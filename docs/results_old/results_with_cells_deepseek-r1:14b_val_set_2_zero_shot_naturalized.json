    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"during the third round of the turkish cup , there be no new entry during that stage\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. Each row in the table corresponds to a different round of some competition, likely the Turkish Cup given the context. The columns include information like round number, clubs remaining, clubs involved, winners from the previous round, new entries this round, and leagues entering at that round.\n\nLooking at Row 3 specifically, which is labeled as the third round:\n- Round: Third\n- Clubs Remaining: 59\n- Clubs Involved: 54\n- Winners from Previous Round: 54\n- New Entries This Round: None\n- Leagues Entering At This Round: None\n\nThe claim states that there were no new entries during the third round. According to the table, under \"new entries this round\" for row 3, it says \"none\". That directly supports the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other information in the same row that might contradict or support this. For example, clubs involved (54) and winners from previous round (54) suggest that all clubs in the third round came from the previous stage without any new additions. Since both numbers are the same, it implies no new entries were added.\n\nI also need to make sure that I'm looking at the correct row for the third round. The rows are numbered 1 through 8, with each representing a different stage of the competition, ending with the final. So Row 3 is indeed the third round.\n\nTherefore, the data clearly supports the claim as true because new entries in the third round are listed as none.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that during the third round, there were no new entries.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"new entries this round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table data. The claim states: \"the highest number of winner from a previous round in the turkish cup be 54 in round 3.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where the 'winners from previous round' are mentioned and their corresponding rounds.\n\nLooking at Row 1 (Round 1), the winners from the previous round are listed as none. Since it's the first round, that makes sense. Then in Round 2 (Row 2), there are 43 winners from the previous round. Moving to Round 3 (Row 3), the winners from the previous round number is 54. That seems significant.\n\nIn Round 4 and beyond, starting from Row 4 onwards, the numbers go down again. For example, in Round 4, there are 27 winners, which is lower than 54. This suggests that Round 3 had the highest number of previous round winners at 54.\n\nI should also check if any other rounds have higher numbers. From the data provided, Rounds 1 through 8 only show 54 as the highest in Round 3. There are no higher numbers elsewhere.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is correct because Round 3 indeed has 54 winners from the previous round, which is the highest number across all rounds.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winners from previous round\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"s\u00fcper lig be the most common league to win a round in the turkish cup.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems like it's about rounds of a competition, maybe the Turkish Cup, and each row corresponds to a different round. The columns include things like round number, clubs remaining, clubs involved, winners from previous rounds, new entries, and leagues entering at that round.\n\nThe question is whether s\u00fcper lig is the most common league to win a round. So I think I need to look at which leagues' teams are winning each round. From the table, I can see that in each row, under \"winners from previous round,\" there's a number indicating how many clubs moved on.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Round 1: 86 winners, and the new entries are 86 from TFF Third League and Turkish Regional Amateur League.\n- Round 2: 43 winners. New entries here are 65 leagues entering, but these include S\u00fcper Lig, TFF First League, and TFF Second League. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking at \"leagues entering,\" in round 2 it's those three leagues. So the new teams come from those leagues.\n\nBut wait, winners from previous rounds: for example, Round 1 has 86 winners, which would be the new entries moving to Round 2. Then Round 2 has 43 winners (from 108 clubs involved). These 43 are moving to Round 3. Now, where do these winners come from? Are they from S\u00fcper Lig or other leagues?\n\nLooking at each round:\n\nRound 1: New entries are 86, which are TFF Third League and Turkish Regional Amateur. So the initial participants in Round 2 include clubs from those two leagues plus any winners from Round 1.\n\nWait no, actually, Round 1 has 86 new entries, so those would be the teams playing in Round 1, right? Then the winners of Round 1 (which is 43) move to Round 2. But where do these 43 come from? Are they all from TFF Third League and Turkish Regional Amateur, or could some be from higher leagues?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently: the claim is about which league's teams win the most rounds. So for each round, if a team wins that round, what league do they belong to? We need to count how many times S\u00fcper Lig teams are winners across all rounds.\n\nLooking at the \"winners from previous round\" column:\n\n- Round 2: 43 winners (from Round 1). But Round 1's new entries were from TFF Third and Turkish Regional. So maybe these 43 are from those two leagues, not S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nWait, but in Round 2, the \"new entries this round\" is 65, which includes S\u00fcper Lig teams. Does that mean that in Round 2, some new teams entered from S\u00fcper Lig? Or do they refer to new entries as teams entering the competition?\n\nWait, perhaps each round has both winners from previous rounds and new entries. So in Round 2, clubs involved are 108: 43 winners from Round 1 (from lower leagues) plus 65 new entries which include higher leagues like S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nSo when a team wins Round 2, it's either one of the 43 or one of the 65. But if it's in the 65, they're from S\u00fcper Lig, etc. So to find out how many times S\u00fcper Lig teams win each round, I need to see how many winners come from that league.\n\nLooking at Round 2: The new entries are 65, which include S\u00fcper Lig, so any of those 65 could potentially be winners. But in the data, we don't have explicit numbers on how many winners came from each league. It only says the leagues entering at this round. So maybe the number isn't directly given.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if any of the rounds indicate that S\u00fcper Lig teams are winning more times than others. Let's look at each round:\n\nRound 1: Winners (86) from new entries in Round 1, which were from TFF Third and Turkish Regional Amateur.\n\nRound 2: Winners (43) could be from either Round 1 winners or the new entries. But since the table doesn't specify where these winners come from, it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in later rounds, only higher league teams remain because they can't have more than one team per league. For example, Round 4 has 32 clubs involved, and new entries are 5 leagues entering: S\u00fcper Lig again. Wait no, actually, Round 4's winners from previous round are 27, which might come from the lower leagues, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look at how many times a league appears in \"leagues entering.\" So for each round, when new entries come in, if it's S\u00fcper Lig, that means their teams could be present and potentially winning.\n\nLooking:\n\n- Round 1: Leagues entering are TFF Third League & Turkish Regional Amateur.\n- Round 2: S\u00fcper Lig, TFF First, TFF Second.\n- Round 3: None\n- Round 4: S\u00fcper Lig\n- Round 5: None\n- Rounds 6-8: None\n\nSo S\u00fcper Lig enters in Round 2 and Round 4. Each time they enter, how many teams do they contribute? For example, in Round 2, it's \"s\u00fcper lig & tff first league & tff second league,\" which are new entries (65). So perhaps multiple teams from S\u00fcper Lig entered here.\n\nBut without knowing how many teams from each league were added, it's hard to say. However, the claim is about being the most common league to win a round. If in any of these rounds, S\u00fcper Lig teams won more often than others, then maybe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Round 4: clubs remaining is 32, clubs involved is 32, winners from previous (Round 3) are 54? Wait no, Round 4's winners from previous round is 27. Then new entries this round are 5, which include S\u00fcper Lig.\n\nWait, perhaps each time a league enters, their teams could be winning more in subsequent rounds.\n\nBut I'm not seeing explicit data on how many times S\u00fcper Lig teams won specific rounds. The table only gives numbers of clubs and leagues entering, but not the breakdown of winners per league.\n\nSo without knowing that, it's impossible to determine whether S\u00fcper Lig is the most common league to win a round because there's no direct information about which league's teams are winning each round. We have data on new entries in terms of leagues, but not on where the winners come from.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given table. There isn't enough data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that S\u00fcper Lig is the most common league to win a round cannot be confirmed or denied based on the provided information. The table includes details about new entries and clubs involved in each round but does not specify which league's teams won each round. Without this specific data, it's impossible to determine if S\u00fcper Lig teams won more rounds than others.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is undetermined due to insufficient data regarding the winners' leagues in each round.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says that the lowest number of new entries concluding a round in the Turkish Cup is 5.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and see where the new entries are listed. Each row represents a different round in the competition, from the first round up to the final. The columns we're interested in are \"round\" and \"new entries this round\".\n\nLooking at Row 1 (first round), there are 86 new entries. That's quite a lot. Then in Row 2 (second round), it's 65 new entries. Still high, but less than the first round.\n\nMoving on to Row 3 (third round), the number of new entries drops to none. Hmm, that's interesting. No new clubs entered at this stage. Then in Row 4 (fourth round), there are 5 new entries. That seems lower than previous rounds, except for the third round which had zero.\n\nRow 5 onwards has no new entries\u2014so from group stages and beyond, it's all about the winners from the previous rounds without any new clubs entering. So the numbers go: 86, 65, 0, 5, then 0 again for the later rounds.\n\nThe claim is about the lowest number of new entries in a round being 5. But looking at the data, there was a round (third round) where no new clubs entered\u2014so zero new entries. That's lower than 5. \n\nWait, so if zero is possible, then the minimum would be zero, not five. Therefore, the claim that the lowest number is 5 isn't correct because in the third round, there were none. So the claim should be false.\n\nI also need to check which row corresponds to each round and highlight the cells where the new entries are 5 and possibly zero. The fourth round had 5 new entries, so I should note that row. Additionally, the third round had zero, but since it's lower than five, maybe that's important too.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the lowest number of new entries in a round was zero, not five.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"new entries this round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"new entries this round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Round 1 of the Turkish Cup begins with 156 competitors and the final round only completes with 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the data provided in the table. The table has eight rows, each representing a different stage of what seems to be a tournament, possibly the Turkish Cup.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It mentions Round 1, clubs remaining is 156, and new entries this round are 86 leagues including the TFF third league and the Turkish regional amateur league. So, it starts with 156 clubs in Round 1. That part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNow, for the final round: The table has Row 8 labeled as \"final.\" In that row, clubs remaining is 2. That matches the second part of the claim, which states that the final round only completes with 2 clubs. So both parts of the claim are supported by the data.\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. Each row seems to represent a different stage, starting from Round 1 up to the Final. The \"clubs remaining\" column shows how many teams proceed to each subsequent round. \n\nIn Row 8 (Final), there are indeed 2 clubs remaining, which is consistent with the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"there be new entry for the 1st 4 round of the turkish cup\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. It has multiple rows representing different rounds, from first to final. Each row lists details like clubs remaining, involved, winners from previous rounds, new entries, and leagues entering at that round.\n\nThe claim is about whether there are new entries in the first four rounds of the Turkish Cup. So I should check each of these rounds (rounds 1 to 4) for any new entries.\n\nLooking at row 1 (first round), under \"new entries this round,\" it says 86. That's a lot, so definitely there were new entries here.\n\nRow 2 is the second round. The \"new entries\" column shows 65. Again, more than zero, meaning new teams joined this round.\n\nMoving to row 3, which is the third round. Here, \"new entries this round\" is listed as none. So no new teams entered in the third round.\n\nRow 4 is the fourth round. The \"new entries\" column again says none. No new entries here either.\n\nSo for rounds 1 and 2, there were new entries, but not in rounds 3 and 4. Since the claim mentions the first four rounds, which include rounds where new entries did occur (rounds 1 and 2), the overall answer would be TRUE because there were indeed new entries in some of those rounds.\n\nWait, the claim says \"there be new entry for the 1st 4 round,\" implying that each of these rounds had new entries. But actually, only the first two did. However, the wording is a bit unclear. If it's asking if any of the first four rounds had new entries, then yes, because rounds 1 and 2 did. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nNow, to highlight the cells that support this. In round 1, \"new entries\" is 86, so I should point out row 0 (since rows start at 0) and column \"new_entries_this_round\". Similarly, in round 2, row 1, same column has 65. Therefore, these two cells are highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"new entries this round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"new entries this round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the highest number of winner from a previous round in the urkish cup be 59 in round 3\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each column represents. Looking at Row 1, the columns are:\n\n- Round\n- Clubs Remaining\n- Clubs Involved\n- Winners from Previous Round\n- New Entries This Round\n- Leagues Entering at this Round\n\nThe claim is about \"winners from a previous round\". So I'm looking at the \"Winners from Previous Round\" column across all rounds.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: First Round. Winners from previous round are none because it's the first.\nRow 2: Second Round. Winners from previous round is 43.\nRow 3: Third Round. Winners here are 54.\nRow 4: Fourth Round. It's 27.\nRow 5 to 8 (fifth, group stage, semi-finals, final) all have winners as the same number as clubs involved, which suggests that in these rounds, every club progresses, so they're all winners from previous round.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking at Row 3: \"Winners from Previous Round\" is 54. Let me check each row:\n\n- Round 1: None (since it's the first round)\n- Round 2: 43\n- Round 3: 54\n- Round 4: 27\n- Round 5: 16\n- Group stage: 8\n- Semi-finals: 4\n- Final: 2\n\nSo the winners from previous rounds are as above. The highest number in this column is 54, which occurs in Round 3.\n\nThe claim says that \"the highest number of winner from a previous round in the Turkish cup be 59 in round 3\". Wait, but according to the data, Round 3 has 54 winners. So the claim states 59, but the actual value is 54.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that the highest number was 59 when in reality it's 54 in Round 3. Alternatively, maybe I misread something? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at Row 3: \"round is third round clubs remaining is 59 clubs involved is 54 winners from previous round is 54 new entries this round is none leagues entering at this round is none.\"\n\nSo the number of winners from the previous round in Round 3 is indeed 54, not 59. Therefore, the claim's stated value (59) doesn't match the data.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding about what \"highest\" means. The highest number of winners from a previous round could be looking for the maximum across all rounds. Let me check all the \"winners from previous round\" values:\n\nRound 1: 0\nRound 2:43\nRound3:54\nRound4:27\nRound5:16\nGroup Stage:8\nSemi-finals:4\nFinal:2\n\nSo indeed, the highest is 54 in Round 3. So if someone claims that the highest was 59, they're wrong because it's actually 54.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest number of winners from a previous round is 59 in round 3.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that the TFF Third League is the most common league to win a round in the Turkish Cup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. Each row corresponds to a different round of the tournament, from the first round up to the final. For each round, there are several columns: round number, clubs remaining, clubs involved, winners from previous rounds, new entries this round, and leagues entering at that round.\n\nI think I need to check which leagues have been winning these rounds. Specifically, for each round where a league's team wins, we should note the league. The claim suggests that TFF Third League has the most wins across all rounds.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (First Round):** Leagues entering are TFF Third League and Turkish Regional Amateur League. But since it's the first round, winners from previous rounds would be none because there was no prior round. The new entries this round are 86 clubs, but I'm not sure if the winner is necessarily from these leagues.\n\n- **Row 2 (Second Round):** Leagues entering include S\u00fcper Lig and TFF First and Second Leagues. Winners from previous rounds (first round) are 43, so they would come from either the first or second leagues mentioned earlier. The new entries this round are 65 clubs.\n\n- **Row 3 (Third Round):** No new entries; all 54 involved are winners from the second round. So if any TFF Third League team made it here, they might win.\n\nBut wait, looking at each row's \"winners from previous rounds,\" that indicates how many teams moved on to this round. The \"new entries\" are the number of new clubs entering in this round. So when a league enters, it's adding more teams into the competition for that round.\n\nI think I need to track which leagues' teams won each round. For example, if in Round 2, some teams from S\u00fcper Lig or TFF Second League won and advanced. But does the data tell us which specific league a winner came from? It doesn't directly specify; it just mentions which leagues are entering at each round.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the key is to see how many times each league's teams win in their respective rounds. Since only the third league and Turkish Regional are in Round 1, but they might not have advanced much. In Round 2, more prominent leagues like S\u00fcper Lig enter, which could mean their teams might be more likely to win.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- **Round 4 (Row 4):** Leagues entering are only S\u00fcper Lig. The previous winners were 27, so perhaps from lower leagues. But since it's Round 4, maybe TFF Third League teams have advanced this far and could be winning here.\n\nWait, but in the data, each round's \"leagues entering\" is separate, not indicating which league's team won. So without knowing the actual winners' leagues, it's hard to track exactly how many times each league has a winner.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of new entries per round relates to the likelihood of that league producing a winner. The more teams from a particular league enter, the higher chance they might have in winning that round.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Round 1: TFF Third League (86 clubs)\n- Round 2: S\u00fcper Lig (among others), but only 65 new entries\n- Rounds after that don't have new entries, so any winners would come from previous rounds.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the number of new entries directly translates to the number of wins for each league. The claim says TFF Third League is the most common, which suggests they have more wins than other leagues across all rounds.\n\nWait, but looking at Round 4: leagues entering are only S\u00fcper Lig with 5 new entries. Since in earlier rounds, TFF Third League had many clubs (86), maybe some of them made it to later rounds and won there.\n\nBut without explicit data on which league each winner comes from, I can't definitively say if TFF Third is the most common. The table only mentions leagues entering, not winners' origins.\n\nSo perhaps the claim isn't supported by the given data because we don't have information about which league's teams actually won each round. Therefore, the answer might be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the TFF Third League is the most common to win a round in the Turkish Cup cannot be confirmed as there's no direct data on winners' leagues.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

So, I'm looking for the minimum value in the \"new entries this round\" column across all rounds.\n\nLooking at the table data:\n\n- **Row 1 (First Round)**: New entries = 86\n- **Row 2 (Second Round)**: New entries = 65\n- **Row 3 (Third Round)**: New entries = None\n- **Row 4 (Fourth Round)**: New entries = 5\n- **Row 5 (Fifth Round)**: New entries = None\n- **Row 6 (Group Stage)**: New entries = None\n- **Row 7 (Semi-Finals)**: New entries = None\n- **Row 8 (Final)**: New entries = None\n\nFrom this, the new entries decrease as we move to later rounds. The lowest number of new entries that isn't zero or none is in Row 4 with a value of 5. Rows 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have no new entries (None), which might be considered lower than any positive number, but the claim specifies \"2\" as the lowest, not None.\n\nHowever, since the claim mentions 2, I should check if there's a round with exactly 2 new entries. From the data provided, none of the rounds have exactly 2; the closest is Row 4 with 5. Therefore, the claim that 2 is the lowest number isn't supported by the table.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed anything. The \"new entries this round\" column only has numerical values in Rows 1, 2, and 4. All other rounds have no new entries. So the numbers are 86, 65, and 5. None of these is 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there's no round where exactly 2 new clubs entered. The lowest number is actually 5 in the fourth round.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 2 is the smallest number of new entries in any round, but according to the table, the minimum is 5 in the fourth round.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"new entries this round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"from round 1 to the final round, there be 4 club remain to complete the round.\" Hmm, I need to see how many clubs are remaining as they progress through each round until the final.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- **Round 1**: Clubs Remaining is 156.\n- **Round 2**: Clubs Remaining drops to 113.\n- **Round 3**: It goes down to 59.\n- **Round 4**: Now there are 32 clubs left.\n- **Round 5**: This reduces to 16.\n- **Group Stage (Round 6)**: Still 8 clubs.\n- **Semi-Finals (Round 7)**: Clubs Remaining is 4.\n- **Final (Round 8)**: Only 2 clubs remain.\n\nThe claim mentions that by the final round, there are 4 clubs remaining. But according to the data, in the Final round (Row 8), only 2 clubs are left. So the claim isn't accurate because it says 4, but the table shows 2.\n\nI think I need to check each step again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim clearly.\n\nThe claim says: \"4 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority be fraternity while 3 be a sorority.\" Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It seems to be stating that out of some fraternities and sororities, 4 are fraternities and 3 are sororities.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing an organization. Each row has details like letters, organization name, nickname, founding date, university, and type (fraternity or sorority).\n\nSo first, I'll count how many fraternities and how many sororities there are in total based on the 'type' column.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Type is fraternity.\nRow 2: Type is sorority.\nRow 3: Type is sorority.\nRow 4: Type is fraternity.\nRow 5: Type is sorority.\nRow 6: Type is fraternity.\nRow 7: Type is fraternity.\n\nSo counting them up:\n\nFraternities: Rows 1,4,6,7 \u2192 that's 4 fraternities.\nSororities: Rows 2,3,5 \u2192 that's 3 sororities.\n\nWait a second, according to the table, there are indeed 4 fraternities and 3 sororities. So the claim is saying exactly that, which matches our count.\n\nNow, I need to highlight the relevant cells in the table. Since the type determines whether it's a fraternity or sorority, the 'type' column is the key here. Each row where the type is fraternity or sorority should be highlighted to show why the claim is true.\n\nSo for each row (0 to 6), if the type is fraternity, we'll note that; same for sorority. But since the claim is about counts, highlighting all 'type' cells would make it clear which are fraternities and which are sororities, thus showing why the total counts add up.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON output, I'll set \"answer\" to \"TRUE\", and then list each row with its type column as highlighted. That way, anyone reviewing can see exactly where the information comes from.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"alpha epsilon phi 2 be a sorority that be found before sigma alpha epsilon pi 3.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table data row by row. There are seven rows with organizations and their details. I'm focusing on two specific entries mentioned in the claim: \"alpha epsilon phi 2\" and \"sigma alpha epsilon pi 3.\"\n\nLooking at Row 2, it says:\n- Letters: \u03b1\u03b5\u03c6\n- Organization: alpha epsilon phi 2\n- Nickname: aephi\n- Founding date: 1909 - 10 - 24\n- Founding university: barnard college\n- Type: sorority\n\nSo, \"alpha epsilon phi 2\" is indeed a sorority with a founding date of October 24, 1909.\n\nNow, looking for \"sigma alpha epsilon pi 3.\" That's in Row 3:\n- Letters: \u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0\n- Organization: sigma alpha epsilon pi 3\n- Nickname: sigma\n- Founding date: 1998 - 10 - 01\n- Founding university: university of california, davis\n- Type: sorority\n\nThe founding date here is October 1, 1998.\n\nSo the claim is that \"alpha epsilon phi 2\" (founded in 1909) was established before \"sigma alpha epsilon pi 3\" (founded in 1998). Since 1909 comes way before 1998, this part of the claim is correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other entries for these organizations. Let me scan through all rows again to make sure I didn't miss anything. No, Row 2 and Row 3 are the only ones with those exact names. \n\nAnother thing: The claim mentions \"alpha epsilon phi 2\" as a sorority. From Row 2, it's confirmed as a sorority. So both parts of the claim align with the data.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true because alpha epsilon phi 2 was founded in 1909 and sigma alpha epsilon pi 3 in 1998, so the former was established earlier.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"alpha epsilon phi 2\" is a sorority founded before \"sigma alpha epsilon pi 3.\" Checking Row 2 confirms it's a sorority with a founding date of October 24, 1909. Row 3 shows \"sigma alpha epsilon pi 3\" was founded on October 1, 1998. Since 1909 is earlier than 1998, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"zeta beta tau 1 stand as the oldest founding cultural interest fraternity.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find information about Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT). From the data, I see that Row 7 corresponds to Zeta Beta Tau with letters \u03b6\u03b2\u03c4. The details here are: nickname is zbt, founding date is 1898-12-29, founding university is city college of new york, and type is fraternity.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is the oldest fraternity in the table. Let's go through all the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Alpha Epsilon Pi (founded 1913)\n- Row 2: Alpha Epsilon Phi (founded 1909), it's a sorority.\n- Row 3: Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (1998), also a sorority.\n- Row 4: Sigma Alpha Mu (1909), a fraternity. \n- Row 5: Sigma Delta Tau (1917), a sorority.\n- Row 6: Tau Epsilon Phi (1910), a fraternity.\n- Row 7: Zeta Beta Tau (1898), a fraternity.\n\nComparing the founding dates, ZBT was founded in 1898, which is earlier than Sigma Alpha Mu and others. So it's one of the oldest fraternities listed. \n\nNow, does the claim specify that ZBT is the oldest \"cultural interest\" fraternity? The table doesn't explicitly mention any cultural interests for each organization. It only categorizes them as fraternities or sororities but not by specific interests like cultural ones. Therefore, I can't confirm if ZBT is specifically a cultural interest fraternity based on the given data.\n\nSo while ZBT is the oldest fraternity in terms of founding date, without information about it being a cultural interest group, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"zeta beta tau 1\" as the oldest cultural interest fraternity. From the table, ZBT's founding date is 1898, making it older than other fraternities listed (e.g., Sigma Alpha Mu at 1909). However, the table doesn't specify that ZBT is a cultural interest fraternity; it only identifies it as a fraternity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founding_date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"6 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority be found before the year 1920\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that six (6) fraternities and sororities listed in the table were founded before the year 1920. So, my goal is to count how many of these organizations have founding dates prior to 1920.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are seven rows, each representing a different organization with details like letters, organization name, nickname, founding date, university, and type (fraternity or sorority). I'll go through each row one by one and check the founding year against 1920.\n\nRow 1: Alpha Epsilon Pi (\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0) was founded on November 7, 1913. Since 1913 is before 1920, this counts.\nRow 2: Alpha Epsilon Phi (\u03b1\u03b5\u03c6) was founded on October 24, 1909. Again, before 1920, so it counts too.\nRow 3: Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0) was established on October 1, 1998. That's well after 1920, so this doesn't count.\nRow 4: Sigma Alpha Mu (\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc) was founded on November 26, 1909. Before 1920, so it counts.\nRow 5: Sigma Delta Tau (\u03c3\u03b4\u03c4) was started on March 25, 1917. That's before 1920, so this counts as well.\nRow 6: Tau Epsilon Phi (\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6) was founded on October 10, 1910. Before 1920, it's included.\nRow 7: Zeta Beta Tau (\u03b6\u03b2\u03c4) was established on December 29, 1898. That's definitely before 1920, so this counts too.\n\nNow, let's count the ones founded before 1920:\n- Row 1: Yes\n- Row 2: Yes\n- Row 4: Yes\n- Row 5: Yes\n- Row 6: Yes\n- Row 7: Yes\n\nThat makes six organizations. However, looking back at Row 3, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded in 1998, which is after 1920, so it doesn't count.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"6 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority be found before the year 1920.\" But according to my count, there are six fraternities/sororities founded before 1920 (Rows 1,2,4,5,6,7). However, Row 3 is a sorority but after 1920. So that's six out of seven.\n\nWait again, let me recount to make sure I didn't miscount:\n\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 3: No (founded in 1998)\nRow 4: Yes\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 6: Yes\nRow 7: Yes\n\nSo that's six yeses. Therefore, the claim is correct because exactly six of them were founded before 1920.\n\nWait, but I thought the claim was about \"cultural interest\" fraternities and sororities. The table doesn't specify cultural aspects beyond their names, but since all are Greek-letter organizations, perhaps they are considered cultural in that context.\n\nSo yes, the claim is TRUE because six out of seven were founded before 1920.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that City College of New York has been a founding university for two cultural interest fraternities and sororities.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each row in the table represents. Each row contains information about different organizations, including their letters, organization name, nickname, founding date, founding university, and type (fraternity or sorority).\n\nI need to check how many times City College of New York appears as a founding university for either fraternities or sororities.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Founding university is New York University, type fraternity. Not City College.\n\nRow 2: Barnard College, type sorority. No.\n\nRow 3: University of California, Davis, type sorority. No.\n\nRow 4: Founding university is City College of New York, type fraternity. That's one.\n\nRow 5: Cornell University, type sorority. No.\n\nRow 6: Columbia University, type fraternity. No.\n\nRow 7: City College of New York again, type fraternity. That's two fraternities from City College.\n\nSo City College is listed twice as the founding university for fraternities (rows 4 and 7). There are no sororities founded by City College in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions both fraternities and sororities. Since there are two fraternities but no sororities, does that count? The wording says \"for 2 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority.\" It's a bit ambiguous whether it's asking for two separate organizations (one fraternity and one sorority) or just any two organizations regardless of type.\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"the city college of new york have be a founding university for 2 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority.\" The way it's phrased, I think it means that City College is the founding university for two such groups in total, whether they are fraternities or sororities. So having two fraternities would satisfy this part because it's about the number, not the specific types.\n\nTherefore, since there are two entries where City College of New York is the founding university (both fraternities), the claim is true.\n\nNow, I need to highlight the cells that support this conclusion.

Let me read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"5 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority be 2 sorority while 3 be a fraternity.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusingly worded, but I think it means that out of five organizations (fraternities and sororities), two are sororities and three are fraternities.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an organization with its type listed as either \"fraternity\" or \"sorority.\" There are seven rows in total. Let me count how many are fraternities and how many are sororities.\n\nRow 1: Fraternity\nRow 2: Sorority\nRow 3: Sorority\nRow 4: Fraternity\nRow 5: Sorority\nRow 6: Fraternity\nRow 7: Fraternity\n\nWait, so that's four fraternities and three sororities. But the claim mentions five organizations in total, with two being sororities and three fraternities. However, in reality, there are seven organizations here, but I think maybe the user is referring to only a subset of them.\n\nWait no, perhaps I misread. Let me check again: The table has seven rows, each representing an organization. The claim talks about five cultural interest fraternities and sororities. But looking at the table, all of them are either fraternities or sororities, so maybe it's considering only some subset.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a specific group of five organizations from the seven provided, but the claim says \"5 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority be 2 sorority while 3 be a fraternity.\" Maybe they're saying that among five organizations (from this list), two are sororities and three are fraternities.\n\nWait, but looking at all seven entries:\n\nFraternity count: Rows 1,4,6,7 \u2192 that's four fraternities.\nSorority count: Rows 2,3,5 \u2192 that's three sororities.\n\nSo total of four fraternities and three sororities. So if we take any five organizations from the seven, depending on which ones are chosen, it could vary.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is about all seven entries? Because the table has seven entries, but the claim refers to five. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no: The claim says \"5 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority.\" So maybe it's considering that there are five organizations in total (perhaps a subset), with two being sororities and three fraternities. But looking at the table, from rows 1 to 7, which is seven entries, but perhaps the user is taking only five of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are four fraternities and three sororities in total across all seven organizations, not two and three as claimed for a subset. But without more context, it's unclear whether the claim refers to all seven or a specific subset.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: The table has 7 rows. The claim says \"5 of the cultural interest fraternity and sorority be 2 sorority while 3 be a fraternity.\" So perhaps it's saying that among five organizations (from the seven), two are sororities and three fraternities.\n\nBut when I count all seven, there are four fraternities and three sororities. If we're considering only five of them, depending on which ones we pick, it could vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because in reality, across all seven organizations, there are more than two sororities and more than three fraternities. Therefore, if someone says that 5 are split as two soros and three frats, but actually, all seven have four frats and three soros, then the claim would be false.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the data again:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Fraternity\n2. Sorority\n3. Sorority\n4. Fraternity\n5. Sorority\n6. Fraternity\n7. Fraternity\n\nSo that's four fraternities and three sororities.\n\nIf someone claims that among five of these, two are sororities and three fraternities, is that true?\n\nWell, if we pick rows 1,4,6,7 (frats) and one sorority (say row2), then in those five, there would be one sorority and four fraternities. But the claim says two soros.\n\nAlternatively, if someone picks three frats and two sororities from the seven, then yes, they could say that. So perhaps the claim is correct if it's considering a specific subset of five organizations where exactly two are sororities and three are fraternities.\n\nBut without knowing which five they're referring to, I can't be certain. However, based on all seven entries, there are more than two sororities (three) and more than three fraternities (four). So if the claim is about all seven, then it's incorrect because it's not 5 organizations but 7.\n\nWait, no, the table has seven rows, so perhaps the user made a mistake in their claim. Or maybe they're talking about five of them, and among those five, two are soros and three frats.\n\nBut without knowing which five, I can't confirm. Alternatively, if we consider all seven, then it's four fraternities and three sororities, so the claim is false because it states 5 total (which would be incorrect as there are seven) or perhaps miscounted.\n\nWait, maybe the user intended to say that among five organizations in general, two are soros and three are frats. But according to the data, when considering all seven, four are frats and three sororities. So if you take any subset of five from these seven, it's possible but not necessarily accurate without knowing which ones.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is incorrect because in the entire list of seven, there are more than two sororities (three) and more than three fraternities (four). Therefore, the claim that 5 organizations consist of two soros and three frats is false when considering all of them. However, if it's referring to a subset of five, then maybe.\n\nBut given that the table includes seven entries, and the claim refers to \"5,\" perhaps the user intended to refer to those five, but the data shows more than that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the correct approach is to count all seven and see if among them, two are soros and three frats, which they are not.\n\nWait no, in total, there are four frats and three soros across all seven entries. So if someone says that 5 of these (meaning five specific ones) have two soros and three frats, then perhaps it's possible. For example, selecting rows 1,4,6,7 (frats) and one sorority like row2, you'd have four frats and one soro in five entries, which doesn't match the claim.\n\nAlternatively, selecting rows 1,2,3,4,5: that's three frats and two soros. So yes, among those five, it would be two sororities and three fraternities. Therefore, the claim is true if they are referring to those five entries.\n\nBut without knowing which five, I can't be certain. However, since the table has seven entries, and the claim refers to five of them, perhaps it's correct for a specific subset but not necessarily accurate overall.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is that the user intended to say all seven have two sororities and three frats, which is false because there are four frats and three soros. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to five organizations in general (not from this table), but without context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that I need to make a determination based on the data provided, which has seven entries with four frats and three sororities, if someone claims that among five of these, two are soros and three frats, then depending on the subset, it could be true. However, without knowing the specific five, I can't confirm.\n\nBut perhaps the intended approach is to consider all seven and see if the claim holds for them. Since in total there are more than two sororities and more than three fraternities, the claim that among five, it's two and three might not hold when considering the entire set.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: The table has seven entries, of which four are fraternities (rows 1,4,6,7) and three are sororities (2,3,5). If someone says that five of these have two soros and three frats, then depending on how they select the five, it could be accurate.\n\nFor example, if you choose rows 1,2,3,4,5: that's three frats and two sororities. So yes, in those five, it matches the claim. Alternatively, choosing a different subset might not.\n\nBut perhaps the user is referring to all seven entries, in which case the claim is incorrect because there are more than two soros and more than three frats.\n\nTherefore, without additional context, I think the claim is incorrect when considering all seven entries, but could be correct for a specific subset of five. However, since the table includes all seven, perhaps the intended answer is that the claim is false.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the user made an error in their count and thinks there are five organizations total, but in reality, there are seven.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, I'll proceed under the assumption that the claim refers to all seven entries, which would make it incorrect because there are four frats and three soros, not two and three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect when considering all seven organizations listed in the table. While the table includes four fraternities and three sororities, the claim suggests that among five organizations, two would be sororities and three fraternities. Without specific context about which subset of five the claim refers to, it's not possible to verify the accuracy universally across all seven entries. However, based on the data provided, the overall distribution does not align with the claim if it pertains to all seven organizations.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect as there are four fraternities and three sororities among the seven organizations listed in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table data.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"alpha epsilon phi 2 be a fraternity that be found before sigma alpha epsilon pi 3.\" So, it's claiming two things:\n1. Alpha Epsilon Phi (AEP) is a fraternity.\n2. AEP was founded before Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (SAEPI).\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row to find these organizations.\n\nRow 2: Organization is Alpha Epsilon Phi (\u03b1\u03b5\u03c6). The type is listed as \"sorority.\" Wait, that's important because the claim refers to it as a fraternity. Sororities are for women, while fraternities are for men. So if AEP is a sorority, then the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNext, I'll look at Row 3: Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0) with founding date 1998-10-01. The type here is \"sorority\" as well. \n\nNow, focusing on the dates:\n- AEP was founded on 1909-10-24.\n- SAEPI was founded much later, in 1998.\n\nSo, even though AEP was founded before SAEPI, since AEP is a sorority and not a fraternity, the claim is incorrect. The claim mistakenly refers to AEP as a fraternity when it's actually a sorority.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founding date\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim is: \"zeta bata tau 1 stand as the newest founding cultural interest fraternity.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check each part against the data.\n\n1. **Name Check**: The claim mentions \"zeta bata tau 1.\" Looking at the table, row 7 has \"\u03b6\u03b2\u03c4\" under letters and the organization is \"zeta beta tau 1.\" So that matches correctly.\n\n2. **Fraternity Check**: The claim refers to it as a fraternity. In the table, row 7's type is listed as \"fraternity,\" so that part checks out.\n\n3. **Newest Check**: The claim says it's the newest. I need to find out which organization was founded most recently. Looking at all rows:\n   - Row1: 1913\n   - Row2: 1909\n   - Row3: 1998\n   - Row4: 1909\n   - Row5: 1917\n   - Row6: 1910\n   - Row7: 1898\n\n   The most recent founding date is row3, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0), founded in 1998. Zeta Beta Tau 1 was founded in 1898, which is the earliest, not the newest.\n\n4. **Cultural Interest Check**: The table doesn't explicitly mention \"cultural interest\" for any fraternity or sorority. It only lists type as fraternity or sorority. So without data on cultural interest, the claim can't be supported by the table.\n\nSo, the claim incorrectly states that Zeta Beta Tau 1 is the newest and a cultural interest fraternity when, according to the table, it's actually the oldest and there's no mention of cultural interest.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly identifies Zeta Beta Tau 1 as the newest and a cultural interest fraternity.

The claim says that seven cultural interest fraternities and sororities were found before the year 1921.\n\nFirst, let me look at the data provided in the table. There are seven rows, each representing a different organization with their details like letters, organization name, nickname, founding date, university, and type (fraternity or sorority). \n\nI should check each row to see if the founding date is before 1921. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: \u03b1\u03b5\u03c0, founded on 1913-11-07. That's definitely before 1921.\nRow 2: \u03b1\u03b5\u03c6, founded on 1909-10-24. Also before 1921.\nRow 3: \u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0, founded on 1998-10-01. Wait, that's way after 1921. So this one doesn't count.\nRow 4: \u03c3\u03b1\u03bc, founded on 1909-11-26.

The third row (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b5\u03c0) was founded in 1998, which is after 1921, so it doesn't count.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are seven such organizations isn't supported by the data.
