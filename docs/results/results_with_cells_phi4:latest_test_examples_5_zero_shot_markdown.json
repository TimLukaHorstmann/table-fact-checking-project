Identify the row with the title \"the witchfinder\":\n   - From the table, \"the witchfinder\" is listed under the title column at row index 7.\n   - The corresponding \"no overall\" value for this episode is 20.\n\n2. Identify the row with the title \"sweet dreams\":\n   - From the table, \"sweet dreams\" is listed under the title column at row index 10.\n   - The corresponding \"no overall\" value for this episode is 23.\n\n3. Compare the \"no overall\" values:\n   - \"the witchfinder\" has an overall number of 20.\n   - \"sweet dreams\" has an overall number of 23.\n\nSince 23 (for \"sweet dreams\") is greater than 20 (for \"the witchfinder\"), \"sweet dreams\" indeed happens later in the series than \"the witchfinder\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells from the table are those containing the episode numbers and titles for both episodes:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"no overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

In the `score` column, Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team score should be greater than 1 (since it mentions \"more than 1 goal\").\n\nLet's inspect each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Date: 13 February 2000\n  - Score: 1 - 0\n  - Result: 4 - 0\n  - Competition: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup\n\n  Here, Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team scored 4 goals in the match. Since the score is \"1 - 0\", it indicates that he could have contributed to more than one goal. This matches our condition of scoring more than one goal.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Date: 3 September 2000\n  - Score: 5 - 1\n  - Result: 7 - 1\n  - Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualifier\n\n  Here, the score is \"5 - 1\". Again, since Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team scored a total of 5 goals in this match, it indicates that he could have contributed to more than one goal. This also matches our condition.\n\nBoth rows (2 and 3) satisfy the conditions specified in the claim for the year 2000.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe table shows that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did score more than one goal in two different international competitions during the year 2000, which supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but remaining scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\nThe claim has two main assertions:\n1. Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal in the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n2. Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score any goals during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLet's break down the analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Check for 2006 FIFA World Cup\n- The table row corresponding to the 2006 FIFA World Cup is:\n  - Row Index: 7\n  - Date: 24 June 2006\n  - Score (match result): 1 - 0 in favor of Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team.\n  - Result: 1 - 2 (aet) against his team, indicating a loss after extra time.\n  \nSince the \"score\" is 1 - 0 and Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team won that half/period, it indicates he scored during this match. Therefore, the first part of the claim is supported.\n\n### Step 2: Check for 2010 FIFA World Cup\n- The table row corresponding to the 2010 FIFA World Cup is:\n  - Row Index: 10\n  - Date: 11 June 2010\n  - Score (match result): 1 - 1, indicating a draw.\n  \nSince the \"score\" and \"result\" are both 1 - 1, it implies that Rafael M\u00e1rquez's team scored one goal, but there is no indication that he was the scorer. However, since we only need to verify if he remained scoreless (i.e., did not score any goals), this part of the claim holds true based on the information provided.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe table supports both parts of the claim:\n1. Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n2. He did not score during the 2010 FIFA World Cup (as per the available data).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells from the table are:\n\n- Row Index 7 for the 2006 FIFA World Cup result indicating he scored.\n- Row Index 10 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup result showing no individual goal attribution to Rafael M\u00e1rquez.\n\nThe JSON object representing this analysis is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal,\" we need to check two main conditions:\n\n1. Identify rows where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored (column: `goal`).\n2. Determine if those scores were part of an international competition and whether Mexico lost in those matches.\n\nLet's analyze the table:\n\n- **Goals by Rafael M\u00e1rquez**: The `goal` column directly indicates when he scored.\n- **International Competitions**: These are listed under the `competition` column, which includes events like World Cup qualifiers, Gold Cups, and the FIFA World Cup itself. Friendly matches are not considered international competitions for this claim.\n\nNow, let's examine each relevant row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: \n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 1999 Carlsberg Cup (International)\n   - Result: 3 - 0 (Win)\n\n2. **Row 2**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup (International)\n   - Result: 4 - 0 (Win)\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2002 World Cup Qualifier (International)\n   - Result: 7 - 1 (Win)\n\n4. **Row 5**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup (International)\n   - Result: 2 - 0 (Win)\n\n5. **Row 6**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier (International)\n   - Result: 3 - 0 (Win)\n\n6. **Row 7**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier (International)\n   - Result: 5 - 0 (Win)\n\n7. **Row 8**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2006 FIFA World Cup (International)\n   - Result: 1 - 2 (aet) (Loss)\n\n8. **Row 10**:\n   - Goal: Yes\n   - Competition: 2010 World Cup Qualifier (International)\n   - Result: 2 - 1 (Win)\n\n9. **Row 11**:\n   - Goal: No\n\n10. **Row 12**:\n    - Goal: Yes\n    - Competition: 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup (International)\n    - Result: 4 - 1 (Win)\n\n11. **Row 13**:\n    - Goal: Yes\n    - Competition: Friendly (Not International)\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in international competitions on Rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12.\n- Mexico lost only once in these matches, which was Row 8.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data: Mexico lost 1 time out of 2 when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in an international competition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Here's how each relevant year is represented:\n\n- **Year 2001**: \n  - The entries for the years 2000 to 2002 are:\n    - Row 2: Date = \"13 february 2000\", Competition = \"2000 concacaf gold cup\"\n    - Row 3: Date = \"3 september 2000\", Competition = \"2002 world cup qualifier\"\n    - Row 4: Date = \"12 may 2002\", Competition = \"friendly\"\n  - There is no entry for the year 2001.\n\n- **Year 2009**:\n  - The entries around this year are:\n    - Row 9: Date = \"28 march 2007\", Competition = \"friendly\"\n    - Row 10: Date = \"10 september 2008\", Competition = \"2010 world cup qualifier\"\n  - There is no entry for the year 2009.\n\n- **Year 2012**:\n  - The entries around this year are:\n    - Row 12: Date = \"11 june 2010\", Competition = \"2010 fifa world cup\"\n    - Row 13: Date = \"12 june 2011\", Competition = \"2011 concacaf gold cup\"\n  - There is no entry for the year 2012.\n\nSince there are no entries for Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring in international competitions during 2001, 2009, or 2012 according to this table, he indeed did not score in these years.
