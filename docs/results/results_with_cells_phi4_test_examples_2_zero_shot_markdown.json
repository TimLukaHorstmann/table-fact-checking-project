The claim states: \"Chris Wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team.\"\n\nLet's examine the \"drop\" column in the table:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 0\n- paul emerick: 0\n- todd clever: 0\n- philip eloff: 0\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 0\n- chris wyles: 1\n- david fee: 0\n- mike hercus: 4\n- riaan van zyl: 0\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that:\n\n- Chris Wyles has 1 drop goal.\n- Mike Hercus has 4 drop goals.\n\nSince both Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus have recorded drop goals, the claim that \"Chris Wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team\" is false. \n\nThe relevant cells for this determination are:\n\n- The cell containing Chris Wyles' drop goal count.\n- The cell containing Mike Hercus' drop goal count.\n\nThese correspond to row indices 5 and 7, respectively, in the \"drop\" column.\n\nHere's the JSON object representing our conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "riann van zyl have the longest time span on the united state national rugby union team and tie with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim regarding Riaan van Zyl's performance and tenure on the United States national rugby union team, we need to examine two specific aspects from the table: the span of years played for each player and the number of tries scored.\n\n### Step 1: Checking the Longest Time Span\n\nThe claim states that Riaan van Zyl has the longest time span on the team. We will analyze the \"span\" column in the table:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 1992 - 2000 (8 years)\n- paul emerick: 2003 - 2012 (9 years)\n- todd clever: 2003 -      (ongoing, span not fully specified)\n- philip eloff: 2000 - 2007 (7 years)\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 2007 -      (ongoing, span not fully specified)\n- chris wyles: 2007 -      (ongoing, span not fully specified)\n- david fee: 2002 - 2005 (3 years)\n- mike hercus: 2002 - 2009 (7 years)\n- riaan van zyl: 2003 - 2004 (1 year)\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that Riaan van Zyl does not have the longest time span on the team. Players like Todd Clever and Takudzwa Ngwenya are still active with ongoing spans.\n\n### Step 2: Checking for Ties in Number of Tries\n\nThe claim also states that Riaan van Zyl ties with only one other player for the greatest number of tries. We will check the \"tries\" column:\n\n- vaea anitoni: 26 tries\n- paul emerick: 17 tries\n- todd clever: 11 tries\n- philip eloff: 10 tries\n- takudzwa ngwenya: 10 tries\n- chris wyles: 10 tries\n- david fee: 9 tries\n- mike hercus: 9 tries\n- riaan van zyl: 9 tries\n\nRiaan van Zyl has 9 tries, which ties with David Fee and Mike Hercus. Thus, he ties with two players, not just one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because:\n1. Riaan van Zyl does not have the longest time span on the team.\n2. He ties for the number of tries with more than one player (two players).\n\nThus, we can construct our JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
