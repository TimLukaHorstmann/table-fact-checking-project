    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the claim about Tony Lama being in the top 5 for three major tournaments is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like each row corresponds to a different tournament, with columns indicating various performance metrics such as wins, top finishes, events played, cuts made, etc. The rows are labeled as \"masters,\" \"us open,\" \"the open championship,\" and \"pga championship.\" There's also a totals row at the end.\n\nThe claim is that Tony Lama was in the top 5 for the master tournament, US Open, and The Open Championship. So I need to check if his performance meets this criterion across these three tournaments.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. **Master Tournament (Row 0):** The \"top -5\" column shows a value of 1. This means Tony was in the top 5 once for the Master's.\n2. **US Open (Row 1):** The \"top -5\" is 2, indicating he was in the top 5 twice here.\n3. **The Open Championship (Row 2):** Here, the \"top -5\" column has a 2 as well, so he was in the top 5 two times.\n\nSince all three tournaments have non-zero values in the top 5 column for Tony Lama, it seems to support the claim. I don't see any conflicting data that would make this false. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells to highlight. These would be the \"top -5\" columns for each of the three tournaments mentioned. That corresponds to rows 0, 1, and 2 under the column \"top -5.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON response will indicate that the claim is TRUE and highlight those specific cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top -5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"top -5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top -5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a table with tournament information and a claim about which tournaments Tony Lema participated in. My task is to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are five rows, each representing different tournaments. Each row has several columns: \"tournament,\" \"wins,\" \"top - 5,\" \"top -10,\" etc., along with other stats like events and cuts made.\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lema participated in four specific tournaments: the Master Tournament, US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open Championship. So, I need to check if each of these tournaments is listed in the table under the \"tournament\" column.\n\nLooking at row 1, it's labeled as the \"masters tournament.\" That matches one part of the claim. Row 2 refers to the \"us open,\" which is another tournament mentioned in the claim. Then, row 4 is the \"pga championship,\" and row 3 is \"the open championship.\" Each of these corresponds exactly to the tournaments listed in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that each of these rows has data indicating participation by Tony Lema. Since all four tournaments are present in their respective rows with corresponding statistics, it suggests that he did participate in them.\n\nI should also verify if there's any other tournament mentioned or implied in the table that might contradict this claim. The fifth row seems to be a summary of totals across all tournaments, so it doesn't add any new information about specific events.\n\nSince all four tournaments named in the claim are present and accounted for in rows 1 through 4, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table data. The claim is: \"the only tournament that tony lema win in be the open championship\". \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. There are five rows, each representing a different tournament. Each row has several columns: tournament name, wins, top-5 finishes, top-10 finishes, top-25 finishes, events played, and cuts made.\n\nThe claim is about Tony Lema's wins in these tournaments. It says that the only tournament he won is The Open Championship. So I need to check each row to see how many wins there are for each tournament.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Masters Tournament, wins=0. That means Tony didn't win here.\nRow 2: US Open, wins=0. No win again.\nRow 3: The Open Championship (which is the British Open), wins=1. So he won once here.\nRow 4: PGA Championship, wins=0. No win here either.\nRow 5: Totals, which probably aggregates all tournaments, but since the other totals might not be necessary right now.\n\nSo according to this data, Tony Lema only has one win in The Open Championship. There's no mention of him winning any other tournaments. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because he only won The Open Championship as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lema only won The Open Championship. From the table:\n\n- Row 3 (The Open Championship) shows 1 win.\n- All other tournaments have 0 wins.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns include tournament name, wins, top-5 finishes, top-10, top-25, events played, and cuts made.\n\nThe claim is about whether Tony Lema won in the US Open. So I should look for any row where the tournament is the US Open and check if there were any wins.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 2 is labeled as \"us open\". Let's check the relevant columns for that row:\n- Tournament: US Open\n- Wins: 0\n- Top-5: 2\n- Top-10:3\n- etc.\n\nSo in the US Open row, the number of wins is 0. This directly supports the claim because if wins are 0, Tony Lema didn't win there.\n\nI should also consider other rows to make sure there's no information elsewhere that might contradict this. Rows 1, 3, 4, and 5 don't mention the US Open except for Row 2. The totals row (Row 5) has wins as 1 overall, but that's a summary across all tournaments, not specifically about the US Open.\n\nTherefore, since in the US Open row, the number of wins is 0, the claim that Tony Lema didn't win there is true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"highlighted_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}]}",

    "claim": "tony lema make it to the top 10 in the pga championship , but do not continue on",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"Tony Lema make it to the top 10 in the pga championship , but do not continue on.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It mentions two things about Tony Lema regarding the PGA Championship: he made it to the top 10 and did not continue on.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament or totals. The columns include things like tournament name, wins, top-5 finishes, top-10 finishes, etc., along with events played and cuts made.\n\nSo I need to focus on the row where the tournament is the PGA Championship. That's Row 4 in the table: \n\nTournament: pga championship\nWins: 0\nTop-5: 0\nTop-10: 1\nTop-25: 2\nEvents: 5\nCuts made: 4\n\nThe claim says Tony Lema made it to top 10, so I should check if he has a top-10 finish in the PGA Championship. According to the table, top-10 is 1. That means he did make it into the top 10 once.\n\nNext part of the claim: but do not continue on. I'm not exactly sure what \"continue on\" refers to here. It might mean that he didn't advance further or maybe didn't win after making it to top 10. Looking at the wins column for PGA Championship, it's 0, so he didn't win.\n\nAlternatively, \"do not continue on\" could imply that after making the cut (since cuts made are 4), he didn't proceed further in subsequent tournaments or events, but that might not be directly supported by the data. The table only shows his performance in each tournament listed, and the total across all events.\n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions the PGA Championship, I should focus on that row. He did make top-10 (top-10 is 1), so first part of the claim is correct. Now, whether he \"did not continue on\" \u2013 perhaps meaning he didn't win or maybe he didn't advance further in that tournament.\n\nLooking at the wins column for PGA, it's 0, so he didn't win. But does that mean he didn't continue? The term might be a bit ambiguous, but since he made top-10, which is better than not making the cut, but he didn't convert that into a win.\n\nAlternatively, \"continue on\" could relate to cuts made. He made 4 cuts in 5 events for PGA, so maybe he did continue as far as possible, given that he made the cut each time except once.\n\nBut I think the key point is whether he made top-10 and didn't continue further (like winning). Since he didn't win, perhaps the claim holds. However, it's a bit unclear. \n\nAnother angle: in the PGA Championship row, his top-10 is 1, meaning he was in the top 10 once. So he did make it to top 10. The second part says he doesn't continue on \u2013 maybe implying that after being in the top 10, he didn't proceed further or win.\n\nBut given that he only has one top-10 and zero wins, the claim could be interpreted as correct because he made it but didn't go all the way to a win. However, without more context, I need to stick strictly to the data.\n\nSo in the row for PGA Championship, he has 1 top-10 finish (so he did make it), and zero wins. So the claim that he made it to top 10 but didn't continue on (meaning didn't win) is accurate based on this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lema made it to the top 10 in the PGA Championship but did not continue on. From the table, we see that in the PGA Championship row, top-10 is 1, meaning he did make it into the top 10. However, wins are 0, indicating he didn't win. The term \"continue on\" isn't explicitly defined, but it could imply not winning or advancing further beyond the top 10.\n\nAnswer: TRUE\n\nHighlighted cells would be the 'top - 10' column in row 4 (PGA Championship) since that's where his top-10 finish is noted. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 10\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"Tony Lema be in the top 5 for the pga championship, the us open, and the open championship.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the table represents. Each row corresponds to a different tournament. The columns include things like 'tournament', 'wins', 'top-5', 'top-10', etc., up to top-25, and then some other stats like events and cuts made.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: Masters Tournament\n- Wins: 0\n- Top-5: 1\n- Top-10: 2\n- Etc.\n\nRow 2: US Open\n- Wins: 0\n- Top-5: 2\n- Top-10: 3\n- Etc.\n\nRow 3: The Open Championship (probably the British Open)\n- Wins: 1\n- Top-5: 2\n- Top-10: 2\n- Etc.\n\nRow 4: PGA Championship\n- Wins: 0\n- Top-5: 0\n- Top-10: 1\n- Etc.\n\nRow 5: Totals across all tournaments.\n- Wins: 1\n- Top-5: 5\n- Top-10:8\n- Etc.\n\nThe claim is about Tony Lema's performance in three tournaments: PGA Championship, US Open, and The Open. Specifically, whether he was in the top 5 for each of these.\n\nSo I need to check if, for each of these tournaments (PGA, US Open, Open), his top-5 count is at least 1 or more. If he has any top-5 finishes in each, then the claim holds.\n\nLooking at each tournament:\n\n- PGA Championship: Row 4. Top-5 is 0. So he didn't make it to the top 5 in this tournament.\n- US Open: Row 2. Top-5 is 2. So he was in top 5 twice here.\n- The Open: Row3. Top-5 is 2. He was in top 5 twice there.\n\nBut wait, for the claim to be true, Tony must have been in the top 5 for all three tournaments mentioned. However, according to the data, his top-5 count is 0 for the PGA Championship. So he didn't make it into the top 5 for that event. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because while he was in the top 5 for US Open and The Open, he wasn't for the PGA Championship.\n\nTo confirm, let me double-check:\n\n- For each tournament:\n  - Masters: Not relevant to the claim.\n  - US Open: Top-5 = 2 \u2192 yes.\n  - The Open: Top-5=2 \u2192 yes.\n  - PGA Championship: Top-5=0 \u2192 no.\n\nSince one of them (PGA) doesn't have any top-5 finishes, the overall claim is false.\n\nNow, to structure the JSON response:\n\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n\nHighlighted cells would be those that directly show his performance in each tournament. So for US Open and The Open, his top-5 counts are 2, so we highlight those rows' 'top-5' columns. Also, for PGA, since it's zero, highlighting that as well.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about all three tournaments. Since he didn't make top 5 in PGA, I think only thePGA row needs to be highlighted because that's where he failed. But perhaps highlighting all relevant cells would help show why the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just highlight the specific cells for each tournament:\n\n- US Open (Row2): 'top-5' is 2.\n- The Open (Row3): 'top-5' is 2.\n- PGA (Row4): 'top-5' is 0.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll include all three highlighted cells to show where he succeeded and failed.\n\nThus, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"top-5\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"top-5\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"top-5\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nWait, actually the rows are:\n\nRow 0: Masters\nRow1: US Open\nRow2: The Open\nRow3: PGA\nRow4: Totals\n\nSo in the JSON, row indices start at 0.\n\nTherefore, for US Open it's row index 1, 'top-5' is 2. For The Open, row index 2, top-5=2. For PGA, row index3, top-5=0.\n\nHence, I'll include all three in the highlighted cells to show that two were true and one was not.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"top-5\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"top-5\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"top-5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"tournament that tony lema have not participate in include the master tournament, the us open, the pga championship and the open championship.\"\n\nWait a minute, first off, the name might be misspelled. I think it's supposed to be Tony Lema? Or maybe someone else? But regardless, let's focus on what the table says.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament with various stats like wins, top finishes, events played, and cuts made. There are five rows: Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship (which is the British Open), PGA Championship, and then a totals row.\n\nThe claim is that Tony Lema has not participated in these four tournaments listed. So, to verify this, I need to check if there's any data indicating that he did participate in any of them. If all four have zero wins or maybe zero events played, that would support the claim that he hasn't participated.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1. Masters Tournament: Wins is 0, top-5 is 1, top-10 is 2, etc. Events is 4 cuts made is 4. So he has some finishes but zero wins. It doesn't necessarily mean he didn't participate; maybe he did and finished in the top without winning.\n\nWait, so if events is 4, that means he played 4 times in the Masters? Or wait, no\u2014each row might represent a tournament. Wait, let me clarify: The table's rows are different tournaments, each with their own stats. So for example, the first row is about the Masters Tournament, and under \"events\" it says 4, meaning he played in 4 events related to that tournament? Or wait, maybe each tournament has its own data.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each row represents a different tournament. For instance, Row 1 is the Masters Tournament with 0 wins, top-5=1, etc., and \"events\" is 4, meaning he participated in 4 events of that tournament? Or maybe it's the number of times he played in that specific tournament.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the structure: each row seems to be a different tournament, and within each row, the stats are for Tony Lema's participation in that tournament. So Row 1 is Masters Tournament, where he has 0 wins, top-5 once, etc., and he made 4 cuts but played in 4 events? Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe \"events\" refers to how many times he entered the event. So if it says 'events' is 4 for Masters, that means he participated in 4 Masters tournaments, right?\n\nSo for the claim: Tony hasn't participated in these four tournaments. But according to each row, he has participated:\n\n- For Masters Tournament (Row1): events=4, cuts made=4\u2014so he did participate multiple times.\n- US Open (Row2): events=6, cuts made=5. So he played 6 times, which is more participation.\n- The Open Championship (Row3): events=3, cuts made=3. He participated 3 times.\n- PGA Championship (Row4): events=5, cuts made=4. So he played 5 times.\n\nWait a minute\u2014so according to the table, Tony Lema has participated in all four tournaments: Masters, US Open, The Open, and PGA. Because each row shows that he entered multiple events (e.g., 4 for Masters), so he did participate.\n\nBut the claim says he hasn't participated in these four tournaments. So if the data shows he did participate, then the claim is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"highlighted_cells\"\u2014which ones would indicate that? The events and cuts made columns for each of these tournaments show participation. For example:\n\n- Masters: row 0 (assuming rows are 0-indexed), column 'events' is 4, so he participated.\n- US Open: row1, events=6\n- Open Championship: row2, events=3\n- PGA: row3, events=5\n\nSo all these cells show that he did participate. Therefore, the highlighted_cells would be each of these events and maybe cuts made columns for each tournament.\n\nWait, but according to instructions, I need to list the highlighted cells as a list of objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for each of the four tournaments, their 'events' column shows participation. Alternatively, since the claim is about not participating, the data showing events>0 would contradict that.\n\nSo in conclusion, the claim is false because he has participated in all these tournaments.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tony Lema did not participate in the Master Tournament, US Open, PGA Championship, and The Open Championship. However, according to the table:\n\n- **Masters Tournament**: Events = 4, indicating participation.\n- **US Open**: Events = 6, indicating participation.\n- **The Open Championship**: Events = 3, indicating participation.\n- **PGA Championship**: Events = 5, indicating participation.\n\nSince all these tournaments show events greater than zero, Tony Lema did participate in them.

So I should focus on the row where the tournament is the PGA Championship, which is Row 4. Let me check the 'wins' column for that row. \n\nLooking at Row 4 under the 'wins' column, it says 0. That means Tony Lema has zero wins in the PGA Championship. Therefore, the claim states he doesn't win there, and the data supports that because his number of wins is zero.\n\nI should also make sure there's no other row or information suggesting he won elsewhere but particularly in thePGA Championship. The Totals row shows one win overall, but it doesn't specify which tournament that was. However, since the claim is specifically about the PGA Championship, and Row 4 for that tournament has 0 wins, the statement holds true.\n\nSo I think the answer should be TRUE. Now, to highlight the relevant cells: the 'tournament' column in row 4 where it's PGA Championship, and the 'wins' column in the same row which is zero.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Tony Lema made it to the top 10 in the US Open, but do not continue on.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant row for the US Open, which is Row 2.\n\nIn that row, under \"tournament,\" it says \"us open.\" Now, looking at the columns related to performance: \"top - 10\" and others. The top-10 column here has a value of 3, which indicates how many times Tony Lema finished in the top 10 in this tournament.\n\nSince the claim states that he made it to the top 10 but didn't continue on, I think \"continue on\" might refer to not winning or perhaps not making further progress. Looking at the \"wins\" column for US Open, it's 0, meaning he never won there. So, he did make it to the top 10 multiple times (as indicated by top-10 count being 3), but he didn't win any of those events.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because he made it to the top 10 in the US Open but didn't convert that into a win. \n\nNow, I need to highlight the relevant cells: for \"top - 10\" in Row 2 and maybe others if needed.

The claim says that Paul Emerick does not have the greatest number of tries out of the nine total players.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to find the player named Paul Emerick. Scanning the 'player' column, Row 2 has \"paul emerick\". Now, I need to check his 'tries'. In Row 2, under 'tries', it's listed as 17.\n\nNext, I should compare this number with all other players in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 26 tries\n- Paul Emerick: 17 tries\n- Todd Clever: 11 tries\n- Philip Eloff: 10 tries\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10 tries\n- Chris Wyles: 10 tries\n- David Fee: 9 tries\n- Mike Hercules: 9 tries\n- Riaan van Zyl: 9 tries\n\nFrom this, Vaea Anitoni has the highest number of tries with 26. Paul Emerick is second with 17. Since the claim states that Paul does not have the greatest number of tries, and we see he's not even first but second, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because someone else (Vaea Anitoni) has more tries than Paul Emerick.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I need to analyze the data provided in the table. The claim states that \"paul emerick do not have the greatest number of tries out of the 9 total player.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant information about Paul Emerick from the table. Looking at row 2, Paul Emerick has:\n\n- **Tries**: 17\n\nNext, I'll compare this number with the \"tries\" column of all other players in the table to see if there is a player with more tries than Paul Emerick.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the \"tries\" for each player:\n- Row 1: Vaea Anitoni - **26**\n- Row 2: Paul Emerick - **17**\n- Row 3: Todd Clever - **11**\n- Row 4: Philip Eloff - **10**\n- Row 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya - **10**\n- Row 6: Chris Wyles - **10**\n- Row 7: David Fee - **9**\n- Row 8: Mike Herculus - **9**\n- Row 9: Riaan van Zyl - **9**\n\nFrom this data, it's clear that Vaea Anitoni has the highest number of tries with 26. Paul Emerick is second with 17 tries.\n\nSince there are other players (specifically, Vaea Anitoni) who have more tries than Paul Emerick, the claim \"paul emerick do not have the greatest number of tries out of the 9 total player\" is **TRUE**.\n\nTo format this as a JSON object with two keys: \"answer\" and \"highlighted_cells\", I'll highlight the cells that show the relevant information supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe highlighted cells are:\n- Row 1 (Vaea Anitoni) under the \"tries\" column, which has the highest number of tries.\n- Row 2 (Paul Emerick) under the \"tries\" column, which is less than Vaea Anitoni's tries.\n\nThis JSON object confirms that Paul Emerick does not have the greatest number of tries.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The claim is that the greatest number of drop from one player happened over an 8-year span. So first, I need to understand what each part of the table means.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with several stats: player name, span (years), start, tries, conv, pens, and drop. The \"drop\" column seems to be the number of times the player dropped a ball or something like that.\n\nThe claim is about the maximum number of drops by a single player over 8 years. So I need to find which player had the highest 'drop' value during an 8-year period.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Vaea Anitoni: span is 1992-2000, that's 8 years. His drop is 0.\n2. Paul Emerick: 2003-2012, which is 10 years. Drop is also 0.\n3. Todd Clever: from 2003 to start, but the end year isn't given, so I don't know if it's exactly 8 years. His drop is 0.\n4. Philip Eloff: 2000-2007, that's 7 years. Drop is 0.\n5. Takudzwa Ngwenya: from 2007 onwards, but the span isn't specified as 8 years. His drop is 0.\n6. Chris Wyles: 2007 to start, which might be a short period. His drop is 1.\n7. David Fee: 2002-2005, that's 3 years. Drop is 0.\n8. Mike Hercus: 2002-2009, that's 7 years. Wait, 2002 to 2009 is actually 7 seasons if we count each year as a season, but the span is from 2002 to 2009 inclusive, which is 8 years (since 2009 - 2002 = 7, plus one more year makes it 8). His drop is 4.\n9. Riaan van Zyl: 2003-2004, that's only 2 years. Drop is 0.\n\nNow, looking for the highest drop over an 8-year span:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni played for exactly 8 years (1992-2000) but his drops are 0.\n- Mike Hercus played from 2002 to 2009, which is 8 years. His drops are 4, which seems higher than others, but let me check if any other player has a higher drop.\n\nWait, Chris Wyles has only 1 drop, so Mike's 4 drops are higher. Also, looking at the other players, their drops are either 0 or less than Mike's.\n\nSo the highest number of drops is 4 by Mike Hercus over an 8-year span (2002-2009). Therefore, the claim that the greatest number of drops from one player happened over 8 years is TRUE because Mike Hercus has 4 drops over that period. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the greatest number of drop from 1 player happen over the span of 8 year\". It doesn't specify if it's the highest absolute number or just whether any player had a high number over 8 years. But since Mike has 4 drops over 8 years and others have 0 or less, this is the maximum.\n\nI should highlight Mike Hercus's drop cell because that's where the value lies.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drop\"}\n  ]\n}",

From the data given, it looks like \"span\" represents the years a player was active, and the other columns might track statistics during that time.\n\nSo, looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni's span is from 1992 to 2000. That means his play has ended because there's an end year.\n\nRow 2: Paul Emerick played from 2003 to 2012. His span also has a clear end, so he's finished.\n\nRow 3: Todd Clever's span starts in 2003 but doesn't have an end year. This might mean his time with the team isn't over yet.\n\nRow 4: Philip Eloff played from 2000 to 2007, so that's done.\n\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya started in 2007 without an end year. So he's still active.\n\nRow 6: Chris Wyles has a span ending in 2007? Wait, no, it starts in 2007 but doesn't specify the end. Hmm, actually looking again, the span is listed as \"2007 -\", so that means he hasn't finished yet.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check each row's span:\n\n- Row 1: 1992 - 2000 (ended)\n- Row 2: 2003 - 2012 (ended)\n- Row 3: 2003 - (no end, ongoing)\n- Row 4: 2000 - 2007 (ended)\n- Row 5: 2007 - (ongoing)\n- Row 6: 2007 - (ongoing)\n- Row 7: 2002 - 2005 (ended)\n- Row 8: 2002 - 2009 (ended)\n- Row 9: 2003 - 2004 (ended)\n\nSo, rows 3, 5, and 6 have spans without end years.

The claim is: \"Chris Wyles be one of the two players with drop during their time on the rugby team.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. Each row in the table corresponds to a player, and the columns include details like 'player', 'span' (years), 'start', 'tries', 'conv', 'pens', and 'drop'. The key column here is 'drop' since the claim mentions drops.\n\nLooking at each player's 'drop' value:\n\n- Row 1: Vaea Anitoni - drop is 0\n- Row 2: Paul Emerick - drop is 0\n- Row 3: Todd Clever - drop is 0\n- Row 4: Philip Eloff - drop is 0\n- Row 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya - drop is 0\n- Row 6: Chris Wyles - drop is 1\n- Row 7: David Fee - drop is 0\n- Row 8: Mike Hercus - drop is 4\n- Row 9: Riaan van Zyl - drop is 0\n\nSo, only two players have a non-zero 'drop' value: Chris Wyles with 1 and Mike Hercus with 4.

The claim says that Riaan van Zyl has the shortest time span on the US National Rugby Union team and ties with three others for the smallest number of tries.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to understand the data better.\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni played from 1992-2000. That's a span of 8 years.\nRow 2: Paul Emerick played from 2003-2012, which is 10 years.\nRow 3: Todd Clever started in 2003 and the end isn't listed, so his span is ongoing or longer than others.\nRow 4: Philip Eloff was active from 2000-2007, that's 7 years.\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya played from 2007 onwards, so again a longer span.\nRow 6: Chris Wyles started in 2007 and has stats until then, but his start year is the same as others.\nRow 7: David Fee was active from 2002-2005, which is 3 years.\nRow 8: Mike Hercus played from 2002-2009, that's 7 years.\nRow 9: Riaan van Zyl played from 2003-2004, so 2 years.\n\nLooking at the time spans, Riaan van Zyl has a span of just two years, which is indeed the shortest among all listed players. Next, I'll check the number of tries for each player to see if Riaan ties with three others for the smallest.\n\nTries:\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni - 26\nRow 2: Paul Emerick - 17\nRow 3: Todd Clever - 11\nRow 4: Philip Eloff - 10\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya - 10\nRow 6: Chris Wyles - 10\nRow 7: David Fee - 9\nRow 8: Mike Hercus - 9\nRow 9: Riaan van Zyl - 9\n\nWait, the claim says he ties with three others for the smallest number of tries. From the data, both David Fee and Mike Hercus have 9 tries, but looking at the table again:\n\nWait no, let me double-check.\n\nLooking back, in row 7: David Fee has tries is 9.\nRow 8: Mike Hercus also has tries as 9.\nRows 4,5,6 all have 10 tries each. Riaan van Zyl (row 9) has 9 tries, same as David and Mike. So that makes three players with 9 tries: David Fee, Mike Hercus, and Riaan van Zyl.\n\nWait no, because row 4 is Philip Eloff with 10, row5 Takudzwa Ngwenya also 10, row6 Chris Wyles 10, so rows 4-6 have 10 each. Rows 7 and 8 are 9, and row9 is also 9.\n\nSo Riaan van Zyl has 9 tries, same as David Fee (row7) and Mike Hercus (row8). So that's three others: David Fee and Mike Hercus? Wait no, because the claim says \"tie with 3 others\", so including himself makes four. But according to the data, Riaan van Zyl has 9 tries along with David Fee and Mike Hercus. That's two others, making a total of three players (including himself) with the smallest number of tries.\n\nWait, no: Row7 is David Fee with 9, row8 is Mike Hercus with 9, row9 is Riaan van Zyl with 9. So that's three players tied at 9 tries. But wait, looking back, I think there might be a mistake here. Let me recount:\n\nRow7: David Fee - 9\nRow8: Mike Hercus - 9\nRow9: Riaan van Zyl - 9\n\nThat's three players with 9 tries each. So the claim says he ties with 3 others for the smallest number of tries, which would mean including himself as one of them, making it four? Or does \"tie with 3 others\" mean that he and three others are tied at the same low number.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. The claim states Riaan van Zyl has the shortest time span AND ties with 3 others for the smallest tries. So from the data:\n\n- Time span: Shortest (2 years) - correct.\n- Number of tries: He's at 9, which is tied with David Fee and Mike Hercus, so that's two others. So total three players including him? Or does it mean he's among a group where four people have the smallest number.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking back, row7: David Fee has 9 tries (2002-2005)\nrow8: Mike Hercus has 9 tries\nrow9: Riaan van Zyl has 9\n\nSo that's three players with 9 tries, making it the smallest number of tries. So yes, he ties with two others for the smallest number, which is a total of three players.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"tie with 3 others\", so including himself, it would be four? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the three others are referring to those who have the same as him, making it three in total (including Riaan). So yes, he's tied with two others for the smallest number of tries.\n\nWait no, that can't be right because \"tie with 3 others\" would mean four players including himself. But according to the data, only David Fee and Mike Hercus have 9 tries along with Riaan van Zyl, making three in total. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because he doesn't tie with three others but two.\n\nWait no, let me make sure: The data shows that Riaan van Zyl has 9 tries. Looking at all players:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 26\n- Paul Emerick:17\n- Todd Clever:11\n- Philip Eloff:10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya:10\n- Chris Wyles:10\n- David Fee:9\n- Mike Hercus:9\n- Riaan van Zyl:9\n\nSo the smallest number of tries is 9, achieved by three players: David, Mike, and Riaan. So Riaan ties with two others, making a total of three players. Therefore, he doesn't tie with three others but three including himself.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. The claim says \"ties with 3 others\", so that would make four in total, including him. But according to the data, only three have 9 tries: David, Mike, and Riaan. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's not three others but two others.\n\nWait no, maybe I misread which rows correspond to whom. Let me check again:\n\nRow7: David Fee has tries is 9\nRow8: Mike Hercus has tries is 9\nRow9: Riaan van Zyl has tries is 9\n\nSo that's three players with the same number of tries, which is 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim says he ties with 3 others. That would mean four in total (including himself), but according to the data, only three have 9. Therefore, the claim is incorrect regarding the number of people he ties with for the smallest tries.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow1: Vaea Anitoni - 26\nRow2: Paul Emerick - 17\nRow3: Todd Clever - 11\nRow4: Philip Eloff -10\nRow5: Takudzwa Ngwenya -10\nRow6: Chris Wyles -10\nRow7: David Fee -9\nRow8: Mike Hercus -9\nRow9: Riaan van Zyl -9\n\nSo, rows 7-9 have 9 tries. That's three players with the lowest number of tries.\n\nTherefore, the claim is that he ties with three others (i.e., four in total including himself) for the smallest number of tries, but according to the data, only three have the same number. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because he doesn't tie with three others but two, making a group of three.\n\nWait no, I think the confusion comes from whether \"tie with 3 others\" means that along with himself, there are three others, making four in total. But according to the data, only three players have 9 tries: David Fee (row7), Mike Hercus (row8), and Riaan van Zyl (row9). So he ties with two others for the smallest number of tries.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because he doesn't tie with three others but two. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"ties with 3 others\" refers to three people in addition to himself, making four in total. But according to the data, only three have 9 tries.\n\nSo, the claim's second part is incorrect because he doesn't tie with three others for the smallest number of tries; he ties with two others, making a group of three.\n\nTherefore, the task would be to verify both parts: does he have the shortest time span (yes) and does he tie with three others for the smallest number of tries (no, only two others). Therefore, the claim is partially correct but the second part is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Riaan van Zyl has the shortest time span (2 years) and ties with three others for the smallest number of tries. \n\n- **Shortest Time Span**: Correct, as he has the shortest duration from row9.\n- **Ties with Three Others for Smallest Tries**: Incorrect, as he only ties with two others (David Fee and Mike Hercus), making a total of three players with 9 tries.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim correctly identifies his shortest time span but incorrectly states that he ties with three others; in reality, he ties with two others. \n\nThe final answer is: \n\n$\\boxed{\\text{Partially correct}}$",

The claim is: \"paul emerick do not have fewer tries than any other player.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at Paul Emerick's statistics in the table. From row 2, his data shows that he has 17 tries. Now, I need to compare this number with all the other players listed.\n\nLet's list out each player and their 'tries' numbers:\n\n- Vaea Anitoni: 26\n- Paul Emerick: 17\n- Todd Clever: 11\n- Philip Eloff: 10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya: 10\n- Chris Wyles: 10\n- David Fee: 9\n- Mike Hercus: 9\n- Riaan van Zyl: 9\n\nNow, the claim is that Paul Emerick does not have fewer tries than any other player. So, I need to check if there's at least one player who has more tries than him or the same.\n\nLooking at Vaea Anitoni with 26, that's higher than Paul's 17. Todd Clever has 11, which is lower than 17. Philip Eloff and others have 10 or less, David Fee, Mike Hercus, Riaan van Zyl have 9.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says he doesn't have fewer tries than any other player.

Therefore, Paul Emerick does have someone with more tries, which means his number of tries isn't higher than all others.\n\nBut wait, the claim is phrased as \"do not have fewer\", so it could be interpreted that he doesn't have fewer than at least one other player. But looking again, the way it's worded might mean that he doesn't have fewer than any (i.e., everyone else has equal or less). However, since Vaea Anitoni has more, the claim would actually be false because Paul does have someone with more tries.\n\nWait, no. Let me parse the sentence again: \"paul emerick do not have fewer tries than any other player.\" So it's saying that for every other player, paul's tries are not fewer. In other words, for all other players, their tries >= paul's 17.\n\nBut looking at Vaea Anitoni, he has 26 which is greater than 17. Todd Clever has 11, which is less than 17. So does the claim hold?\n\nWait, no. The way the claim is phrased might mean that Paul's tries are not fewer than any single other player. That would require that every other player has <=17. But Vaea Anitoni has 26, which is higher. Therefore, the claim is false because there exists at least one player (Vaea) with more tries than Paul.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the phrasing. Let me see: \"do not have fewer tries than any other player.\" So, for all other players, their number of tries >= Paul's 17? Or that he doesn't have fewer than each individual player?\n\nWait, no. It could mean that Paul's tries are equal to or greater than every other player's tries. But that's not the case because Todd Clever has 11, which is less than 17. Wait, but wait: if someone else has more, then he does have fewer than them, making the claim false.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The claim says Paul does NOT have fewer tries than any other player. So for all other players, their number of tries is not greater than his. But Vaea Anitoni has 26 which is greater. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there exists a player (Vaea) with more tries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure of the sentence. Let's parse it grammatically: \"do not have fewer tries than any other player.\" It could be that Paul doesn't have fewer tries compared to each individual player. So for every other player, his tries are >= theirs.\n\nBut looking at Vaea Anitoni, who has 26, which is higher, so in this case, Paul does have fewer than him. Therefore, the claim would be false because there's someone with more tries.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm getting confused between \"any other player\" as a group versus each individual. Let me clarify: The statement says that Paul doesn't have fewer tries than any other player. So if even one player has more, the claim is false.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Since Vaea Anitoni has 26 >17, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Paul Emerick does not have fewer tries than any other player. However, Vaea Anitoni has 26 tries, which is more than Paul's 17. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Tries\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the greatest number of drop from one player happen over the span of only 1 year.\" So, I need to look through each player's data and see who has the highest 'drop' in a single year.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 8: Mike Hercus has a drop of 4. His span is from 2002 to 2009, which is 7 years. So, I need to check if he had any single year with more than 4 drops.\nWait, no\u2014the 'drop' column might be the total over his entire span. So, maybe each player's drop is cumulative, not per year.\n\nWait, that makes it tricky because without knowing how many years they played, we can't tell their annual drops. The claim suggests that the highest drop happened in a single year, but if all players' drops are totals over multiple years, then none of them had a higher drop in just one year.\n\nSo, Mike Hercus has 4 drops over 7 years. If he had more than 4 in a single year, it would be higher than others, but we don't know because the data is total.\n\nLooking at other players: most have 0 or very low drops. For example, Row 6 has Chris Wyles with 1 drop, which is lower than Mike's 4. So even if Mike's 4 happened over multiple years, no single year surpasses that. Therefore, the claim isn't supported because we don't see any player having a higher drop in one year than the totals given.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. If 'drop' is per season or annually, then Mike's 4 drops might be from one year. But the data doesn't specify annuals; it's just total over the span. So without knowing, we can't confirm any single-year drop higher than others. Hence, the claim isn't supported, so answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that a player had the highest number of drops in a single year. However, based on the table, all players' 'drop' counts are totals over multiple years, not per year. Therefore, there's no evidence to support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that all of the players have already finished their span of play on the United States National Rugby Union team.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table means. Each row represents a player with several columns: Player, Span, Start, Tries, Conv, Pens, Drop.\n\nThe \"Span\" column likely indicates the years they played for the team. So if the span is listed as something like 1992-2000, that means the player was active from 1992 to 2000. If a span ends with a dash (like in row 3 and 5), it probably means they are still playing beyond that year.\n\nNow, looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni, Span 1992-2000. So he played until 2000. Since the current year isn't specified, but if we assume the data is up to date, he has finished his span.\n\nRow 2: Paul Emerick, 2003-2012. He stopped in 2012.\n\nRow 3: Todd Clever, 2003-. The dash here suggests he's still active beyond 2003, so he hasn't finished his span yet.\n\nRow 4: Philip Eloff, 2000-2007. He stopped in 2007.\n\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya, 2007-. Again, the dash implies he's still playing beyond 2007.\n\nRow 6: Chris Wyles, 2007-. Still active as of the data's cutoff.\n\nRow 7: David Fee, 2002-2005. He stopped in 2005.\n\nRow 8: Mike Hercus, 2002-2009. He stopped in 2009.\n\nRow 9: Riaan van Zyl, 2003-2004. He stopped in 2004.\n\nSo the claim is that all players have finished their span. But from the table, Todd Clever and Chris Wyles have spans ending with a dash, meaning they are still playing. Therefore, not all players have finished their span. \n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE because there are active players who haven't completed their time on the team yet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Span\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Chris Wyles be the only player with drop during his time on the rugby team.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what each column represents. The columns are Player, Span, Start, Tries, Conv, Pens, Drop. I'm particularly interested in the 'Drop' column since the claim focuses on that.\n\nLooking at Row 6, which is Chris Wyles, his drop value is 1. So he does have a drop. Now, to check if he's the only one, I need to look at all other rows to see if any other player has a non-zero drop.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni - Drop is 0.\nRow 2: Paul Emerick - Drop is 0.\nRow 3: Todd Clever - Drop is 0.\nRow 4: Philip Eloff - Drop is 0.\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya - Drop is 0.\nRow 6: Chris Wyles - Drop is 1. (This is the only non-zero drop so far.)\nRow 7: David Fee - Drop is 0.\nRow 8: Mike Hercus - Drop is 4. Oh, wait! His drop value is 4, which is more than zero. So he also has a drop.\nRow 9: Riaan van Zyl - Drop is 0.\n\nSo according to the data, both Chris Wyles and Mike Hercus have drops (1 and 4 respectively). This means that Chris isn't the only player with a drop during his time on the team. Therefore, the claim is false because there's another player with a non-zero drop.\n\nNow, I need to highlight the cells that support this conclusion. Specifically, the 'Drop' column for both Row 6 (Chris Wyles) and Row 8 (Mike Hercus).\n\nSo the highlighted cells should include:\n- {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Drop\"} since it's Chris Wyles.\n- {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Drop\"} because Mike Hercus is in row 8, but wait, no. Wait, rows are zero-indexed or one? Looking back at the initial data:\n\nWait, in the table provided, Row 6 is index 5 if we start from 0, since there are rows 1 to 9 listed as rows 0-8? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the user's message, the rows are described as row 1, row 2, etc., up to row 9. So when they're presented as JSON, likely using zero-based indexing. Or maybe not; perhaps it's one-based. Hmm, but the example given has \"row_index\" as 0 for the first row, so probably zero-based.\n\nWait no: the user provided the table as rows 1 to 9 in their natural text description, then when they showed an example JSON, the highlighted_cells had row indexes starting at 0, like 0,1. So likely, the actual data is stored with zero-based index.\n\nSo Chris Wyles is Row 6 in the user's initial description, which would be index 5 (since first row is 0). Mike Hercus is Row 8, which is index 7.\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni - index 0\nRow 2: Paul Emerick - index 1\nRow 3: Todd Clever - index 2\nRow 4: Philip Eloff - index 3\nRow 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya - index 4\nRow 6: Chris Wyles - index 5\nRow 7: David Fee - index 6\nRow 8: Mike Hercus - index 7\nRow 9: Riaan van Zyl - index 8\n\nYes, so the drop values are:\n\nChris Wyles (index 5) has a drop of 1.\nMike Hercus (index 7) has a drop of 4.\n\nTherefore, to highlight these cells, I need to include both in the highlighted_cells array. So each object will have \"row_index\" as 5 and 7 respectively, with \"column_name\" being \"Drop\".\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Drop\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Drop\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Riaan van Zyl is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"riann van zyl have the longest time span on the united state national rugby union team and tie with only 1 other player for the greatest number of tries.\"\n\nWait, I notice that \"riann\" is spelled differently in the claim compared to the table. In the table, it's Riaan van Zyl. So maybe this is a typo or misspelling. I should check if that affects anything.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their span (years active), starts, tries, conversions, pens, and drops. The columns are: Player, Span, Start, Tries, Conv, Pens, Drop.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Riaan van Zyl has the longest time span.\n2. He ties with only one other player for the greatest number of tries.\n\nLet's tackle the first part: who has the longest span?\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Vaea Anitoni (1992-2000) \u2192 8 years\n- Row 2: Paul Emerick (2003-2012) \u2192 9 years\n- Row 3: Todd Clever (2003-) \u2192 still ongoing, so over a decade at least\n- Row 4: Philip Eloff (2000-2007) \u2192 7 years\n- Row 5: Takudzwa Ngwenya (2007-) \u2192 ongoing, maybe similar to Todd Clever\n- Row 6: Chris Wyles (2007-) \u2192 ongoing\n- Row 7: David Fee (2002-2005) \u2192 3 years\n- Row 8: Mike Hercus (2002-2009) \u2192 7 years\n- Row 9: Riaan van Zyl (2003-2004) \u2192 only 1 year\n\nWait, Todd Clever's span is from 2003 to present. So he has the longest time span because it's still ongoing beyond the data cutoff. Similarly, Chris Wyles and Takudzwa Ngwenya also have spans extending past 2007. But among all players, who has the longest?\n\nTodd Clever (Row 3) is from 2003 to start is 51. So his span starts in 2003 and continues beyond, making it longer than others like Mike Hercus (2002-2009: 7 years), while Todd's is longer as he's still active.\n\nSo Riaan van Zyl only played from 2003-2004, which is just a couple of years. Therefore, he doesn't have the longest time span; in fact, he has one of the shorter spans.\n\nWait, but according to the table, Riaan's Span is 2003-2004, which is two years. Todd Clever's is 2003-, so from 2003 to at least 2012 (since he started in 2003 and has 51 starts). So yes, Todd has the longest span.\n\nNow for the second part: does Riaan tie with only one other player for the greatest number of tries?\n\nLooking at Tries column:\n- Row 1: 26\n- Row 2: 17\n- Row 3: 11\n- Row 4: 10\n- Row 5: 10\n- Row 6: 10 (Chris Wyles)\n- Row 7:9\n- Row8:9\n- Row9: Riaan has 9 tries.\n\nWait, let me check each row's Tries:\n\nRow 1: Vaea Anitoni \u2192 26 tries.\nThat's the highest in the table. Let's see others:\n- Paul Emerick: 17\n- Todd Clever: 11\n- Philip Eloff:10\n- Takudzwa Ngwenya:10\n- Chris Wyles:10\n- David Fee:9\n- Mike Hercus:9\n- Riaan van Zyl:9\n\nSo Vaea Anitoni has the highest number of tries with 26. Only he is the top; others are below that.\n\nRiaan van Zyl has 9, which ties him with several players (David Fee, Mike Hercus). So he doesn't tie for the greatest number; in fact, he's much lower.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false. Riaan doesn't have the longest span nor does he have the highest tries. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Riaan van Zyl has the longest time span and ties for the greatest number of tries. However, analyzing the table shows that Todd Clever has the longest span (2003-), and Vaea Anitoni leads with 26 tries. Riaan van Zyl only has 9 tries, tying with others but not leading.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"highlighted_cells\": []\n}\n```",
