2025-02-03 12:25:33,800 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim states that someone made it to the top-10 in some context but didn't continue on. Based on the data provided:

1. **Top-10 Finish**: The individual achieved a top-10 position three times (as indicated by "Top-10: 3").
2. **Cuts Made**: They successfully advanced beyond a certain stage five times out of six events ("Cuts made: 5").

This suggests that in all three instances where they finished in the top-10, they also made the cuts, meaning they continued on after those finishes. However, since they never won any tournaments (as indicated by "Wins: 0"), it can be interpreted that while they reached the top-10 multiple times, they did not achieve a victory, thus not continuing to win.

Therefore, the claim is true in the sense that they made top-10 finishes but didn't go on to win any tournaments. 

**Answer:** The claim is true because they finished in the top-10 three times but never won a tournament, so they did not continue on to victory.

**Answer:**  
Riaan Van Zyl does not tie with three others; he ties with two others who also have 9 tries.

1. **Jonathan Legear** has 1 goal from the title playoff, which might be associated with the Belgian Cup.
2. The other three players do not have any goals listed in the "title playoff" or "super cup" columns.

Given this information, it's likely that only Jonathan Legear scored in the Belgian Cup context provided, while the others did not score in that specific competition.

**Answer:** Only Jonathan Legear scored 1 goal in the Belgian Cup.

2025-02-03 12:57:40,511 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim that Guillaume Gillet scored three times as much as each of two other players is accurate when considering their total points across all tournaments (including the UEFA Champions League). Gillet has a total of 9 points, while multiple players have totals of 3. Therefore, his score is indeed triple theirs.

However, if we focus strictly on the UEFA Champions League (the 'league' column), where Gillet scored 8 points, there are no two other players with scores that are exactly one-third of 8. Thus, the claim holds true based on total points but not specifically within the league alone.

**Answer:** The claim is accurate when considering the total points across all tournaments, as Guillaume Gillet's total of 9 is three times the total of several other players who scored 3 each.

- **Jelle** has 3 goals in the "league" column, which we assume refers to the Champions League for this analysis.
- Players such as Hernán Losada and Víctor Bernárdez have 1 goal each in the "league" column.

Given this data, Jelle's 3 goals are indeed three times the number of goals scored by each of these two players. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table if "league" corresponds to the Champions League.

2025-02-03 13:22:28,885 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: Based on the analysis of the provided table, there isn't enough information to conclusively determine that Rafael Marquez scored exactly three goals in international friendly competitions. The 'goal' column's interpretation is ambiguous, and without explicit details about his personal goal contributions in each match, it's impossible to verify the claim.

However, if we assume each row represents a match where he contributed at least one goal, and considering only two rows under "friendly" competition (Rows 3 and 8), this would not sum up to three goals. Therefore, the data does not support the claim that he scored three goals in friendly competitions.

**Answer:** The claim cannot be confirmed based on the provided data.

2025-02-03 13:26:55,816 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The statement that 2000 was the only year Rafael Márquez scored more than one goal in international competition is false. In addition to a notable performance in 2000 where he scored five goals, there were subsequent years like 2002 where he also achieved multiple goals in a single match.

Answer: The claim is incorrect because Rafael Márquez had instances of scoring more than once in other years beyond 2000.

Based on the data provided:
- In all matches where Márquez scored (indicated by "goal" > 0), Mexico won except for one match (row 8) where they lost with Márquez scoring once.

Therefore, the assertion holds true as there's exactly one instance of a loss coinciding with Márquez's goal.

1. **Identify Matches with Goals by Márquez**: Each row represents a match where Márquez scored goals (as indicated by the 'goal' column).

2. **Count Losses in Those Matches**:
   - Only one match resulted in a loss for Mexico: Match 8, where Márquez scored once and the result was 1-2.

3. **Conclusion**: Since there is at least one instance where Mexico lost despite Márquez scoring, the teammate's statement that "when you score, we sometimes lose" is true based on the data provided.

**Answer**: The claim is true; there was at least one match where Márquez scored and Mexico lost.

2025-02-03 13:53:29,724 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The Brewers did have days in August 2005 where their cumulative wins exceeded their losses, meaning they had a winning record on those days. 

**Answer:**

False  
The Brewers had multiple days in August 2005 with a winning record.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim states that there were no days in August 2005 when the Brewers had a winning record (more wins than losses).

2. **Analyze the Table:** Each row's "Record" column shows cumulative wins and losses after each game.

3. **Check Each Row:**
   - Early rows show records like 1-0, 2-0, etc., indicating more wins.
   - As August progresses, many days have higher wins than losses.

4. **Conclusion:** Since there are days where wins > losses, the claim is false.

**Relevant Cells (Record Column):**

Each row from 0 to 31 in the "Record" column shows their cumulative record up to that date, demonstrating multiple instances of a winning record.

The final answer is:

**Answer:**

False  
The Brewers had days with a winning record in August 2005.
