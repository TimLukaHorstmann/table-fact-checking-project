- Total wins: 4

5. **Check if the claim matches the total number of nominations and wins**: The claim states that Kristofer Martin has been nominated for 7 awards between 2012 and 2013, with 4 wins.
   - Nominations: 1 + 1 = 2 (not 7)
   - Wins: 4 (matches)

6. **Conclusion**: Since the number of nominations does not match the claim, but the number of wins matches, we can conclude that the chain of thought leads to a False answer.

Step 2: Analyze the "european cup" row. In this competition, Nottingham Forest has 3 appearances, scored 32 goals for, and conceded 12 goals against.
This information will be used to compare with other competitions.

Step 3: Analyze the "uefa cup" row. In this competition, Nottingham Forest has 3 appearances, scored 18 goals for, and conceded 16 goals against.
We need to verify if Nottingham Forest has more wins in this competition compared to others.

Step 4: Since there is only one row with a label of "inter - cities fairs cup", we move on to the next step. However, as it appears that all rows are not relevant for determining which competition they participated in, let's look at their participation.
Nottingham Forest has a total of 10 appearances across different competitions.

Step 5: Analyze the "uefa super cup" row. In this competition, Nottingham Forest has 2 appearances, scored 4 goals for, and conceded 3 goals against.
This information will be used to compare with other competitions.

Step 6: Based on the table data, we can conclude that:
- The total appearances of Nottingham Forest across all competitions is indeed 10 (as stated in the "total" row).
- However, in order to determine if they have won the most at the UEFA Cup specifically, we need to compare the goals for and against values.
We notice that the data provided does not explicitly show which competition has the highest number of wins. Therefore we will look at the goal difference across all competitions.

3. Check if the names of the individuals in these rows match the names mentioned in the claim: For row 3 (Victor Lo Yik-kee), the romanised name matches the first name in the claim. For row 9 (Jeremy Young Chit-on), the romanised name does not match exactly, but the last name matches. Given that there are many ways to romanize Chinese names and slight differences in spelling can occur, this may be acceptable depending on the specific conventions used for romanization in this context.

4. Compare the "foreign nationality" values of these rows with the rest of the table: Since the "foreign nationality" column indicates British only for the specified rows, it suggests that both Victor Lo Yik-kee and Jeremy Young Chit-on are indeed British.

In this case, the claim does not specify that it refers to the total combined score, but if it did, then the maximum combined score would be 66 (from row 3 where NC State scored 42 and Tennessee scored 6).

2025-02-07 18:45:58,579 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the competition(s) for each match listed in the table. The competition column in the table indicates 'ecqg5' for four matches, 'ecqpo' for two matches, and 'friendly' for six matches. There are no repeating competition names, indicating that there is more than one competition.

2. Observe the venue where the majority of matches are played. In this case, it is Hampden Park in Glasgow, as it hosted 6 out of the 9 matches.

3. Recall that the question asks about the Scottish football season for 2003. However, the table does not provide any information about the year. Since there are no dates from 2003 in the table, we cannot definitively confirm or deny the claim based on this information alone.

As the table does not contain enough context to determine the truthfulness of the claim, I cannot produce a final answer. However, it is worth noting that if more specific and relevant data about the year was provided, we could potentially verify or refute the claim.

Final answer (without the JSON format): UNABLE TO ANSWER DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.

3. **Count results in Bhind district**: We then count the results in these rows: 177334 + 210649 + 205839 + 166893 = 860315.

4. **Find Datia district rows**: To count the results in Datia district, we need to identify the rows where 'district' equals "datia". Looking at the table, we find rows 5 and 8.

    ```
    {
      "row_index": 5,
      "column_name": "district"
    },
    {
      "row_index": 8,
      "column_name": "district"
    }
    ```

5. **Count results in Datia district**: We then count the results in these rows: 130161 + 139600 = 269761.

6. **Compare counts with claim**: The total count of results is 1371252, which does not match either 860315 (Bhind) or 269761 (Datia). Since the claim requires counting exactly 5 times in Bhind and 3 times in Datia, but we have a different total, we know that it's false.

7. **Final Answer**:

Based on the reasoning above, I found a positive score in row index 5 indicating that Milwaukee Brewers win 1 game during the 1982 World Series. However, there are not enough games to fulfill a three-game win.

2025-02-07 18:58:01,043 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: ### Step 1: Extract the date and time for each game on October 16
To determine if the game on October 16 was the only one longer than 3 minutes, we first need to extract the time for this game.

```html
<tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>october 16</td>
    <td>st louis cardinals - 5 , milwaukee brewers - 7</td>
    <td>county stadium</td>
    <td>3:04</td>
    <td>56560</td>
</tr>
```

### Step 2: Convert the time from hours and minutes to just minutes
To determine if the game was longer than 3 minutes, we need to convert the time from hours and minutes to just minutes.

```html
<time>3 hours and 4 minutes = (3 * 60) + 4 = 196</time>
```

### Step 3: Determine if there are any games that started later or went longer than October 16's game.
To verify the claim, we need to check all of the times in order to see if there were no games after October 16 with a time greater than 196 minutes.

```html

    <td>3</td>
    <td>october 15</td>
    <td>st louis cardinals - 6 , milwaukee brewers - 2</td>

    <td>busch stadium (ii)</td>
    <td>2:50</td>
    <td>53723</td>
</tr>
```

### Step 4: Convert all of the other game times from hours and minutes to just minutes.
```html
<tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>october 12</td>
    <td>milwaukee brewers - 10 , st louis cardinals - 0</td>

    <td>busch stadium (ii)</td>
    <td>2:50</td>
    <td>53723</td>
</tr>

<time>2 hours and 50 minutes = (2 * 60) + 50 = 170</time>
```

### Step 5: Determine if there are any games that started later than October 16th with a time greater than 196.
There is one game on October 17th that started after October 16th and has a time greater than 196 minutes.

Therefore, the claim is false.

4. Compare the weights of the devices and find the lightest one among them. In our case, the value at row 6 is 0.78 kg, which is the lightest weight found.
5. Check if any other device has a lower weight than Sony's lightest subnotebook (0.78 kg). Since no other devices have a lower weight, Sony indeed has the lightest subnotebook at 0.78 kg.

2025-02-07 19:02:14,941 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:

1. First, let's analyze the claim: "russia be the only nation to take home at least 1 time of each medal". This means we need to check if Russia has won at least one gold, silver, and bronze medal.

2. Looking at the table, we see that Russia has:
   - Gold medals: 4 (in rank 1)
   - Silver medals: 1 (in rank 1)
   - Bronze medals: 1 (in rank 1)

3. Since Russia has won at least one of each medal, let's check if there are any other nations that have also won at least one of each medal.

4. Looking at the table again, we see that:
   - China has not won a silver or bronze medal.
   - France has not won a gold, silver, or bronze medal (except for 1 silver in rank 3).
   - Canada and Poland have both only won 1 bronze medal each.

5. Since none of the other nations have won at least one of each medal, Russia is indeed the only nation that meets this condition.

6. However, we still need to verify that no other nation has won exactly one gold, one silver, and one bronze medal. After re-examining the table, I realize that China does not meet this condition (it doesn't have any medals), but France and Canada do not either.

7. But Poland actually does not qualify because it also only has 1 medal (bronze). The same goes for Canada's single gold.

8. However, the same situation holds true for France as well. So in total there are three nations that meet this condition:

- russia 
- france
- poland

From the table, we can see that the only tournament where the player was not present in all the years within 2008-12 is the Australian Open. Therefore, to verify the claim, we need to check if there is any year between 2008 and 2012 when the player was present at the Australian Open.

     Second, check each year between 2008 and 2012 to see if the player participated in the Australian Open. From the table, we can observe that the player did participate in the Australian Open in 2008 (2r) and was absent from 2009-2012.

     Third, compare our findings with the claim. Since the claim states that the player should only be absent for the Australian Open in the years 2008-12, our observations match the claim."

2. Check each row to determine if it contains an SSD as the hard drive:
    - Loop through all rows in the table
    - For each row, check the value of the cell corresponding to the "Hard drive" column
    - If the value is either "ssd" or "ssd, dvd", mark that row as relevant
3. Count the number of relevant rows: Once all relevant rows have been identified, count how many of them have an SSD as their hard drive
4. Compare the result with the given claim: If the number of relevant rows is 12, then the answer is "TRUE". Otherwise, the answer is "FALSE"
5. Output the final JSON object:

2025-02-07 19:15:29,127 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: #### Step 1: Identify the starting date
The starting date given in the claim is March 7, 2003.

#### Step 2: Determine if the show aired until April 16, 2004
To determine if the claim is true, we need to find out when the show ended. We can do this by finding the row with the highest "original air date" that is before or on April 16, 2004.

#### Step 3: Find the last row with a date before or on April 16, 2004
We will go through the rows one by one and compare their dates with April 16, 2004.

#### Step 4: Check each row's date against April 16, 2004
Rows 25-26 have the highest "original air date" before April 16, 2004. 

#### Step 5: Analyze Rows 25 and 26 for the last recorded original air date
Row 26 is the last one that had an "original air date" of April 16 ,  2004

2025-02-07 22:13:45,621 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: #### Step 1: Determine the titles in order
To assess the claim, we first need to determine the titles in order from the table.

### Step-by-step reasoning:
- We will go through each row of the table and extract the title for comparison.
- Titles are located in column "title".

#### Table (naturalized):
Row 1: title: dallas, directed by: don colliver, written by: peter field rachael ray, original air date: march 7 , 2003, production code: ad1b07.

Row 25: title: saratoga, directed by: don colliver, written by: peter field rachael ray, original air date: october 8 , 2003, production code: ad1b25.

Row 26: title: saratoga, directed by: don colliver, written by: peter field rachael ray, original air date: october 15 , 2003, production code: ad1b26.

#### Step 2: Verify if "dallas" is indeed the first and "saratoga" is last
Now that we have determined the titles in order, we will compare this sequence to our claim.
- The first title should be "dallas".
- The last title should be "saratoga".

#### Chain of Thought:
The chain of thought for this problem is that we start with a claim about the time range in which the show aired. We then look at the original air dates provided in the table to determine if all episodes fall within this specified time frame.

Since row 1's original air date (March 7, 2003) occurs before the claimed start date, and row 24's (April 2, 2004) occurs after the claimed end date, we can conclude that not every episode aired between these two dates. This means our final answer is FALSE.

2025-02-07 19:22:31,607 - WARNING - Error parsing response: 'dict' object has no attribute 'upper'. Raw response: ### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the claim**: We need to check if the Scottish club has the lowest amount of transfer fee.
2. **Find relevant data**: Look for all the rows where "nat" equals "sco".
3. **Extract the transfer fees**: For each row found in step 2, extract the value from the "transfer fee" column and store it in a list or similar data structure.
4. **Filter out empty values**: Remove any entries with an empty string (n / a) from the list created in step 3.
5. **Find the minimum transfer fee**: Use the list created in step 3 to find the smallest value, which represents the lowest amount of transfer at "sco".
6. **Compare with claim**: Compare the result from step 5 with the claim's value (22) and determine if it is true or false.

### Explanation:
The code implements the reasoning process above in JSON format. The `chain_of_thought` array describes each step of the reasoning process, including finding relevant data, extracting transfer fees, filtering out empty values, and comparing with the claim. Finally, the answer is determined to be true or false based on comparison with the claim's value (22), along with relevant cells that supported this conclusion.
