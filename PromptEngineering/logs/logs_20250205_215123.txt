The claim is that "You knocked out your opponent in 1 minute and 20 seconds, making it the fastest knockout of your career." 

**Analysis**:
- The table shows a fight against Joe Campanella with a duration of 1:20 and result as a win. This indicates that the knockout occurred at 1 minute and 20 seconds.
- If this is the shortest time recorded in your fights, then it would be accurate to call it the fastest knockout of your career.

From the provided data:
- Only **Row 0** indicates a home game at Pepsi Center with an attendance of **19,359**.
- The remaining rows are away games at Target Center or other venues and should be excluded from this calculation.

Since there's only one home game in the dataset, the average attendance is simply the attendance of that single game.

**Answer:**  
The average attendance at home games (Pepsi Center) is **19,359**.

   ]
}

Wait, I'm now confused because in the table, Row 8 is where Borislav Jeliazkov is. Let me recount:

Rows as per user's data (1-14), but when considering zero-based indexing, they become 0-13.

Row 1: index 0
Row 2: index 1
...
Row 8: index 7

So the match against Borislav is at row_index 7, and the shortest time is in Row 7 (index 6), which is Joe Campanella with time 0:18.

Thus, the relevant cells are:

- Opponent in row 6 (Joe Campanella)
- Time in row 6 (0:18)

Therefore, the correct JSON should be:

{
   "answer": "FALSE",
   "relevant_cells": [
     {"row_index": 6, "column_name": "opponent"},
     {"row_index": 6, "column_name": "time"}
   ]
}

Final Answer:
{
   "answer": "FALSE",
   "relevant_cells": [
     {"row_index": 6, "column_name": "opponent"},
     {"row_index": 6, "column_name": "time"}

2025-02-05 22:18:28,927 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To determine if there were any consecutive losses during the season, we examine the sequence of game outcomes:

1. **List the Game Outcomes**: From the data provided, list each game's result in chronological order.
   
   - W (Win)
   - W
   - W
   - L (Loss)
   - W
   - L
   - W
   - W
   - L
   - W
   - W
   - W
   - W

2. **Check for Consecutive Losses**: Look through the sequence to see if there are two 'L's in a row.

   Scanning the list, each loss is followed by a win:
   
   - After the first loss (4th game), the next game is a win.
   - The second loss (6th game) is also followed by a win in the 7th game.
   - The third loss (9th game) is followed by wins in games 10, 11, and so on.

3. **Conclusion**: There are no instances where two losses occur consecutively throughout the season.

**Answer:**  
There were no consecutive losses during the season.

2025-02-05 22:47:29,977 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Total Games**: There are 10 games listed from Game 47 to Game 56.

2. **Determine Leadership**: Check each game to see who had the highest points (leader).

3. **Count Stephen Jackson's Leadings**:
   - Game 50: SJ
   - Game 51: SJ
   - Game 52: SJ
   - Game 53: SJ

4. **Compare Against Half**: Half of 10 games is 5. Since SJ led in 4 games (less than 5), the claim is true.

Answer:

The claim is true because Stephen Jackson led in fewer than half of the games, specifically leading in 4 out of 10 games.

2025-02-05 23:16:54,038 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The task involves determining if Potter Co was both the first to be proposed and the last to be listed based on the provided data.

**Analysis:**

1. **Proposed Date:**
   - Potter Co's project was cleaned up before the formal creation of the NPL (December 1980), indicating it was likely proposed earlier than other projects with dates starting from 1983 onwards.
   - Therefore, Potter Co was first proposed.

2. **Listed Date:**
   - The listed date for Potter Co is the same as its proposed date, implying it might have been handled before others were even proposed.
   - Newsford Products was listed in March 2007, which is later than any other listed dates provided (e.g., Flowood Site in 1984, Davis Timber in 2000).
   - Thus, Newsford Products was the last to be listed.

**Conclusion:**
While Potter Co was indeed the first proposed, it was not the last listed. Therefore, the claim that Potter Co was both first proposed and last listed does not hold.

**Answer:** No

- In row 0, when playing against Cambridge University, the touring team scored 12 points.

Since 12 exceeds 10, it indicates that the touring team did score more than 10 points against Cambridge University. Therefore, the claim that "no team scores more than 10 against Cambridge University" is false.

**Answer:** No, there exists a game where a team scored more than 10 against Cambridge University.

**Answer:**

- **First Part (Potter Co. being the first proposed):** Incorrect. There were earlier proposed projects such as Flowood Site (September 1983) and Newsom Brothers (October 1984).
- **Second Part (Not yet listed):** Correct. Potter Co.'s 'listed' date is empty or not applicable, indicating it hasn't been listed yet.

Thus, while Potter Co. wasn't the first proposed project overall, it has indeed not been listed yet.

2. **Score Comparison**: Steve's total score is 139, while Phil's is 143. Therefore, Steve does have a lower score than Phil.

However, since the statement incorrectly identifies Steve's country as Scotland, which contradicts the table, the entire statement is false because it contains inaccurate information about his nationality.

2025-02-06 00:09:19,336 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The task is to verify whether Glasgow Govan is among the top five constituencies in terms of swing to gain and whether its result was an SNP gain.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Glasgow Govan in the Table:**
   - Located in Row 7 (index 6), with a swing to gain of 2.92 and result as "snp gain."

2. **Determine Top Five by Swing to Gain:**
   - Sorted descendingly:
     1. Glasgow Govan: 2.92
     2. Western Isles: 2.91
     3. Dundee West: 2.13
     4. Kilmarnock & Loudoun: 1.92
     5. Cumbernauld & Kilsyth: 1.07

3. **Analyze the Claim:**
   - The claim suggests Glasgow Govan is a "5 constituency," possibly meaning fifth place.
   - However, it's actually first when sorted by swing to gain.

4. **Conclusion on SNP Gain:**
   - The result for Glasgow Govan is correct as an SNP gain.
   - Its ranking contradicts the claim of being fifth.

**Answer:**

The claim that Glasgow Govan is a "5 constituency" (fifth place) is incorrect, but it did experience an SNP gain.

2025-02-06 00:11:01,674 - WARNING - Error parsing response: 'dict' object has no attribute 'upper'. Raw response: <think>
Alright, so I need to determine if the claim "pádraig harrington be the only player from northern ireland" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading through the problem and the table provided.

First, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row contains information about a golfer's performance in a tournament. The columns are place, player name, country, score, and to par. My focus is on the 'player' and 'country' columns because the claim is about pádraig harrington being the only player from Northern Ireland.

Looking at the rows:

Row 1: Steve Stricker from the United States.
Row 2: Colin Montgomerie from Scotland.
Row 3: Kenneth Ferrie from England.
Row 4: Geoff Ogilvy from Australia.
Row 5: Jim Furyk from the United States.
Row 6: Pádraig Harrington from Ireland. Wait, Ireland? The claim says Northern Ireland, but this is just Ireland. So I should note that.
Row 7: Jason Dufner from the United States.
Row 8: Graeme McDowell from Northern Ireland. Oh, here's another player from Northern Ireland.
Row 9: Phil Mickelson from the United States.
Row 10: Arron Oberholser from the United States.

Wait a second, I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check each row carefully.

Row 8: Player is Graeme McDowell, country is Northern Ireland. So that's one player from Northern Ireland.

The claim states that pádraig harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland. But according to this, Graeme McDowell is also from Northern Ireland. That means there are at least two players from Northern Ireland: Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell. Therefore, the claim is false because it's not exclusive to Harrington.

Wait, hold on again. Wait, looking back at row 6, it says pádraig harrington's country is Ireland, not Northern Ireland. So actually, only Graeme McDowell is from Northern Ireland. That changes things. Let me confirm:

Row 6: Country is Ireland (for Harrington), and Row 8: Country is Northern Ireland (McDowell). Therefore, the claim says Harrington is the only one from Northern Ireland, but in reality, McDowell is from Northern Ireland, not Harrington. So if the claim states that Harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland, that's incorrect because McDowell is also from there.

Wait, no, wait again. The claim says "pádraig harrington be the only player from northern ireland". But according to the table, Harrington is from Ireland, not Northern Ireland. So in this case, the only player from Northern Ireland is Graeme McDowell. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not Harrington; it's McDowell who is from Northern Ireland.

Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row again:

Row 6: pádraig harrington, country: ireland. So that's correct—Harrington is from Ireland.
Row 8: graeme mcdowell, country: northern ireland.

So the claim states that Harrington is the only one from Northern Ireland, but in reality, McDowell is the one from Northern Ireland, and he isn't the only one because there are no others. Wait, but according to the table, only McDowell is from Northern Ireland. So if the claim says Harrington is the only one, that's false because it's actually McDowell, not Harrington.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down step by step.

1. The claim: "pádraig harrington be the only player from northern ireland."
2. To verify, I need to check two things:
   a. Is pádraig harrington in the table?
   b. Are there any other players from Northern Ireland besides him?

From the table:

- Looking for players with country as "northern ireland." Only Row 8 has that: Graeme McDowell.
- So, only McDowell is from Northern Ireland.

Now, checking if Harrington is the only one. Since Harrington's country is Ireland (Row 6), he isn't from Northern Ireland. Therefore, the claim that Harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland is incorrect because there's no such player as Harrington in Northern Ireland; instead, McDowell is the only one.

Wait, but maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: "pádraig harrington be the only player from northern ireland." So the claim is saying that Harrington is the sole representative from Northern Ireland. However, according to the table, he's from Ireland, not Northern Ireland. Therefore, the correct information is that McDowell is from Northern Ireland, making the claim about Harrington incorrect.

Alternatively, if I misinterpret and think that "northern ireland" is part of Ireland, but no, they're separate regions. So, in this context, they are distinct.

Therefore, the relevant cells to check are:

- For Harrington: row 6, country is Ireland.
- Check other rows for Northern Ireland: row 8, country is Northern Ireland.

Since only McDowell is from Northern Ireland and he's not the same as Harrington, the claim that Harrington is the only one is false.

Wait, but wait again. The claim says "pádraig harrington be the only player from northern ireland." If we check all rows for country being Northern Ireland:

Row 8: Graeme McDowell, Northern Ireland.

So, there's only one player from Northern Ireland, which is McDowell. Therefore, Harrington isn't even from Northern Ireland; he's from Ireland. So the claim that Harrington is the only one from Northern Ireland is false because it's actually McDowell who is from there.

Thus, the answer should be FALSE.
</think>

The claim states that Pádraig Harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland. Checking the table:

- Row 6 shows Pádraig Harrington's country as Ireland, not Northern Ireland.
- Row 8 lists Graeme McDowell from Northern Ireland.

Thus, the claim is incorrect because Graeme McDowell is the sole player from Northern Ireland.

When considering all teams:

North Melbourne is third.

When considering only away teams:
1. North Melbourne: 121

   - 1999: 5
   - 2000: 6
   - 2001: 7
   - 2002: 5
   - 2003: 9
   - 2004: 7
   - 2005: 9
   - 2006: 5
   - 2008: 1
3. **Sum the Races:** Adding these numbers gives a total of 66 races.
4. **Compare with Claim:** The claim states 198 races, which doesn't match the calculated total.

**Answer:** No, Shane Hall did not run 198 races between 1996 and 2008; he ran a total of 66 races during that period.

2025-02-06 01:03:28,826 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim that the globular cluster has the second highest declination is **TRUE**.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object Types and Declinations:**
   - NGC 5466 (Row 2) is a globular cluster with a declination of approximately 32°.
   - Other objects have the following declinations:
     - NGC 5474: 39°
     - NGC 5477: 27.67°
     - NGC 5408: 22.73°
     - NGC 5457: 20.88°

2. **Determine the Order of Declinations:**
   - Highest: NGC 5474 (39°)
   - Second highest: NGC 5466 (32°)
   - Third: NGC 5477 (27.67°)
   - Fourth: NGC 5408 (22.73°)
   - Fifth: NGC 5457 (20.88°)

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The globular cluster NGC 5466 is the second highest in declination among the listed objects.

**Relevant Cells:**

- Row 0: Declination of NGC 5408
- Row 1: Declination of NGC 5457
- Row 2: Object type (Globular Cluster) and Declination of NGC 5466
- Row 3: Declination of NGC 5474
- Row 4: Declination of NGC 5477

These cells were examined to determine the declinations' order and confirm that the globular cluster (NGC 5466) holds the second highest position.

- The brightest object in the table is a spiral galaxy with an apparent magnitude of 8.7, which is lower (brighter) than any other object type.
- While another spiral galaxy has a higher magnitude (11.9), it is still brighter than the globular cluster and irregular galaxies.

Therefore, since the minimum apparent magnitude among spirals is lower than that of other types, the claim holds true.

**Answer:** Yes, the spiral galaxy has the least apparent magnitude in this context.

2025-02-06 01:16:02,343 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim that "spiral galaxies have the most apparent magnitude" is disproven by the given data. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding Apparent Magnitude:** In astronomy, apparent magnitude measures how bright an object appears from Earth. Lower magnitudes indicate brighter objects, while higher magnitudes mean dimmer objects.

2. **Analyzing the Data:**
   - NGC 5457 (Spiral): 8.7 (Brightest)
   - NGC 5466 (Globular Cluster):10.5
   - NGC 5474 (Spiral):11.9
   - NGC 5408 (Irregular):14.0
   - NGC 5477 (Irregular):14.5 (Dimmest)

3. **Evaluating the Claim:** The claim suggests spiral galaxies have the highest apparent magnitude, implying they are the dimmest.

4. **Comparing Magnitudes:**
   - The dimmest objects in the list are irregular galaxies with magnitudes of 14.0 and 14.5.
   - Spiral galaxies vary: NGC 5457 is the brightest (8.7), while NGC 5474 is dimmer but still brighter than irregulars.

5. **Conclusion:** Since irregular galaxies have higher apparent magnitudes (are dimmer) than some spiral galaxies, the claim that spirals have the highest apparent magnitude is false.

**Final Answer:** The claim is disproven; irregular galaxies in the dataset have higher apparent magnitudes (i.e., are dimmer) than some spiral galaxies.

2025-02-06 01:16:05,930 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim that spiral galaxies have the second highest declination among the listed objects is incorrect. Upon analysis of the declinations:

- Row4 (spiral galaxy) has the highest at ~39.75°
- The second highest is row3 (globular cluster) at ~32.067°

Since the second highest declination is held by a globular cluster, spiral galaxies do not occupy that position.

**Answer:** No, spiral galaxies do not have the second highest declination; it is actually a globular cluster that holds that position.

2025-02-06 01:20:49,479 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim is about whether the first record in the table was recorded in November 1965. Upon examining the data:

- The first row (index 0) has a 'first' value of September 1990.
- The earliest start date in the entire table is November 1965, found in row index 3.

However, since "the first record" typically refers to the first entry in the list (row 0), and its 'first' column does not match November 1965, the claim is FALSE. If it were referring to the earliest start date regardless of order, it would be TRUE, but based on standard interpretation, it's about row index 0.

**Answer:** The claim is FALSE because the first record (row 0) starts in September 1990, not November 1965.

2025-02-06 01:23:46,383 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim is incorrect. Takamiyama's span of approximately 13 years is not the shortest; several other wrestlers have shorter durations.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevance**: Locate rows where the 'name' is "takamiyama" (found in row 6).

2. **Calculate Time Spans**:
   - For each wrestler, subtract the year of their first appearance from their last.
   - Example for Takamiyama: 1982 - 1969 = 13 years.

3. **Compare All Spans**: Determine the shortest duration among all wrestlers.
   - The shortest span is found to be 4 years (Daikirin).

4. **Conclusion**: Since 13 years isn't the shortest, the claim that Takamiyama has the shortest span of 13 years is false.

**Answer:**  
The claim is incorrect.

- **Kotonishiki**: 9 years
- **Kaio**: ~6 years and 2 months (shortest)
- **Musoyama**: ~6 years and 6 months
- **Hasegawa**: ~8 years and 10 months
- **Kotomitsuki**: ~6 years and 6 months

1. **Hosting Instances**: The table shows that South Korea hosted the Asian Games twice: in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). This makes South Korea the only country to have hosted more than once.

2. **Location Accuracy**: The claim incorrectly lists Doha as a host location for South Korea. In reality, Doha is in Qatar and was the host in 2006.

**Conclusion**: While it's true that South Korea hosted equestrian events twice, the claim erroneously includes Doha as one of the host locations. Therefore, the claim is partially accurate but contains an error regarding the location.

Answer: The claim is partially correct; South Korea did host more than once, but listing Doha as a host is incorrect.

1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The table lists various fights with results including KO, TKO, and SD (split decision). The result for Hatton's fight is a KO in round 2 of 12.

2. **Interpret Score Differences**: A KO in an early round suggests a significant lead, implying a larger score difference at that point compared to fights ending later or by split decisions.

3. **Compare with Other Fights**: While some fights went longer (e.g., 12 rounds), the Hatton fight ended quickly, which could indicate a substantial immediate score differential.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the quick KO in round 2, it's inferred that this bout had the biggest score difference compared to others listed.

**Answer:** Yes, the bout against Ricky Hatton had the largest score difference due to the early knockout, indicating a significant lead at that point.

2025-02-06 02:29:31,509 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim is TRUE because there are companies in the table with more than 40,000 employees over Sandvik. Specifically, ISS (534,500) and Volvo (98,162) meet this condition.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Sandvik's Employees:** Sandvik has 50,030 employees.
2. **Calculate Threshold:** 50,030 + 40,000 = 90,030 employees needed to meet the claim.
3. **Check Other Companies:**
   - ISS (534,500) > 90,030 ✅
   - Securitas (272,425) > 90,030 ✅
   - Nokia (130,050) > 90,030 ✅
   - Maersk (117,080) > 90,030 ✅
   - Ericsson (104,525) > 90,030 ✅
   - Volvo (98,162) > 90,030 ✅

Since multiple companies exceed the required threshold, the claim is TRUE.

**Relevant Cells:**

- Sandvik's employees: Row 8, Column "employees"
- ISS's employees: Row 0, Column "employees"

These are the key cells used to verify the claim.

2025-02-06 02:39:48,658 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: Yes, Episode 10 of Season 3 aired exactly one week after Episode 9. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Episodes:** We need to find the air dates for Episode 9 and Episode 10 of Season 3.

2. **Analyze Air Dates:** By examining the "Original air date" column, each episode in the table airs weekly, one week apart from the previous episode.

3. **Determine Episode Numbers:** Since each row represents a consecutive episode within the season, we count through the rows to find Episodes 9 and 10.

4. **Check Air Dates:**
   - Episode 9 (row index 8) aired on June 12.
   - Episode 10 (row index 9) aired on June 19.

5. **Calculate the Difference:** The air dates are exactly one week apart, confirming that Episode 10 aired one week after Episode 9.

**Answer:** Yes, Episode 10 aired one week after Episode 9 in Season 3.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Episodes:** We need to check if "Red All Over" comes immediately after "Aingavite Baa".
2. **Locate the Episodes in the Season Order:** By examining the 'no_in_season' numbers:
   - "Aingavite Baa" is listed as no_in_season:44.
   - "Red All Over" follows with no_in_season:45.
3. **Verify Consecutiveness:** Since 45 directly follows 44, they are consecutive episodes.

Without explicit information about seasons in the table, it's challenging to determine how these episodes are distributed across seasons.

However, considering that the table lists all episodes up to number 22, which is typical for multiple seasons, it's likely that Chris Long directed episodes across more than one season. Therefore, the claim that he directed only one season is FALSE.

**Answer:** The claim is FALSE.

2025-02-06 02:49:24,233 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To determine whether any two episodes have a combined viewership exceeding that of the first two episodes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Extract Viewerships**: Extract the viewership numbers for all episodes into a list.
2. **Calculate Initial Sum**: Compute the sum of the first two episodes' viewerships.
3. **Sort Viewerships**: Sort the list of viewerships in descending order to easily find the top two highest values.
4. **Check Top Pair**: Compare the sum of the top two viewerships with the initial sum. If it's greater, the claim is false; otherwise, it holds.

**Answer:**

The claim that no two episodes have a combined viewership exceeding that of the first two is true if and only if the sum of the two highest viewerships (after sorting) does not exceed the initial sum of the first two episodes. 

Thus, the solution involves checking whether the sum of the top two sorted viewerships exceeds the initial sum. If it does, the claim is false; otherwise, it's true.

**Final Answer:**

The claim holds if no two other episodes' combined viewership exceeds that of the first two. The result can be determined by comparing the sum of the top two episodes after sorting with the initial sum. 

So, the final answer depends on this comparison:

- If the maximum possible sum (top two sorted) > initial_sum → claim is false.
- Else → claim is true.

For a specific dataset, follow these steps to verify.

2025-02-06 02:53:35,244 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim that the first two episodes have the highest combined viewership is incorrect. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Viewership of First Two Episodes**: The first episode (season 1, no in series=24) has 15.07 million viewers, and the second episode has 15.75 million viewers. Their combined total is 30.82 million.

2. **Examine Other Episodes' Viewership**: Look through the rest of the episodes to find any two that have a combined viewership exceeding 30.82 million.

3. **Find Higher Combined Viewership**: For example, episode no in series=43 (season 20) has 16.32 million viewers, and another episode with 16.02 million viewers would sum to 32.34 million when combined. This total exceeds the first two episodes' combined viewership.

4. **Conclusion**: Since there exists at least one pair of episodes (e.g., no in series=43 and another) whose combined viewership is higher than that of the first two, the initial claim is false.

**Answer:** The first two episodes do not have the highest combined viewership; other episodes surpass this total.

2025-02-06 03:10:13,742 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To address the task of finding specific episodes (Episode 8 and Episode 10) from Season 2 based on the provided table structure, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understand the Table Structure**:
   - The table contains two columns: "no in series" and "no in season".
   - "no in series" refers to the episode's overall number across all seasons.
   - "no in season" refers to the episode's position within its specific season.

2. **Identify Season 2 Episodes**:
   - Locate rows where "no in season" corresponds to Episode 8 and Episode 10 of Season 2.
   - Note that without complete data, it's assumed Season 2 has at least 10 episodes.

3. **Locate Episode 8 of Season 2**:
   - Find the row where "no in season" is 8 and belongs to Season 2.
   - Extract relevant details such as air date or episode title (if available).

4. **Locate Episode 10 of Season 2**:
   - Similarly, find the row with "no in season" as 10 within Season 2.

5. **Present Findings**:
   - List the identified episodes along with their details if provided.

### Note:

- If the table doesn't extend to Season 2 or Episodes 8 and 10, it may indicate that additional data is needed beyond the current dataset.
- The actual details (e.g., air dates) would depend on the complete table entries which aren’t fully provided here.

2025-02-06 03:28:36,799 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim is true. Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey again in August 2000.

**Answer:**

Yes, the claim is true. The fight against Terry Smith occurred on April 13, 2000 (Row 32), which was before his subsequent fight with Marcus Harvey on August 17, 2000 (Row 30). Therefore, Librado Andrade did have a fight with Terry Smith before the fight with Marcus Harvey.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**
   - Terry Smith: Row 32, Date April 13, 2000.
   - Marcus Harvey: Two entries; Row 35 (August 14, 1999) and Row 30 (August 17, 2000).

2. **Determine Order of Fights:**
   - Terry Smith's fight is April 13, 2000.
   - The later Marcus Harvey fight is August 17, 2000.

3. **Verify Sequence:**
   - Since April 2000 comes before August 2000, the fight with Terry Smith (Row 32) occurred before the subsequent fight with Marcus Harvey (Row 30).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The claim is true based on the provided data.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes, Librado Andrade fought Terry Smith before fighting Marcus Harvey in August 2000.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that "the rotten apple" is directed by Bob Bralver and has the earliest release date among his works.

2. **Search for Title in Table:** Review each row's Title column to find "the rotten apple." It does not exist in the provided data.

3. **Check Director Entries:** Look for entries where the Director is Bob Bralver. Only one such entry exists: Row 6 (index 6), titled "ten wheel trouble," released on March 24, 1985.

4. **Conclusion:** Since "the rotten apple" isn't listed and Bob Bralver only directed one film in the table, the claim is false.

**Answer:** The claim is false because there's no entry for "the rotten apple" directed by Bob Bralver in the provided data.

2025-02-06 03:39:38,159 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim states that Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005, aged86, and was 10 years older than Arthur Sheekman, who died at age76. 

From the table:
- Charles Alden Black (Shirley Temple's husband) died in 2005 at 86.
- Gloria Stuart, married to Arthur Sheekman, died in 1978 at 76.

The table doesn't provide Arthur Sheekman's death details. Therefore, while Charles died at 86, we can't confirm Arthur's age or year of death from the given data.

**Answer:** The claim is partially correct based on available data. Charles Alden Black did die in 2005 at 86. However, there's no information about Arthur Sheekman's death in the table to confirm he died at 76.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**
   - Look for entries mentioning Charles Alden Black and Arthur Sheekman.
   - Found Shirley Temple's row (husband Charles) and Gloria Stuart's row (husband Arthur).

2. **Extract Death Details:**
   - Charles Alden Black died on August 4, 2005, aged86.
   - Gloria Stuart died on January 12, 1978, aged76; no details for her husband.

3. **Assess the Claim:**
   - Confirmed Charles's death details.
   - Insufficient data to confirm Arthur Sheekman's death or age.

**Final Answer:** The claim about Charles Alden Black is correct, but there's no information supporting that Arthur Sheekman died at 76.

2025-02-06 03:40:20,448 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To determine the correct production code for Episode 67, let's analyze the given data step by step.

1. **Identify the starting point**: Episode 46 has a production code of 58620.
2. **Determine the increment pattern**: Each subsequent episode increases the production code by 1.
3. **Calculate up to Episode 67**:
   - From Episode 46 (58620) to Episode 67, there are \(67 - 46 = 21\) episodes.
   - Therefore, the production code for Episode 67 should be \(58620 + 21 = 58641\).
4. **Compare with provided data**: The last listed episode (Episode 67) shows a production code of 58643, which is inconsistent with the calculated value.

**Conclusion**: Based on the increment pattern, Episode 67 should have the production code **58641**. However, there's an inconsistency in the provided data where it lists 58643. This suggests either a discrepancy in the data or additional episodes not accounted for in the sequence.

However, if we consider external knowledge where the national median is typically higher than New Mexico's, the answer would be:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Data Points:**
   - Look for "New Mexico" and "United State" in the dataset.

2. **Extract Median Household Incomes:**
   - New Mexico: $18,315
   - United States (from external knowledge): Typically higher than state medians, e.g., around $60,000.

3. **Compare the Two Values:**
   - Since $18,315 < $60,000, New Mexico's median is lower.

**Answer:** The claim is true based on external knowledge; however, with the provided data alone, it cannot be confirmed.

But strictly using the given dataset without external information:

The claim cannot be verified as the US median income isn't listed.

**Answer:**

FALSE

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understanding the Claim:** The statement compares New Mexico's median household income to that of the entire U.S., requiring both figures.
2. **Analyzing the Table:** The table lists counties in New Mexico with columns like Population, Households, Median Age, Education, and Income, but no national figure is present.
3. **Identifying Relevant Data:** Without a row for the state of New Mexico or the U.S. as a whole, there's no way to extract the necessary comparison figures.
4. **Conclusion:** The data provided doesn't allow verification of the claim, so it cannot be fully supported.

**Final Answer:**

FALSE

No relevant cells are present in the table to support this claim, as the required state and national median household incomes are not listed.

2025-02-06 04:53:19,500 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To solve this problem, we need to determine which week had the highest attendance at a series of events. Each event is recorded with its respective date and attendance figures. The goal is to identify the week number corresponding to the event with the maximum attendance.

### Approach
1. **Data Analysis**: We start by examining the data structure. Each entry in the dataset includes the week number, date, and attendance count.
2. **Identify Maximum Attendance**: We iterate through each entry to find the one with the highest attendance value.
3. **Extract Week Number**: Once we identify the entry with the maximum attendance, we extract its corresponding week number.

### Solution Code
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data representing weeks and their respective attendances
data = [
    [1, 'August 19', 25436],
    [1, 'August 26', 28579],
    [2, 'September 2', 31017],
    [3, 'September 9', 35421],
    [4, 'September 16', 32198],
    [5, 'September 23', 37125],
    [6, 'September 30', 29410],
    [7, 'October 7', 34589],
    [8, 'October 14', 36730],
    [9, 'October 21', 40054],
    [10, 'October 28', 38925],
    [11, 'November 4', 31200]
]

# Convert the data into a DataFrame for easier manipulation
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Week', 'Date', 'Attendance'])

# Find the row with the maximum attendance value
max_attendance_row = df[df['Attendance'] == df['Attendance'].max()]

# Extract the week number from that row
highest_week = max_attendance_row['Week'].values[0]

print(highest_week)
```

### Explanation
1. **Data Preparation**: The data is structured as a list of lists, where each sublist contains the week number, date, and attendance for an event.
2. **DataFrame Conversion**: Using pandas, we convert this list into a DataFrame for easier manipulation. This allows us to use built-in functions for finding maximum values efficiently.
3. **Finding Maximum Attendance**: By using the `max()` function on the 'Attendance' column, we determine the highest attendance value in the dataset.
4. **Extracting Week Number**: After identifying the row with the maximum attendance, we extract and print the corresponding week number.

This approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the week with the highest event attendance using pandas for data manipulation.

2025-02-06 04:56:18,999 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim states that Hawthorn have the highest score among all away teams in the season. Based on the given data from July 7, 1979, which includes multiple games:

- Away teams and their scores:
  - Footscray: 50 points
  - Melbourne: 76 points
  - Hawthorn: 74 points
  - Geelong: 100 points
  - Collingwood: 101 points
  - Fitzroy: 65 points

Collingwood achieved the highest score of 101 points as an away team. Since Hawthorn's score (74) is not the highest, the claim is false.

**Answer:** The claim is false; Collingwood had a higher score than Hawthorn in that round.

   - Upon examining all rows, only "sky calcio 6" (row index 17) lists both "calcio" and "sport news" as its content.

3. **Assess Other Services:** Confirm whether any other service besides "sky calcio 6" offers sport news.
   - All other services, including "sky calcio 12," only list "calcio" without mentioning sport news.

4. **Conclusion:** Since "sky calcio 6" is the sole service offering sport news in addition to calcio, the claim that "sky calcio 12" is the only one with sport news content is incorrect.

**Answer:** False

2025-02-06 06:13:31,688 - WARNING - Error parsing response: 'bool' object has no attribute 'upper'. Raw response: <think>
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table and a claim, and I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.

The claim states: "more television service have hdtv than those that don't." So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that shows whether more TV services are offering HDTV compared to those that aren't.

Looking at the table provided, it has several columns. Let me identify which ones might be relevant. The columns are:

1. Index
2. Title
3. Genre
4. Rating
5. HDtv

Since the claim is about HDtv, I should focus on the 'HDtv' column to see how many services have HDTV enabled and how many don't.

Now, examining each row in the table. Each entry under the 'HDtv' column indicates whether a particular service offers HDTV or not. The entries are either "yes" or "no."

I'll go through each row and count the number of "yes" and "no" responses in the HDtv column.

Starting from row 0:
- Row 0: yes
- Row 1: no (this is a promotional message, but still counts as 'no' for HDtv)
- Row 2: yes
- Row 3: no
- Row 4: yes
- Row 5: no
- Row 6: yes
- Row 7: no
- Row 8: yes
- Row 9: no
- Row 10: yes
- Row 11: no
- Row 12: yes
- Row 13: no
- Row 14: yes
- Row 15: no
- Row 16: yes
- Row 17: no
- Row 18: yes

Wait, that's 19 rows in total. Let me recount to ensure I didn't miss any.

Actually, looking back, there are more rows than that. The table seems to have multiple entries for "sky calcio" with different numbers and the promotional messages interleaved.

Let me count each row properly:

Rows with 'HDtv' as 'yes':
- Sky Calcio 1: yes
- Sky Calcio 2: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 3: yes
- Sky Calcio 4: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 5: yes
- Sky Calcio 6: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 7: yes
- Sky Calcio 8: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 9: yes
- Sky Calcio 10: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 11: yes
- Sky Calcio 12: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 13: yes
- Sky Calcio 14: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 15: yes
- Sky Calcio 16: no (promo)
- Sky Calcio 17: yes

Wait, that doesn't seem right. I think I need to recount each row accurately.

Looking again:

Row indices from 0 onwards:

Row 0: HDtv = yes
Row 1: HDtv = no
Row 2: yes
Row 3: no
Row 4: yes
Row 5: no
Row 6: yes
Row 7: no
Row 8: yes
Row 9: no
Row 10: yes
Row 11: no
Row 12: yes
Row 13: no
Row 14: yes
Row 15: no
Row 16: yes
Row 17: no
Row 18: yes

Wait, that's 19 rows. Let me count the number of 'yes' and 'no':

Yes:
Rows 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 → That's 10 times.

No:
Rows 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 → Wait, row 17 is the last 'no' before row 18. Let me check:

From row 0 to row 18 (total of 19 rows), how many are 'yes'? 

Looking at each even index: 0,2,4,... up to 18 → that's 10 entries.

Odd indices: 1,3,5... up to 17 → 9 entries.

Wait, row 18 is index 18 (even), so total 'yes' are 10, and 'no' are 9. So yes, more services have HDtv than those that don't.

But wait, let me recount because sometimes it's easy to miscount:

Total rows: 19

Number of 'yes':
Looking at each row:

Row 0: yes
Row 2: yes
Row 4: yes
Row 6: yes
Row 8: yes
Row 10: yes
Row 12: yes
Row 14: yes
Row 16: yes
Row 18: yes

That's 10 'yes' responses.

Number of 'no':
Row 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 → that's 9 'no' responses.

So indeed, there are more services with HDtv than without. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.
</think>

The claim "more television service have hdtv than those that don't" is TRUE based on the data provided. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The 'HDtv' column indicates whether a service offers HDTV (yes/no).
2. **Count Responses:**
   - 'Yes': 10 instances
   - 'No': 9 instances
3. **Compare Counts:** Since there are more 'yes' than 'no', the claim holds.

**Answer:**

The claim is TRUE. More television services offer HDTV than those that do not.

{
  "answer": true,
  "reasoning": "Based on the table, there are more entries with 'HDtv' marked as 'yes' (10) compared to 'no' (9)."

2025-02-06 06:28:10,462 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim is false because only about 28.57% of the total goals came from World Cup or qualifier matches.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Matches:** We need to consider matches categorized as either "2002 world cup" or "2002 world cup qualifier."

2. **Calculate Total Goals in All Matches:**
   - Row 0: 1
   - Row 1: 6 + 2 = 8
   - Row 2: 8 + 2 = 10
   - Row 3: 2 + 2 = 4 (Qualifier)
   - Row 4: 3 + 0 = 3
   - Row 5: 1 + 5 = 6 (Qualifier)
   - Row 6:7 + 0 = 7
   - Row 7:4 + 0 = 4 (World Cup)
   - Row 8:2 + 2 = 4
   - Row 9:1 + 1 = 2
   - **Total Goals:** 1 + 8 + 10 + 4 + 3 + 6 +7 +4 +4 +2 = 49

3. **Calculate Goals from Relevant Matches:**
   - Row 3 (Qualifier): 4
   - Row 5 (Qualifier):6
   - Row7 (World Cup):4
   - **Total Goals:** 4 + 6 +4=14

4. **Compare to Half of Total Goals:**
   - Half of 49 is 24.5.
   - 14 < 24.5, so goals from relevant matches are less than half.

**Answer:** The claim is false.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim "carsten jancker score all of his goal in dreisamstadion, freiburg" is true or false based on the provided table. 

First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim suggests that Carsten Jancker scored all of his goals at a specific venue: Dreisamstadion in Freiburg. So, I have to check if every goal he scored was indeed at this venue.

Looking at the table, there are multiple rows with matches at "dreisamstadion  , freiburg". Let me go through each row and see where the goals were scored.

Row 1 (index 0): Date June 3, 2000. Venue is not Freiburg; it's Nuremberg. So no goal here relevant to the claim.

Row 2 (index 1) and Row 3 (index 2): Both are on June 7, 2000 at Freiburg. The scores show 6-2 and then 8-2. Assuming these are cumulative scores, it's possible that multiple goals were scored in each match.

Row 4 (index 3) is a World Cup qualifier in Helsinki. So no goals here from Jancker if he played here.

Row 5 (index 4): August 15, 2001 at Budapest. Another venue outside Freiburg.

Row 6 (index 5): September 1, 2001 at Munich's Olympiastadion. Not relevant.

Row 7 (index 6): May 9, 2002 back to Freiburg with a score of 7-0. This could indicate multiple goals scored here.

Rows 8, 9, and 10: These are in Sapporo Dome, Sofia, and Sarajevo respectively. So no Freiburg venues beyond index 6.

Now, I need to see if all the goals Jancker scored were at Freiburg's Dreisamstadion. But wait, looking at the 'score' column:

Row 2: score is 6-2; Row 3: same as above but in a different row? Maybe duplicate entries or perhaps an error.

Assuming that the scores are for each match, and Jancker could have scored multiple goals across these games. However, without knowing how many goals he scored overall, it's impossible to confirm if all of them were at Freiburg.

But wait, looking closer: The claim is about "all of his goals" in that venue. So even if he scored just once elsewhere, the claim would be false. However, the table doesn't provide individual player statistics, only team scores and results. Therefore, we don't have data on how many goals Jancker personally scored in each match.

Given this lack of specific data about Carsten Jancker's goal contributions, I can't verify if all his goals were at Freiburg. But wait, maybe the claim is suggesting that every time he scored, it was there. If any of his goals were scored elsewhere, then the claim is false.

Looking again: The matches outside Freiburg (rows 0,4,5,6) – in those games, if Jancker played and scored, then the claim would be false. But without individual data, we can't confirm or deny this.

But considering that in row 7 (index 6), the score is 7-0 at Freiburg, which might imply multiple goals. However, without knowing who scored them, I can't attribute them to Jancker specifically.

Wait, perhaps looking for any instance where a match outside Freiburg has a goal by Jancker. But since there's no data on individual scorers, the claim cannot be confirmed as TRUE because we don't have evidence that all his goals were at Freiburg. Alternatively, maybe he didn't play in other venues, but we can't tell from this table.

Wait, another approach: The claim says "all of his goal" (assuming plural), so perhaps Jancker scored multiple times only in Freiburg. But without data on each goal's location, it's impossible to confirm.

Alternatively, if the table is about matches where Germany played, and Carsten Jancker was a German striker who might have been involved in these games. For instance, the 2002 World Cup match (row 8) had a score of 4-0 for Germany in Sapporo Dome. If Jancker scored there, then the claim would be false because that's not Freiburg.

But without knowing if he actually scored in that game or others outside Freiburg, we can't confirm. However, since the table includes matches where Germany played at other venues and didn't lose (like 4-0), it's possible Jancker could have scored elsewhere.

Given that, I think the claim might be false because there are matches outside Freiburg where he might have scored, but without specific data on his goals in each match, we can't be certain. However, given the structure of the table and the presence of multiple venues, it's more likely that the claim is FALSE.

So, to determine this, I need to look at all rows where the venue isn't Freiburg and see if any have goals that could be attributed to Jancker. But since we don't have individual goal data, perhaps the safest conclusion is that there are matches outside Freiburg where he might have scored, making the claim FALSE.

Therefore, the answer should be "FALSE", and the relevant cells would include all rows where the venue isn't Freiburg, as these could potentially show goals scored elsewhere.
</think>

The claim states that Carsten Jancker scored all his goals at Dreisamstadion in Freiburg. However, the table includes matches at other venues such as Nuremberg, Helsinki, Budapest, Munich, Sapporo, Sofia, and Sarajevo. Since there's no data on individual scorers, we can't confirm that Jancker didn't score elsewhere. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.

2025-02-06 06:34:34,428 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The majority of goals do not come from World Cup (WC) or qualifier matches. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Total Goals Calculation:**
   - Sum all goals across all games listed in the rows:
     - Row0:5
     - Row1:10
     - Row2:10
     - Row3:4
     - Row4:7
     - Row5:6
     - Row6:7
     - Row7:8
     - Row8:4
     - Row9:2
   - Total goals = 5 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 4 + 2 = **63**

2. **Goals from WC and Qualifiers:**
   - Identify rows corresponding to WC or qualifiers:
     - Row3 (Qualifier):4
     - Row5 (Qualifier):6
     - Row7 (WC Match):8
   - Total goals from these games = 4 + 6 + 8 = **18**

3. **Comparison:**
   - Goals from WC/Qualifiers:18
   - Remaining goals:63 - 18 = 45

Since 18 is less than half of 63, the majority of goals are not from World Cup or qualifier matches.

**Answer:** No, the majority of goals do not come from World Cup or qualifier games. Only **28.57%** (approximately) of the total goals are from these competitions.

2025-02-06 06:42:23,601 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To determine if Carsten's team scored a total of 2 points across two separate games, we need to clarify the meaning of "score" and "result." Assuming standard football scoring:

- A win grants 3 points.
- A draw grants 1 point per game.
- A loss grants 0 points.

If Carsten's team earned 2 points in total across two games, this would imply they drew both matches (1 point each), resulting in a combined total of 2 points. However, without knowing the exact meaning of "score" and "result," this assumption may not be accurate. Further clarification on these terms is needed for an precise answer.

**Answer:**

Assuming standard football scoring where draws earn 1 point each, Carsten's team would have earned 2 points by drawing two separate games. Therefore, they scored a total of 2 points across those two matches.

Twice the total for Ohio would be 12,386, which is higher than Kentucky's total. Additionally, comparing individual enrollments shows some Kentucky schools have lower enrollments than Ohio ones.

**Answer:** No, the enrollments of Kentucky institutions are not twice those of Ohio institutions based on the provided data.

2025-02-06 06:59:29,457 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The task was to determine if institutions in Kentucky have approximately twice the enrollment of those in Ohio. After calculating the total enrollments:

- **Kentucky Total Enrollment:** 11,000 (approximately)
- **Ohio Total Enrollment:** 6,193

To check if Kentucky's total is about twice Ohio's:  
6,193 * 2 = 12,386  
Since 11,000 < 12,386, the claim that Kentucky institutions have twice the enrollment of Ohio ones is **false**.

Answer: No, Kentucky institutions do not have approximately twice the enrollment of Ohio institutions.

2025-02-06 07:27:01,671 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: In examining the attendance figures for baseball games in 2022, we analyzed the attendances of day games (12:00 PM) and night games (7:00 PM or 3:30 PM) across various dates. The goal was to verify if all day games had lower attendances than their corresponding night games except for a notable exception at the Florida venue.

### Key Findings:
1. **Florida Game Exception**:  
   - On September 11, the game held in Florida at 12:00 PM drew an attendance of 38,472. This figure was higher than some evening games on the same day, making it the exception where a day game outperformed night games in terms of attendance.

2. **Other Day Games**:  
   - On the same date (September 11), two additional day games were held at 12:00 PM with attendances of 30,807 and 37,359 respectively. These figures were lower compared to evening games on that day.

3. **Night Games Performance**:  
   - Evening games, particularly the one on September 10 at 7:00 PM, had a higher attendance of 50,469. Another night game on September 11 at 7:00 PM recorded an attendance of 27,500, which was still higher than most day games except for the Florida exception.

### Conclusion:
The analysis confirms that in 2022, all day games had lower attendances than their corresponding night games, with the sole exception being the game held in Florida. This exception highlights unique factors such as venue location or local interest contributing to higher attendance despite the daytime timing.

- **epsilon euskadi** appears in two rows (2009 Eurocup and 2009 West European Cup), each with 1 win, totaling 2 wins.
- **international dracoracing** appears once with 1 win.

Thus, only **international dracoracing** has exactly one win. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.

**Answer:** The claim is true; only a single team (international dracoracing) has exactly one win across all races.

2025-02-06 08:04:22,742 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The task was to determine if any judge served as chief justice for more than one year based on the provided data. The analysis identified Federico Hernández Denton as the only chief justice in the dataset, appointed in 2004 with "0 years until mandatory retirement." Despite uncertainty about the exact meaning of "years until mandatory retirement," it is reasonable to infer that his tenure exceeds a year given the appointment date and typical judicial terms. Therefore, the claim that no judge served as chief justice for more than a year is false.

**Answer:**  
The claim is false because Federico Hernández Denton has been serving as chief justice since 2004, which is well beyond one year.

But honestly, without knowing participation counts, it's impossible. Maybe the user expects a different reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the table shows each driver only once except for Stan Jones who appears twice, making it 8 unique winners over 9 races. So if a driver won one race and lost all others they participated in, then yes, multiple losses. But since there are 8 unique winners, that implies at least 8 drivers have one win and possibly 1 loss each (if they only raced once). Therefore, the claim might not hold.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. I think the answer expected is FALSE because the information isn't sufficient to confirm the claim.

**Final Answer:** \boxed{\text{FALSE}}

2025-02-06 08:08:20,703 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: The claim states that "1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortuño," which can be interpreted as whether at least one judge was appointed by him. Since there are six instances where judges were appointed by Luis Fortuño, the answer is TRUE.

However, if the claim is meant to imply exactly one judge, then it would be FALSE because multiple were appointed. Given the wording, it's safer to interpret "1 of" as at least one, making the claim TRUE.

**Answer:**

The claim is TRUE because there are judges who were appointed by Luis Fortuño, satisfying the condition that at least one was appointed.

The sole row with Class 'pg' (row1) shows that these locomotives were withdrawn between 1958-1963, which suggests they are no longer in operation and thus unlikely to be part of UTA.

**Answer:** False

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Locate rows where 'Class' is 'pg' and 'Type' is '0-6-0'.
   - Found in row1: Class 'pg', Type '0-6-0'.

2. **Check Incorporation into UTA**:
   - No data indicates these locomotives are part of UTA.
   - Withdrawn dates (1958-1963) suggest they were retired before UTA's establishment.

Conclusion: The claim is false as the data shows no incorporation into UTA.

2025-02-06 08:33:52,041 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: No, there is no game against the White Sox with an attendance of less than 1000 in the given data.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Relevant Games:** Look through each row to find games where the opponent is "White Sox."

2. **Extract Attendance Figures:** For each identified game, note the attendance numbers.

3. **Compare with Threshold:** Check if any of these attendances are below 1000.

4. **Conclusion:** Since all recorded attendances (e.g., 13413, 13004) for White Sox games exceed 1000, the answer is no.

**Answer:** No

2025-02-06 08:45:14,940 - WARNING - Attempting fallback parsing on: To address the claim about the attendance at a game against the White Sox and determine if it was the least attended, we need to analyze the provided data. However, upon reviewing the JSON structure:

1. **Data Review**: Each entry under "data" represents a game with details including the date, home team, away team, scores, innings, and attendance.
2. **Opponent Check**: The "away_team" field in each game's data is checked to identify opponents.
3. **White Sox Presence**: None of the games list "White Sox" as an opponent.

**Conclusion**: Since there are no games against the White Sox recorded in the dataset, it's impossible to verify the claim regarding attendance for such a game. Therefore, based on the provided data, we cannot determine if a game against the White Sox was the least attended because no such game exists in this dataset.

Answer: There is no game against the White Sox in the provided data; thus, the claim about their game being the least attended cannot be verified here.
