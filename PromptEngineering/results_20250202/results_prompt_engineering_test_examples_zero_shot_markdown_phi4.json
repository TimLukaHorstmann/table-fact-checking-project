However, neither has played in the super cup (as their super cup column is 0).\n\nGiven these points:\n- Jonathan Legear indeed scores 4 more goals than Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez.\n- There is no other player with a higher total who also participated in the Belgian Cup (super cup) besides Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez.\n\nThus, the claim holds true based on the table's data.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells:\n\n1. Jonathan Legear's \"total\": row 5, column \"total\"\n2.

To verify this, we need to check if there are entries for the years 2001, 2009, and 2012 where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Check Year 2001:**\n   - Look through the table for any entry with the year \"2001\" in the `date` column.\n   - The entries are:\n     - Row 3: Date is \"3 september 2000\"\n     - Row 4: Date is \"12 may 2002\"\n   - There are no entries for the year 2001.\n\n2. **Check Year 2009:**\n   - Look through the table for any entry with the year \"2009\" in the `date` column.\n   - The entries are:\n     - Row 9: Date is \"28 march 2007\"\n     - Row 10: Date is \"10 september 2008\"\n   - There are no entries for the year 2009.\n\n3. **Check Year 2012:**\n   - Look through the table for any entry with the year \"2012\" in the `date` column.\n   - The only entry after 2011 is:\n     - Row 12: Date is \"12 june 2011\"\n   - There are no entries for the year 2012.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are no entries for the years 2001, 2009, or 2012 in the table, Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not have any recorded scores during these years according to this data. Therefore, he remained scoreless in international competitions for these years as per the information available.\n\nThus, the claim is **FALSE** because there are no entries showing that he scored in those specific years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThe `relevant_cells` list is empty because we did not find any relevant data for the years specified in the claim.",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to evaluate the attendance figures for each game listed in the table and identify which game has the highest attendance.\n\nThe relevant column from the table is \"location attendance,\" as it contains the attendance numbers for each game.\n\nLet's extract and compare these numbers:\n\n1. Game against Houston (Row 0): Attendance = 18422\n2. Game against Sacramento (Row 1): Attendance = 18422\n3. Game against Dallas (Row 2): Attendance = 20301\n4. Game against New Orleans (Row 3): Attendance = 17781\n5. Game against Memphis (Row 4): Attendance = 15908\n6. Game against Minnesota (Row 5): Attendance = 18478\n7. Game against Memphis (Row 6): Attendance = 18422\n8. Game against Golden State (Row 7): Attendance is not specified numerically.\n\nFrom the data, the highest attendance is 20301 for the game against Dallas on April 5th.\n\nThe claim states that \"the game against New Orleans have the highest attendance,\" with an attendance of 17781, which is lower than the highest recorded attendance of 20301. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verifying this are those in the \"location attendance\" column where the numbers are provided:\n\n- Row 0: Attendance = 18422\n- Row 1: Attendance = 18422\n- Row 2: Attendance = 20301 (highest)\n- Row 3: Attendance = 17781 (New Orleans)\n- Row 4: Attendance = 15908\n- Row 5: Attendance = 18478\n- Row 6: Attendance = 18422\n\nHere is the JSON object with the answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
