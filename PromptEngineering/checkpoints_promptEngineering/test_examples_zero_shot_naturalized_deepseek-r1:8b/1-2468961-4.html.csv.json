The claim says, \"the title of the 56th episode in the series be sister act.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the table is structured. Each row represents an episode with details like no in series, no in season, title, director, writer, etc. So, each row corresponds to a specific episode number.\n\nThe key here is to find the 56th episode and check its title. The episodes are numbered from 1 to 22 based on \"no in series,\" which seems to be the primary identifier. So, I'm looking for a row where \"no in series\" is 56.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: no in series 47\nRow 2: no in series 48\n...\nContinuing this way, Row 10: no in series 56\n\nSo, the 56th episode is Row 10.

The episode's title is \"The Apartment.\"\n2. It was written by Julia Newton.\n3. It corresponds to series number 48.\n\nFirst, I should look for episodes where the writer is Julia Newton. Scanning through each row, I see that in Row 2, the writer is Julia Newton. Let me check the details of Row 2:\n- Title: The Apartment\n- Written by: Julia Newton\n\nThat matches both conditions 1 and 2. Now, checking the series number for this episode.

The claim is: \"howard adler robert griffard write the episode that originally aired april 29, 1994.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions two people: Howard Adler and Robert Griffard. The claim says they wrote an episode that originally aired on April 29, 1994.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different episode with details like title, director, writers, original air date, etc. I need to find if there's any row where both Howard Adler and Robert Griffard are listed as writers for an episode that aired on April 29, 1994.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Written by Bob Rosenfarb.\n- Row 2: Julia Newton.\n- Row 3: Brian Bird & John Wierick.\n- Row 4: Richard P Halke.\n- Row 5: Meredith Siler.\n- Row 6: Howard Adler & Robert Griffard.

Hmm, that doesn't match the claim.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. No, in the first row, written by is Bob Rosenfarb. So the episode was directed by Richard Correll and written by Bob Rosenfarb. But the claim says it's written by Julia Newton.\n\nSo that doesn't match. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because while series 47 does have an episode titled 'way - off broadway', it wasn't written by Julia Newton but rather Bob Rosenfarb.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there isn't another row for series 47.

Let me start by understanding the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"the production code for feel forty that debut after october 1 , 1993 be 455451.0\"\n\nWait, there's a typo in the title of the claim. It should probably be \"Feel Forty\" instead of \"feel forty\". I'll keep that in mind but proceed with the correct spelling.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what part of the table is relevant. The claim mentions \"production code for Feel Forty.\" Looking at the table, each row has a 'title' column and a 'production code' column. So I should look for the row where the title is \"Feel Forty.\"\n\nNow, I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: title is \"Way - off Broadway\"\nRow 2: \"The Apartment\"\nRow 3: \"Never on Sunday\"\nRow 4: \"Paper Chase\"\nRow 5: \"Trading Places\"\nRow 6: \"Video Mania\"\nRow 7: \"Hog Wild\"\nRow 8: \"Down and Out in Port Washington\"\nRow 9: \"The Marrying Dude\"\nRow 10: \"Sister Act\"\nRow 11: \"Christmas Story\"\nRow 12: \"Close Encounters of the Marital Kind\"\nRow 13: \"Bad Girls\"\nRow 14: \"Read All About It\"\nRow 15: \"Thirteen with a Bullet\"\nRow 16: \"My Bodyguard\"\nRow 17: \"Pretty Woman\"\nRow 18: \"Nightmare Weekend\"\nRow 19: \"Birth of a Salesman\"\nRow 20: \"Feel Forty\"\nAh, here it is. Row 20 has the title \"Feel Forty.\" So that's the relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check the production code for this row. Looking at row 20, the 'production code' is listed as 445471. The claim says it should be 455451.0. Wait a minute, these are different numbers: 445471 vs. 455451. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that the production code debut was after October 1, 1993. Looking at row 20, the 'original air date' is March 25, 1994. That's after October 1, 1993, so that part of the claim seems correct.\n\nHowever, the production code doesn't match. The table shows 445471 for \"Feel Forty,\" but the claim states it should be 455451.0. This mismatch suggests the claim is incorrect because the production codes don't align.\n\nI should also check if there's another row with \"Feel Forty.\" Scanning through again, I only see row 20 as having that title. So no other rows are relevant here.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is false because the production code for \"Feel Forty\" doesn't match what's stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"production code\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim in question is: \"maria a brown write the episode great expectation.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It seems like it's claiming that Maria A Brown was involved in writing an episode titled \"Great Expectations.\" However, looking at the table provided, I notice a typo. The title of one of the episodes is listed as \"great expectations,\" with the word 'great' lowercase and 'expectations' also lowercase. This might be significant because names are typically capitalized in such contexts.\n\nNext, I need to check each row of the table to see if any episode was written by Maria A Brown and titled \"Great Expectations.\" The table has 22 rows, each representing an episode with details like the director, writer, title, original air date, etc. My focus will be on two columns: \"written_by\" and \"title.\"\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find a match where the writer is Maria A Brown and the title matches the claim, considering the capitalization. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Writer is Bob Rosenfarb, not Maria A Brown.\nRow 2: Julia Newton, no.\nRow 3: Brian Bird & John Wierick, no.\nRow 4: Richard P Halke, no.\nRow 5: Meredith Siler, no.\nRow 6: Howard Adler & Robert Griffard, no.\nRow 7: Julia Newton again, not Maria A Brown.\nRow 8: Maria A Brown is the writer here, but the title is \"down and out in port washington,\" which doesn't match \"Great Expectations.\"\nRow 9: Howard Adler & Robert Griffard, no.\nRow 10: Rj Colleary, no.\nRow 11: Brian Bird & John Wierick, no.\nRow 12: Bob Rosenfarb, no.\nRow 13: Maria A Brown is the writer here as well.

The title here is \"nightmare weekend,\" which doesn't match.\nRow 19: Julia Newton, no.\nRow 20: Rj Colleary, no.\nRow 21: Howard Adler & Robert Griffard, no.\nRow 22: Brian Bird & John Wierick, no.\n\nFrom this scan, I notice that Maria A Brown is indeed a writer in some episodes, but none of the episodes she wrote are titled \"Great Expectations.\" The closest match is Row 8 and Row 18, both with titles that don't align with the claim. Additionally, the correct title in the table is listed as lowercase, which might indicate it's an error or perhaps a different episode.\n\nMoreover, the claim uses \"great expectation\" without capitalizing \"Great,\" whereas the table has \"great expectations.\" This discrepancy suggests there might be a typo or confusion in the claim. If the title in the table was correctly intended to be \"Great Expectations,\" then no such episode exists as written by Maria A Brown.\n\nTherefore, considering both the absence of Maria A Brown writing an episode titled \"Great Expectations\" and the possible capitalization issue, the claim appears to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"maria a brown write the episode great expectation\" is not supported by the table. After carefully reviewing each row, there is no episode written by Maria A Brown with the title \"great expectations.\" The closest related information involves her writing other episodes like \"down and out in port washington,\" but none match the specific claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"written_by\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"written_by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the title of series number 56 be the case of the miss diary.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's saying that for series number 56, the title should be \"The Case of the Missing Diary.\" But looking at the table, each row represents a different episode with various details like the production code and other attributes.\n\nI'll start by locating series number 56 in the table. The table has 22 rows, each corresponding to a specific series number. Scanning through the list:\n\nRow 1: no in series:47\n...\nRow 11: no in series:57\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, looking at row numbering: Row 1 is series 47, so Row n corresponds to series number n+46? Or perhaps each row is a separate series within the season. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nLooking back, the table seems to list multiple episodes from what looks like a TV series, possibly in different seasons. Each row has attributes like 'no in series' which might indicate the episode number or some other identifier. The key columns here are:\n\n- no in series: This seems to be an identifier for each episode.\n- title: The name of the episode.\n- directed by, written by, etc.\n\nSo, the first step is to find row 56 in the table. But looking through the rows, the highest series number listed is 66 (Row 20: no in series:66). So perhaps I need to check if there's a row where 'no in series' is 56.\n\nWait, actually, each row seems to have unique values for 'no in series', starting from 47 up to 66. So, the rows go from series number 47 to 66. Therefore, series 56 would be somewhere in between.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: no in series:47\n...\nRow 10: no in series:56\n\nWait, let me count properly. Each row increments 'no in series' by 1. So, Row 1 is 47, Row 2 is 48, and so on until Row 20 is 66. Therefore, series number 56 would be in Row (56 - 47) +1? Wait, no. Actually, each row's 'no in series' is the same as the row index plus 46 because Row 1:47=1+46. So yes, series number n is at row (n-46). Therefore:\n\nseries 47: row 1\nseries 48: row2\n...\nseries 56: row10\n\nWait, let me calculate that again. If row_index starts at 0 or 1? The first row is labeled as row 0 in the example JSON, but looking back, the user provided rows starting from row 0 as an example, but in the actual table, the rows are numbered from 1 to 22.\n\nWait, no. In the provided table, each row has \"no in series\" values from 47 up to 66, so perhaps each 'no in series' is the same as the row number (assuming rows start at 1). So row 1:47, row2:48,... row20:66.\n\nSo series 56 would be in row 56-47+1=10. Therefore, it's row 10.\n\nNow, looking at row 10:\n\ntitle is \"birth of a salesman\"\n\nSo the title for series number 56 is \"birth of a salesman,\" not \"the case of the missing diary.\" \n\nTherefore, the claim that the title should be \"the case of the miss diary\" is incorrect. So the answer would be FALSE.\n\nBut I need to make sure I'm checking the correct cells. The relevant columns are 'title' and 'no in series'. For series number 56, which is row10, the column 'title' has the value \"birth of a salesman.\"\n\nThus, the claim refers to a wrong title for series 56.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that the title of series number 56 is \"the case of the missing diary.\" However, upon examining the table, the actual title for series 56 (located in row 10) is \"birth of a salesman.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Series Number**: The claim refers to series number 56.\n2. **Locate Row in Table**: Each 'no in series' value corresponds directly to each row. Since 'no in series' starts at 47 and increments by 1 per row, series 56 is found in row (56 - 47) + 1 = row 10.\n3. **Check Title for Series 56**: In row 10, the title is listed as \"birth of a salesman,\" not \"the case of the missing diary.\"\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim does not match the actual data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
