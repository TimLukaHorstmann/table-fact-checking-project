The writers here include Jeff Astrof, but Matt Goldman isn't mentioned. So this doesn't fit.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Series 69, Season 2, Title: Burning Love, Writers: Sherry Bilsing-Graham & Ellen Kreamer.

Wait, looking back, the user's table only goes up to row 20, but in my analysis above, I might have miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, upon reviewing, the table provided has 20 rows, so series numbers go from 68 to 87 across 20 episodes. So when I was going through each row, I think I missed that there are two \"Scream\" episodes. Wait no, actually, in the table, I see only one \"Scream\" title at series 86? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- **Row 19**: Series 87, Season 20, Title: Scream, Writers: Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman.\n\nYes, that's the correct row. So in the table, only one episode titled \"Scream\" is written by both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman, which is series 86? Wait no, let me check the exact numbering.\n\nWait, actually:\n\n- Row 19 (series 87) has title \"Scream\" with writers Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman.\n\nSo that's the only episode where both are listed as writers and the title is \"scream.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists an episode written by both Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman named \"scream.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one episode in the table.

Let me start by reading the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the incredible writer who gains 5.56 million viewers be none other than jack burditt.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think it's saying that the writer who achieved 5.56 million viewers is Jack Burditt. So, I need to check if there's a row where the us viewers (millions) column equals 5.56 and the written by field is Jack Burditt.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific episode with details like series number, season, title, writers, original air date, and US viewers in millions.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find a match for both 5.56 million viewers and Jack Burditt as the writer.\n\nStarting from Row 1: us viewers are 7.17, not 5.56. Row 2: 6.65, nope. Row3: 6.86, no. Row4: 6.99, still no. Row5: 6.58, close but not 5.56. Row6: 6.68, no. Row7: 7.19, nope. Row8:7.27, no. Row9:7.01, no. Row10:7.49, no.\n\nRow11:7.64, nope.

So, the writer is Frank Pines, not Jack Burditt.\n\nWait, so the us viewers are correct at 5.56, but the writer isn't Jack Burditt. Therefore, the claim that the incredible writer who gains 5.56 million viewers is none other than Jack Burditt is FALSE because the actual writer for that episode was Frank Pines.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the episode with 5.56 million viewers was written by Frank Pines, not Jack Burditt.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"written by\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Amy Iglow write the episode nut and it gain 6 million viewer.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two main things: Amy Iglow wrote an episode titled \"nut\" and that this episode gained 6 million viewers. So, I'll need to check both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized with rows numbered from 1 to 20. Each row has several columns: series, season, title, written by, original air date, and US viewers in millions. My goal is to find if there's an episode written by Amy Iglow titled \"nut\" that had 6 million viewers.\n\nI'll start by checking each row for the presence of \"Amy Iglow\" in the \"written by\" column. Let me go through the table one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Written by Kari Lizer & Jeff Astrof\n- Row 2: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Kreamer\n- Row 3: Jack Burditt\n- Row 4: Allan Rice\n- Row 5: Frank Pines\n- Row 6: Matt Goldman\n- Row 7: Amy Iglow\n- Row 8: Jeff Astrof\n- Row 9: Jack Burditt\n- Row 10: Frank Pines\n- Row 11: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Kreamer\n- Row 12: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Kreamer\n- Row 13: Jack Burditt\n- Row 14: Jeff Astrof\n- Row 15: Frank Pines\n- Row 16: Amy Iglow & Allan Rice\n- Row 17: Sherry Bilsing - Graham & Ellen Kreamer\n- Row 18: Tricia O'Kelley & Alex Kapp Horner\n- Row 19: Jack Burditt\n- Row 20: Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman\n\nFrom this, Amy Iglow is mentioned in Row 7. Let me check what the episode is titled. Row 7's title is \"nuts,\" which is close to \"nut\" but pluralized. The claim uses \"nut\" singular, so I'm not sure if this counts as a match. Maybe it depends on how strict the matching is.\n\nNext, looking at the number of viewers for Row 7: It's 7.19 million. The claim states that the episode gained 6 million viewers. Since 7.19 isn't exactly 6 million, there seems to be a discrepancy here. So, even if \"nuts\" is considered as \"nut,\" the viewers count doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider whether \"Amy Iglow wrote the episode nut.\" The title in Row 7 is \"nuts,\" which might not be exactly \"nut.\" However, sometimes titles can have slight variations or plural forms. But the claim specifically says \"nut,\" singular. So perhaps it's not a direct match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed another row where Amy Iglow wrote an episode titled \"nut.\" Let me scan again quickly. No, only Row 7 has Amy Iglow as the writer, and that's \"nuts.\" There are no other rows with Amy Iglow in the written by column.\n\nSo, the first part of the claim may not be fully accurate because the title is plural, not singular. Additionally, the viewers for that episode are 7.19 million, which doesn't equal 6 million as stated.\n\nTherefore, even though Amy Iglow did write an episode (Row 7), the specifics of the episode title and viewer count don't align with the claim. So, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the episode by jeff astrof and allan rice be name scream and gain 6.29 million view.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions an episode written by Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice, titled \"scream,\" which received 6.29 million views.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different episode with details like series number, season, title, writers, original air date, and US viewers in millions.\n\nI need to check if there's an episode where:\n1. The writers are Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice.\n2. The title is \"scream.\"\n3. The US viewers figure matches 6.29 million.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 5: series 72, season 5, title \"doctor little man,\" writers Frank Pines. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 7: series 74, season 7, title \"nuts,\" writers Amy Iglow. No.\n\nRow 14: series 81, season 14, title \"a family unfair,\" writers Jeff Astrof. Doesn't have Allan Rice and the title isn't scream.\n\nWait, actually looking at Row 5 again: series 72, season 5, written by Frank Pines. Not relevant.\n\nThen, looking further down:\n\nRow 17: series 83, season 16, title \"subway, somehow,\" writers Amy Iglow & Allan Rice. Title doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I skipped some rows. Let me check row numbers more carefully.\n\nRows 1-20 are provided. So after row 14 (a family unfair), which is Jeff Astrof alone, let's see if any episode in the next rows matches both writers and title.\n\nLooking at Row 17: writers are Amy Iglow & Allan Rice, so not Jeff Astrof. Title is \"subway, somehow.\" Not scream.\n\nRow 18: Revenge makeover, writers Tricia O'kelley & Alex Kapp Horner. No.\n\nRow 19: I love what you do for me, Jack Burditt. No.\n\nRow 20: Scream, written by Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman. Oh, here's an episode titled \"scream\" with Jeff Astrof as a writer, but not Allan Rice. So that doesn't match the claim which says both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice wrote it.\n\nSo in row 20, the writers are Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman, not Allan Rice. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because while there's an episode titled \"scream\" written by Jeff Astrof, it's co-written with Matt Goldman, not Allan Rice. The viewers for this episode (6.29 million) does match, but since the writers don't include both Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice, the claim is false.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Row 20: series 77, season 10, title \"scream,\" written by Jeff Astrof & Matt Goldman. So not with Allan Rice. Therefore, the claim that it's written by Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other row matches both writers and title. Let's scan:\n\nLooking at Row 7: nuts, Amy Iglow alone. No.\n\nRow 14: a family unfair, Jeff Astrof only. No.\n\nRow 20: scream, Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman. So no match for both Astrof and Rice.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the episode titled \"scream\" was written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman, not Allan Rice. Even though it reached 6.29 million views, the co-writers don't include Allan Rice.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that an episode written by Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice, titled \"scream,\" received 6.29 million views. Checking the table, there's no entry where both writers are listed as Jeff Astrof and Allan Rice with the title \"scream.\" Instead, Row 20 lists \"scream\" as written by Jeff Astrof and Matt Goldman. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Writers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Writers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
