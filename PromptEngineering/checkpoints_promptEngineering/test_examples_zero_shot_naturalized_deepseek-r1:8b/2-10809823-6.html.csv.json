    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim says: \"the away team for 3 may 1980 be south melbourne , st kilda , footscray , essendon , carlton , and geelong.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the away teams on a specific date, which is May 3, 1980. The away teams listed are South Melbourne, St Kilda, Footscray, Essendon, Carlton, and Geelong.\n\nLooking at the table, it has six rows, each representing a different game from May 3, 1980. Each row includes information about both home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd size, and the date.\n\nSo my task is to check if all the listed away teams in the claim are indeed present as away teams on that specific date (May 3, 1980) in the table.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see which away teams are there.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Melbourne, away team is South Melbourne. So South Melbourne is an away team here.\n\nRow 2: Home team Collingwood vs St Kilda (away). So St Kilda is another away team.\n\nRow 3: Hawthorn is home against Footscray (away). Footscray is listed as the away team here.\n\nRow 4: Fitzroy is home, Essendon is away. So Essendon is an away team.\n\nRow 5: North Melbourne is home against Carlton (away). Carlton is another away team.\n\nRow 6: Richmond is home against Geelong (away). So Geelong is listed as the away team here.\n\nSo all the listed teams in the claim are indeed away teams on May 3, 1980. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut I should also check if there's any missing or extra teams mentioned in the claim that aren't present. The claim lists six teams: South Melbourne, St Kilda, Footscray, Essendon, Carlton, and Geelong. From my analysis above, each of these is indeed an away team on that date.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has several rows with details about different home and away teams for matches on May 3, 1980.

The table has six rows, each corresponding to a different match on May 3, 1980. Each row lists the home team, their score, the away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet me list out the home teams from the table:\n\n1. Melbourne\n2. Collingwood\n3. Hawthorn\n4. Fitzroy\n5. North Melbourne\n6. Richmond\n\nThe claim includes all six of these names as home teams for May 3, 1980.

The claim is: \"the venue on 3 may 1980 be mcg , victoria park , prince park , junction oval , arden street oval , and vfl park.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting.

So I need to check if each listed venue corresponds to any of these rows.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is McG. That's one of the venues mentioned, so it's relevant.\nRow 2: Venue is Victoria Park. Also mentioned in the claim, so that's another relevant cell.\nRow 3: Venue is Princes Park. Wait, the claim says \"Prince Park.\" Is Princes Park also known as Prince Park? Yes, sometimes they are referred to interchangeably. So I think that counts.\nRow 4: Venue is Junction Oval. That's in the list, so it's relevant.\nRow 5: Venue is Arden Street Oval. Also in the claim, so relevant.\nRow 6: Venue is VFL Park. Which matches one of the venues listed.\n\nWait, but the claim lists \"Prince Park,\" and the table has \"Princes Park.\" Are these considered the same? I think they are, as sometimes it's a matter of spelling. So that should count as correct.\n\nSo all six venues in the claim have corresponding entries in the table on May 3, 1980.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction. The claim says, \"the crowd at the venue victoria park be larger than the crowd at the venue prince park.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the relevant data points are here. The key elements are two venues: Victoria Park and Prince Park. Each row in the table lists a home team, their score, away team, etc., including the venue, crowd number, and date.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is McG\nRow 2: Venue is Victoria Park with a crowd of 29094\nRow 3: Venue is Princes Park with a crowd of 11958\nRow 4: Venue is Junction Oval\nRow 5: Venue is Arden Street Oval\nRow 6: Venue is VFL Park\n\nSo, the claim specifically mentions two venues: Victoria Park and Prince Park. From the table, I see that Row 2 is Victoria Park with a crowd of 29094, and Row 3 is Princes Park with a crowd of 11958.\n\nNow, to compare these two crowds: 29094 vs. 11958. Since 29094 is larger than 11958, it seems like the claim should be true because the crowd at Victoria Park is indeed larger than that at Prince Park.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there's no confusion between \"Princes Park\" and \"Prince Park.\" In the table, Row 3 lists venue as Princes Park. The claim refers to Prince Park\u2014do these names match? They sound similar but perhaps they are different venues. If that's the case, then maybe the crowd numbers don't directly compare because it's a different place.\n\nBut according to the table, there is no row for Prince Park. The closest is Princes Park with 11958. So if the claim is about Victoria Park vs. Prince Park, but only Victoria Park and Princes Park are listed, I have to assume that Prince Park isn't in the data. Therefore, maybe the claim is comparing two different venues not both present in the table.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim specifically mentions Victoria Park and Prince Park. Since the table includes Victoria Park (Row 2) and another venue called Princes Park (Row 3), perhaps there's a typo or mix-up between \"Prince\" and \"Princes.\" If they are different venues, then the crowd at Victoria Park isn't being compared to Prince Park but to Princes Park.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrectly referring to Princes Park as Prince Park. If that's the case, then perhaps there's no data for Prince Park, making the comparison impossible, which would make the claim false.\n\nBut looking back, the claim says \"Prince Park.\" The table has a venue called Princes Park in Row 3 with 11958 attendees. So if the claim is about Victoria Park vs. Prince Park, but only Princes Park exists, then the data doesn't support the comparison because Prince Park isn't listed. Therefore, there's no evidence to confirm or deny the claim as per the given table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the venues are considered the same, and \"Prince\" and \"Princes\" are typos, which might be a mistake in the question. If that's the case, then Victoria Park's crowd is 29094, and Princes Park is 11958, making the claim true.\n\nBut since the table lists them as separate venues with different names, I think the correct approach is to check if both are present. Since the claim refers to Prince Park, which isn't in the data, perhaps it's false because there's no data point for Prince Park. Therefore, we can't confirm whether Victoria Park's crowd is larger than Prince Park's.\n\nWait, but maybe the user intended Princes Park as the venue in Row 3, and the claim refers to Prince Park. If that's a typo, then perhaps it's meant to be Princes Park, making the comparison valid.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. To be precise, I should only consider the data given. Since the claim mentions Prince Park, which isn't present in the table as a venue, there's no relevant data to confirm or deny it. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the table because one of the venues isn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Prince\" is a typo and they meant \"Princes,\" then Victoria Park (29094) vs. Princes Park (11958), making the crowd at Victoria larger. But since the claim specifically says Prince Park, which doesn't exist in the table, I think the answer would be that the claim isn't fully supported because one venue isn't present.\n\nBut wait, maybe the user is just comparing based on the given data. So if we look only at Victoria Park and Princes Park, then 29094 > 11958, so the claim is true. But since the claim refers to Prince Park, which isn't in the table, perhaps it's false because the comparison can't be made.\n\nI'm a bit torn here. The key is whether both venues are present. Since only Victoria Park and Princes Park are listed, but not Prince Park, maybe the claim is false because Prince Park doesn't exist in the data.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Prince\" is intended to be \"Princess,\" then perhaps it's a typo, and the claim would be true. But as per the given data, I think the answer should note that only Victoria Park and Princes Park are present, but not Prince Park, so the claim can't be fully supported.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim is specifically about Prince Park. So if the table doesn't have an entry for Prince Park, then there's no way to verify whether its crowd is larger or not. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data because one of the required venues isn't present.\n\nBut wait again, maybe the venues are considered the same. If \"Prince\" and \"Princes\" are different, but if they're treated as the same, then it's comparing Victoria Park to Princes Park, which would be true. But since the claim uses different names, I think it's safer to assume that Prince Park is a separate venue not listed here.\n\nIn conclusion, the relevant cells are Row 2 (Victoria Park) and Row 3 (Princes Park). The crowd at Victoria Park (29094) is larger than Princes Park (11958), so if the claim was about comparing Victoria to Princes, it's true. However, since the claim mentions Prince Park specifically, which isn't in the table, perhaps the answer is that the claim can't be fully supported because one venue isn't present.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to check each condition against the table. So if the claim refers to two venues, both need to exist in the table for the comparison. Since Prince Park isn't listed, maybe the claim is false because it's not possible to confirm with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, if the user made a typo and meant Princes Park, then it's true. But as per the exact wording, it's about Prince Park which isn't there.\n\nSo I think the answer would be that only Victoria Park and Princes Park are in the table, but not Prince Park. Therefore, the claim can't be confirmed with the data provided because one venue is missing.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe task requires comparing the crowd sizes at two venues mentioned in the claim: Victoria Park and Prince Park. Upon reviewing the provided data:\n\n1. **Victoria Park (Row 2)** has a crowd size of 29,094 attendees.\n2. **Prince Park** is not listed as an individual venue in the table.\n\nSince Prince Park's crowd size cannot be determined from the given data, the comparison required by the claim is incomplete. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported with the provided information.\n\n### Relevant Data Points:\n- **Row 2 (Victoria Park):** 29,094 attendees.\n- **No data available for Prince Park.**\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim about Victoria Park's crowd being larger than Prince Park's cannot be confirmed because Prince Park is not listed in the table.",

Looking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'm looking for two specific pieces of information:\n1. The crowd size at VFL Park on May 3, 1980.\n2. The crowd size at Prince Park on May 3, 1980.\n\nSo, I'll need to scan each row to see if the venue is either VFL Park or Prince Park and if the date matches May 3, 1980.\n\nStarting with VFL Park: I go through each row.\n- Row 1: Venue is MCG. Not VFL Park.\n- Row 2: Venue is Victoria Park. No.\n- Row 3: Princes Park. Not VFL Park.\n- Row 4: Junction Oval. No.\n- Row 5: Arden Street Oval. No.\n- Row 6: VFL Park. Yes! So, the crowd here is 47,265.\n\nNext, looking for Prince Park. I check each row again:\n- Row 1: MCG. Not Prince Park.\n- Row 2: Victoria Park. No.\n- Row 3: Princes Park. Hmm, that's close. Wait, \"Princes\" vs. \"Prince\"? The claim mentions Prince Park. Is there a Prince Park? Looking back at the table, row 3's venue is Princes Park, which is often also known as Prince Park in some contexts. So maybe they're referring to Princes Park as Prince Park? Or perhaps it's a typo.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Prince Park,\" and the table has \"Princes Park.\" If they're considered the same entity, then row 3's crowd would be 11,958. But if not, there might be another game at Prince Park that I didn't see in the table.\n\nLooking again, row 3 is Hawthorn vs Footscray at Princes Park with a crowd of 11,958 on May 3, 1980. If \"Prince Park\" refers to another venue, perhaps it's not in the table or maybe I missed it. Let me check all rows once more.\n\nRow indices:\n1: MCG\n2: Victoria Park\n3: Princes Park\n4: Junction Oval\n5: Arden Street Oval\n6: VFL Park\n\nI don't see any other venues named Prince Park or Princes Park besides row 3. So, if the claim is referring to Princes Park as Prince Park, then row 3's crowd is 11,958.\n\nNow, comparing the two crowds:\n- VFL Park: 47,265\n- Prince Park (Princes Park): 11,958\n\nIs 47,265 more than twice 11,958? Let me calculate twice 11,958. That would be 23,916. Since 47,265 is more than that, the claim holds.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 6 (VFL Park) and row 3 (Princes Park).\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to compare the crowd sizes at VFL Park and Prince Park on May 3, 1980.

It's saying that on May 3, 1980, these six teams were the home teams. So I need to look into the table and find out which rows correspond to that date and then check their home team names.\n\nLooking at the table, all rows have a \"date\" column. The claim specifies the date as May 3, 1980. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is May 3, 1980. Home team is Melbourne.\nRow 2: Same date. Home team is Collingwood.\nRow 3: Same date. Home team is Hawthorn.\nRow 4: Same date. Home team is Fitzroy.\nRow 5: Same date. Home team is North Melbourne.\nRow 6: Same date.

So St Kilda isn't a home team on that date; it's an away team. So no match.\n- Footscray: Check the table. In row 3, Hawthorn is home and Footscray is away. No footscray as home team.\n- Essendon: In row 4, Fitzroy is home, away team is Essendon. So Essendon isn't a home team here; it's an away team.\n- Carlton: Row 5 lists North Melbourne as home, away is Carlton.

It says that on May 3, 1980, the away teams in certain matches were Melbourne, Collingwood, Hawthorn, Fitzroy, North Melbourne, and Richmond.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game between a home team and an away team, along with other details like scores and venue. The dates for all rows are May 3, 1980, so they're all on the same date as the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row to see who the away teams were:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Melbourne, away team is South Melbourne.\nRow 2: Home team is Collingwood, away team is St Kilda.\nRow 3: Home team is Hawthorn, away team is Footscray.\nRow 4: Home team is Fitzroy, away team is Essendon.\nRow 5: Home team is North Melbourne, away team is Carlton.\nRow 6: Home team is Richmond, away team is Geelong.\n\nNow, the claim lists the away teams as Melbourne, Collingwood, Hawthorn, Fitzroy, North Melbourne, and Richmond. \n\nLet me check each of these:\n\n- Melbourne: Is Melbourne listed as an away team in any row? Yes, Row 1 has South Melbourne as the away team, but that's a different team (South Melbourne is sometimes known as Melbourne in older contexts, but it's a separate club). Wait, actually, I need to be precise. The claim mentions \"Melbourne\" specifically. In the table, only Row 6's home team is Richmond vs. Geelong. So for Row 1, the away team is South Melbourne, not Melbourne.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the names. Let me list all the away teams from the table:\n\n- Row 1: South Melbourne\n- Row 2: St Kilda\n- Row 3: Footscray\n- Row 4: Essendon\n- Row 5: Carlton\n- Row 6: Geelong\n\nNone of these are Melbourne, Collingwood, Hawthorn, Fitzroy, North Melbourne, or Richmond as away teams. The home teams in the table include all those names except when they're playing away.\n\nWait, let's look again. The claim says that on May 3, 1980, the away teams were those six clubs. So I need to check each of them:\n\n1. Melbourne: In Row 1, the home team is Melbourne; the away team is South Melbourne. So Melbourne is a home team, not an away team.\n\n2. Collingwood: Home team in Row 2; so they're not away.\n\n3. Hawthorn: Home team in Row 3; not away.\n\n4. Fitzroy: Home team in Row 4; not away.\n\n5. North Melbourne: Home team in Row 5; not away.\n\n6. Richmond: Home team in Row 6; not away.\n\nSo none of these six clubs are listed as away teams on May 3, 1980. Instead, the away teams are South Melbourne, St Kilda, Footscray, Essendon, Carlton, and Geelong.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it lists the wrong away teams. The actual away teams were different from what's stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly identifies the away teams for May 3, 1980. None of Melbourne, Collingwood, Hawthorn, Fitzroy, North Melbourne, or Richmond are listed as away teams in any row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the only venue on 3 may 1980 be victoria park\" is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row of the table and see which one has the venue as Victoria Park on May 3, 1980. The claim says that this is the only venue for that date, so I should check if any other venues are listed on May 3, 1980.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The venue is McG, which doesn't match Victoria Park.\nRow 2: Venue is Victoria Park. That's the one mentioned in the claim.\nRow 3: Venue is Princes Park.\nRow 4: Venue is Junction Oval.\nRow 5: Venue is Arden Street Oval.\nRow 6: Venue is VFL Park.\n\nSo, only Row 2 has Victoria Park as the venue on May 3, 1980. Now I need to check if it's the only one. Since all other rows have different venues, this makes the claim true because there's only one venue listed for that date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE since Victoria Park is the sole venue listed for May 3, 1980.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim says: \"the crowd at the venue Victoria Park be smaller than than the crowd at the venue Prince Park.\" Wait, there's a typo here\u2014probably meant \"smaller than\" instead of \"than than.\" But regardless, I need to check if Victoria Park's crowd is indeed smaller than Prince Park's.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns related to this claim are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" etc., but specifically, the relevant columns are \"crowd\" and the venue names.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row to find where Victoria Park is the venue. In Row 2: home team Collingwood, venue Victoria Park, crowd 29094. That's Victoria Park.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's a Prince Park as another venue. Looking at all rows:\n\nRow 1: McG\nRow 2: Victoria Park\nRow 3: Princes Park\nRow 4: Junction Oval\nRow 5: Arden Street Oval\nRow 6: VFL Park\n\nWait, Row 3 is Princes Park, but the claim mentions Prince Park. Is Princes Park the same as Prince Park? They sound similar. Maybe it's a typo in the claim, or perhaps I should consider them as different.\n\nIf the venues are Victoria Park and Princes Park, then we need to check their crowd numbers.\n\nFrom Row 2: Victoria Park has a crowd of 29094.\nIn Row 3: Princes Park (not Prince Park) has a crowd of 11958. So if the claim is about Prince Park vs. Victoria Park, but in reality, Victoria Park's crowd is higher than Princes Park, so the claim would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim intended to say Prince Park instead of Princes Park. If it was Prince Park, and based on the data, there is no such venue as Prince Park. The only one close is Princes Park with 11958, but Victoria Park has a higher crowd of 29094, so even if we consider Prince Park (which doesn't exist), it would still be smaller than Victoria Park's 29094.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is comparing Victoria Park to Prince Park, which might not exist in the table. But since Princes Park exists with a lower crowd, and Victoria Park has a higher crowd, regardless of whether the venues are correctly named, the comparison holds as FALSE because the actual crowd at Victoria Park (29094) is larger than at Princes Park (11958). Therefore, the claim that it's smaller is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the crowd numbers for both Victoria Park and Princes Park. Since Prince Park isn't directly in the table, maybe only Victoria Park is needed? No, because the comparison requires two venues. So we need both their crowd values to check if one is indeed smaller than the other.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"Prince Park,\" which isn't exactly as per the table. The correct venue is Princes Park with 11958. So perhaps the relevant cells are Victoria Park's crowd and whether Prince Park exists or not. But since Prince Park doesn't exist, maybe it's a typo, so we should consider that the claim refers to Princes Park.\n\nIn any case, the key is to check if Victoria Park's crowd is smaller than another venue's crowd. From the data, Victoria Park has 29094, and the next highest is VFL Park with 47265, which is larger. So if the claim was about VFL Park, it would be false. But since it's comparing to Prince Park/Princes Park, which have lower crowds, then yes, it's smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is that Victoria Park has a crowd of 29094 and Princes Park (if that's what the claim refers to) has 11958, so 11958 < 29094. Therefore, the claim that the crowd at Victoria Park is smaller than Prince Park's is false because it's actually larger.\n\nSo the answer would be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the crowd for both venues.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we compare the crowd sizes of Victoria Park and Princes Park. The crowd at Victoria Park (29,094) is larger than that at Princes Park (11,958), making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the crowd at VFL Park on 3 May 1980 was less than half the size of the crowd at Prince Park that same day.\"\n\nFirst, I should find all the relevant rows in the table for both venues mentioned in the claim. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is McG\nRow 2: Victoria Park\nRow 3: Princes Park\nRow 4: Junction Oval\nRow 5: Arden Street Oval\nRow 6: VFL Park\n\nSo, from this, I can see that VFL Park is mentioned in Row 6 and Prince Park (Princes Park) is in Row 3. So the relevant rows are Row 3 and Row 6.\n\nNext, I need to extract the crowd numbers for each of these venues on the same date, which is May 3, 1980.\n\nFrom Row 6: VFL Park had a crowd of 47,265.\nFrom Row 3: Princes Park (Prince Park) had a crowd of 11,958.\n\nNow, to evaluate the claim: Is 47,265 less than half of 11,958? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 47,265 is much larger. So I think I might have misread something. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the claim says VFL Park's crowd was less than half of Prince Park's. But VFL Park's crowd (47,265) is way more than twice that of Princes Park (11,958). So 47,265 is almost four times larger than 11,958. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the venues. Let me clarify: The claim says VFL Park's crowd was less than half of Prince Park's. So it's comparing VFL Park (47k) to Princes Park (11k). Is 47k less than half of 11k? No, because half of 11k is about 5.5k. Since 47k is more than that, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread which park is which. Let me check again. The table has Princes Park (row 3) and VFL Park (row 6). So yes, VFL Park had a much larger crowd.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at VFL Park was less than half of Prince Park's crowd on the same day. However, upon examining the data:\n\n- **VFL Park**: Crowd = 47,265\n- **Prince Park (Princes Park)**: Crowd = 11,958\n\nTo determine if 47,265 is less than half of 11,958, we calculate half of 11,958, which is approximately 5,979. Since 47,265 is significantly larger than 5,979, the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 3 (Prince Park) and Row 6 (VFL Park).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
