    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim states: \"there be less than 11 loss that corinthians receive when they amass 22 point.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. Corinthians' losses must be less than 11.\n2. They must have amassed 22 points.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row corresponding to Corinthians and check their points and number of losses.\n\nScanning through the \"team\" column, I see Corinthians listed in Row 6. Let's verify that:\n\nRow 6: position: 6, team: corinthians, points: 22, played: 22, drawn: 2, lost: 10, against: 51, difference: -20.\n\nSo, their points are indeed 22, which meets the first condition. Now, looking at the number of losses they have: 10. The claim says less than 11, so 10 is less than 11. That seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there's any other part that might affect this. For example, does \"amass 22 points\" imply something about the context or timing? In this table, it looks like points are cumulative, and each row represents a team's performance up to that point. So, Corinthians have exactly 22 points with 10 losses.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim is supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for Corinthians' points and losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"there be zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at which team Corithians are. Looking at the table, in row 6, we have Corithians. Their points are 22 and they've played 22 games. Now, the claim mentions scoring over 25 points, but Corithians only scored 22 points. That might be a red flag because if they scored more than 25, their points should be higher than that. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's about the points they've received or conceded? Wait, the claim says \"loss that corinthians recieved,\" so I think it refers to how many games they lost, given that they scored over 25 points.\n\nWait, but Corithians only have 22 points, which is less than 25. So if their score is above 25, but their points are 22, maybe the claim is false because they didn't reach that point. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about when they do score over 25 points in a game, whether they lost that particular game.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The table seems to show each team's overall performance\u2014points earned, games played, drawn, lost, against whom, and their goal difference. So it's not about individual games but the total season stats.\n\nThe claim is about Corithians' losses when they score over 25 points. But in the table, Corithians have a total of 22 points across all games. They didn't score above 25 points in total; they only scored 22. So perhaps the claim is based on the idea that whenever they scored more than 25 points in a single game (if such games exist), they didn't lose those games.\n\nBut since the table doesn't provide per-game data, it's about their overall performance. Since Corithians have 22 total points, which is below 25, maybe the claim is trying to say that whenever they scored over 25 in a single game (if any such games exist), they didn't lose those games.\n\nBut without specific game data, I can't verify per-game results. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to their overall points and losses. Let me check Corithians' total losses: row 6 shows lost:10. So they lost 10 times. But if scoring over 25 is a condition, but their total points are 22, then they didn't score over 25 at all in total.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the claim. Maybe it's about goals scored or points in a game leading to zero losses. Alternatively, perhaps \"scored over 25 point\" refers to the total points earned, which would be 22, so that's not over 25. So Corithians didn't score over 25 points, so the condition is irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about games where they scored more than 25 points in a single game, leading to zero losses in those games. But without per-game data, I can't tell how many times they scored over 25 and whether they lost any of those specific games.\n\nBut given that the table doesn't provide per-game stats, maybe we need to consider their overall performance. Since Corithians have 10 losses overall, but if their total points are below 25, then the condition in the claim isn't met because they didn't score over 25. Therefore, maybe the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point.\" So if Corithians scored over 25 points in a game (and assuming they did), then they didn't lose those games. But since their total points are 22, which is below 25, maybe the condition never applied, so it's vacuously true? Or perhaps false because they didn't have any such instances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for when Corithians scored over 25 and check if they lost any of those games. But without per-game data, I can't do that. So maybe the claim is referring to something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, row 6 shows points as 22, played 22, drawn 2, lost 10, against 51, difference -20. So their total points are 22, which is below 25. Therefore, they didn't score over 25 points in the season, so there were zero instances where they scored over 25 and also had a loss. But since they didn't have any games where they scored over 25, maybe the claim is technically true because zero losses occurred in such games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to check if their total losses are zero when their points are over 25. But their points are 22, so again, no relevant data.\n\nI think the key here is that Corithians didn't score over 25 points at all, so there's no scenario where they scored above 25 and lost a game. Therefore, the claim is true because in zero cases did they lose while scoring over 25. Alternatively, it might be considered vacuously true.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider their total losses regardless of points. The claim says \"zero loss that corinthians recieved when they score over 25 point.\" So perhaps when they scored over 25 in a game, they didn't lose. But since they never scored over 25, the number of times this happened is zero, and thus there were zero losses in those cases.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Corithians didn't have any instances where they scored over 25 points and lost a game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Corithians did not lose any games when they scored over 25 points. However, from the table, Corithians have a total of 22 points, which is below 25. Therefore, there were no instances where they scored above 25 points, making the condition in the claim irrelevant. Since there were zero losses in such hypothetical scenarios, the claim holds true.\n\nAnswer: The statement is true because Corithians did not score over 25 points in any game, so they didn't lose any games under that condition.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",
