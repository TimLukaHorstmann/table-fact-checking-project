    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"From 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao lacks any defense 50% of the time.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each row in the table represents. Each row seems to be a fight that Manny Pacquiao had during those years. Let me go through each row and note down the relevant details.\n\nRow 1: This is about his WBC Flyweight title in December 1998 against Chatchai Sasakul. The result was a KO in the 8th round, and he defended it once.\nRow 2: This is the Lineal Flyweight title on the same date against the same opponent. Result also a KO in the 8th, with one defense.\nRow 3: IBF Super Bantamweight title in June 2001 against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. He won via TKO and had 4 defenses before this fight.\nRow 4: The Ring Featherweight title in November 2003 against Marco Antonio Barrera.TKO in the 11th, with 2 defenses.\nRow 5: WBC Super Featherweight in March 2008 against Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez. He won by SD (Split Decision) in 12 rounds, no defenses before this fight.\nRow 6: The Ring Junior Lightweight title same date as above, also a SD victory, again with no prior defenses.\nRow 7: WBC Lightweight title in June 2008 against David D\u00edaz, TKO in the 9th, 0 defenses.\nRow 8: The Ring Junior Welterweight in May 2009 against Ricky Hatton, KO in the 2nd, 0 defenses.\n\nNow, the claim is about Manny lacking any defense 50% of the time from 1998 to 2009. So I need to see how often he had no defenses before each fight.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow1: He defended once before fighting Chatchai. So this fight was his first defense.\nRow2: Also, same as Row1, one defense before.\nRow3: Four defenses before facing Ledwaba.\nRow4: Two defenses before fighting Barrera.\nRows 5-8: Each of these fights had 0 defenses before the bout.\n\nSo out of the 8 rows (since it's from 1998 to 2009), let's see how many times he had 0 defenses:\n\nRows 5,6,7,8: that's four fights with 0 defenses. So 4 out of 8, which is 50%.\n\nThe claim says he lacks any defense 50% of the time. Wait, \"lacks\" meaning he didn't have any defenses before the fight? Or does it mean he didn't defend the title? I think in boxing terms, \"defense\" here refers to defending a title or having prior defenses.\n\nBut looking at the data, from 1998-2009, there are 8 fights. Rows 5,6,7,8 (four rows) had 0 defenses before each fight. So that's four out of eight, which is 50%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"manny pacquiao have his first tko , in a winning bout , in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Manny Pacquiao had his first T KO (Technical Knockout) in a winning bout in 2001. So I need to find if there was a fight in 2001 where he won via T KO.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight. The columns include number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is 1998-12-04, so not 2001.\nRow 2: Also 1998, same as above.\nRow 3: Date is 2001-06-23. This is in 2001. Let's check the result. It says \"tko 6 / 12\". So yes, it's a T KO. The opponent was Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. And the result shows Manny won because he got the T KO.\nRow 4: Date is 2003, so not relevant.\nRow 5 and 6 are in 2008, which is after 2001.\nRows 7 and 8 are later as well.\n\nSo Row 3 is the one that matches. It shows Manny's first T KO in 2001 against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. He won this fight, so it's a winning bout.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by Row 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"manny pacquiao win more bout in 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Manny Pacquiao won more bouts (fights) in the year 2008. So, I should look into the table to find all the fights Manny had in 2008 and count how many he won.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists eight rows, each representing a different fight. Each row has details like the number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. The dates range from 1998 to 2009, so I can focus only on rows where the date is in 2008.\n\nNow, scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is 1998-12-04 \u2192 not 2008.\nRow 2: Same as Row 1 \u2192 not 2008.\nRow 3: 2001-06-23 \u2192 not 2008.\nRow 4: 2003-11-15 \u2192 nope.\nRow 5: 2008-03-15 \u2192 this is in 2008.\nRow 6: Also 2008-03-15 \u2192 same as above.\nRow 7: 2008-06-28 \u2192 another 2008 fight.\nRow 8: 2009-05-02 \u2192 not 2008.\n\nSo, rows 5, 6, and 7 are the ones that occurred in 2008. Now, I need to check the results of these fights to see how many Manny won.\n\nRow 5: Result is \"sd 12 / 12\" which means a split decision victory.\nRow 6: Same result as Row 5 \u2192 another split decision win.\nRow 7: Result is \"tko 9 / 12\" \u2192 a technical knockout, so that's a win.\n\nSo, in total, Manny had three bouts in 2008, all of which he won. That means the claim stating he won more bouts in 2008 seems to be accurate based on these three wins.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other fights he had in 2008 that might be missing from the table. The table provided has eight rows, and only three of them are in 2008. If the claim says \"more bouts,\" maybe it's referring to a specific number higher than three? Or perhaps the term \"more\" is subjective.\n\nHowever, based on the data given, Manny Pacquiao had three wins in 2008. The claim doesn't specify how many he needs to win to qualify as \"more,\" so if three is indeed more than what he usually has or compared to previous years, it might hold. But without specific numbers, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut considering the table only shows these three fights, and all are wins, I think the claim is TRUE because he did have multiple wins that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a fight with a specific opponent, date, and weight category.\n\nRow 1: WBC Flyweight (112)\nRow 2: Lineal Flyweight (112) - This might be a separate title or classification.\nRow 3: IBF Super Bantamweight (122)\nRow 4: The Ring Featherweight (126)\nRow 5: WBC Super Featherweight (130)\nRow 6: The Ring Junior Lightweight (130) - Same as above, but from another organization\nRow 7: WBC Lightweight (135)\nRow 8: The Ring Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nSo, listing out the weight categories:\n\n1. Flyweight (112)\n2. Super Bantamweight (122)\n3. Featherweight (126)\n4. Super Featherweight (130)\n5. Lightweight (135)\n6. Junior Welterweight (140)\n\nWait, that's six different weight categories. The claim says five. Did I miscount?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Flyweight\n- Super Bantamweight\n- Featherweight\n- Super Featherweight\n- Lightweight\n- Junior Welterweight\n\nThat's six categories. So the claim is incorrect because it's actually more than five.\n\nBut wait, rows 2 and 6 both reference Lineal and The Ring Junior Lightweight. Are these considered separate categories or part of the same? If they're from different organizations (like WBC vs. The Ring), does that count as different categories?\n\nI think so. Each title is a distinct category. So Manny held six titles, not five.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Manny Pacquiao have his biggest difference in final scoring point during his bout with ricky hatton.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. Looking at the table, each row represents a different fight Manny had. The claim mentions Ricky Hatton, so I need to check which row corresponds to their fight.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 7: opponent is David D\u00edaz\n- Row 8: opponent is Ricky Hatton\n\nSo, Row 8 is the relevant one because it's the fight against Ricky Hatton. Now, I should look at what columns are important here. The claim is about \"final scoring point,\" which in boxing usually refers to something like points scored or perhaps the outcome of the fight.\n\nIn the table, each row has \"result\" as a column. So, looking at Row 8: result is \"ko 2 / 12\". This means Manny won by knockout in the second round. The other columns like \"defenses\" might not be directly related to scoring points. \n\nI need to check if this was indeed his biggest difference in final scoring. Without more data on scoring differences, I can infer that Manny's performance in this fight (a quick knockout) might have been notable, suggesting a significant score difference.\n\nTherefore, Row 8 and the \"result\" column are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then provide a JSON response with the answer and the relevant cells. The claim says: \"From 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense only 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It seems to suggest that during those years, Manny had only one instance where he lacked a defense. So, I need to look at each row in the table and check how many times he didn't have a defense.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nEach row has several columns: number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, defenses. The 'defenses' column indicates how many defenses Manny had for that particular fight.\n\nRow 1: defenses = 1\nRow 2: defenses = 1\nRow 3: defenses = 4\nRow 4: defenses = 2\nRow 5: defenses = 0\nRow 6: defenses = 0\nRow 7: defenses = 0\nRow 8: defenses = 0\n\nWait, the claim is from 1998 to 2009. So, rows 1 through 8 are all within that timeframe because the latest date is May 2, 2009.\n\nNow, let's count how many times Manny lacked a defense. Lacked any defense would mean 'defenses' being zero or not having any defenses in that fight. Wait, but looking at the table, each row has a number of defenses listed as either 0 or a positive integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The term \"lacked any defense\" might refer to having no prior defenses before this fight. For example, if it's his first defense or maybe the initial title defense. So, in some contexts, sometimes a fighter's first defense is considered as their first time defending the title. So, when they have 0 defenses listed here, does that mean it was their first defense?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"defenses\" refers to the number of times they've successfully defended the title before this fight. So if it's 0, it might be their first defense.\n\nWait, but in row 5, for example: titles are WBC super featherweight (130), date is March 15, 2008, opponent Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, result SD 12/12, defenses: 0. So does that mean he didn't have any defenses before this fight? If so, then yes, he lacked a defense.\n\nSimilarly, rows 6,7,8 also show defenses as 0.\n\nSo, let's count how many times he had defenses=0:\n\nRows 5,6,7,8: four instances where defenses are 0.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lack any defense only 1 time.\" So if it means that he lacked a defense (i.e., had 0 defenses) only once, then the claim is FALSE because in reality, he had multiple times with 0 defenses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"lacked any defense\" refers to having zero successful defenses before this fight, meaning that it's his first defense. So if a fighter hasn't defended the title before, their first defense would be considered as lacking any defense because they haven't had previous ones. So in that case, each of those 0s is a time he lacked a defense.\n\nSo rows 5-8: that's four times where defenses are 0, meaning he lacked any defense four times.\n\nBut the claim says \"only 1 time.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there were multiple instances where Manny lacked any defense beyond just one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Manny Pacquiao lacked any defense only once between 1998 and 2009. However, upon examining the table, it's clear that he had four fights (rows 5-8) where his defenses were listed as zero, indicating he lacked a defense each time.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. The claim specifies that Manny lacked any defense only once.\n2. By analyzing the 'defenses' column in each relevant row:\n   - Rows 5, 6, 7, and 8 all show defenses as 0, indicating he had no prior defenses for these fights.\n3. This results in four instances where he lacked a defense, contradicting the claim of only one instance.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"defenses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao is true or false. The claim says: \"Manny Pacquiao had his first tko in a losing bout in 1998.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the claim. A \"TKO\" (Technical Knockout) means that the boxer causes the opponent to surrender before the full round or via a knockout in the specified rounds. The term \"losing bout\" implies that Pacquiao lost the fight. The year mentioned is 1998.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's any record of Manny Pacquiao having a TKO loss in 1998. Let me go through each row of the table provided.\n\nRow 1: number 1, name Pacquiao, titles WBC Flyweight (112), date Dec 04, 1998, opponent Chatchai Sasakul, result KO 8/12, defenses 1. So here, he KO'd his opponent in round 8. It's a win for him, so this doesn't apply to a loss.\n\nRow 2: Same as row 1 but the title is Lineal Flyweight (112). Opponent same, result KO 8/12. Again, Pacquiao won, so no loss here.\n\nRow 3: Date June 23, 2001 vs Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, result TKO in round 6. This is a win, as he's the one who caused the TKO.\n\nRow 4: November 15, 2003 vs Marco Antonio Barrera, result TKO 11/12. Another win for Pacquiao.\n\nRow 5: March 15, 2008 vs Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, result SD 12/12. This is a split decision, so no KO involved.\n\nRow 6: Same date as row 5, different title (The Ring Junior Lightweight), same opponent and result (SD). Again, no TKO.\n\nRow 7: June 28, 2008 vs David D\u00edaz, result TKO 9/12. Pacquiao won here as well.\n\nRow 8: May 2, 2009 vs Ricky Hatton, KO in round 2. Another win.\n\nSo, looking through all these rows, I don't see any instance where Manny Pacquiao had a TKO loss before the end of 1998. In fact, his first TKO was against Chatchai Sasakul on December 4, 1998, which was a win (KO). Therefore, there's no record in 1998 where he lost via TKO.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if perhaps another row exists that wasn't listed. The table provided has 8 rows, and all of them after row 1 are either wins or later fights. There doesn't seem to be a loss with a TKO in 1998.\n\nAlso, the claim specifies it's his first TKO in a losing bout. If his first TKO was a win, then he never had a losing TKO in 1998. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Manny Pacquiao did not have a TKO loss in 1998. His first TKO was a victory.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"manny pacquiao win the most bout in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about Manny Pacquiao winning the most bouts in 2001. So, my focus should be on any fights that occurred in 2001 and how many he won that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like number, name, titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. The rows are numbered from 0 to 7, I think, because there are eight rows total.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find ones where the date is in 2001. Let's go through them one by one:\n\nRow 0: Date is 1998-12-04 \u2013 that's not 2001.\nRow 1: Same date as Row 0, so also 1998.\nRow 2: Date is 1998-12-04 again.\nRow 3: Date is 2001-06-23. That's in 2001. So this fight happened in 2001.\nRow 4: 2003-11-15 \u2013 not 2001.\nRow 5: 2008-03-15 \u2013 way after 2001.\nRow 6: Same date as Row 5, so also 2008.\nRow 7: Date is 2009-05-02 \u2013 later years.\n\nSo only Row 3 (which is the third fight in the table) took place in 2001. Now, what's the result of that fight? The \"result\" column says \"tko 6 / 12\", which I think means a technical knockout in the 6th round. So he won this fight.\n\nNow, the claim is about Manny winning the most bouts in 2001. Since there's only one fight in 2001 (Row 3), and he won it, does that make him the fighter with the most wins in that year? Well, if he had more than one fight that year, or if others had more, but since only this one is listed for 2001, and he won it, then yes, he has at least one win.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another fight in 2001 that I missed. Let me double-check the dates again:\n\n- Rows 0-2: December 1998\n- Row 3: June 2001\n- Rows 4-7: After 2001\n\nSo yes, only one fight in 2001, which he won. So he didn't have more than one, but he did win the most (only one). The wording of the claim is a bit tricky because \"the most\" could mean the highest number, not necessarily multiple wins. So since there's only one and he won it, that makes the statement TRUE.\n\nWait, but sometimes in sports, \"most bouts\" might refer to the total number, which would be just one here. But maybe the claim is implying that he had more than others, but if no one else had any, then yes, he has the most.\n\nAlternatively, if there's only one fight and he won it, then he did win the most in 2001 because no one else did. So I think the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on Manny Pacquiao's single victory in 2001 (Row 3), making him the fighter with the most wins that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says that from 1998 to 2009, Manny Pacquiao fought in the same weight category. So I need to check each of his fights during that period and see if he was in the same category each time.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several fights starting from 1998 up until 2009. Each row has details like number, name (which is always Manny Pacquiao), titles, date, opponent, result, and defenses. The key here is to look at the 'titles' column because that should indicate the weight category he was fighting in.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Titles are \"wbc flyweight (112)\". So his first fight in 1998 was in the WBC Flyweight division, which I think is a lower weight limit. Then, looking at Row 2, it's also \"lineal flyweight (112)\", so that seems consistent with Row 1.\n\nMoving to Row 3: Titles are \"ibf super bantamweight (122)\". Super bantamweight is higher than flyweight, so that's a different category. Now, this might indicate he moved up in weight, which would mean the claim isn't entirely accurate because his category changed over time.\n\nRow 4 has titles \"the ring featherweight (126)\", which again is a different division from super bantamweight or flyweight. Featherweight is another level up from super bantamweight, so that's another change.\n\nRows 5 and 6 both mention \"wbc super featherweight (130)\" and \"the ring junior lightweight (130)\". Super featherweight and junior lightweight are also different categories. So from Row 3 to Row 4, and then further down, the weight categories keep changing\u2014first to super bantamweight, then featherweight, then super featherweight and junior lightweight.\n\nRow 7 is \"wbc lightweight (135)\", which is another step up in weight, higher than junior lightweight. Finally, Row 8 has \"the ring junior welterweight (140)\", which again is a different category from lightweight.\n\nSo Manny Pacquiao didn't fight in the same weight category throughout 1998 to 2009. He moved up from flyweight to super bantamweight, then featherweight, and kept changing categories as he went on. Therefore, the claim that he fought in the same category during those years is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Manny Pacquiao's bout with Marco Antonio Barrera is true or false based on the given table. The claim states that \"Manny Pacquiao have the biggest difference in score point during his bout with marco antonio barrera.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find all the rows related to Manny Pacquiao fighting Marco Antonio Barrera. From the table, there are four relevant rows:\n\nRow 4: Titles include \"the ring featherweight (126)\", date is 2003-11-15, opponent is Marco Antonio Barrera, result is tko 11/12, defenses: 2.\n\nLooking at other rows, Row 5 and 6 mention Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez, not Barrera. Rows 7 and 8 are about different opponents, David D\u00edaz and Ricky Hatton, respectively. So only Row 4 is relevant here.\n\nNow, I need to check if Manny Pacquiao has the biggest difference in score points against Barrera. The table doesn't provide information on the score points or differences between fighters. It only shows the result of each fight, like KO 8/12 or tko 11/12, and the number of defenses.\n\nSince there's no data on score points or point differences in the table, I can't verify whether the claim is true or false based on this information. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported as it requires data not provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
