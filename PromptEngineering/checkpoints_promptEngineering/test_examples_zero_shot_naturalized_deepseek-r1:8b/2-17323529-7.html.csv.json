    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about game 40 having a high assist of Eric Gordon with 6 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. Each row corresponds to a different game, from game 32 up to game 47. The columns include various stats like high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and the overall record.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"game 40\" having a high assist of Eric Gordon with 6. So my first task is to find the relevant row in the table for game 40. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: game 32\nRow 2: game 33\nRow 3: game 34\nRow 4: game 35\nRow 5: game 36\nRow 6: game 37\nRow 7: game 38\nRow 8: game 39\nRow 9: game 40\n\nThere it is, row 9 corresponds to game 40. Now, within that row, I need to look for the assist column. The columns in each row are a bit varied, but looking at row 9:\n\n- game: 40\n- date: january 19\n- team: minnesota\n- score: l 86 - 94 (ot)\n- high points: eric gordon (25)\n- high rebounds: deandre jordan (10)\n- high assists: mardy collins (8)\n- location attendance: staples center 14399\n- record: 9 - 31\n\nSo the \"high assists\" for game 40 are listed as Mardy Collins with 8. That's interesting because the claim is about Eric Gordon having 6 assists.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes in sports stats, players can have multiple high assists or other players share it. But in this case, the \"high assists\" column is specifically listed as Mardy Collins with 8. There's no mention of Eric Gordon assisting with 6 in that game.\n\nHowever, another thought: sometimes a game might list the highest assist by a player, but if Eric Gordon had 6, maybe it's not necessarily the highest. But the claim says \"high assists,\" which typically means the highest for that game. So if Mardy Collins has 8, then Eric Gordon isn't the one with the high assist in that game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the columns. Let me check again:\n\nRow 9: high points are Eric Gordon (25), high rebounds are DeAndre Jordan (10), and high assists are Mardy Collins (8). There's no mention of Eric Gordon having a high assist of 6 here.\n\nTherefore, it seems that in game 40, the highest assist was by Mardy Collins with 8, not Eric Gordon. So the claim that Eric Gordon had a high assist of 6 is incorrect for this game.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}]}",
