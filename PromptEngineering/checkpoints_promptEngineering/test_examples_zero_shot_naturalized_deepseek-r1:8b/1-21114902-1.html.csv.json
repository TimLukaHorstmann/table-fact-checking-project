    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"there be 1 submission of the night when matt wiman be the fighter.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse what exactly the claim is saying. It seems to state that there's exactly one submission in a single fight where Matt Wiman was the fighter. So, I need to check if Matt Wiman has any fights recorded with exactly 1 submission.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fighter and contains several columns. The relevant column here is \"submissions of the night.\" So, for Matt Wiman's row, I should look at this value.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find Matt Wiman. Scanning the list:\n\nRow 1: Joe Lauzon\nRow 2: Anderson Silva\nRow 3: Chris Lytle\nRow 4: Nate Diaz\nRow 5: Frankie Edgar\nRow 6: Clay Guida\nRow 7: Sam Stout\nRow 8: Wanderlei Silva\nRow 9: Diego Sanchez\nRow 10: Forrest Griffin\nRow 11: Tyson Griffin\nRow 12: Carlos Condit\nRow 13: Tito Ortiz\nRow 14: Joe Stevenson\nRow 15: Donald Cerrone\nRow 16: Jon Jones\nRow 17: Jim Miller\nRow 18: Chris Leben\nRow 19: Brad Pickett\nRow 20: Georges St-Pierre\nRow 21: Kenny Florian\nRow 22: Josh Koscheck\nRow 23: Melvin Guillard\nRow 24: Dennis Siver\nRow 25: Martin Kampmann\nRow 26: BJ Penn\nRow 27: Ed Herman\nRow 28: Roy Nelson\nRow 29: Lyoto Machida\nRow 30: Stefan Struve\n\nWait, I think I might have missed Matt Wiman. Let me check again.\n\nHmm, actually, Matt Wiman isn't listed in the table provided. Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I skipped a row. Let me recount:\n\nThe list goes up to Row 33, so perhaps Matt Wiman is somewhere around there? Or maybe he's not included at all. \n\nWait, the table provided only has up to row 33, and the last few rows include fighters like BJ Penn, Ed Herman, Roy Nelson, Lyoto Machida, and Stefan Struve. I don't see Matt Wiman in here.\n\nSo, if Matt Wiman isn't present in the table, that means there's no data for him, which would imply that the claim is looking at a fighter who isn't in the table. Therefore, the statement \"there be 1 submission of the night when matt wiman be the fighter\" can't be verified because Matt Wiman isn't in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRows 1-30: fighters from A to Z, including some like BJ Penn, Martin Kampmann, etc. Matt Wiman isn't here. Then rows 31-33 include more fighters, but again, no Matt Wiman.\n\nSo, since Matt Wiman's row isn't present, the claim can't be true because there's no data supporting it. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about Matt Wiman having exactly one submission in a fight. Since Matt Wiman isn't listed in the table, there's no data to support this claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim about Joe Lauzon is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that Joe Lauzon has 5 fights of the night and 1 knockout of the night.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the fighter named Joe Lauzon. Let's go step by step:\n\nRow 1: fighter: joe lauzon. Okay, here we go. So this is Joe Lauzon. Now I need to check his fights of the night and knockouts.\n\nLooking at the columns for Row 1, there are several entries:\n- Fights of the night: 5\n- Knockouts of the night: 1\n\nSo both values match exactly what the claim states. The claim says Joe Lauzon has 5 fights of the night and 1 knockout of the night, which is exactly what's shown in Row 1.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows with Joe Lauzon to make sure it's not a duplicate or another entry. But scanning through the rest of the table, I don't see another row with \"joe lauzon.\" So this must be the only one.\n\nTherefore, since both numbers in Row 1 for Joe Lauzon match the claim, the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Joe Lauzon's fight statistics, we locate his row and check the relevant columns.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Fighter:** The claim refers to \"joe lauzon,\" so we search for this name in the table.\n2. **Locate the Row:** Found in Row 1 with fighter: joe lauzon.\n3. **Check Fights of the Night:** The value is 5, matching the claim's \"5 fights of the night.\"\n4. **Check Knockouts of the Night:** The value is 1, matching the claim's \"1 knockout of the night.\"\n\nBoth statistics align perfectly with the claim, confirming its validity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Fights of the night\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"joe lauzon have 4 knockout\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"joe lauzon,\" so I should look for that fighter in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see Row 1: fighter: joe lauzon. That's where Joe Lauzon is listed. \n\nNow, the claim says he has \"4 knockout.\" Looking at the table columns, I need to identify which column tracks knockouts per night. The relevant columns for each row are fights of the night, knockouts of the night, submissions of the night, and awards total. Since the claim mentions knockouts, the key column here is \"knockouts of the night.\"\n\nSo, I go to Row 1 and check the \"knockouts of the night\" value. According to the table, Joe Lauzon has 1 knockout that night.\n\nThe claim states he has 4, but the table shows only 1. That means the claim is incorrect because it's not matching the actual number listed in the table. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"knockouts of the night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"2 submission of the night occur when the fighter be matt wiman.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that there are exactly two submissions attributed to Matt Wiman in one of his fights. So, my task is to check Matt Wiman's row in the table and see if he has two submission wins.\n\nLooking through the table, I should find the row for Matt Wiman. Scanning each fighter's name... Here it is: Row 20: fighter: matt wiman.\n\nNow, focusing on his data. The columns relevant here are \"submission of the night,\" but in the table, it's listed as \"submissions of the night.\" I need to check how many times Matt Wiman has submitted his opponents in a single fight. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about submissions occurring when the fighter *is* Matt Wiman. So perhaps it's the number of submissions he caused in one event.\n\nWait, actually, each row seems to represent a single fight or event for the fighter, right? Or maybe each row is their overall stats. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf each row is a fighter's overall record, then \"submission of the night\" would be how many times they've submitted in their career. But that doesn't make much sense because the number seems low for some fighters and high for others. Alternatively, perhaps each row represents a single event or fight where these stats were recorded.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The term \"submission of the night\" likely refers to how many submissions Matt Wiman has made in a particular fight. So if he had two submission wins in one event, that would be two. But looking at Row 20: fighter: matt wiman, his stats are:\n\nfights_of_the_night: 2\nknockouts_of_the_night: 3\nsubmissions_of_the_night: 0\n\nWait, submissions of the night is zero? That doesn't make sense for two submissions. Maybe I misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a single fight, and \"submission of the night\" is how many times he submitted in that fight. So if Matt Wiman had two submissions in one event, then that would be two. But looking at his data, it's 0. That contradicts the claim. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The column for Matt Wiman is \"submissions_of_the_night\": 0. So he has zero submissions in whatever context this refers to. Therefore, if the claim says two submissions occurred when the fighter is Matt Wiman, but according to his record, it's zero, then the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured differently, and each row represents a fight where these stats are from that particular fight, not overall. So for example, in one of Matt Wiman's fights, he had two submissions. But looking at Row 20: fighter: matt wiman, it shows he has zero submissions of the night.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me look at another fighter as a reference. For instance, Georges St-Pierre (Row 23) has 3 fights, with 1 knockout and 1 submission each. So if Matt Wiman is supposed to have two submissions in one fight, but according to his row, he has zero. Therefore, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"submission of the night\" refers to how many times he was submitted by others, not how many he submitted opponents. That could change things. But that doesn't seem to make much sense either because typically submissions are wins, but sometimes it can refer to being submitted as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each row is per fight, and \"submission of the night\" indicates whether he submitted someone or not in that particular fight. So if in one fight he did two submissions, that would be a high number. But according to his data, it's zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about him being submitted twice, but that's less common as a term. Usually, submissions are counted as wins or losses.\n\nGiven all this confusion, I think the key point is that Matt Wiman has zero submissions in whatever context the table uses, so if the claim states he had two, then it's incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were 2 submission of the night when the fighter was Matt Wiman. Checking his row in the table shows \"submissions_of_the_night\" as 0.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Look for Matt Wiman's row to find \"submission_of_the_night\" or similar.\n2. **Analyze Submissions**: His submissions count is 0, contradicting the claim of 2.\n3. **Conclusion**: Since his submission count doesn't match the claim, it is deemed false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"submissions_of_the_night\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
