    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"during season 2000 - 1, Kanto Gakuin University was the winner, the title was the 37th, and attendance was not available.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into three parts:\n1. Season: 2000 - 1\n2. Winner: Kanto Gakuin University\n3. Title: 37th\n4. Attendance: Not available\n\nWait, actually, it's four points because the title is a specific number and attendance is another condition. So I need to check each of these.\n\nLooking at the table rows, each row represents a season with various details like title (which seems to be the event number), season years, winner, runner-up, venue, and attendance.\n\nI should look for the row where \"season: 2000 - 1\" is mentioned. Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 12: 41st, 2004-5\nRow 13: 42nd, 2005-6\nRow 14: 43rd, 2006-7\nRow 15: 44th, 2007-8\nRow 16: 45th, 2008-9\nRow 17: 46th, 2009-10\nRow 18: 47th, 2010-11\nRow 19: 48th, 2011-12\nRow 20: 49th, 2012-13\n\nWait, I don't see a row with \"season: 2000 - 1\". Maybe it's further down? Let me check again. Wait, the table starts from Row 1 as 30th, 1993-4 and goes up to Row 20 as 49th, 2012-13.\n\nSo, I need to see if there is a row for season 2000 -1. Maybe it's not in the provided data? Let me check each season:\n\nLooking at the \"season: year-range\" column:\nRow 1: 1993-4\n...\nRow 8: 2000-1\nAh, I see now. I might have skipped over Row 8.\n\nRow 8: title: 37th, season: 2000 - 1 details, winner: Kanto Gakuin University, score: 42 -15, runner-up: Hosei, venue: National Stadium Tokyo, attendance: n/a.\n\nSo yes, there is a row for 2000-1. Now check the winner: it's Kanto Gakuin University, which matches the claim. The title is 37th, so that's correct too.\n\nAttendance is listed as \"n / a\" in Row 8, meaning not available, which aligns with the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the relevant cells in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"meiji win the 32nd title, while waseda be the runner - up.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about Meiji winning the 32nd title, and the second part is about Waseda being the runner-up.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row to find where these details are mentioned. Each row corresponds to a different year and has several attributes like title number, season, winner, runner-up, etc.\n\nStarting with the 32nd title, I need to look for rows that mention the 32nd title. Scanning through, Row 3 says \"title: 32nd\" which matches. So the relevant row is row_index 3. Now, checking the winner column in this row, it's Meiji. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if Waseda was the runner-up for the 32nd title. Looking at the same row (Row 3), the runner-up is Waseda as well. So that matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait a second, but sometimes multiple rows could have the same title number? No, each row seems to be consecutive from 30th up to 49th. So the 32nd is unique and appears only in Row 3. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as Meiji won the 32nd title and Waseda was the runner-up.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim about a table is true or false. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions: \"at the national stadium tokyo venue, during season 1995 - 6 detail, the title be 32nd and the runner up be waseda.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if there's a row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: title, season (with a range), winner, score, runner-up, venue, and attendance. The claim specifies the season as 1995 - 6 details, which probably corresponds to \"season: 1995 - 6 details\" in one of the rows.\n\nI'll go through each row starting from 1 until I find the correct year and then check the relevant columns for that row.\n\nRow 1: 30th, 1993-4 details... Doesn't match 1995.\nRow 2: 31st, 1994-5... No.\nRow 3: Title is 32nd, season: 1995 -6 details. That's the one we need to check further.\n\nNow, for Row 3, which is the 32nd title, season 1995 -6 details. Let's see the winner and runner-up.\n\nWinner: meiji\nRunner-up: waseda\n\nThe claim says the runner-up is waseda, which matches this row. The title being 32nd also matches.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by Row 3. So, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant for this verification. Looking back, each row has the following columns: title, season, winner, score, runner-up, venue, and attendance.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific pieces of information:\n\n1. Venue is national stadium tokyo.\n2. Season 1995 -6 details.\n3. Title is 32nd.\n4. Runner-up is waseda.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a column in the table. So, I need to map each part of the claim to their respective columns and rows.\n\nFor the venue: The 'venue' column has \"national stadium , tokyo\" which is what's specified in the claim. So, for the relevant row (3), this cell is important.\n\nSeason: The 'season' column has \"1995 - 6 details.\" This matches exactly, so that's another relevant cell.\n\nTitle: The 'title' column has \"32nd,\" which matches the claim. Another relevant cell.\n\nRunner-up: The 'runner - up' column in Row 3 is waseda, as per the table. So that's also relevant.\n\nI think I need to include all four columns (season, title, runner-up, venue) from Row 3 as relevant cells because each part of the claim ties into one of these columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the specified conditions against the table. All aspects match in Row 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the season 2010 - 11 detail have a title of 47th and the runner - up be waseda.\" So I need to verify two things from the table:\n\n1. The row corresponding to the season 2010-11 has a title of 47th.\n2. In that same row, the runner-up is Waseda.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with each row representing a different year or season. Each row has several columns: title, season (which includes the year and number), winner, score, runner-up, venue, etc.\n\nI need to locate the row where the season is 2010 -11. Let me go through each row until I find that specific combination.\n\nRow 1: 30th, 1993\n...\nContinuing down, Row 18: title 47th, season 2010-11 details. So yes, the first part of the claim checks out\u2014title is indeed 47th for that season.\n\nNext, I need to check who the runner-up was in that row. From the table's row 18 (which is actually row index 18?), wait no\u2014the rows are numbered from 1 to 20, but their indices in the list might be different. Wait, looking back at the data, each row starts with a title like \"Row 1: title:...\", so Row 1 corresponds to the first entry.\n\nSo for season 2010-11, which is the 47th title (row 18), I need to check the runner-up column. From the table:\n\nIn row 18, the details are:\ntitle: 47th,\nseason: 2010 -11,\nwinner: teikyo,\nscore:17 -14,\nrunner - up: waseda,\nvenue: national stadium , tokyo , tokyo,\nattendance:25458.\n\nSo yes, the runner-up is Waseda. That matches the claim.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up row numbers. The table lists rows from 1 to 20. So the 47th title would be in row 18? Wait, no\u2014row numbering might be based on the season number. Let's recount:\n\nRow 1: 30th\n...\nRow 12:41st\nRow13:42nd\nRow14:43rd\nRow15:44th\nRow16:45th\nRow17:46th\nRow18:47th, which is season 2010-11. So yes, row index 18 (if rows start at 1) would be the correct one.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":17, \"column_name\":\"runner - up\"}]}",

Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"2010 - 11 detail season have a runner - up of tokai , and a title of 47th.\"\n\nSo, two things are being claimed here:\n1. The season marked as \"2010 - 11 details\" has Tokai as the runner-up.\n2. This same season is titled the \"47th.\"\n\nI should look for the row corresponding to the season 2010 - 11 details in the table.\n\nLooking through each row, I find that Row 18 corresponds to title: 47th, season: 2010 - 11 details, winner: teikyo, etc. So the season part of the claim matches this row.\n\nNow, checking the runner-up for this row. According to the table, the runner-up is waseda. However, the claim says the runner-up is Tokai. That doesn't match. \n\nWait, let me double-check the table. Row 18: winner is teikyo, score is 17 -14, runner-up is waseda. So the runner-up isn't Tokai as claimed.\n\nAdditionally, the title of season 2010 -11 is indeed the 47th, so that part is correct.\n\nSince one part (runner-up) doesn't match and the other (title) does, the overall claim is partially incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two facts about a specific row in the table.

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table structure.\n\nThe claim says: \"2010 - 2011 detail be the season have kanto gakuin university as the winner , with an attendance of n / a , and a title of 37th.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table. Let me break down the claim into key points:\n\n1. Season is 2010 - 2011.\n2. The details for that season should be present.\n3. Kanto Gakuin University is the winner.\n4. Attendance is 'n / a'.\n5. The title (row number) is 37th.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different year or season, with various attributes like title, season, details, winner, score, runner-up, venue, and attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to find the row that corresponds to the 2010 - 2011 season. Let me scan through the table rows:\n\nRow 12: 2004\nRow 13: 2005\nRow 14: 2006\nRow 15: 2007\nRow 16: 2008\nRow 17: 2009\nRow 18: 2010 - 11 details, winner: teikyo...\nWait, row 18 is titled 47th, season 2010 - 11 details.\n\nHold on, that might not align with the claim. Wait, let me recount the rows to make sure I'm getting the right season for each title.\n\nThe table starts from Row 1 as 30th, then 31st, up to Row 20 as 49th. Each row seems to correspond to a specific season. For example:\n\nRow 1: 1993 - 4 details\nRow 2: 1994 - 5 details\n...\nRow 12: 2004 - 5 details\nRow 13: 2005 - 6 details\nRow 14: 2006 -7\nRow 15: 2007-8\nRow 16: 2008-9\nRow 17: 2009-10\nRow 18: 2010 -11 details\nWait, but the title in row 18 is 47th, which would be season 2010-11.\n\nBut the claim refers to \"2010 - 2011 detail\", so that's probably referring to row 18. However, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at Row 17: title 46th, season 2009 -10 details\nRow 18: title 47th, season 2010 -11 details\n\nSo yes, the 2010-11 season is in row 18.\n\nNow, according to the claim, Kanto Gakuin University should be the winner. Let me check row 18's winner. From the table:\n\nRow 18: winner: teikyo, score:17-14, runner-up: waseda.\n\nSo the winner is Teikyo, not Kanto Gakuin University. That already contradicts one part of the claim.\n\nAdditionally, the title in row 18 is 47th, but the claim says \"37th\". So that's another discrepancy.\n\nAlso, the attendance for row 18 is 25458, which isn't 'n / a'. So all parts of the claim don't align with row 18.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the correct row. Let me make sure:\n\nThe title starts from 30th upwards. So Row 1:30th, Row2:31st... up to Row20:49th.\n\nThe claim refers to \"2010 -2011 detail\", which would correspond to season 2010-11, likely around 47th title (since 2010-11 is after 2009-10, which was 46th). So row18 is indeed the one for 2010-11.\n\nBut in that row, the winner is Teikyo, not Kanto Gakuin. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at Row17: title=46th, season=2009-10, winner=teikyo\nRow18: title=47th, season=2010-11, winner=teikyo\n\nSo both those rows have Teikyo as the winner. So the claim says Kanto Gakuin is the winner for 2010-11, which doesn't match.\n\nAlso, the attendance in Row18 is 25458, not 'n/a', so that's another issue.\n\nAdditionally, the title in row18 is 47th, but the claim mentions 37th. So that's inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, none of the cells in row18 support all parts of the claim. Wait, let me check if any other rows might fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the seasons. Let me look for a row with season 2010-11.\n\nLooking at Row17:2009-10\nRow18:2010-11\nYes, only row18 has 2010-11.\n\nSo in that row, winner is Teikyo, not Kanto Gakuin. So the claim is incorrect on that front.\n\nAlso, the title is 47th, not 37th as per the claim.\n\nThe attendance is also not 'n/a', it's 25458.\n\nTherefore, the claim has multiple inaccuracies: wrong winner, wrong title, and actual attendance isn't 'n/a'.\n\nSo overall, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table:\n\nRow 3: title is 32nd, season: 1995 - 6 details, winner: Meiji, score: 43 - 9, runner-up: Waseda.\n\nWait, that doesn't match the claim. The claim says the loser (runner-up) is Hosei, but in Row 3, the runner-up is Waseda.\n\nLet me check all rows to ensure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I misread the row numbers or columns.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: 30th title, Meiji wins.\n- Row 2: 31st, Daito Bunka U wins, runner-up is Meiji.\n- Row3:32nd, Meiji wins, runner-up Waseda.\n- Row4:33rd, Meiji wins, runner-up Waseda.\n- Row5:34th, Kanto Gakuin U wins, runner-up Meiji.\n- Row6:35th, Kanto Gakuin U wins, runner-up Meiji.\n- Row7:36th, Keio wins, runner-up Kanto Gakuin U.\n- Row8:37th, Kanto Gakuin U wins, runner-up Hosei.\n- Row9:38th, Kanto Gakuin U wins, runner-up Waseda.\n- Row10:39th, Waseda wins, runner-up Kanto Gakuin U.\n- Row11:40th, Kanto Gakuin U wins, runner-up Waseda.\n- Row12:41st, Waseda wins, runner-up Kanto Gakuin U, attendance is 35462.\n- Row13:42nd, Waseda wins, runner-up Kanto Gakuin U, attendance 30163.\n- Row14:43rd, Kanto Gakuin U wins, runner-up Waseda, attendance 31954.\n- Row15:44th, Waseda wins, runner-up Keio, attendance 23694.\n- Row16:45th, Waseda wins, runner-up Teikyo, attendance 22344.\n- Row17:46th, Teikyo wins, runner-up Tokai, attendance 17569.\n- Row18:47th, Teikyo wins, runner-up Waseda, attendance 25458.\n- Row19:48th, Teikyo wins, runner-up Tenri, attendance 14407.\n- Row20:49th, Teikyo wins, runner-up Tsukuba, attendance 20050.\n\nNow, the claim is about the 32nd title. Looking at Row3, it's the 32nd title, and Meiji is the winner, not the loser (runner-up). The runner-up there is Waseda, not Hosei.\n\nHosei appears as a runner-up in Row8:37th title, where Kanto Gakuin U wins over Hosei. So Hosei was a runner-up in that game, but it's not related to the 32nd title.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems incorrect because Meiji is the winner of the 32nd title, and the runner-up isn't Hosei.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
