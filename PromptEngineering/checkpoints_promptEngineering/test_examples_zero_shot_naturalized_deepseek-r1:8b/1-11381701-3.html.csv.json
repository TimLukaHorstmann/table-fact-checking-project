    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"bada have a value of 0.05% on july - 13.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each row in the table and check for any mentions of \"bada\" around July 13th. The rows are labeled from 1 to 7, each with different sources, dates, methods, and percentages for various platforms like iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian/Series 40, bada, Windows, and Other.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's from May 13, so the date is May, not July. So, this row doesn't have anything to do with July 13th. Next, Row 2 is also May 13, same as above\u2014irrelevant for July.\n\nMoving on to Row 3: August 13, which is after July. The date here is August, so it's not the right month either. So, this row can be disregarded for now.\n\nRow 4 is also May 13, so again, irrelevant. Now, looking at Row 5: This one says July 13 under \"date,\" and the method is \"browsing.\" The column for bada here is 0.05%, which matches the claim exactly. So, this row directly supports the statement.\n\nRow 6 is also July 13, but it's from StatCounter, so I need to check what they have for bada. Looking at their numbers: bada is 4.64%. That doesn't match 0.05%, so this row contradicts the claim a bit. However, since Row 5 already matches, maybe that's enough?\n\nRow 7 is March 13, which is before July, so it's not relevant.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions july - 13, and in Row 5, bada is indeed 0.05%. So even though another row (Row 6) might have a different value, as long as one of the rows supports the claim fully, I think that should be sufficient for it to be TRUE.\n\nBut hold on, the claim says \"have a value of 0.05% on july - 13.\" So I need to make sure that this exact percentage is in the table for bada during July 13th. Row 5 matches both the date and the value. Therefore, it's fully supported.\n\nSo, even though another row (Row 6) shows a different number, but since the claim is specifically about a certain source (Net Market Share), which does have 0.05% for bada on July 13th, that makes the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bada\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"window have a percentage of 1.85% when other be 0.7%\". It seems to compare two percentages: one for Windows and another for \"other\" devices.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where \"Windows\" and \"Other\" are mentioned. \n\nRow 1 mentions Windows as 3.00%, but it doesn't list \"Other\".\nRow 2: Windows is 2.9%, other is 0.3%. Not matching.\nRow 3: Windows is 3.3%, other is 0.2%.\nRow 4: Windows is 3.2%, other is 0.0%. Doesn't match.\nRow 5: No \"Other\" mentioned here; it only shows percentages for each OS, including Windows at 1.15% and other at 0.19%.\nRow 6: Other is 2.66%, but no Windows data here.\nRow 7: Other is 0.7%, but does this row have Windows? Yes, Windows is listed as 1.85%. So here, Windows is 1.85% and other is 0.7%.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 7, \"windows\" is 1.85% and \"other\" is 0.7%. That exactly matches the claim. But I need to verify if this row is correctly identified.\n\nHowever, I should check each relevant column for \"Windows\" and \"Other\". Each row has different columns: for example, Row 5's method is \"browsing\", which might not align with other rows' methods like \"units sold\" or \"subscribers.\" But the claim doesn't specify the method, so it could apply to any of them.\n\nLooking again at Row 7, under source: wikimedia, date: mar -13, method: browsing. The \"other\" category here is 0.7% and windows is 1.85%. That's a direct match. So the claim should be TRUE because there's a row where Windows is 1.85% when other is 0.7%.\n\nWait, but in Row 7, other is 0.7%, and Windows is 1.85%. The claim states \"window have a percentage of 1.85% when other be 0.7%\", so this seems to fit exactly.\n\nI should check if any other rows could also satisfy this condition. For example, in Row 6, other is 2.66%, but Windows isn't mentioned there. In Row 5, Windows is 1.15%, and other is 0.19%. Not matching. In Row 4, other is 0.0% and Windows is 3.2%. Doesn't match. So the only row that matches both percentages exactly is Row 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 7's data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"windows\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"other\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim is: \"international data corporation show that blackberry have a percentage of 2.9% on may - 13.\"\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. There are seven rows, each with different sources and dates, all from May to July 2013. Each row has various columns like source, date, method, and then OS percentages.\n\nThe claim mentions \"international data corporation\" as the source, which is Row 4 in the table. The date is May -13, so I'm looking for Row 4 because it's the only one with a May date from that source. \n\nIn Row 4, the columns are: source (idc), date (may-13), method (units shipped), and then the OS percentages. So the relevant column here would be \"Blackberry\" since the claim is about BlackBerry's percentage.\n\nLooking at the numbers in the table for BlackBerry in Row 4: it says 2.9%. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nI should check other rows to make sure there isn't another source or method that might also show 2.9% for May, but since Row 4 is the only one from IDC and May-13, and its value is 2.9%, the claim is supported.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in Row 4 under \"Blackberry\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Row 4 of the table, which corresponds to the source (International Data Corporation), date (May -13), and method (units shipped), lists BlackBerry at 2.9%. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Blackberry\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, let me break down what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: Android usage at 25.28% and Windows usage at 1.15%. So I need to check if these exact percentages are present in the table for those platforms.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has different sources and dates, and they track various platforms like iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Symbian/Series 40, Bada, Windows, and Other. The claim is about Android and Windows specifically.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to see if these numbers match. Let's start with the rows provided:\n\nRow 1: Source is comscore reports (US only), date May-13, method subscribers. For US iOS: 39.20%, Android:52.40%, etc. So here, Android is much higher than 25%, so this doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 2: Gartner, May-13, units sold. Here, Android is 74.4%, which is way higher than 25.28%. Windows is 2.9%, close but not exactly 1.15%.\n\nRow 3: Gartner, Aug-13, units sold. Android at 79.0%, so that's even higher.\n\nRow 4: IDC, May-13, units shipped. Android at 75.0%, which again doesn't match the claim's 25.28%. Windows here is 3.2%.\n\nRow5: Net Market Share, July-13, method browsing. Android is 25.28%, and Windows is 1.15%. Oh, this exactly matches both numbers in the claim.\n\nRow6: StatCounter, July-13, browsing. Android is 38.34%, which doesn't match, and Windows is 1.52%.\n\nRow7: Wikimedia, March-13, browsing. Android 25.93% and Windows 1.85%. Close but not exact for Android, but the claim uses \"use\" which might mean usage or market share, so it's about matching percentages.\n\nWait, in Row5, Android is exactly 25.28% and Windows is exactly 1.15%, which matches the claim exactly. So that row supports both parts of the claim.\n\nOther rows don't have those exact numbers except Row5. Also, I need to check if there are any other rows where this might apply, but looking through, only Row5 has the correct figures.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be in Row5, columns for Android and Windows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 5, which has both Android at 25.28% and Windows at 1.15%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Android\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Windows\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's saying that the highest percentage for window usage is reported by \"net market share.\" To verify this, I need to find out which row in the table corresponds to net market share and check their window usage percentages.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n- Row 1: Source is comscore reports (US only), date May 13. It doesn't mention windows as a category, so probably not relevant.\n- Row 2: Gartner, May 13, units sold. No specific info on windows except it's there, but I need to see the numbers.\n- Row 3: Gartner, Aug 13, units sold. Again, mentions windows but let me check their percentage.\n- Row 4: IDC, May 13, units shipped. Includes windows with 3.2%, so that's a number to compare.\n- Row 5: Net Market Share, July 13, browsing method. Here, they have \"windows\" as 1.15%. So this is where net market share reports it.\n- Row 6: StatCounter, July 13, browsing. They have windows at 1.52%.\n- Row 7: Wikimedia, March 13, browsing. Windows are at 1.85%.\n\nNow, the claim says \"the largest window use percentage comes from Net Market Share.\" So I need to see if 1.15% (Row 5) is higher than all others.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\n- Row 3: Gartner August: windows 3.3%\n- Row 4: IDC May: windows 3.2%\n- Row 6: StatCounter July: 1.52%\n- Row 7: Wikimedia March: 1.85%\n\nWait, the highest number I see is in row 3 with 3.3% and row 4 at 3.2%. Both are higher than row 5's 1.15%.\n\nSo, according to the table, Net Market Share (row 5) doesn't have the largest window use percentage.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions \"bada\" having a specific value of 25.28% on May 13th. So I need to check the table for any row that falls under May and relates to bada's percentage.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a source, date, method, and then various percentages including bada. Let me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: May -13, method is subscribers. It shows bada as \"n/a\". So not 25.28%.\n\nRow 2: Also May -13, but the method is units sold. The bada value here is 0.7%. That's way lower than 25.28%.\n\nRow 3: August -13, so not May.\n\nRow 4: May -13, method is units shipped. Bada is listed as \"n/a\" again. So no match.\n\nRow 5: July -13, which is after May, so irrelevant for the date in question.\n\nRows 6 and 7 are for July -13 as well, so they don't apply.\n\nWait a second, none of the May rows have bada at 25.28%. The closest I see is Row 2, but that's 0.7%, which isn't close to 25.28. Also, the claim mentions \"units shipped\" and \"method\", but in Row 4 for May -13, bada is n/a.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Maybe the claim refers to a different method? For instance, does any row with May -13 use a different method that has bada at 25.28%?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 1: subscribers\nRow 2: units sold\nRow 4: units shipped\n\nNone of these have bada at 25.28%. The only Row with May -13 and bada is Row 4, which is units shipped but shows n/a for bada.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me check Row 5 again\u2014it's July, so not May. So in all May rows (Rows 1,2,4), bada doesn't reach 25.28%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Is there any May row where bada is around 25%? From the table:\n\n- Row 1: bada n/a\n- Row 2: 0.7%\n- Row 4: n/a\n\nSo no, none of them have 25.28%. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"bada\" has a value of 25.28% on May -13. Checking each relevant row in the table for May -13:\n\n- Row 1 (subscribers): bada is n/a\n- Row 2 (units sold): bada is 0.7%\n- Row 4 (units shipped): bada is n/a\n\nNone of these rows show a value close to or equal to 25.28%.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"Windows have a percentage of 1.80% lower when other be 0.3%.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim is saying. It seems like it's comparing the Windows market share to another category (other) under certain conditions. Specifically, it mentions that when \"other\" is 0.3%, Windows has a percentage of 1.80%. So, perhaps it's suggesting that Windows' percentage is lower than others by 1.8% when other is at 0.3%.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"Windows\" and \"other,\" so I should focus on rows where both these categories are present.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Sources comscore (US only). It has a Windows percentage of 3.00%, but no \"other\" value listed except it says other is n/a.\nRow 2: Gartner, May-13, units sold. Windows is 2.9%, other is 0.3%. This looks relevant because it shows both categories and their percentages.\nRow 3: Gartner, Aug-13. Windows is 3.3%, other 0.2%. Doesn't match the claim's numbers but maybe not directly related.\nRow 4: IDC, May-13. Windows 3.2%, other 0.0%. Not matching 1.80% and 0.3%.\nRow 5: Net market share, July-13. Windows is 1.15%, other is 0.19%. Doesn't match.\nRow 6: Statcounter, July-13. Windows is 1.52%, other 2.66%. No match.\nRow 7: Wikimedia, Mar-13. Windows 1.85%, other 0.70%. Not matching.\n\nThe claim refers to \"Windows have a percentage of 1.80% lower when other be 0.3%.\" Looking at the data, in Row 2, Windows is 2.9% and other is 0.3%. So, if we subtract other (0.3%) from Windows (2.9%), that's 2.6%, not 1.80%. Alternatively, maybe it's saying when other is 0.3%, Windows is 1.80% lower than others. Wait, the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim means that Windows' percentage is 1.80% less than \"other\" when other is 0.3%. So in Row 2, Windows is 2.9%, other is 0.3%. The difference is 2.6%, not 1.8%. So maybe it's not supported here.\n\nLooking elsewhere, in Row 4: Windows is 3.2%, other is 0.0%. If other is 0.3%, this row doesn't have that value. Similarly, no rows show Windows as 1.80% when others are 0.3%.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the claim. Perhaps it's saying that the percentage of Windows is 1.80% lower than \"other\" when other is at 0.3%. So in Row 2: Windows is 2.9%, other is 0.3%. So if other is 0.3%, then Windows is 0.3% higher than others (since 0.3 to 2.9 is an increase of 2.6%). That's not a decrease, so it doesn't support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when \"other\" is 0.3%, Windows is at 1.8%. But looking through all rows, I don't see any where Windows is 1.80% with other being 0.3%.\n\nWait, in Row 2: Windows is 2.9%, other 0.3%. So if we subtract other from Windows, it's 2.6%, not 1.8%. So the claim doesn't hold here.\n\nLooking for any row where Windows is 1.80% and other is 0.3%. The only row with other 0.3% is Row 2 (Windows 2.9%) and maybe others? No, other rows don't have other at 0.3%.\n\nWait, in Row 4: other is 0.0%, Windows 3.2%. If other were 0.3%, then perhaps the difference would be more. But it's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that when \"other\" is 0.3%, Windows is at 1.80%? Looking through all rows, I don't see any row where Windows is exactly 1.80% and other is exactly 0.3%.\n\nSo the claim isn't supported by the data provided. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check Row 5: Windows is 1.15%, other 0.19%. No. Row 6: Windows 1.52%, other 2.66%. No. Row 7: Windows 1.85%, other 0.70%.\n\nSo none of these rows support the claim. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any row where Windows' market share is 1.80% when \"other\" is 0.3%. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Windows\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Other\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
