    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"kweku adoboli work for ubs in london, united kingdom.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see if it matches this claim.\n\nRow 1: Yasuo Hamanaka - Doesn't match because the name is different and he's from Japan.\nRow 2: Kweku Adoboli. His country is London, UK. The institution is UBS. The date is 2011, loss is 2.3 billion, etc. So this row matches the claim.\nRow 3: Nick Leeson - Different name and country, so no.\nRow 4: toshihide iguchi - Different name and country, not relevant.\nRow 5: Boris Picano - Not matching.\nRow 6: John Rusnak - Different name.\n\nSo only Row 2 is relevant. Now, I need to check the columns related to the claim. The claim mentions \"work for\" which relates to the institution column because that's where the employer is listed.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are in row 2, specifically the 'institution' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2, Column 'institution' as it correctly states Kweku Adoboli worked at UBS in London, UK.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"institution\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
