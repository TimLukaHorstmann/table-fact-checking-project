    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and win every time.\" So, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. It mentions Wozniak competing in Canada five times and winning all those matches. From the table, I need to check if there are five rows where Wozniak is the winner in Canada. Also, each of these wins should be a separate competition.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about different tournaments. The columns we need to look at are: outcome (which shows if she won or was a runner-up), date, tournament location, surface, opponent, and score. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if Wozniak is listed as the winner in Canada. Let's scan the 'tournament' column for any that mention Canada.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Tournament is Lachine, Canada. Outcome is winner. So this is one win in Canada.\nRow 2: Hamilton, Canada. She lost, so outcome is runner-up. Not a win.\nRow 3: Pelham, USA. Runner-up. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Victoria, Mexico. Winner, but not in Canada.\nRow 5: Mexico City, Mexico. Runner-up.\nRow 6: Toronto, Canada. Winner. That's two wins so far.\nRow 7: Hamilton, Canada. Winner. Now three wins.\nRow 8: Ashland, USA. Winner, but not Canada.\nRow 9: Pittsburgh, USA. Winner, not in Canada.\nRow 10: Redding, USA. Runner-up.\nRow 11: Vancouver, Canada. Winner. Fourth win.\nRow 12: Nassau, Bahamas. Winner, but not Canada.\n\nSo, the tournaments where Wozniak won and were held in Canada are rows 1,6,7,11. That's four wins, not five. The claim says she won every time in Canada five times. So that part isn't fully supported\u2014only four wins. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak competed in Canada five times and won each match. However, checking the table shows she only won four matches in Canada.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim is: \"Wozniak compete in 5 tournaments in 2005 and win 3 of them.\" So, I'm looking for information about how many tournaments Wozniak played in 2005 and how many she won.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row to check the 'tournament' column for the year 2005. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: July 17, 2005, Hamilton, Canada.\nRow 4: October 16, 2005, Victoria, Mexico.\nRow 5: October 23, 2005, Mexico City, Mexico.\nRow 6: November 13, 2005, Toronto, Canada.\n\nWait, that's four tournaments in 2005. But the claim says five. Did I miss any?\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\nRows are numbered from 1 to 12. Let me check each date for 2005.\n\nRow 2: July 17, 2005.\nRow 4: October 16, 2005.\nRow 5: October 23, 2005.\nRow 6: November 13, 2005.\n\nThat's four tournaments in 2005. The claim says five, so that might mean the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row. Let me check again. Row numbers:\n\n1: June 30, 2002\n2: July 17, 2005\n3: October 2, 2005\n4: October 16, 2005\n5: October 23, 2005\n6: November 13, 2005\n7: July 23, 2006\n8: October 1, 2006\n9: November 12, 2006\n10: March 23, 2008\n11: August 7, 2011\n12: March 17, 2012\n\nSo in 2005, rows 2,4,5,6 are the tournaments. That's four. The claim says five, so that would mean Wozniak didn't compete in five tournaments in 2005. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check if any other rows in 2005 might be included. Row 3: October 2, 2005, but it's a runner-up, and the tournament is Pelham, US. So that's another one. Wait, so rows 2,3,4,5,6 are all in 2005? Let me count:\n\nRow 2: July\nRow 3: October 2\nRow 4: October 16\nRow 5: October 23\nRow 6: November 13\n\nThat's five tournaments in 2005. Oh, I see, I missed row 3 earlier. So Wozniak competed in five tournaments in 2005.\n\nNow, checking the outcomes:\n\nRow 2: Winner (so that's a win)\nRow 4: Winner\nRow 5: Runner-up (loss)\nRow 6: Winner\n\nWait, but row 3 is outcome: runner-up. So total wins would be rows 2,4,6\u2014three wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: Wozniak competed in five tournaments in 2005 and won three of them.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each relevant row for the year 2005 and counting both the number of tournaments and the outcomes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and then check if the table supports it.\n\nThe claim says that Wozniak has only competed once in the Bahamas and won that match. So, I need to look for any matches involving Wozniak in the Bahamas according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 12 rows, each representing a different tournament with various details. The columns include outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nI should go through each row and check if any of them involve Wozniak playing in the Bahamas. However, I notice that the opponents mentioned in the table are names like Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, Soledad Esper\u00f3n, Olga Blahotov\u00e1, Olena Antypina, Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault, \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay, Victoria Azarenka, Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1, Jamie Hampton, and Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. None of these names are Wozniak.\n\nWait a minute, the claim is about Wozniak competing in the Bahamas. So I need to see if any row has \"Bahamas\" as the tournament location and whether she won that match.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Tournament is Lachine, Canada\nRow 2: Hamilton, Canada\nRow 3: Pelham, United States\nRow 4: Victoria, Mexico\nRow 5: Mexico City, Mexico\nRow 6: Toronto, Canada\nRow 7: Hamilton, Canada\nRow 8: Ashland, United States\nRow 9: Pittsburgh, United States\nRow 10: Redding, United States\nRow 11: Vancouver, Canada\nRow 12: Nassau, Bahamas\n\nAh, Row 12 is the only one with \"Bahamas\" as the tournament location. So Wozniak played in the Bahamas once, and according to that row, the outcome was a win.\n\nNow, checking the opponent for Row 12: Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. The score is 6-4, 7-5, which means Wozniak won.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Wozniak has only competed once in the Bahamas and she won that match.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"wozniak have be runner - up 3 time but never in canada\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Wozniak has been a runner-up three times but not in Canada. So, I need to check two things: whether she was a runner-up three times and whether any of those were specifically in Canada.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score. The relevant columns for this claim would be 'outcome' because we're interested in when she was a runner-up and 'tournament: ...' to see where those matches occurred.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to find instances where the outcome is 'runner - up'. Scanning from Row 1 to Row 12:\n\nRow 3: Runner-up, tournament location is Pelham, United States.\nRow 10: Runner-up, tournament in Redding, United States.\n\nWait, that's only two runner-up entries. Did I miss any? Let me check again.\n\nRows:\n- Row 3: Yes.\n- Row 10: Yes.\n- Any others? Hmm, let me look at all rows.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. For example, the initial table provided has 12 rows, but in the claim, it's about being runner-up three times. So perhaps there are three instances where Wozniak was a runner-up.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list each row with outcome:\n\n1. Winner\n2. Winner\n3. Runner-up (Row 3)\n4. Winner\n5. Runner-up (Row 5)\n6. Winner\n7. Winner\n8. Winner\n9. Winner\n10. Runner-up (Row 10)\n11. Winner\n12. Winner\n\nWait, that's only two runner-ups: Row 3 and Row 10. So the claim says she was a runner-up three times. That would be incorrect if there are only two instances.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 1: Winner\nRow 2: Winner\nRow 3: Runner-up\nRow 4: Winner\nRow 5: Runner-up\nRow 6: Winner\nRow 7: Winner\nRow 8: Winner\nRow 9: Winner\nRow 10: Runner-up\nRow 11: Winner\nRow 12: Winner\n\nSo only Rows 3, 5, and 10 are runner-ups. That's three times.\n\nWait, Row 5: outcome is runner-up. So that's three instances: 3,5,10. Okay, so she was a runner-up three times.\n\nNow, the next part of the claim is whether she was never a runner-up in Canada. So we need to check if any of these runner-up matches were in Canada.\n\nLooking at each runner-up row:\n\nRow 3: tournament in Pelham, United States.\nRow 5: tournament in Mexico City, Mexico.\nRow 10: tournament in Redding, United States.\n\nNone of these are in Canada. So she was a runner-up three times but not in Canada.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's any other runner-up in Canada. Looking through the table, I don't see any tournaments in Canada where outcome is runner-up except Row 11: tournament in Vancouver, Canada, but that's a winner. So no, none of her runner-ups are in Canada.\n\nSo the claim says she was a runner-up three times and never in Canada. That seems to be TRUE based on the table.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm each row again for runner-ups:\n\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 5: Yes (opponent Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri)\nRow 10: Yes\n\nThat's three. And none of these are in Canada. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as Wozniak was a runner-up three times, none occurring in Canada.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"wozniak have win 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012.\" So first, I'll need to check each row in the table to see if it relates to Wozniak's wins in that timeframe.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner, date June 30, 2002. The opponent is Beier Ko. The score is 6-0, 6-3. But I don't know if this is Wozniak or another player. Since the table doesn't specify who won each match, it's hard to tell if it's her.\n\nRow 2: Winner on July 17, 2005 in Hamilton, Canada. Opponent Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri. Score 6-1, 6-2. Again, not sure if this is Wozniak.\n\nRow 3: Runner-up on October 2, 2005 in Pelham, USA. Opponent Soledad Esper\u00f3n. Not relevant unless it's her losing, but the outcome isn't a win for her.\n\nRow 4: Winner on October 16, 2005 in Victoria, Mexico. Opponent Olga Blahotov\u00e1. Score 2-6, 6-0, 6-4. The score is unusual; maybe she won three sets? But again, unsure if it's Wozniak.\n\nRow 5: Runner-up on October 23, 2005 in Mexico City, Mexico. Opponent Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri. So she lost this match.\n\nRow 6: Winner on November 13, 2005 in Toronto, Canada. Opponent Olena Antypina. Score 6-4, 6-3. This seems like a win for her.\n\nRow 7: Winner on July 23, 2006 in Hamilton, Canada. Opponent Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault. Score 6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2. She won in three sets.\n\nRow 8: Winner on October 1, 2006 in Ashland, USA. Opponent \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay. Score 6-1, 7-6 (7-2). Another win for her.\n\nRow 9: Winner on November 12, 2006 in Pittsburgh, USA. Opponent Victoria Azarenka. Score 6-2, ret. She won and retired the opponent.\n\nRow 10: Runner-up on March 23, 2008 in Redding, USA. Opponent Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1. She lost this match.\n\nRows 11 and 12 are after 2012, so they don't count.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times she won between 2002 and 2012. From the table:\n\nRow 6: November 13, 2005 - win\nRow 7: July 23, 2006 - win\nRow 8: October 1, 2006 - win\nRow 9: November 12, 2006 - win\n\nThat's four wins. But the claim is that she has won nine times in that period. So unless there are more wins not listed here, it seems false.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some rows. Let me check again:\n\nRows 1-5: Only Row 6 is a definite win for her, perhaps others might be hers but since the table doesn't specify names, it's hard to confirm. Rows 6-9 are clear wins, that's four wins.\n\nSo she only has four wins in the given timeframe, not nine. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak won nine times between 2002 and 2012.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and loss every time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that Wozniak competed in Canada five times and lost every time. So, I need to check if there are at least five entries in the table where the tournament location is Canada, and in all those cases, the outcome was a loss.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a specific match. The columns relevant here are:\n\n- Row_index: To track which rows to look at.\n- Date: Not as important for this claim, but maybe useful for context.\n- Tournament: This is where I can check if it's in Canada.\n- Outcome: Whether Wozniak won or lost that particular match.\n\nSo, my first step is to go through each row and see which ones have the tournament location as Canada. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Lachine, Canada\nRow 2: Hamilton, Canada\nRow 3: Pelham, United States (not Canada)\nRow 4: Victoria, Mexico\nRow 5: Mexico City, Mexico\nRow 6: Toronto, Canada\nRow 7: Hamilton, Canada\nRow 8: Ashland, United States\nRow 9: Pittsburgh, United States\nRow 10: Redding, United States\nRow 11: Vancouver, Canada\nRow 12: Nassau, Bahamas\n\nFrom this, rows 1, 2, 6, and 7 have tournaments in Canada. That's four times, not five. So already, the claim is saying five times, but according to the table, there are only four matches in Canada.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I missed any rows. Rows 1 through 12: row 3 is Pelham (US), row 4 Mexico, row5 Mexico, row6 Toronto, row7 Hamilton, row8 US, row9 US, row10 US, row11 Vancouver, row12 Bahamas. So yes, only four times in Canada.\n\nBut the claim says five times, so that's already a discrepancy. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only four matches in Canada, not five.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Lachine, Canada - yes\nRow 2: Hamilton, Canada - yes\nRow 6: Toronto, Canada - yes\nRow7: Hamilton, Canada - yes\nThat's four rows. So four times, not five.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the count, but according to the table, it's four times.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if Wozniak lost all these matches. So, for each of those four rows, what was the outcome?\n\nLooking at row 1: outcome is winner (beaten Beier Ko 6-0,6-3). So she won.\nRow2: winner against Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri (6-1,6-2).\nRow6: winner against Olena Antypina (6-4,6-3).\nRow7: winner against Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault (6-1,6-7(5-7),6-2). So she lost the third set but still won overall.\n\nSo in all four of these matches in Canada, Wozniak won. Therefore, not only did she not lose every time, she actually won each time. That's another point against the claim.\n\nBut even if she had lost once or more in Canada, the fact that there are only four times is enough to make the claim false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because Wozniak competed in Canada four times, not five, and she didn't lose every time\u2014she actually won each of those matches.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Wozniak compete in 5 tournament in 2006 and win 3 of them.\" So, I'm looking for how many tournaments Wozniak played in 2006 and whether she won 3 out of those 5.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the relevant rows. Each row represents a tournament with details like outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament name, surface, opponent, and score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has \"outcome\", \"date\", \"tournament: ...\", etc. So, I need to check which rows correspond to 2006 and whether they are Wozniak's tournaments.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 1: June 30, 2002 - Lachine, Canada\nRow 2: July 17, 2005 - Hamilton, Canada\nRow 3: October 2, 2005 - Pelham, US\nRow 4: October 16, 2005 - Victoria, Mexico\nRow 5: October 23, 2005 - Mexico City, Mexico\nRow 6: November 13, 2005 - Toronto, Canada\nRow 7: July 23, 2006 - Hamilton, Canada\nRow 8: October 1, 2006 - Ashland, US\nRow 9: November 12, 2006 - Pittsburgh, US\nRow 10: March 23, 2008 - Redding, US\nRow 11: August 7, 2011 - Vancouver, Canada\nRow 12: March 17, 2012 - Nassau, Bahamas\n\nSo, the tournaments in 2006 are Row 7 and Row 8 and Row 9. Wait, let's check the dates:\n\nRow 7: July 23, 2006\nRow 8: October 1, 2006\nRow 9: November 12, 2006\n\nYes, these are in 2006.\n\nNow, I need to see who won these tournaments and whether it's Wozniak. The \"opponent\" column can help identify if she was the winner or not. But wait, the \"outcome\" column says 'winner' or 'runner-up', so that's more direct.\n\nRow 7: Outcome is winner.\nRow 8: Winner\nRow 9: Winner\n\nSo, in 2006, Wozniak won three tournaments: Hamilton (July), Ashland, and Pittsburgh. That's three wins.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"compete in 5 tournament\" and win 3 of them. But from the table, I see only three tournaments in 2006 where she was the winner. So that would mean she didn't compete in five; she competed in three and won all. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says five tournaments but she actually played three.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row's date:\n\n- Row 7: July 2006\n- Row 8: October 2006\n- Row 9: November 2006\n\nThat's only three tournaments in 2006 where she was the winner. So, she didn't compete in five; she competed in three and won all of them.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because she didn't compete in five tournaments but only three, and even then she won all three, not just three out of five.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Wozniak competed in 5 tournaments in 2006 and won 3. However, examining the table reveals that she participated in only 3 tournaments during that year (July, October, November) and won all three. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 2 time but lose.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out who \"wozniak\" refers to. Looking at the table, most of the opponents are women's names, like Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, Victoria Azarenka, etc., but there's one that stands out: Wozniak isn't listed as an opponent in any row. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Because I think Maria Sharapova is another famous name, but she's not here either. Alternatively, perhaps \"wozniak\" refers to someone else.\n\nWait, the table lists opponents like Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, Soledad Esper\u00f3n, Olga Blahotov\u00e1, Olena Antypina, Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault, \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay, Victoria Azarenka, Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1, Jamie Hampton, and Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. None of these are \"Wozniak.\" Maybe the claim is about a player named Wozniak who is not listed here, which would mean I can't verify from the table. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo and they meant another name. For example, Ana Ivanovic? Or maybe it's a different person entirely. Without knowing exactly who \"Wozniak\" refers to, it's hard to proceed. However, assuming \"Wozniak\" is a player in the table or related to it, I need to check their participation and results.\n\nWait, looking again, the row 12 has an opponent named Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. Maybe that's not relevant. Alternatively, perhaps \"wozniak\" refers to someone who played in the Bahamas but lost twice.\n\nThe claim says Wozniak competed only two times in the Bahamas and lost both times. So I need to look for entries where the tournament is in the Bahamas, check how many times she participated, and if she lost.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 12: outcome: winner, date: March 17, 2012, tournament: Nassau (Bahamas), surface: hard, opponent: Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. So Wozniak won in Nassau. But does that mean she only competed twice there? The table doesn't show another Bahamas tournament for her.\n\nWait, the claim says \"only compete in the bahamas 2 time but lose.\" So maybe the user is implying that she lost both times when she played in the Bahamas, but according to row 12, she won once. If she only played once and won, then the claim would be false because she didn't lose. Alternatively, if she played twice in the Bahamas, with one win and one loss, but the claim says \"only compete...but lose,\" implying she lost both times.\n\nBut from the table, there's only one entry for Nassau (Bahamas) where she was the winner against Aliz\u00e9 Cornet on March 17, 2012. So if that's her only appearance in the Bahamas, then she didn't lose both times\u2014she only played once and won. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the table. Let me check each row again for Bahamas tournaments.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 12: Nassau, Bahamas, winner.\n\nNo other rows mention Bahamas. So Wozniak (assuming it's the same person) played once in the Bahamas and won. Therefore, she didn't lose both times; she lost zero times there. Thus, the claim is false because she only competed once but didn't lose either time\u2014it was just one match where she won.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Wozniak\" refers to someone else who only played twice in the Bahamas and lost both, then I need to see if that's supported by the table. But from the table, there's no other mention of her playing in the Bahamas more than once or losing any matches there.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the claim is false because Wozniak didn't lose both times in the Bahamas\u2014she won once.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 2 time but lose\" is false. The table shows that Wozniak played once in Nassau, Bahamas, and won her match there.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says that Wozniak has been a winner three times but never in Canada. So, first, I need to check if there are any matches where Wozniak won three tournaments. Then, I need to verify whether those wins occurred in Canada or not.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match where someone is either the winner or runner-up. The columns include outcome (winner or runner-up), date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nI should go through each row to find any wins by Wozniak. Wait, but looking at the table, I don't see an entry for Wozniak. Hmm, that's confusing. The names listed in the opponents are Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, Soledad Esper\u00f3n, Olga Blahotov\u00e1, Olena Antypina, Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault, \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay, Victoria Azarenka, Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1 - Str\u00fdcov\u00e1, Jamie Hampton, and Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. None of these are Wozniak.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misremembering. Wait, is the claim about someone else? Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe Wozniak is a different person, but in this table, all winners are other players.\n\nSo, if none of the matches in the table are won by Wozniak, then the first part of the claim is incorrect because she never won three times here. But wait, I might be misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's about someone else with a similar name, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a different context. The key point is whether Wozniak has been a winner three times and whether any of those wins were in Canada.\n\nSince there are no matches where Wozniak won in this table, the first part of the claim (three wins) isn't supported. Therefore, regardless of whether she's never won in Canada, since she hasn't won three times at all here, the entire statement would be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row again. Each winner is different: Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault, \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay, Victoria Azarenka, Jamie Hampton, Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. None of these are Wozniak.\n\nSo, the claim's first part is incorrect because she hasn't won three times in the table. Therefore, the overall statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have lose 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says Wozniak lost 9 times between 2002 and 2012. So I need to find how many losses she had in that period based on the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Each row represents a match.\n- The 'outcome' column indicates if it was a win or loss (runner-up).\n- The years are from 2002 to 2012, so all rows up to 2012 should be considered. Wait, the last relevant row is Row 12 in March 2012.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Winner on June 30, 2002. So no loss here.\n\nRow 2: Winner on July 17, 2005. No loss.\n\nRow 3: Runner-up on October 2, 2005. That's one loss.\n\nRow 4: Winner on October 16, 2005. No loss.\n\nRow 5: Runner-up on October 23, 2005. Second loss.\n\nRow 6: Winner on November 13, 2005. No loss.\n\nRow 7: Winner on July 23, 2006. No loss.\n\nRow 8: Winner on October 1, 2006. No loss.\n\nRow 9: Winner on November 12, 2006. No loss.\n\nRow 10: Runner-up on March 23, 2008. Third loss.\n\nRow 11: Winner on August 7, 2011. No loss.\n\nRow 12: Winner on March 17, 2012. No loss.\n\nWait, but the claim is about losses between 2002 and 2012. So from Rows 3 to 10 are within that period.\n\nCounting the losses:\n\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 5: 2\n- Row 10: 3\n\nSo only three losses in total. That's way less than 9.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some rows or perhaps the user meant something else. Let me double-check if all relevant years are covered. The earliest is June 30, 2002, and the latest is March 17, 2012. So Rows 1-12 should be included.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe Wozniak had more losses not listed here? But the table seems to cover her matches during that time. Each row is a specific match result, so if she lost, it's recorded here. If she didn't lose in those years, then the total would indeed be three losses.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all runner-up outcomes:\n\nRow 3: Runner-up (1)\nRow 5: Runner-up (2)\nRow 10: Runner-up (3)\n\nSo only three times. Therefore, the claim of losing nine times is incorrect.
