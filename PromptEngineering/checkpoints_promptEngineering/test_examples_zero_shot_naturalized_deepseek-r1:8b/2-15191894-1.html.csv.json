It seems like both Ed Weir and Ralph Chase went to different schools\u2014Ed to Nebraska and Ralph to Pittsburgh. So, yes, Ed Weir is from Nebraska, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, Ralph Chase: The same row 2 mentions his school as Pittsburgh. That aligns with the second part of the claim that he's from Pittsburgh. So that checks out too.\n\nNow, Benny Friedman: Looking at Row 5, the name is \"benny friedman,\" and his school is listed as Michigan.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"benny friedman of michigan play the quarterback position while edward l mcmillan of princeton play center.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. **Benny Friedman plays the quarterback position for Michigan.**\n2. **Edward L. McMillan plays the center position for Princeton.**\n\nI'll start by searching the table for both individuals.\n\n**For Benny Friedman:**\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 5 has name: benny friedman, school: michigan, position: quarterback.\nSo this matches both the name and position in the claim.\n\n**For Edward L. McMillan:**\nChecking each row again:\n- Only Row 4 mentions edward l mcmillan, with position: center and school: princeton.\nThis also matches the claim's description of him playing center for Princeton.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI'll now identify the relevant cells in the table that support each part of the claim.\n\nFor Benny Friedman:\n- Row index 5 (since rows start from 0 or 1? Wait, looking at the table, row 1 is the first one, so row indices are likely starting at 0. Wait, actually, the user's example shows row_index:0 as the first element in an array, which would correspond to Row 1 in the table.\n\nWait, this might be a bit confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe table has rows numbered from 1 to 7. The JSON example uses row indices starting at 0, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nSo Row 1 corresponds to row_index:0, Row 2 to row_index:1, etc.\n\nTherefore:\n- Benny Friedman is in Row 5 (row_index 4), columns: position, name, school, unanimous, college hall of fame.\nBut the relevant columns are 'position' and 'name'. Wait, no, the columns mentioned in the table are:\n\nLooking at the naturalized format, each row has several entries:\n- position, name, school, unanimous, college hall of fame.\n\nSo for Benny Friedman, the relevant cells would be the row where name is \"benny friedman\" and position is \"quarterback\".\n\nSimilarly, for Edward L. McMillan, it's the row where name is \"edward l mcmillan\" and position is \"center\".\n\nNow, to find their positions:\n\n- Benny Friedman: Row 5 (row_index 4) has name: benny friedman, position: quarterback.\nSo relevant cells are at row_index 4, column_name: position and possibly name.\n\nWait, but the JSON example includes both row_index and column_name. So for each relevant cell, I need to specify which columns are being checked.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's about two attributes: position and school for each person.\n\nSo for Benny Friedman, I need cells where:\n- name is \"benny friedman\"\n- position is \"quarterback\"\n\nSimilarly, for Edward L. McMillan:\n- name is \"edward l mcmillan\"\n- position is \"center\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\nFor Benny Friedman:\n- row_index:4 (since Row 5 is index 4)\n  - column_name: \"name\" and \"position\"\n\nFor Edward L. McMillan:\n- row_index:3 (Row 4 is index 3)\n  - column_name: \"name\" and \"position\"\n\nWait, but the JSON example in the instructions only lists two cells with their row indices and column names. So perhaps I need to list each relevant cell once per the information needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's sufficient to just mention the cells where each person is located.\n\nSo:\n\n- Benny Friedman: name and position in Row 5 (row_index 4)\n- Edward L. McMillan: name and position in Row 4 (row_index 3)\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be two objects:\n1. row_index:4, column_name: \"name\" and \"position\"\n2. row_index:3, column_name: \"name\" and \"position\"\n\nBut wait, in the claim, we're checking two things: position and school for each person.\n\nWait no, the claim is about their positions, not schools. So perhaps I only need to check position.\n\nBut the table includes more columns, but the claim is specifically about position and school for each individual.\n\nSo, for each person:\n\n- Benny Friedman: Check if he plays quarterback for Michigan.\n  - So, find row where name is \"benny friedman\" and school is \"michigan\".\n\n- Edward L. McMillan: Check if he plays center for Princeton.\n  - Find row where name is \"edward l mcmillan\" and school is \"princeton\".\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Benny Friedman:\n- row_index:4 (Row 5)\n  - column_name: \"position\" (to check if it's quarterback) and \"school\" (to check if it's Michigan).\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has multiple attributes. So for Benny Friedman, I need to check both position and school.\n\nSimilarly, for Edward L. McMillan:\n- row_index:3 (Row 4)\n  - column_name: \"position\" (center) and \"school\" (Princeton).\n\nSo, in the JSON response, each relevant cell is an object with row_index and column_name. Since we're checking two columns per person, that would mean four cells.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's sufficient to check position only, since the school is part of the claim but isn't directly a condition (the claim says \"of michigan\" and \"of princeton\"). So maybe the relevant cells are just the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both columns need to be considered because the table may have multiple entries for the same name but different schools or positions. However, in this specific case, each row seems unique.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to list all the cells that are relevant to verify the claim. So since the claim mentions two attributes (position and school) for each person, I should check those columns.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the claim again: \"benny friedman of michigan play the quarterback position while edward l mcmillan of princeton play center.\"\n\nSo it's two claims:\n1. Benny Friedman plays quarterback for Michigan.\n2. Edward L. McMillan plays center for Princeton.\n\nTo verify each, we need to check both their positions and schools.\n\nTherefore, for each person, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Benny Friedman: row where name is \"benny friedman\" AND school is \"michigan\" (and position is quarterback).\nBut since the table may have other entries with same name but different info, perhaps better to check all columns related.\n\nWait, actually, in this specific table, each row has unique combinations of name and school, so for Benny Friedman, there's only one row where name is \"benny friedman\" and school is \"michigan\".\n\nSimilarly for Edward L. McMillan: only one row with his name and Princeton as school.\n\nSo to confirm the claim, we need to check:\n\nFor Benny Friedman:\n- Is the position 'quarterback'?\n- Is the school 'michigan'?\n\nFor Edward L. McMillan:\n- Is the position 'center'?\n- Is the school 'princeton'?\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n1. row_index:4 (Row 5)\n   - column_name: \"position\"\n2. row_index:4\n   - column_name: \"school\"\n3. row_index:3 (Row 4)\n   - column_name: \"position\"\n4. row_index:3\n   - column_name: \"school\"\n\nBut that would be four cells in total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system only requires us to list each person's relevant columns once, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, I think it's better to include all relevant columns that are needed to verify the claim.\n\nSo, the JSON response should have two objects:\n\n1. row_index:4 (Row 5)\n   - column_name: \"position\"\n2. row_index:4\n   - column_name: \"school\"\n\nAnd\n\n3. row_index:3 (Row 4)\n   - column_name: \"position\"\n4. row_index:3\n   - column_name: \"school\"\n\nSo, four cells in total.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if the system requires both columns or just one per person.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check position and school for each person separately, so two cells per person.\n\nIn any case, given that, I think including all relevant cells as per the claim is necessary.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claims about Benny Friedman and Edward L. McMillan, we need to check both their positions and schools in the provided table. The relevant cells are those where each individual's name matches their respective school and position.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"school\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the given data. The claim is: \"ernie big dog nevers from stanford play the fullback position and andy swede oberlander red grange play the halfback position.\"\n\nFirst, I need to carefully look at each part of the claim and see if it aligns with the information provided in the table. Let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Ernie Big Dog Nevers from Stanford plays the fullback position.\n2. Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange play the halfback position.\n\nI'll need to verify each part individually using the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"ernie big dog nevers from stanford play the fullback position.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I should search for a row where the name is \"Ernie Big Dog Nevers\" and his school is Stanford. Additionally, his position should be \"fullback.\" Let me scan each row:\n\n- Row 1: Name is Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully; no match.\n- Row 2: Ed Weir Ralph Chase; no match.\n- Row 3: Carl Diehl Ed Hess; no.\n- Row 4: Edward L McMillan; different name and position (center).\n- Row 5: Benny Friedman; not the person we're looking for.\n- Row 6: Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange; different first names, playing halfback.\n- Row 7: Ernie Big Dog Nevers; here it is! His school is Stanford, and his position is \"fullback.\" So this part checks out.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the claim: \"andy swede oberlander red grange play the halfback position.\"\n\nAgain, looking for a row where the name includes \"Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange,\" school is Dartmouth and Illinois (since the name has both), and position is \"halfbacks.\" Scanning again:\n\n- Row 6: Name listed as \"and y swede oberlander red grange\" \u2013 that's exactly who we're looking for. His position is \"halfbacks,\" which matches. His schools are Dartmouth and Illinois, but since the claim just mentions playing the halfback position, the school part isn't directly needed for this check.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. Each row represents a person with their position, name, school, and some other details like whether they were unanimously selected and their status in the college hall of fame. The key columns here are \"position\" and \"name.\" \n\nThe claim mentions two specific individuals: Friedman and McMillan. So, I need to check each of these names in the table to see if they play the positions stated.\n\nLooking at row 5, position is quarterback, name is Benny Friedman. Okay, so Friedman plays quarterback. That part seems to match. The claim says \"friedman play fullback,\" but according to the table, he's a quarterback. That doesn't align. Wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again.\n\nWait no, the first part of the claim is about Friedman playing fullback, but in the table, Friedman is a quarterback. So that would mean the claim is incorrect there. Hmm, perhaps I need to look at McMillan as well.\n\nLooking for McMillan in the table: row 4 has position center and name Edward L. McMillan. The claim says McMillan plays quarterback. But according to the table, he's a center, not a quarterback. So that doesn't match either.\n\nWait, so both parts of the claim are incorrect? Friedman is a quarterback, not a fullback, and McMillan is a center, not a quarterback. Therefore, the entire claim seems to be false.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss any rows. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully plays ends.\nRow 2: Ed Weir Ralph Chase plays tackles.\nRow 3: Carl Diehl Ed Hess play guards.\nRow 4: Edward L.

So I need to check each of these people in the table to see where they attended school.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: position: ends, name: Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully, school: Michigan Dartmouth. Hmm, this row has two names, but it's probably not relevant since the claim is about Weir and Chase, who aren't mentioned here.\n\nRow 2: position: tackles, name: Ed Weir Ralph Chase, school: Nebraska Pittsburgh. Wait, the school listed here is Nebraska Pittsburg? That doesn't make sense because the user wrote \"nebraska pittsburgh\" but maybe it's a typo. But regardless, the claim says they attended Princeton, so this row might not be relevant.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check each row properly. The rows are numbered from 1 to 7.\n\nRow 2: position: tackles, name: Ed Weir Ralph Chase, school: Nebraska Pittsburgh. So their schools are Nebraska and Pittsburgh? That contradicts the claim that they went to Princeton. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The claim says \"weir and chase both attended princeton,\" but in the table, Row 2's school is listed as Nebraska Pittsburg. So that would mean Weir and Chase didn't go to Princeton but to Nebraska and Pittsburgh. That already contradicts the claim.\n\nBut before jumping to conclusions, let me check all relevant rows.\n\nRow 3: position: guards, name: Carl Diehl Ed Hess, school: Dartmouth Ohio State. Not relevant for Weir or Chase.\n\nRow 4: position: center, name: Edward L McMillan, school: Princeton. This is about someone named McMillan, not Weir or Chase.\n\nRow 5: position: quarterback, name: Benny Friedman, school: Michigan. So Friedman went to Michigan, but the claim says he attended Stanford, which doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: position: halfbacks, name: Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange, school: Dartmouth Illinois. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: position: fullback, name: Ernie Big Dog Nevers, school: Stanford. So Nevers went to Stanford, but again, not relevant to Weir or Chase.\n\nSo, going back to Row 2: Ed Weir and Ralph Chase are listed as attending Nebraska Pittsburg. The claim says they attended Princeton, which is incorrect. Also, Friedman is at Michigan, not Stanford as claimed.\n\nWait, the claim might have a typo? Or maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nThe claim is: \"weir and chase both attended princeton , whereas friedman attend stanford.\" So according to this, Weir and Chase went to Princeton, but in the table, they're at Nebraska and Pittsburgh. That's different.\n\nAlso, Friedman is at Michigan, not Stanford, so that part of the claim is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim seems to be FALSE because both Weir and Chase didn't attend Princeton, and Friedman didn't go to Stanford.\n\nBut wait, in Row 2, the school is \"nebraska pittsburgh\" \u2013 could this be a typo? Maybe it's supposed to be Nebraska Pittsburgh or maybe they intended to say Princeton. But as per the table, it's listed as Nebraska Pittsburg, which I assume is correct unless there's a mistake in data entry.\n\nSimilarly, Friedman's school is Michigan, so that part of the claim is incorrect as well.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are false: Weir and Chase didn't go to Princeton, and Friedman didn't go to Stanford. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: the claim refers to three individuals \u2013 Weir, Chase, and Friedman. I need to find their respective rows in the table.\n\nWeir is in Row 2, position: tackles. Chase is also in Row 2, same row but different position. So both are in Row 2.\n\nFriedman is in Row 5, position: quarterback.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Row 2 for Weir and Chase to check their schools, and Row 5 for Friedman's school.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Weir and Chase attended Princeton, while Friedman attended Stanford. However, according to the table:\n\n- Weir and Chase attended Nebraska Pittsburg, not Princeton.\n- Friedman attended Michigan, not Stanford.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells are relevant. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"nevers from michigan play tackle with swede , and grange play fullback.\" I'll parse this into two parts:\n\n1. Nevers from Michigan plays tackle with Swede.\n2. Grange plays fullback.\n\nI need to check each part against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a position, names, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame info. The columns relevant here are \"position\", \"name\", \"school\", etc., but since we're focusing on specific individuals (Nevers, Swede, Grange), I should look for their rows.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: Name is Bennie Oosterbaan Mike Tully. Not relevant unless someone else matches.\n\nRow 2: Name is Ed Weir Ralph Chase. Not matching.\n\nRow 3: Names are Carl Diehl Ed Hess. No match.\n\nRow 4: Name is Edward L McMillan. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: Name is Benny Friedman. Also not the same as Nevers or Swede.\n\nRow 6: Names are Andy Swede Oberlander Red Grange. Ah, here's Swede and Grange. Their position is halfbacks. School is Dartmouth Illinois. Unanimous status is yes no, but I think that's for the person listed first, which is Andy Swede Oberlander. But regardless, their position and whether they are in the hall of fame might be relevant, but since the claim is about their positions and playing with someone else.\n\nRow 7: Name is Ernie Big Dog Nevers. His school is Stanford. Position is fullback. So he's a fullback from Stanford, not Michigan. Wait, the claim says \"nevers from michigan\", which might be a mistake because in row 7, his school is Stanford. But let me check if there's another Nevers from Michigan.\n\nLooking through all names: Row 5 has Benny Friedman from Michigan, but that's a different name. So maybe the claim is incorrect in saying \"nevers from michigan\" since he's actually from Stanford.\n\nNow, for the first part of the claim: Nevers from Michigan plays tackle with Swede. From the table, I don't see any Nevers listed as playing tackle. The only person named Nevers (Row 7) is a fullback from Stanford. So that part seems incorrect because he's not from Michigan and isn't playing tackle.\n\nThe second part: Grange plays fullback. Looking at row 6, Red Grange is indeed listed as a halfback, but the claim says \"grange play fullback.\" So if Grange is actually a halfback, then this part might be incorrect unless there's another Grange who is a fullback.\n\nWait, in row 7, it's Ernie Big Dog Nevers who is a fullback, not Grange. So Grange's position is halfback, so he isn't playing fullback as per the claim.\n\nAdditionally, Swede is in row 6 as a halfback, but the claim says \"swede play tackle with.\" Since Swede is listed as a halfback, that might be incorrect.\n\nSo both parts of the claim seem to be false. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to find any cells that directly contradict or support the claim. For \"nevers from michigan play tackle with swede,\" looking at row 7 (Nevers) and row 6 (Swede). Their columns are position, name, school, etc.\n\nSo, Nevers is in row 7: position fullback, school Stanford. Swede is in row 6: position halfbacks. Therefore, the cells that confirm this are row 7 for Nevers and row 6 for Swede. Their positions don't match the claim.\n\nSimilarly, Grange's row (row 6) shows he's a halfback, not a fullback as per the claim.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 6: position, name, school\n- Row 7: position, name, school\n\nBut I think for each part of the claim, the relevant rows are where the individuals mentioned in the claim are. So for \"nevers from michigan,\" since there's no such row (Nevers is from Stanford), but to check if he plays tackle, we look at his position which is fullback, so that cell is row 7, position.\n\nFor Swede, he's a halfback, not tackle, so that's row 6, position. Also, since the claim says he's playing with Swede, but Swede isn't listed as playing tackle, that's another relevant cell.\n\nSimilarly, Grange is a halfback, so his position in row 6 is relevant for whether he plays fullback.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 6: position (since Swede is a halfback, not tackle)\nRow 7: position (Nevers is fullback, not from Michigan)\n\nI think that's it. So the answer would be FALSE and include these rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
