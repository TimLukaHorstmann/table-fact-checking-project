    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"At the shooto 2003 event on March 18th in Tokyo, Japan, he battled with fighter Rumina Sato.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, I should check each row for any mention of Shooto 2003, March 18th, Tokyo, and whether it involves a fight against Rumina Sato.\n\nStarting from Row 0 to Row 35:\n\n- Rows 25 and 28 mention \"Shooto 2004\" and \"Shooto 2003: Year - End Show,\" respectively.\n- Looking for rows that specifically mention March 18th, 2003. None of the rows have that exact date mentioned.\n- Checking if any row mentions a fight against Rumina Sato. Scanning through each row, I see Row 29 mentions fighting against Rumina Sato in Shooto 2003: 3/18 (time: 2:09), which matches March 18th, 2003, in Tokyo.\n\nWait, let me check again. In the table, Row 29 has:\n- res: win\n- record: 5 - 1 - 1\n- opponent: Rumina Sato\n- method: tko (punches)\n- event: Shooto 2003: 3/18\nSo yes, March 18th, 2003, in Tokyo. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n\nI should also make sure that other rows don't contradict or provide conflicting info. But since only Row 29 matches all criteria, it's sufficient for verification.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says, \"At Dream 11, his fight with Shinya Aoki went to 4:56.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find any that mention Dream 11 and Shinya Aoki fighting at 4:56. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Doesn't mention Dream 11.\n- Row 2: No match for Shinya Aoki or Dream 11.\n- ...\n- Row 10: Maybe, let's see. It mentions \"Dream 11\" and a fighter named Shinya Aoki, but the time is 15:00. Hmm, that's not 4:56.\n- Continuing through rows 12 to 35... \n\nWait, I think I might have skipped a row where Dream 11 is mentioned with Shinya Aoki. Let me check again. Oh, in row 11, it says \"Dream 11\" and the opponent is Shinya Aoki. The time for that fight is listed as 4:56. So that matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in row 11, which shows the fight between Shinya Aoki at Dream 11 ended at 4:56.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"Event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of \"Pride Bushido 10\" in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 24 mentions \"euphoria - road to the titles,\" and another row (Row 23) refers to Deep - 13. However, none of these explicitly mention \"Pride Bushido 10.\"\n\nNext, I'll check if there's a KO with a knee strike in any of the relevant fights. The claim specifies that it was a fight at Pride Bushido 10. Since I don't see that specific event listed in the table, I can't confirm any details about it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if any other rows might be related or if there's an error in my search. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Rows 1 to 35 list various events like Deep, Euphoria, Shooto, etc., but none mention Pride Bushido 10.\n- The closest is Row 24: \"euphoria - road to the titles,\" but that's a different event.\n\nSince there's no entry for Pride Bushido 10 in the table, I can't verify if the KO happened there.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true based on the given table and instructions. The claim states: \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18 be the event in turku, finland and have an opponent of rumina sato.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. The event is \"shooto 2003: 3 / 18\" held in Turku, Finland.\n2. The opponent for that event is Rumina Sato.\n\nI'll go through each row to find relevant information.\n\nStarting from Row 26: It mentions an event called \"shooto finland : capital punishment 2\", location Helsinki, Finland. Opponent is Metin Yakut. Not matching the claim.\n\nContinuing down, Row 27: Event is \"shooto 2003: year end show\" in Chiba, Japan. Opponent Vitor Ribeiro. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 28: shooto 2003 with Takanoori Gomi in Yokohama. No match.\n\nRow 29: shooto 2003 against Rumina Sato in Tokyo. This seems relevant because the opponent is Rumina Sato and event is shooto 2003, but location is Tokyo, not Turku. So this doesn't match the claim's location of Turku.\n\nRows beyond that don't have any matches for shooto 2003 in Turku.\n\nNext, looking at Rows around Turku: Row 31 mentions a fight in Turku, but it's against Sami Hyyppa and event is \"shooto finland : the first time.\" No match for the claim's event details.\n\nRow 32: Draw between Rafles La Rose and Ressel La Rose. Not relevant.\n\nRows 33-35 are about other events and opponents in Turku but don't mention shooto 2003 or Rumina Sato.\n\nNow, checking Row 29 again: It's in Tokyo, not Turku, so it doesn't satisfy both the event location and opponent. There's no row that matches both the event name and location as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The same goes for rows 1 to 4. Row 5 talks about Round 2 but doesn't specify the time. \n\nIn Row 26, it says \"round 3 be at 3:50.\" Wait, that's exactly what the claim is saying. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI should check if any other rows might also mention round 3 or affect the outcome, but looking further, I don't see any others.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"dream 11 be the event at 5:00 with the opponent of caol uno.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part means. Let's start by looking for \"Dream 11\" in the column named \"event\". Scanning through the rows, I see that most events are labeled as various organizations or shows, like \"Shooto 2003: Year End Show\" or \"Deep - 13\", etc. Hmm, does any row have \"Dream 11\" as the event? Let me check each one carefully.\n\nLooking at row 26: It says \"event: shooto finland : capital punishment 2\". Nope, that's not Dream 11. Then I see rows 27 and onwards. Row 28 mentions \"Shooto 2003: 8/10\", row 29 is about Rumina Sato, row 30 is \"Shooto 2002: Year - End Show\", and so on. I don't see any event named Dream 11 in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it somewhere. Let me go through each entry again. Rows before 26 are labeled with names like Caol Uno, Sergey Golyaev, Gesias Cavalcante, etc., but none mention Dream 11 as the event.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim is about the opponent being \"the opponent of caol uno\". So I need to find rows where Caol Uno fought. Looking through the table, at row 22: It says \"opponent: caol uno\" and event is \"Deep - 13\". The time there is 4:48.\n\nSo the claim is specifically looking for Dream 11 as the event and that it happened at 5:00 with Caol Uno's opponent. From what I can see, none of the events are Dream 11. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false because there's no Dream 11 event listed here.\n\nAlso, regarding the time, even if there was a Dream 11 event, it doesn't specify at 5:00. So that part isn't supported either.\n\nPutting it all together, since both conditions aren't met, the entire claim should be considered false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"pride bushido 10 never have ko (knee) method\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim. It says that in Pride Bushido 10, there were no knockouts via knee methods. So I need to check all the matches in Pride Bushido 10 and see if any of them ended with a knockout due to a knee strike.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table for events labeled \"Pride Bushido 10.\" From scanning the rows, it seems there are none directly mentioning \"Pride Bushido 10.\" So my first thought is that maybe there's no data on Pride Bushido 10 in this table. But wait, the claim is specifically about Pride Bushido 10, so if there are no entries here, does that mean the claim is automatically true? Because if there's nothing to contradict it, then yes, but I should make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row for any mention of \"Pride Bushido\" and see their results. For example, row 24 mentions \"euphoria - road to the titles,\" which is a different event. Row 25 talks about \"shooto 2004: 7 / 16,\" again not Pride Bushido 10.\n\nLooking further, rows 1 through 35 don't list any event named \"Pride Bushido 10.\" That's concerning because if there are no matches for Pride Bushido 10 in the table, then by default, the claim holds true since none of them have a knockout via knee. However, I should consider that maybe the data isn't fully provided or perhaps it's assumed that there is at least one match.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to check each condition against the table. Since there are no entries for Pride Bushido 10, I can't find any matches where a knockout happened via knee. So the absence of such events supports the claim being true.\n\nBut let me also think about whether the term \"KO (knee)\" is consistently used in the table. For example, row 24 mentions a KO (knee) method but it's for Caol Uno vs. Sergey Golyaev. However, that's not Pride Bushido 10, so it doesn't affect our claim.\n\nTherefore, since there are no entries in the table for Pride Bushido 10, and assuming all methods of knockouts are accounted for elsewhere, the statement holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
