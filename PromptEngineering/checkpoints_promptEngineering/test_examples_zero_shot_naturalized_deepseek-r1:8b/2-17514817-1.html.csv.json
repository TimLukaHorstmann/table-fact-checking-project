The claim says: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter Healer beer won 3 gold medals between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if West Berkshire Brewery actually exists and produces a beer called Dr Hexter Healer.

Each of these entries has different competition names but all relate to CAMRA branch festivals or regionals.\n\nSince none of these rows mention West Berkshire Brewery or Dr Hexter Healer as a beer from that brewery, the claim might be false.

The claim says: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild be its most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which beers belong to West Berkshire Brewery. Looking at the table, all the beers are listed with their names and other details. The only brewery mentioned in the table is \"West Berkshire Brewery\" in row 13, where it says: \"Maggs Magnificent Mild.\" So that's the beer in question.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many prizes Maggs Magnificent Mild won between 1995 and 2009. I'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- Row 13 (2005): Prize is Gold Medal.\n- Row 14 (2005): Bronze Medal for overall.\n- Row 15 (2005): Not relevant since it's \"good old boy.\"\n- Row 17 (2006): Silver Medal.\n- Row 18 (2006): Silver Medal again.\n- Row 13 (2005) already counted, so that's two golds in 2005 and 2006.\n\nWait, row 13 is for 2005, prize: Gold Medal. Then row 17 is 2006, Silver Medal. So from 1995 to 2009, I need to check all rows where \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" appears within that timeframe and note their prizes.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 13 (2005): Gold\nRow 14 (2005): Bronze\nRow 17 (2006): Silver\nRow 18 (2006): Silver\nRow 25 (2008): Silver\nRow 13: another instance in 2005? Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, row 13 is 2005, and it's Gold. Then row 14 is also 2005 but Bronze for overall. So each year it's entered, it can get multiple medals.\n\nSo between 1995 and 2009:\n\n- 2002: Not listed as a winner in the table except rows 4,5,6,7 are for different beers.\nWait, no, row 13 is 2005, so let me list all instances where \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" appears and their prizes between 1995-2009.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nRow 5: 2002, Gold Medal\nRow 13: 2005, Gold\nRow 14: 2005, Bronze\nRow 17: 2006, Silver\nRow 18: 2006, Silver\nRow 25: 2008, Silver\nSo that's five entries:\n\n- 2002: Gold\n- 2005: Gold and Bronze (same year)\n- 2006: Silver twice\n- 2008: Silver\n\nWait, but I need to count how many times it won prizes. Each medal counts as a prize.\n\nSo total medals between 1995-2009:\n\n- 2002: 1\n- 2005: 2 (Gold and Bronze)\n- 2006: 2 (Silver twice)\n- 2008: 1\n\nTotal is 1+2+2+1=6 prizes. But the claim says \"most decorated.\" Now, I need to check if any other beer from West Berkshire Brewery won more.\n\nLooking through the table, are there other beers from West Berkshire? Only \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" is listed under that brewery in row 13. So it's the only one.\n\nTherefore, since it has the most number of prizes (6) between those years, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on checking each instance of \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild\" in the table and counting their prize winnings between 1995 and 2009. Each medal counts as a decoration.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim to verify: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild has won a gold medal every single instance in which it won a prize between 1995 and 2009.\" My task is to check each row of the table provided to see if this claim holds true.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that whenever West Berkshire Brewery (specifically their Maggs Magnificent Mild beer) won a prize in the years from 1995 to 2009, they also received a gold medal each time.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an entry where a specific beer might have won a prize. The columns of interest here are: year, beer name, prize, category, and competition. So I need to look for rows where the beer name is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and see what their prizes were between 1995 and 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Year 1995, beer name isn't Maggs...\nRow 2: 1997, Dr Hexter's Healer. Not relevant.\nRow 3-4: Both in 2002, \"Good Old Boy\" and \"second reserve champion\". Not Maggs.\nRow 5: 2002, Maggs Magnificent Mild. Prize is gold medal. So that's one instance where it won a gold. But does this mean it only ever won gold when it won? I need to check all instances.\n\nRow 6-7: Also in 2002, other beers. Not relevant.\nRow 8: 2003, Maggs Magnificent Mild at Siba National Beer Competition. Prize is gold medal again. So far two golds.\nRow 9: 2003, \"Full Circle\". Not relevant.\nRow 10: 2004, Maggs won overall winner but category is beer of the festival. Prize is overall winner, which I think is a win. So that's three times.\n\nRows 11-12: In 2005, Maggs won gold in Camra Reading Branch and third place in another competition. Wait, so if it's in the same row, does that mean two entries? Let me check the table again. Oh, actually, each row is a separate entry. So Row 11: prize gold medal, category mild. That's four times.\nRow 12: prize third place. Since the claim says \"won a prize\", third place might count as a win, but in reality, it's third. However, the claim specifies that every time it won a prize (i.e., any prize), it got gold. So if there's an instance where it won something else, like third, but not gold, then the claim is false.\n\nRow 13: 2005, Maggs again with gold medal. That's five times.\nRow 14: Bronze medal in overall category in 2005. So that's another prize (bronze) but not gold. This is important because it shows that Maggs won a prize without getting gold. Therefore, the claim would be false because they have instances where they won prizes that weren't gold.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The claim says \"every single instance in which it win a prize\" between 1995-2009, it won gold. So if there's any instance where they won a prize (any medal) without getting gold, the claim is false.\n\nSo looking at Row 14: prize is bronze. That means they won a prize but didn't get gold. Therefore, the claim is not fully true because in 2005, they won a bronze which isn't gold.\n\nI need to check all instances where Maggs won any prize in that time frame:\n\n- 2002: Gold\n- 2003: Gold\n- 2004: Overall winner (probably first place)\n- 2005: Gold and Bronze\n- 2009: Let me check the end of the table.\n\nRows 27-28 are 2009 entries. Row 27: Maggs Healer, prize gold in London competition. Row 28: \"Good Old Boy\" with gold in same category. So for Maggs, in 2009, they won gold again.\n\nSo between 1995 and 2009, the instances where Maggs Magnificent Mild won a prize (gold) are:\n\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2004\n- 2005 x2? Wait, no. In Row 11: 2005, prize gold in Camra Reading Branch. Row 12: same year, prize third in another competition. So that's two entries for 2005.\n\nWait, but does each row represent a different entry or the same brewery multiple times in the same year? I think each row is a separate award. So in 2005, Maggs got gold and bronze. That means in that year alone, they won two prizes: one gold, one bronze. Therefore, between 1995-2009, there are instances where they won prizes without getting gold.\n\nThus, the claim is false because they have at least one instance (Row 14) where they won a prize without it being gold.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" won any prize between 1995 and 2009.

The table has 28 rows, each with year, beer name, prize, category, and competition.\n\nI'll start by looking for any row where the beer name is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 5: 2002, Maggs Magnificent Mild, Gold Medal, Mild and Porter, SIBA South East Region.\n- Row 8: 2003, Maggs Magnificent Mild, Gold Medal, Mild and Porter, SIBA National Beer Competition.\n- Row 17: 2006, Maggs Magnificent Mild, Silver Medal, Mild, SIBA National Beer Competition.\n- Row 18: 2006, Maggs Magnificant Mild, Silver Medal, Mild, Camra Reading Branch.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. The claim mentions \"Maggs Magnificent Mild,\" so rows 5, 8, 17, and 18 fit the name.\n\nNow, looking for a bronze award in SIBA National Beer Competition. From the table:\n\n- Row 14: 2005, Maggs Magnificent Mild, Bronze Medal, Overall, SIBA South East Region.\n- Row 17: 2006, Silver Medal, so not bronze.\n- Row 18: 2006, also silver.\n\nWait, row 14 is in 2005. So the claim says between 1995 and 2005. Does that include 2005? Yes, because it's up to and including 2005.\n\nSo row 14 is within the timeframe. The prize here is Bronze Medal at SIBA South East Region, not National. The competition in row 14 is SIBA South East Region, not National. So does this matter?\n\nThe claim specifies \"SIBA National Beer Competition.\" Looking through the table for SIBA National:\n\n- Row 8: 2003, Maggs Magnificent Mild, Gold Medal, Mild and Porter, SIBA National.\nSo row 8 is a Gold Medal in SIBA National.\n\nBut row 14 is SIBA South East Region. So there's no bronze award for Maggs Magnificent Mild at SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995-2005 according to the table.\n\nWait, are there any other rows? Let me check:\n\nRow 17: 2006, Silver Medal, Mild, SIBA National.\n\nNo bronze there. So in the given timeframe of 1995-2005, Maggs Magnificent Mild only won Gold in 2003 and Silver in 2006 (but 2006 is beyond 2005). \n\nSo within 1995-2005, the only bronze award for Maggs would be in SIBA South East Region, not National. Therefore, the claim's statement that it received a bronze award at SIBA National between those years isn't supported by the table.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all rows again for \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and \"Bronze Award\" in SIBA National.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 5: Gold Medal, SIBA South East.\n- Row 8: Gold Medal, SIBA National.\n- Row 14: Bronze Medal, SIBA South East.\n- Row 17: Silver Medal, SIBA National.\n- Row 18: Silver Medal, Camra Reading.\n\nSo no, within the timeframe of 1995-2005, Maggs Magnificent Mild didn't receive a bronze award in SIBA National. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. The claim says \"received a bronze award at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.\" So it's possible that the bronze was after 2005, but the claim specifies between 1995-2005. Therefore, since there's no bronze in SIBA National during that time, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo to answer, I need to find all relevant cells. The name \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" is in rows 5,8,14,17,18. But the prize should be Bronze and competition SIBA National.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 5: Gold Medal, not Bronze.\n- Row 8: Gold Medal, SIBA National, but no.\n- Row 14: Bronze Medal, but competition is South East Region, not National.\n- So no cells match all three criteria: name, bronze, SIBA National.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows where:\n\n- Beer name = Maggs Magnificent Mild\n- Prize = Bronze\n- Competition = SIBA National\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 14 is in 2005, but competition is South East Region. No row has all three: name, bronze, and SIBA National.\n\nTherefore, there are no relevant cells that support the claim. So answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
