    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Good Old Boy beer has 5 awards between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify all entries in the table that pertain to West Berkshire Brewery and their Good Old Boy beer. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: year 1995, beer name is \"good old boy,\" prize is overall winner, category is beer of the festival, competition is CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival.\n- Wait, but the brewery isn't specified here. The table just lists beer names without mentioning breweries unless I'm assuming based on the name. Hmm, that might be a problem because the claim specifies \"West Berkshire Brewery,\" so I need to confirm if each entry with \"good old boy\" is indeed from this brewery.\n\nAssuming that's the case, let me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: 1995, good old boy, prize: overall winner. So that's one award.\nRow 3: 2002, good old boy, prize: gold medal, category best bitter. That's two awards.\nRow 4: 2002, good old boy, prize: second reserve champion, category overall. Third award.\nRow 15: 2005, good old boy, prize: silver medal, category best bitter. Fourth award.\nRow 28: 2009, good old boy, prize: gold medal, category in category. That's five awards.\n\nWait, but I should check the competition names to make sure they fall within the years specified and that it's the same brewery each time.\n\nLooking at the competitions:\n\n- Row 1: CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival (local)\n- Row 3: SIBA South East Region Beer Competition\n- Row 4: Same as above\n- Row 15: Same competition\n- Row 28: CAMRA London and South East Regional Competition\n\nThese are all different competitions, but they could be from the same brewery. The claim doesn't specify the type of competition, just that it's awards between 1995 and 2009. So five entries: 1995, 2002 x2, 2005, and 2009. That makes five awards.\n\nSo each entry is for Good Old Boy by West Berkshire Brewery, each year from 1995 to 2009, with prizes: overall winner (1995), gold medal (2002), second reserve champion (2002), silver medal (2005), and gold medal (2009). So that's five awards in total.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter Healer beer won 3 gold medals between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries where the beer name is \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" and the prize is a gold medal, with the competition being within the years 1995 to 2009.\n\nStarting from Row 1: It's about \"good old boy,\" so not relevant. Rows 2-4 don't mention \"Dr Hexter's Healer.\" \n\nLooking at Row 7 (year 2002), prize is silver, not gold. So that's a bronze or maybe another medal? Wait, the row says prize is silver medal in category strong ale. So no gold there.\n\nMoving to Row 23 (2008), it mentions \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" with a gold medal in the competition \"camra reading branch beer festival.\" That's one gold.\n\nRow 26 (2009): Again, Dr Hexter's Healer with a gold medal in camra reading branch. So that's two golds by 2009.\n\nBut wait, the claim says between 1995 and 2009, so does it include 2009? Yes, because 2009 is within the timeframe. But I only found two gold medals for Dr Hexter's Healer: in 2008 and 2009. \n\nWait, let me check Row 7 again. In Row 7 (year 2002), the prize is silver medal. So no gold there. What about other rows?\n\nLooking further, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each row where beer name is \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" and check for gold medals.\n\nRow 23: year 2008, gold.\nRow 26: year 2009, gold.\n\nThat's two golds in the timeframe. But the claim says three. So perhaps I missed a row? Let me see:\n\nLooking at Row 7: 2002, prize is silver.\nRow 23: 2008, gold.\nRow 26: 2009, gold.\n\nWait, are there any others? Let's check from year 1995 onwards.\n\nIn the table, the earliest occurrence of \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" is in Row 7 (2002) with a silver medal. Before that, no entries for Dr Hexter's Healer. So between 1995 and 2009, the only gold medals are in 2008 and 2009, which makes two. The claim says three, so perhaps it's false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all rows where beer name is \"Dr Hexter's Healer.\"\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 2: dr hexter 's healer, prize: runner up (1997)\nRow 7: silver medal (2002)\nRow 23: gold in best local beer (2008)\nRow 26: gold in best local beer (2009)\nRow 27: mentions another competition but \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" with a gold medal (2009)\n\nWait, Row 27 is year 2009. So that's three instances where Dr Hexter's Healer won gold medals between 2002 and 2009.\n\nBut the claim says \"between 1995 and 2009.\" So starting from 1995, so does it include 2009? Yes, because 2009 is within the timeframe.\n\nSo in total, how many gold medals:\n\nRow 23: 2008\nRow 26: 2009\nRow 27: 2009\n\nThat's three gold medals. So the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells indicate that \"Dr Hexter Healer\" won a gold medal each year from 2008 to 2009, totaling three times within the specified timeframe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild being their most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009 is true or false. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"most decorated\" means here. It likely refers to the highest number of awards or prizes won by a specific beer. So, I should look into how many times Maggs Magnificent Mild has been awarded across the given years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go row by row and note every instance where Maggs Magnificent Mild is mentioned, along with its prize and category. This will help me tally up the number of awards it received between 1995 and 2009.\n\nStarting from Row 1: The first mention is in 1995, but there's no entry for Maggs Magnificent Mild in that row. So I skip.\n\nRow 2: Still no Maggs here either.\n\nNow, Row 3: It mentions \"good old boy,\" so not relevant for Maggs.\n\nRows 4-6 also don't mention Maggs.\n\nMoving to Row 7: No, it's about Dr Hexter's Healer.\n\nRows 8 onwards:\n\nRow 8: Maggs gets a gold medal in the mild and porter category at SIBA National Beer Competition. That's one award.\n\nRow 9: Full Circle is mentioned, so not relevant.\n\nRow 10: Maggs wins overall winner at Bracknell Blues & Real Ale Festival. That's another award, bringing it to two.\n\nRow 11: Maggs gets gold medal in mild category at CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival. Now three awards.\n\nRow 12: Maggs is third place overall at CAMRA Reading Branch. So that's a third place, which might not count as a win but still an achievement. However, since it's third place, maybe it's considered a prize, so maybe count it as another award, making four?\n\nWait, the claim is about being the \"most decorated,\" so I think wins and medals matter more than just placements. Third place is a prize, yes, but in some competitions, third might be bronze. So perhaps each placement counts as an award of sorts.\n\nBut let's see how many times Maggs got gold, silver, or bronze medals.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 13: Gold medal in mild category at SIBA South East Region. That's five awards.\n\nRow 14: Bronze medal overall at SIBA South East Region. So that's a sixth award.\n\nRow 15: Silver medal for best bitter, but it's for another beer (good old boy), so not relevant.\n\nRows 16: Dr Hexter's Wedding Ale is mentioned, not Maggs.\n\nRow 17: Maggs gets silver medal in mild at SIBA National. That's seven awards.\n\nRow 18: Another silver medal at CAMRA Reading Branch. Eighth award.\n\nRow 19: Old Father Thames is mentioned, so skip.\n\nRow 20: Skiff, not Maggs.\n\nRow 21: Full Circle again.\n\nRow 22: Mash Tun, not Maggs.\n\nRow 23-26: Dr Hexter's Healer and Mr Chubb's are mentioned, not Maggs.\n\nRow 27: Dr Hexter's again.\n\nRow 28: Good Old Boy is mentioned, so not relevant for Maggs.\n\nSo from the above, I can see that Maggs Magnificent Mild has won multiple awards. Let me count each time it was awarded:\n\n- Row 8: Gold medal (1)\n- Row 10: Overall winner (2)\n- Row 11: Gold medal (3)\n- Row 12: Third place (maybe considered a prize, so 4)\n- Row 13: Gold medal (5)\n- Row 14: Bronze medal (6)\n- Row 17: Silver medal (7)\n- Row 18: Silver medal (8)\n\nThat's eight awards. Now, I need to check if any other beer from West Berkshire Brewery won more awards in that period.\n\nLooking at the table, let's see if \"good old boy\" or others have more wins:\n\nRow 3: Good Old Boy is mentioned as winning something in 1995, but I don't know which category. Let me check:\n\nWait, in Row 3, it says \"good old boy be its most decorate [sic] beer.\" Wait no, the claim is about Maggs. But looking at other beers, maybe good old boy has more awards.\n\nLooking through the rows again for Good Old Boy:\n\n- Row 3: Not specified but mentioned as a beer.\n- Row 28: It gets gold medal in in-category at CAMRA London & South East Regional Competition. So that's one award.\n\nOther mentions of Good Old Boy are in Rows 15 and 28, with only Row 28 giving an award beyond just being a name.\n\nSo Good Old Boy has perhaps only one significant award during this period (gold in 2009), whereas Maggs has eight awards.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other beers like Dr Hexter's Healer and others, they might have some wins but not as many as Maggs.\n\nTherefore, based on the tally, Maggs Magnificent Mild seems to be West Berkshire Brewery's most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009 with eight awards.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table. Maggs Magnificent Mild received multiple awards between 1995 and 2009, making it the most decorated beer during that period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"3 of west berkshire brewery 's beer each win a single award between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that there are three different beers from West Berkshire Brewery, each winning just one award within a specific timeframe (from 1995 to 2009). So, my task is to check if this is supported by the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it lists various beer names along with their prizes, categories, and competitions. But I notice that all the entries have \"maggs magnificent mild\" as one of the beer names. For example, rows 5,8,11,12,13,14,17,18, etc., all mention \"maggs magnificent mild.\" This repetition suggests that this specific beer might be winning multiple awards across different competitions and years.\n\nNow, the claim refers to three beers each winning a single award. So, I need to find at least three distinct beer names from West Berkshire Brewery (but in the table, it's just \"west berkshire brewery\" without specifying if there are others). Wait, actually, looking through the table, I don't see any other breweries mentioned besides \"camra\" branches and competitions, so maybe all these are from the same brewery.\n\nBut focusing on the beer names: the only unique beers I see are \"good old boy,\" \"dr hexter 's healer,\" \"maggs magnificent mild,\" \"full circle,\" and \"old father thames.\" So potentially, each of these could be a different beer. However, most of them are winning multiple awards, not just one.\n\nFor instance, \"maggs magnificent mild\" has several gold medals across competitions like the SIBA National Beer Competition and Camra festivals. Similarly, \"dr hexter 's healer\" also wins multiple awards in different categories and competitions over the years. \n\nBut does each of these three beers only win a single award? Let me check:\n\n- \"maggs magnificent mild\": Wins gold medals in 2002 (SIBA South East), 2003 (National SIBA), and silver medals in 2006 (National SIBA) and 2005 (Reading Branch). So, more than one award.\n\n- \"dr hexter 's healer\": Wins gold medals in 2008 (Reading Branch) and 2009 (Reading Branch). Also, wins a bronze medal in 2005 (SIBA South East). So, multiple awards.\n\n- \"good old boy\": Wins gold in 2002 (SIBA South East), silver in 2005 (SIBA South East), and second reserve champion in 2002. Again, more than one award.\n\nSo, none of these three beers have just a single award; they each have multiple awards over the years. Therefore, the claim that \"3 of west berkshire brewery 's beer each win a single award between 1995 and 2009\" is FALSE because each of them has won multiple awards, not just one.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other beers from West Berkshire Brewery in the table. The only other beer names mentioned are \"full circle,\" which also wins multiple medals, and \"old father thames,\" which might be another unique beer but also with more than one award. Therefore, even considering all possible relevant cells, each of these three main beers has won multiple awards.\n\nThus, the claim is not supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n  {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"maggs magnificent mild\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"good old boy\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"good old boy\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"dr hexter 's healer\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"dr hexter 's healer\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"full circle\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"full circle\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"old father thames\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"old father thames\"}\n]}",

The first few rows are from 1995 onwards. Row 1 mentions \"good old boy\" with a prize of overall winner but the competition is CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival. I need to check if West Berkshire Brewery is associated with this. Wait, maybe I should confirm which brewery corresponds to each beer name.\n\nLooking at row 3 and row 4, both are for Good Old Boy as well. In row 3 (2002), the prize is Gold Medal in Best Bitter for SIBA South East Region. Row 4 also mentions Good Old Boy with a prize of Second Reserve Champion in Overall category, same competition. So here, it's clear that West Berkshire Brewery's Good Old Boy won awards in 2002.\n\nThen in row 15 (2005), there's another mention of Good Old Boy winning Silver Medal in Best Bitter for SIBA South East Region. Additionally, rows 3 and 4 are from 2002, which is within the specified timeframe of 1995-2009.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if all these prizes count towards the claim. The claim says \"do not win a single award,\" so any award mentioned would make the claim false.\n\nSo in rows 3 and 4 (2002), Good Old Boy won Gold Medal and Second Reserve Champion. In row 15 (2005), it won Silver Medal. These are all within 1995-2009.

The table has a lot of rows, so I'll go row by row.\n\nStarting from Row 1: It's about \"good old boy\" beer, not Maggs Magnificent Mild, so probably not relevant here.\n\nRow 2: Dr Hexter's Healer, also not relevant.\n\nRows 3-4: Also Good Old Boy, so skip.\n\nRow 5: Maggs Magnificent Mild is here with a Gold Medal in 2002 at the SIBA South East Region. Wait, but the competition mentioned in the claim is the National level, not just South East. So this might be relevant, but I need to see if there's another win later.\n\nRow 6: Mr Chubb's Lunchtime Bitter, not our beer.\n\nRows 7-8: Back to Maggs Magnificent Mild again. In 2003, it won Gold Medal at SIBA National Beer Competition. That's one win.\n\nThen, in Row 9: Full Circle, so skip.\n\nRow 10: Maggs Magnificent Mild is the overall winner in 2004 at Bracknell festival, but that's a different competition, not SIBA National.\n\nRows 11-12: Maggs again, but third place and not at National level.\n\nRow 13: Maggs wins Gold Medal in 2005 at SIBA South East Region. Again, not National.\n\nRow 14: Bronze Medal, same category, so no.\n\nRow 15: Good Old Boy, not relevant.\n\nRows 16-17: Dr Hexter's Wedding Ale and Silver Medal for Mild in 2006 at National. Not our beer.\n\nRow 18: Maggs gets Silver Medal again in 2006 at Camra Reading Branch, which is a different competition.\n\nRows 19-21: Other beers, not relevant.\n\nRow 22: Mash Tun, no.\n\nRows 23-25: Mr Chubb and Maggs get some medals but not National level after 2003.\n\nRows 26-27: Dr Hexter's Healer again in 2009 at London and South East Regional. Not our beer.\n\nRow 28: Good Old Boy once more.\n\nSo, I see that Maggs Magnificent Mild won Gold Medal in 2003 and 2005 at SIBA National Beer Competition? Wait no, row 13 is 2005, but it's South East Region, not National. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 5: 2002, South East Region.\nRow 8: 2003, National.\nRow 17: 2006, National as Silver Medal.\nWait, so in the table, Maggs won at SIBA National Beer Competition in 2003 (Gold) and 2006 (Silver). But the claim says two times between 1995 and 2009. So that's two wins.\n\nBut wait, is there another win? Let me check all entries again.\n\nRow 13: 2005, South East Region, Gold Medal.\nSo only two National-level wins in 2003 and 2006. Wait, but the claim says \"two time\" which implies at least two times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, no, the claim says between 1995 and 2009, so 2003 and 2006 are within that period. So that's two wins.\n\nBut looking back, row 8 is 2003: Gold Medal, SIBA National.\nRow 17: 2006: Silver Medal, SIBA National.\nSo that's two awards. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe there was a third win. Let me check again.\n\nNo, in the table, Maggs won at SIBA National only twice: 2003 and 2006. So between 1995-2009, yes, that's two times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the entries in rows 8 (2003) and 17 (2006), where Maggs Magnificent Mild won awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter Healer beer only receiving a silver medal between 1995 and 2009 is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: It says that during the years 1995 to 2009, this specific beer (Dr Hexter Healer) has only received a silver medal. So I need to check all entries in the table for Dr Hexter Healer and see if any other prizes or medals were awarded besides silver.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row one by one to find any mentions of \"dr hexter 's healer.\"\n\nStarting from Row 1: It's about a different beer, Good Old Boy. Not relevant for Dr Hexter Healer.\n\nRow 2: Again, Dr Hexter 's Healer is mentioned here as the beer name, and it got runner up in 1997. So that's a silver medal (runner up) in 1997.\n\nRow 3: Good Old Boy again. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Same as Row 3.\n\nRow 5: Maggs' Mild, not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Another beer. Dr Hexter 's Healer is here with a Silver Medal in 2002 for Strong Ale category.\n\nRow 7: Another entry for Dr Hexter 's Healer in 2002, this time it's Silver Medal for Strong Ale again.\n\nThen Rows 8 to 26 start mentioning other beers, but let me check if any of them are Dr Hexter Healer. \n\nWait, Row 27: Dr Hexter 's Healer with a Gold Medal in 2009 for Best Local Beer in the CAMRA Reading and South East Regional Competition. \n\nSo that's another prize\u2014Gold Medal in 2009.\n\nBut wait, I should check all rows up to 2009 since the claim is about 1995-2009.\n\nWait, Row 27 is year 2009, so within the timeframe.\n\nSo from the table:\n\n- 1997: Silver\n- 2002: Silver (twice in same year, Strong Ale and another category)\n- 2009: Gold\n\nSo that's three entries for Dr Hexter Healer. Two Silvers and one Gold. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states only silver medals were received.\n\nBut wait, I should check if there are any other prizes beyond 2009 but within the timeframe? No, up to 2009 as per the claim.\n\nSo the beer got a Gold in 2009, which is outside of Silver. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Dr Hexter Healer received only silver medals from 1995 to 2009. However, the table shows that in 2002 and 2006, it also achieved Silver Medals, and importantly, in 2009, it won a Gold Medal. This contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild beer is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says that \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild have won a gold medal every single instance in which it won a prize between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand exactly what the claim is asserting. It\u2019s stating that whenever Maggs Magnificent Mild won a prize between those years, they also received a gold medal. So I need to check all instances where this beer won any prize in that timeframe and see if each of those wins was accompanied by a gold medal.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one, focusing only on entries related to Maggs Magnificent Mild and the years 1995 to 2009. \n\nStarting from Row 1: It's about Good Old Boy, so not relevant here.\n\nRow 5: Year 2002, Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal. That fits the claim because it's a prize (gold medal) within 1995-2009.\n\nRow 8: Year 2003, same beer won gold at Siba National Beer Competition. So another instance where it got a gold when they won a prize.\n\nRow 11: 2005, Maggs Magnificent Mild again with a gold medal in Camra Reading Branch Beer Festival. That's another win where they got gold.\n\nRow 12: 2005, same beer got third place, which is a prize but not a gold medal. So this instance doesn't fit the claim because even though it won a prize (third place), it wasn't a gold.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"every single instance in which it wins a prize.\" So if they won a prize that's not gold, does that make the claim false? Because here, they got third place as a prize, but not gold. Therefore, the claim is saying every time they won a prize between those years, they got gold. But here's an exception.\n\nBut let me double-check. The claim is about \"winning a gold medal every single instance in which it wins a prize.\" So if any of their prizes are not gold within that timeframe, the claim would be false.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 13: 2005, Maggs Magnificent Mild won gold again at Siba South East Region. That's fine.\n\nRow 14: 2005, same beer got bronze in overall category. Bronze is a prize but not gold. So another instance where they won a prize (bronze) without a gold medal. This further supports that the claim is false because there are multiple prizes (gold and others) but some are non-gold.\n\nRow 15: 2005, Good Old Boy, so irrelevant.\n\nRows 17-28: Most of these involve Maggs Magnificent Mild again, but let's check:\n\nRow 17: 2006, silver medal at Siba National. So another prize without gold.\n\nRow 18: 2006, same beer got silver at Camra Reading Branch. Again, a prize without gold.\n\nRows 19-22: These are other beers, so not relevant.\n\nRow 23: 2008, Dr Hexter's Healer, not our focus here.\n\nWait, actually, I'm only concerned with Maggs Magnificent Mild. So I should filter the rows to include only entries where beer name is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" and year between 1995-2009.\n\nSo let's list all relevant rows:\n\nRow 5: 2002, gold\nRow 8: 2003, gold\nRow 11: 2005, gold\nRow 12: 2005, third place (not gold)\nRow 13: 2005, gold\nRow 14: 2005, bronze (not gold)\nRow 17: 2006, silver (not gold)\nRow 18: 2006, silver (not gold)\n\nSo in total, Maggs Magnificent Mild won several prizes between 1995-2009, but not all of them were gold medals. Specifically, they also got third place, bronze, and silver medals, which are prizes but not gold. Therefore, the claim that every single instance they won a prize was accompanied by a gold medal is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let's go through each row again, but only for Maggs Magnificent Mild:\n\n- Row 5: 2002 - Gold\n- Row 8: 2003 - Gold\n- Row 11: 2005 - Gold\n- Row 12: 2005 - Third place (not gold)\n- Row 13: 2005 - Gold\n- Row 14: 2005 - Bronze (not gold)\n- Row 17: 2006 - Silver (not gold)\n- Row 18: 2006 - Silver (not gold)\n\nThat's eight instances. Out of these, four are golds (Rows 5,8,11,13) and four are non-gold prizes (Rows 12,14,17,18). Therefore, the claim is false because not every prize they won was a gold medal.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal every time they won a prize between 1995 and 2009 is false because there are instances where they won other types of prizes without achieving gold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me carefully read both the claim and the table to understand what needs to be verified.\n\nThe claim says: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild 2 time receive a bronze award at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. It mentions three main things:\n1. The beer is \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" from West Berkshire Brewery.\n2. It received a bronze award.\n3. This happened two times (the word \"2 time\" suggests it's referring to receiving the award more than once).\n4. The competition in question is SIBA National Beer Competition.\n5. The timeframe is between 1995 and 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any rows that match all these conditions. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from Row 1: It's about \"good old boy\" beer, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2: \"dr hexter 's healer\" \u2013 no match.\n\nRow 3-4: Both are \"good old boy\" but different prizes and categories. Not matching.\n\nRow 5: \"maggs magnificent mild\", which matches the beer name. Prize is gold medal, category is mild and porter, competition is SIBA South East region. So this is one occurrence in 2002.\n\nRow 6: Different beer, so skip.\n\nRow 7: Same as above but different year and prize.\n\nRow 8: \"maggs magnificent mild\" again. This time in 2003 at the SIBA National competition with a gold medal. So that's another instance.\n\nRows 9-10: Not matching beer or competition.\n\nRow 11: \"maggs magnificent mild\", SIBA Reading branch, 2005, gold medal \u2013 third occurrence.\n\nRow 12: Same beer but prize is third place at Reading branch in 2005.\n\nRow 13: \"maggs magnificent mild\" in 2005, SIBA South East region, gold medal \u2013 fourth time.\n\nRow 14: Bronze medal at same competition in 2005.\n\nRow 15: Different beer, so skip.\n\nRow 16: Different name and competition, skip.\n\nRow 17-18: \"maggs magnificent mild\" again but prizes are silver medals in different competitions.\n\nRow 19: Different beer.\n\nRow 20-21: Not matching.\n\nRow 22: Different name.\n\nRow 23-24: Different names except for some being in category.\n\nRow 25: Same as above.\n\nRows 26-27: \"dr hexter 's healer\" and others, so skip.\n\nRow 28: \"good old boy\" again.\n\nSo from the table, I see that \"maggs magnificent mild\" won gold medals at SIBA South East region in 2002 (Row5) and 2003 (Row8). It also received a silver medal in 2006 (Row17), another silver in 2007 (no wait, Row18 is 2006, but the prize is silver for mild, not bronze. So no bronze awards here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim says \"bronze award.\" Looking through the table, when does \"maggs magnificent mild\" receive a bronze medal? From my earlier review, I don't see any row where this beer gets a bronze medal in SIBA National competition. Rows 14 and 17 are bronze, but in Row14 it's the overall prize, not in the SIBA National. Wait:\n\nRow14: \"maggs magnificent mild\" at SIBA South East region, bronze, 2005. But the claim is about SIBA National. So this isn't in the National competition.\n\nLooking again, SIBA National is mentioned only in Row8 (2003 gold) and Row13 (2005 gold). No bronze medals in National. Therefore, there's no instance where \"maggs magnificent mild\" received a bronze award at SIBA National between 1995-2005.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"2 time receive a bronze award.\" So it needs two instances of bronze awards. If none exist in SIBA National, then the claim is false.\n\nAlso, the timeframe is 1995-2005, which includes 2002 and 2003 (Rows5 and 8) for golds, but no bronzes in that period in SIBA National.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"receive a bronze award at the SIBA National Beer Competition.\" So it's looking for any occurrence where this happened. If there are none, then it's false. But wait, let me check all rows again for bronze awards in SIBA National.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that only Row14 mentions bronze but it's in the South East region, not national. No row in SIBA National has \"maggs magnificent mild\" with a bronze award. Therefore, the claim is false because there are no two instances of this beer receiving a bronze award at SIBA National between 1995-2005.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me list all occurrences:\n\n- 2002: Gold in South East (Row5)\n- 2003: Gold in National (Row8)\n- 2005: Bronze in South East (Row14)\n- 2005: Gold in South East (Row13)\n- 2006: Silver in National (Row17)\n- 2007: Silver in Regional (Row18)\n\nSo, in SIBA National:\n\n- 2003: Gold\n- 2005: Gold\n- 2006: Silver\n\nNo bronze awards. Therefore, the claim that it received a bronze award twice is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild\" won two bronze awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005. However, upon examining the table, there are no instances where this beer received a bronze award in the SIBA National competition within the specified timeframe.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- No relevant cells as the claim is not supported by any data in the table.\nBut according to the instructions, I need to provide at least one cell. However, since none of the rows support the claim, perhaps no relevant cells are found. But the system might require some.\n\nWait, upon checking, the user provided an example with two cells but in this case, there's nothing relevant. So perhaps no relevant cells exist. But I think that might not be necessary because the answer is FALSE regardless. However, according to instructions, I need to list at least one cell or none? The example had two cells.\n\nBut the claim doesn't have any supporting data, so maybe no relevant cells are found. But in JSON, it's a list. So perhaps an empty list if none are found.\n\nWait, but in this case, since the answer is FALSE, I can choose to not include any relevant cells because they don't support the claim. So:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nBut wait, maybe it's better to indicate that no cells are relevant because none of them support the claim.\n\nAlternatively, if the system expects at least one cell, perhaps the example includes two, but in this case, none. So I'll proceed with an empty list.",
