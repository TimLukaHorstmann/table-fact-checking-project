The claim says that Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) are all members of the Socialist Party of Albania. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each person mentioned in the claim one by one.\n\nStarting with Ilir Meta: Looking at row 3, his term is from 10 December 1991 to 10 December 1992, and his political party is listed as the socialist party of albania. So he's definitely a member of that party.\n\nNext, Bashkim Fino: He's in row 6, starting his term on 11 March 1997 and ending on 24 July 1997. His political party is also the socialist party of albania. That checks out too.\n\nYlli Bufi is next: In row 3, his term starts on 5 June 1991 and ends on 10 December 1991. His party is the socialist party of albania as well. So that's another yes.\n\nNow, Pandeli Majko (1st time) is in row 8. He starts on 2 October 1998 and ends on 29 October 1999.

The claim says, \"the term end for vilson ahmeti be after the term end for ylli bufi.\" So I need to look at their term end dates and see which one comes later.\n\nLooking at the table, Vilson Ahmeti is in row 4. His term start is December 10, 1991, and his term end is April 13, 1992. Ylli Bufi is in row 3 with a term end on December 10, 1991. \n\nWait, so if I compare these dates: Ylli's term ends on December 10, 1991, and Vilson starts after that on the same day but in 1991? No, actually, looking at the exact end dates, Ylli ends on December 10, 1991, while Vilson starts on December 10, 1991. So his term would run from December 10, 1991, to April 13, 1992. \n\nSo Ylli's term ended in 1991, and Vilson's term started later the same year but ended in 1992. Therefore, Vilson's term end is after Ylli's.

It's stating that Sali Berisha is the first individual after Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i who has been elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania. So, I need to check if there's any information in the table supporting this.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various prime ministers and their terms, along with political parties. Each row corresponds to a different person with their respective details. \n\nI should identify where Sali Berisha is mentioned. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 12 is about Sali Berisha. His term started on 11 September 2005 and ended on 15 September 2013, and his political party is the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nNext, I need to find Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i's information. He's in Row 5, starting from 13 April 1992 until 11 March 1997, also with the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\nThe claim says that Sali Berisha was elected as a member of the Democratic Party after Me\u00e7i. So, I should check if there was an election or a term before Sali's time where someone else was from the same party but earlier than him.\n\nLooking at the table, the only other person in the Democratic Party is Aleksand\u00ebr Me\u00e7i, who was prime minister before Sali. There doesn't seem to be another individual from the Democratic Party who served after Me\u00e7i until Sali. So, it appears that Sali Berisha is indeed the first after Me\u00e7i.\n\nAdditionally, checking if any other members of the Democratic Party were elected after Me\u00e7i but before Sali: The next prime ministers after Me\u00e7i are from the Socialist Party (Ylli Bufi, etc.), and then later Sali.

The claim says: \"ilir meta be the first person since aleksand\u00ebr meksi , to be elected as a member of the democratic party of albania political party.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify who ilir meta is in the table. Looking at row 9, ilir meta was born in 1969 and served from October 1999 to February 2002 with the socialist party. However, the claim mentions the democratic party of albania (DPA), so I need to see if ilir meta is associated with that party.\n\nIn the table, the political parties for each row are listed. For example, row 12 lists sali berisha as part of DPA. Row 5, aleksand\u00ebr meksi, was with the democratic party as well. \n\nWait, let me check: the claim says ilir meta is elected as a member of DPA. But looking at row 9, his political party is socialist party of albania (SP). So he's not with DPA.\n\nNext, I need to see if there's anyone after aleksand\u00ebr meksi who joined DPA. Aleksand\u00ebr meski (row 5) was in the democratic party from March 1997 onwards. Let me check others:\n\n- Row 6: bashkim fino is socialist.\n- Row 7: fatos nano, now socialist.\n- Row 8: pandeli majko, socialist.\n- Row 9: ilir meta, socialist.\n- Row 10: pandeli majko again, socialist.\n- Row 11: fatos nano again, socialist.\n- Row 12: sali berisha is DPA.\n- Row 13: edi rama is socialist.\n\nSo after Aleksand\u00ebr meksi, the next DPA member listed is sali berisha in row 12. He started his term in September 2005 and is still incumbent as of the table. \n\nTherefore, ilir meta was not elected to DPA. The first after mecsi would be sali berisha. So the claim that ilir meta is the first since mecsi to join DPA is false.\n\nNow, looking at the relevant cells: We need to check rows where the political party is DPA and after Aleksand\u00ebr meksi's term, which ended in March 1997. The next DPA member was sali berisha starting September 2005, so we need his row (12) for the political party.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 12, column 'political party' to confirm he is with DPA. Also, checking if there's any DPA members between mecsi and berisha: looking at rows 6-11, none are DPA except sali berisha in row 12.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because ilir meta is not associated with the Democratic Party of Albania (DPA), while sali berisha is the next member listed as part of DPA after Aleksand\u00ebr meksi.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It claims that only one individual has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. My task is to check each row in the table to see how many times someone from this party was in power or held any position, as those might indicate their membership.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a prime minister starting from 1991 onwards. The columns include name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. I need to focus on the 'political party' column for the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 2: Ylli Bufi is part of the Socialist Party.\nRow 3: Vilson Ahmeti is non-party, so not relevant here.\nRow 4: Same as above.\nRow 5: Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi from the Democratic Party, not relevant.\nRow 6: Bashkim Fino is in the Socialist Party.\nRow 7: Fatos Nano again for the Socialist Party.\nRow 8: Pandeli Majko is part of the Socialist Party.\nRow 9: Iler Meta is a member as well.\nRow 10: Another term for Pandeli Majko.\nRow 11: Fatos Nano for the third time, still in the Socialist Party.\nRow 12: Sali Berisha from the Democratic Party, so not relevant.\nRow 13: Edi Rama is part of the Socialist Party.\n\nCounting these up, I see that there are multiple members of the Socialist Party of Albania holding various prime minister positions.
