Let's break down the claim and compare it with each relevant cell in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the national stadium , in cardiff , wale , be the largest former rugby union stadium , close in 1997 , with a capacity of 53000 at the time of closure.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim into key points:\n1. Stadium name: National Stadium\n2. Location: Cardiff, Wales\n3. Status: former rugby union stadium\n4. Closure year: 1997\n5. Capacity at closure: 53,000\n\nNow, I'll look for each of these points in the table.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- **Row 1** mentions \"stadium: the national stadium\" with capacity 53,000, city Cardiff, country Wales, closed 1997. This row exactly matches all key points except for the status, which isn't directly mentioned here but is implied by the term \"former rugby union stadium.\"\n\nI need to ensure that this row is relevant and supports all aspects of the claim.\n\nOther rows don't seem to add any additional support. For example, Row 2 is about Lansdowne Road in Dublin, which doesn't match the stadium name or location given in the claim. Similarly, other rows have different locations and capacities, so they don't contribute to verifying the claim.\n\nTherefore, only **Row 1** provides all necessary information to confirm each part of the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if the National Stadium in Cardiff, Wales closed in 1997 with a capacity of 53,000.

The claim states: \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close in 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which stadia are mentioned in the claim. They are Edgeley Park and Firhill. Looking at the table, each row represents a stadium with details like name, capacity, city, country, and the year it was closed.\n\nI'll go through each row to find these two stadia. Starting from Row 11, I see that Edgeley Park is listed with a closing year of 2012. Then, moving further down, Row 12 is Firhill, also closed in 2012.\n\nNext, I need to check if these are the most recent large rugby union stadiums to close in 2012. The claim specifies \"most recent,\" so they should be the last or among the last few to close that year. \n\nLooking at the table, other stadia were closed before 2012:\n- Row 7: Loftus Road, closed 2001\n- Row 8: Meadowbank Stadium, closed 2006\n- Row 9: Racecourse Ground, closed 2009\n- Row 10: Stade Jean-Bouin, closed 2010\n- Row 11: Edgeley Park, closed 2012\n- Row 12: Firhill, closed 2012\n\nSince both Edgeley Park and Firhill were closed in 2012, I need to confirm if there are any other rugby union stadiums that closed in the same year after these two. From the table provided, no other stadia with a closing year of 2012 exist beyond Rows 11 and 12.\n\nTherefore, Edgeley Park (Row 11) and Firhill (Row 12) were indeed the most recent large rugby union stadiums to close in 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both Edgeley Park and Firhill closed in 2012, making them the most recent large rugby union stadiums to shut down that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"England, Scotland, Wales, the United States, and New Zealand each have 2 rugby stadiums with a capacity of over 10,000 that closed.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. Each country mentioned should have exactly two rugby stadiums with capacities over 10,000 that were closed. So I need to check each country one by one.\n\nStarting with England: Looking at the table, I'm looking for entries where the country is England and the capacity is over 10,000 at closure. Let me scan through the rows:\n\n- Row 7: Loftus Road, 18,500 capacity, closed in 2001.\n- Row 11: Edgeley Park, 10,900 capacity, closed in 2012.\n\nWait, Edgeley Park's capacity is 10,900 which is over 10,000. But I only see two stadiums for England: Loftus Road and Edgeley Park. So that gives them exactly two rugby stadiums with capacities over 10,000 that closed. That part checks out.\n\nNext, Scotland: Again, looking for country = Scotland and capacity >10k.\n\n- Row 8: Meadowbank Stadium, 16,500, closed in 2006.\n- Row 12: Firhill, 10,887, closed in 2012.\n\nSo that's two stadiums as well. So far, so good.\n\nNow, Wales: The country is Wales. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: National Stadium, capacity 53,000, closed 1997.\n- Row 9: Racecourse Ground, 15,500, closed 2009.\n\nThat's two stadiums with capacities over 10k that closed. So Wales also has two.\n\nNext up is the United States (US). The claim says each of these countries have two, so I need to check for US as country and capacity >10k.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 3: Petco Park, 42,445, closed in 2010. Capacity over 10k.\n- Row 6: Stubhub Center, 27,000, closed in 2007. Also over 10k.\n\nSo that's two for the US as well. So far, four countries each have two stadiums.\n\nNow, New Zealand: Country is New Zealand.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 4: Athletic Park, 39,000, closed 1999.\n- Row 5: Carisbrook, 29,000, closed 2011.\n\nThat's two for New Zealand as well. So all five countries have exactly two rugby stadiums with capacities over 10k that closed.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"each have 2 rugby stadium.\" Wait, does that mean each country has at least two, or exactly two? The way it's phrased is \"each have 2,\" which implies exactly two. From what I see, all countries meet this condition. So the claim should be true.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other stadiums for these countries that might affect the count.\n\nFor England: Only Loftus Road and Edgeley Park are over 10k. No more entries for England in the table.\n\nScotland: Meadowbank and Firhill, no others in the table.\n\nWales: National Stadium and Racecourse Ground, only two.\n\nUS: Petco Park and Stubhub Center, no others.\n\nNew Zealand: Athletic Park and Carisbrook, only those two.\n\nSo each country has exactly two rugby stadiums with capacities over 10k that closed.

The claim says: \"athletic park , in wellington , be new zealand 's largest stadium , with a total capacity of 39000.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be verified here. \n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. The stadium is called Athletic Park.\n2. It's located in Wellington, New Zealand.\n3. Its capacity at the time of closure is 39,000.\n\nI should check each part against the table provided.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find the row where the stadium is Athletic Park.

Okay, that's the one.\n\nNow, checking the details for Athletic Park:\n- Capacity at closure: 39,000.\n- City: Wellington.\n- Country: New Zealand.\n\nSo all three points match exactly with the claim. \n\nWait, but I should also ensure it's the largest stadium in New Zealand. The table has other stadiums in NZ like Carisbrook (29k), Firhill (10k), Meadowbank (16k), Loftus Road (18k), etc. Athletic Park is 39k, which seems larger than these. But wait, I don't have data on all stadiums in NZ from this table. Maybe there's a bigger one not listed here?

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"lansdowne road be the only rugby union stadium in ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have close\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to carefully parse and understand both the claim and the table structure.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. \"lansdowne road be the only rugby union stadium in ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have close\"\n   - This implies that there's one specific rugby union stadium named Lansdowne Road in Ireland.\n   - It must have a capacity over 10,000 at the time of closure.\n   - It must have been closed.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different stadium with attributes like name, capacity (at closure), city, country, and the year it was closed. The goal is to check if Lansdowne Road meets all these conditions.\n\nFirst step: Locate the row in the table that corresponds to \"lansdowne road\". Scanning through the rows, I find Row 2: stadium: lansdowne road, capacity (at time of closure): 49000, city: dublin, country: ireland, closed: 2007.\n\nNow, let's verify each condition against this row.\n\n1. Capacity over 10,000:\n   - The capacity is 49,000 which is indeed above 10,000. So this condition is satisfied.\n\n2. It must be the only rugby union stadium in Ireland with such capacity and closed.\n   - Now, I need to check if there are any other stadiums in Ireland (from the table) that have a capacity over 10,000 and were closed after the relevant time.\n\nLooking through all rows, let's focus on those that are in Ireland. From the table:\n\n- Row 2: lansdowne road, Ireland, 49k, closed 2007\n- Row 1: national stadium, Wales, 53k, closed 1997 (but it's in Cardiff, Wales)\n- Row 12: firhill, Scotland, ~10k, closed 2012\n\nOther rows don't have Irish stadiums. Wait, but the table includes multiple countries, so we need to list all stadiums in Ireland.\n\nWait a minute, from the table provided, let me recheck:\n\nLooking at each row's country:\n\nRow 1: Wales\nRow 2: Ireland (Lansdowne Road)\nRow 3: United States\nRow 4: New Zealand\nRow 5: New Zealand\nRow 6: United States\nRow 7: England\nRow 8: Scotland\nRow 9: Wales\nRow 10: France\nRow 11: England\nRow 12: Scotland\n\nSo only Row 2 is in Ireland. Now, checking the capacity:\n\n- Row 2 has 49k, which is over 10k and was closed in 2007.\n\nOther rows with capacities over 10k:\n\nRow 1: 53k (Wales)\nRow 3: ~42k (United States)\nRow 4: ~39k (New Zealand)\nRow 5: ~29k (New Zealand)\nRow 6: ~27k (United States)\nRow 7: ~18.5k (England)\nRow 8: ~16.5k (Scotland)\nRow 9: ~15k (Wales)\nRow 10: ~12k (France)\nRow 11: ~10.9k (England)\nRow 12: ~10.88k (Scotland)\n\nWait, but in the table, Row 1 is national stadium in Cardiff, Wales with capacity 53k, closed 1997. So it's a different country.\n\nSo in Ireland, only Row 2 meets the capacity over 10k and was closed. Therefore, there are no other rugby union stadiums in Ireland meeting these criteria. Hence, Lansdowne Road is indeed the only one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if any other Irish stadium had capacity over 10k at closure. From the table, all others in Ireland are either Firhill (Scotland) or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait no, in the table, Row 2 is the only one with country: ireland. So yes, that's the only one in Ireland.\n\nThus, the claim seems to be TRUE because Lansdowne Road is the only rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10k and was closed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data, as no other Irish stadiums in the table meet the criteria of having a capacity over 10,000 at closure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says that England, Scotland, Wales, the United States, and New Zealand each have three rugby stadiums with a capacity over 10,000 that were closed.\n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is asking for. It's about five countries: England, Scotland, Wales, the USA, and New Zealand. Each of these countries should have exactly three rugby stadiums in the table that meet two conditions: the stadium's capacity at closure was over 10,000, and it was closed.\n\nSo, I'll go through each country one by one and check how many relevant stadia they have based on the table.\n\nStarting with England. The table has several rows where the city is London or Stockport, which are in England. Looking at the table:\n\nRow 7: Loftus Road, capacity 18500, closed 2001.\nRow 11: Edgeley Park, capacity 10900, closed 2012.\n\nWait, that's only two stadia for England with capacities over 10,000. So that's a problem because the claim says each should have three. Maybe I missed some. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 0: National Stadium, Cardiff, Wales \u2013 not England.\nRow 1: Lansdowne Road, Dublin, Ireland \u2013 no.\nRow 2: Petco Park, San Diego, USA \u2013 no.\nRow 3: Athletic Park, Wellington, NZ \u2013 no.\nRow 4: Carisbrook, Dunedin, NZ \u2013 no.\nRow 5: Stubhub Center, Carson, USA \u2013 no.\nRow 6: Loftus Road, London, England \u2013 yes, capacity 18500.\nRow 7: Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland \u2013 no.\nRow 8: Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, Wales \u2013 no.\nRow 9: Stade Jean-Bouin, Paris, France \u2013 no.\nRow 10: Edgeley Park, Stockport, England \u2013 yes, capacity 10900.\nRow 11: Firhill, Glasgow, Scotland \u2013 no.\nRow 12: No more rows.\n\nSo for England, only two stadia meet the criteria. Therefore, there's a discrepancy since the claim says three.\n\nWait, but I might have miscounted. Let me list all the countries and their relevant stadia:\n\n- England:\n  - Loftus Road (Row 7), capacity 18500.\n  - Edgeley Park (Row 11), capacity 10900.\n  So that's two, not three.\n\n- Scotland:\n  Looking for stadia in Scotland with capacity >10k closed. Let's see:\n\n  Row 8: Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh, closed 2006, capacity 16500.\n  Row 12: Firhill, Glasgow, closed 2012, capacity 10887 (which is just over 10k). So that's two stadia.\n\n- Wales:\n  Looking for Welsh stadia:\n\n  National Stadium (Row 0), Cardiff, capacity 53000, closed 1997.\n  Racecourse Ground (Row 9), Wrexham, capacity 15500, closed 2009.\n  Stade Jean-Bouin is in Paris, so not Wales.\n\n  So that's two stadia for Wales as well.\n\n- USA:\n  Petco Park (Row 2): San Diego, capacity 42445, closed 2010.\n  Stubhub Center (Row 5): Carson, capacity 27000, closed 2007.\n  Edgeley Park is in England, so not USA. So that's two stadia.\n\n- New Zealand:\n  Athletic Park (Row 3): Wellington, capacity 39000, closed 1999.\n  Carisbrook (Row 4): Dunedin, capacity 29000, closed 2011.\n  So that's two stadia as well.\n\nWait, the claim says each has three. But all of them only have two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because none of the five countries meet the criteria of having exactly three rugby stadiums with capacities over 10k that were closed.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check in case I missed any rows.\n\nLooking back at all rows:\n\nRow 0: Cardiff \u2013 capacity 53000, yes.\nRow 1: Ireland \u2013 no.\nRow 2: USA \u2013 yes.\nRow 3: NZ \u2013 yes.\nRow 4: NZ \u2013 yes.\nRow 5: USA \u2013 yes.\nRow 6: England \u2013 yes.\nRow 7: Scotland \u2013 yes (Meadowbank).\nRow 8: Scotland \u2013 yes (Firhill? Wait, Firhill is in Row 12, not Row 8. Meadowbank is Row 8.\n\nWait, row 12 is Firhill in Glasgow, so that's another one for Scotland.\n\nWait, no: Row 8 is Meadowbank Stadium in Edinburgh, which is Scotland, capacity 16500. So that's two stadia.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have miscounted somewhere. Let me list all the relevant stadia with country and capacities:\n\nEngland:\n- Loftus Road (Row 7): 18,500\n- Edgeley Park (Row 11): 10,900\n\nScotland:\n- Meadowbank Stadium (Row 8): 16,500\n- Firhill (Row 12): 10,887\n\nWales:\n- National Stadium (Row 0): 53,000\n- Racecourse Ground (Row 9): 15,500\n\nUSA:\n- Petco Park (Row 2): 42,445\n- Stubhub Center (Row 5): 27,000\n\nNew Zealand:\n- Athletic Park (Row 3): 39,000\n- Carisbrook (Row 4): 29,000\n\nSo each country has two stadia meeting the criteria. Therefore, the claim that each has three is incorrect.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close in 2010.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify which stadia are mentioned in the claim. The key terms here are \"edgeley park\" and \"firhill.\" Looking at the table, these correspond to rows 11 and 12 respectively.\n\nNext, I'll check when each of these stadia closed. For edgeley park (row 11), the closed year is 2012, and for firhill (row 12), it's also 2012. So both closed in 2012, not in 2010 as stated in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other stadia that closed more recently after 2010. Since the latest closing year in the table is 2012, and both edgeley park and firhill closed then, the claim's assertion about them being recent (in 2010) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the stadia closed in 2012, not 2010, and there were other more recent closures after that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about a stadium is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the national stadium , in cardiff , wale , be the smallest former rugby union stadium , close in 1997 , with a capacity of 10887 at the time of closure.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table. The table has rows from row 0 to row 11, each with details about different stadiums.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"the national stadium.\" I'll search for that in the 'stadium' column. From the table, row 0 is \"stadium: the national stadium,\" and it's located in Cardiff, Wales, closed in 1997. So this matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the claim mentions being the smallest former rugby union stadium. I need to check if there are other stadiums listed that might be smaller or if 'the national stadium' is indeed the smallest. The table includes several stadiums with capacities ranging from 12000 down to 10900 and even lower. For example, row 11 (Firhill) has a capacity of 10887 at closure in 2012. Wait, that's actually slightly smaller than the claimed 10887.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"capacity of 10887 at time of closure.\" Looking back, row 0: capacity is 53000, which is much higher. But wait, no, row 11 has a capacity of 10887. So if 'the national stadium' was closed in 1997 with a capacity of 53000, but Firhill (row 11) was closed later in 2012 with a smaller capacity of 10887.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me list out the capacities:\n\nRow 0: 53000\nRow1:49000\nRow2:42445\nRow3:39000\nRow4:29000\nRow5:27000\nRow6:18500\nRow7:16500\nRow8:15500\nRow9:12000\nRow10:10900 (no, wait row11 is 10887)\nWait, no. Let me check each row's capacity:\n\nRow0:53000\nRow1:49000\nRow2:42445\nRow3:39000\nRow4:29000\nRow5:27000\nRow6:18500\nRow7:16500\nRow8:15500\nRow9:12000\nRow10:10900? No, row10 is 12000, then row11 is 10887.\n\nWait, no. The user's table lists the capacities as:\n\nRow1:49000 (Dublin)\nRow2:42445\nRow3:39000\nRow4:29000\nRow5:27000\nRow6:18500\nRow7:16500\nRow8:15500\nRow9:12000\nRow10:10900? No, wait row11 is 10887.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n\nRow0 (the national stadium):53000\nRow1:Lansdowne Road:49000\nRow2:Petco Park:42445\nRow3: Athletic Park:39000\nRow4:Dunedin:29000\nRow5:StubHub Center:27000\nRow6:Loftus Road:18500\nRow7:Meadowbank Stadium:16500\nRow8:Racecourse Ground:15500\nRow9:Stade Jean-Bouin:12000\nRow10:Edgeley Park:10900? Wait, no, row11 is Firhill:10887.\n\nWait, in the table as given:\n\nRow 0:53000\nRow1:49000\nRow2:42445\nRow3:39000\nRow4:29000\nRow5:27000\nRow6:18500\nRow7:16500\nRow8:15500\nRow9:12000\nRow10:10900? No, row10 is 12000 (Stade Jean-Bouin), and row11 is Firhill with 10887.\n\nWait, no. Let me recount the table as given:\n\nThe user provided rows from 0 to 11.\n\n- Row0:53000 (National Stadium)\n- Row1:49000 (Lansdowne Road)\n- Row2:42445\n- Row3:39000\n- Row4:29000\n- Row5:27000\n- Row6:18500\n- Row7:16500\n- Row8:15500\n- Row9:12000\n- Row10:10900? No, row10 is 10887 (Firhill)\n\nWait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe table as given by the user has rows from 0 to 11.\n\nRow 10: stadium: stade jean - bouin, capacity:12000, city: paris, country: france, closed:2010.\n\nRow11: Firhill, capacity:10887.\n\nSo, in row11 (Firhill), capacity is 10887, which is less than 10900? Wait no, 10887 is less than 10900. So if the claim says that 'the national stadium' was closed in 1997 with a capacity of 10887 at closure, but the actual 'stadium: Firhill' has a smaller capacity.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"capacity of 10887.\" Wait, let's check row0 again. The national stadium is row0, capacity53000. So how does that match?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me re-examine the claim: \"the national stadium , in cardiff , wale , be the smallest former rugby union stadium , close in 1997 , with a capacity of 10887 at the time of closure.\"\n\nSo, the claim is saying that 'the national stadium' was closed in 1997 and had a capacity of 10887 at closure. But according to the table, row0 (the national stadium) has a capacity of 53000 when it was closed in 1997.\n\nBut in row11 (Firhill), which was closed in 2012, the capacity is 10887. So Firhill is smaller than the national stadium.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to 'the national stadium' as being the smallest, which isn't accurate because Firhill is even smaller. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that 'the national stadium' was closed in 1997 and had a capacity of 10887 at that time, but according to row0, its capacity was 53000 when it was closed. So if the claim states 10887, that would be wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the location: the claim mentions Cardiff, Wales, while the national stadium is in Edinburgh? Or wait, no\u2014where exactly is 'the national stadium' referred to here?\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion between different national stadiums. The national stadium could refer to different places. In Scotland, the National Stadium is often associated with football and sometimes refers to Hampden Park, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nBut according to the table provided by the user, row0 is 'the national stadium' in Edinburgh (since it's in city:Edinburgh). So the claim says it's in Cardiff, Wales. That can't be correct because the table shows Edinburgh.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect on two points:\n\n1. The location: It says Cardiff, but the actual stadium is in Edinburgh.\n2. The capacity: It claims 10887 when in reality, the national stadium had a higher capacity (53000) at closure.\n\nBut wait, actually, perhaps the user made a typo in the table? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided the table as:\n\nRow0:\nstadium: The National Stadium\ncapacity:53000\ncity:Edinburgh\ncountry:Scotland\nclosed:1997\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim is saying \"in Cardiff, Wales,\" which is wrong because it's in Edinburgh.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect on both location and capacity.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just confirm:\n\n- The stadium in question is 'the national stadium' in Edinburgh (row0), with a capacity of 53000 when closed in 1997.\n- Firhill Stadium (row11) has a smaller capacity of 10887, but it was closed later in 2012.\n\nSo the claim that 'the national stadium' was closed in 1997 with capacity 10887 is incorrect. It had a higher capacity at closure.\n\nTherefore, the statement is factually incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the national stadium\" in Cardiff, Wales, was closed in 1997 with a capacity of 10887 is incorrect. Based on the provided data:\n\n- **Location**: The stadium in question is actually located in Edinburgh, Scotland (not Cardiff).\n- **Capacity at Closure**: The National Stadium in Edinburgh had a capacity of 53,000 when it was closed in 1997.\n- **Comparison with Firhill Stadium**: While Firhill Stadium in Edinburgh has a smaller capacity (10,887) and was closed later (2012), it does not make the original statement accurate.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is incorrect on both location and capacity.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"lansdowne road be the 1 of 2 rugby union stadium in ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have close.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be verified.\n\nThe key elements are:\n1. Lansdowne Road is one of two rugby union stadiums in Ireland.\n2. Both of these stadiums have a capacity over 10,000 when closed.\n3. Both have been closed at some point.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all rugby union stadiums in Ireland with capacities over 10,000 and check if there are exactly two such stadiums, and if both were closed.\n\nFrom the table, each row represents a stadium with its details. Let's go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 2: stadium: lansdowne road, capacity: 49000 (over 10000), city: dublin, country: ireland, closed: 2007.\nSo that's one.\n\nNow, I need to find another rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 and check if it was closed. \n\nLooking through the table for other Irish stadiums with capacities >10,000:\n\nRow 1: national stadium, capacity 53000 (closed 1997) but country is wales, so not Ireland.\n\nRow 2: lansdowne road, already considered.\n\nRow 3 to 12: none of these are in Ireland except maybe row 4: athletic park in new zealand. So no others in Ireland with capacity >10k.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because according to the table, there is only one stadium in Ireland (lansdowne road) with a capacity over 10,000 and it was closed.\n\nSo the claim says there are two such stadiums. But from the data, it seems there's only one. Therefore, the claim might be false.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed another stadium in Ireland with capacity >10k? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 1: national stadium, wales\nRow 2: lansdowne road, ireland, closed\nRow3-4: new zealand, new zealand, etc.\nRow5: carisbrook, new zealand, etc.\nRow6: stubhub center, united states\nRow7: london, england\nRow8: edinburgh, scotland\nRow9: wrexham, wales\nRow10: paris, france\nRow11: stockport, england\nRow12: glasgow, scotland\n\nNo, only lansdowne road in Ireland has capacity over 10k and was closed. So the claim says there are two such stadiums, but there's only one. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed another stadium. Let me check row numbers again.\n\nRow 1: national stadium, wales\nRow2: lansdowne road, ireland, capacity 49000, closed 2007.\nRow3: petco park, san diego, united states\nRow4: athletic park, new zealand\nRow5: carisbrook, new zealand\nRow6: stubhub center, united states\nRow7: loftus road, london, england\nRow8: meadowbank stadium, edinburgh, scotland\nRow9: racecourse ground, wrexham, wales\nRow10: stade jean-bouin, paris, france\nRow11: edgeley park, stockport, england\nRow12: firhill, glasgow, scotland\n\nNo other Irish stadiums. So only lansdowne road fits the criteria.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because there's only one stadium in Ireland meeting those conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we identified all rugby union stadiums in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 and confirmed if they were closed. Only \"Lansdowne Road\" meets these criteria, making the claim false as there isn't another such stadium in Ireland.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the Athletic Park in Wellington is true based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"athletic park , in wellington , be new zealand 's second largest stadium , with a total capacity of 39000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim to see what information it's providing and how that relates to the table.\n\n1. **Stadium Name**: It mentions \"athletic park.\" Looking through the table, I need to find which row corresponds to this stadium. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 4: stadium: athletic park, capacity: 39000...\nSo yes, it's row 4.\n\n2. **Location**: The claim says it's in Wellington. Checking the city column for row 4: city is Wellington, so that matches.\n\n3. **Country**: It should be New Zealand. Row 4's country is indeed New Zealand.\n\n4. **Capacity**: The claim states a total capacity of 39000. Looking at row 4, capacity is exactly 39000 when closed.\n\n5. **Ranking**: The claim refers to it being the second largest stadium in New Zealand. So I need to see if there's another stadium with a larger capacity listed before it in the table or after. \n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 3: Petco Park, 42445\n- Row 1: National Stadium, 53000\n\nWait, so row 1 has a higher capacity at 53000. Therefore, if Athletic Park is 39000, it's not the second largest because there's another stadium with a larger capacity.\n\nSo, the claim might be incorrect regarding its ranking.\n\nBut let me double-check. The table lists all stadiums, and their capacities are as of when they were closed. So National Stadium (53000) in Cardiff, Wales, is higher than Athletic Park (39000). Then Petco Park in San Diego has 42445. So the top two would be National Stadium at 53000 and Petco Park at 42445.\n\nThus, the largest stadium in New Zealand might be another one not listed here or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, the table includes multiple New Zealand stadiums:\n\n- Row 4: Athletic Park (39000)\n- Row 5: Carisbrook (29000)\n- Row 9: Racecourse Ground (15500)\n- Row 12: Firhill (10887)\n\nSo among these, Athletic Park is indeed one of them. But the claim says it's New Zealand's second largest. Since Petco Park isn't in New Zealand, maybe the highest is National Stadium, but that's in Wales, so perhaps the highest in New Zealand would be another stadium not listed here or the next in line.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table again, only row 4 and others are for New Zealand. So among the New Zealand ones, Athletic Park is the largest with 39000. Because Carisbrook is 29000, which is smaller. Wait, but I'm not sure if there's another stadium in New Zealand with a higher capacity than Athletic Park that's listed.\n\nWait, no, looking at row 4: capacity is 39000. The next highest for New Zealand would be maybe Carisbrook at 29000 and others much lower. So if the table doesn't list a higher capacity stadium in New Zealand, then perhaps Athletic Park is indeed the largest. Therefore, it can't be the second largest.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because some stadiums are in different countries. So, for example, National Stadium is in Cardiff, Wales, so not part of New Zealand.\n\nSo within New Zealand, Athletic Park (39000) is the highest listed capacity. Therefore, it's the largest, not the second. Hence, the claim that it's the second largest would be false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's another stadium not listed in the table with a higher capacity? But since the data only includes what's provided, we have to go by that. So if within the table, the highest for New Zealand is 39000, then it's the largest, making the claim incorrect about being second.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking at all stadiums, the capacities are:\n\n- National Stadium: 53000\n- Petco Park: 42445\n- Athletic Park: 39000\n- Carisbrook: 29000\n- Racecourse Ground: 15500\n- Firhill: 10887\n- Others (Ireland, US, France, England, Scotland)\n\nSo within New Zealand, the highest is Athletic Park at 39000. So it's the largest, not second.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"athletic park , in wellington , be new zealand 's second largest stadium\" is false because it's actually the largest as per the table data.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe another stadium in New Zealand is closed with a higher capacity but isn't listed here? The table doesn't mention any other stadium in New Zealand beyond what's already there. So if the highest is 39000, then it can't be second.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Athletic Park is not the second largest; it's the largest among those listed in New Zealand.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Athletic Park in Wellington is New Zealand's second-largest stadium with a capacity of 39,000. \n\n- **Stadium Name**: Matches row 4.\n- **Location**: Matches Wellington.\n- **Country**: Matches New Zealand.\n- **Capacity**: Matches 39,000.\n\nHowever, the table shows that within New Zealand, Athletic Park has the highest listed capacity at 39,000 (compared to Carisbrook's 29,000). Therefore, it's not the second largest but the largest. This makes the claim false regarding its ranking.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells: The row for Athletic Park is essential as it provides all necessary details to evaluate the claim. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
