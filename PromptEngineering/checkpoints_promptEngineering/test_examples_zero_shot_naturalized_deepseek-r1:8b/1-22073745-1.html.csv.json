The claim says, \"french be the language use for the film title use in nomination for r\u00e9fractaire.\" So, I need to check if French was used as a language for the film title \"R\u00e9fractaire\" when it was nominated.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to find where \"r\u00e9fractaire\" is mentioned. Scanning through the rows, I see Row 8: year (ceremony): 2009 (82nd), film title used in nomination: refractaire, original title: r\u00e9fractaire, languages: french, director: nicolas steil, result: not nominated.\n\nSo, in this row, the film title used in nomination is \"refractaire,\" and the languages are listed as just \"french.\" There's no mention of any other language for this particular film. The original title is also in French, which matches the film title used in nomination.\n\nNow, checking the claim again: It states that French was the language used for the film title \"R\u00e9fractaire\" when it was nominated. From Row 8, I see that French is indeed listed as the language for this film's nomination. The result is noted as \"not nominated,\" but that doesn't affect whether French was used in the nomination process.\n\nTherefore, all the information needed to verify the claim are in Row 8, specifically the languages column.

Let me go through it step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"pol cruchten be the director for the original title perl oder pica.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and see what information it has. The table lists various films with details like the ceremony year, film titles (both the one used in nomination and the original), languages, directors, and results.\n\nI'll start by looking for any rows that mention \"perl oder pica\" as either the film title or the original title. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: The film title used is \"elles,\" so no match.\n- Row 2: Film title is \"back in trouble,\" not matching.\n- Row 3: Original title is \"j'ai toujours voulu \u00eatre une sainte,\" which doesn't match.\n- Row 4: Original title is \"le roman de renart,\" different from \"perl oder pica.\"\n- Row 5: Film titles are \"your name is justine\" in both columns, so no match.\n- Row 6: The original title here is \"perl oder pica.\" That's a match for the original title part of the claim. Now I need to check who the director was for this row.\n\nLooking at row 6, the director is listed as \"pol cruchten.\" So if the claim says that pol cruchten is the director for the original title perl oder pica, then it matches because in row 6, the original title is indeed \"perl oder pica\" and the director is pol cruchten.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on this information.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that \"Renart the Fox\" is available in both Polish and English. To verify this, I need to check the relevant cells in the table that contain information about the film's languages.\n\nI'll start by scanning the table for any rows where the film title used in nomination or the original title matches \"Renart the Fox\". The original title of the film is listed as \"le roman de renart\" in Row 4, which corresponds to the year 2005 (78th ceremony). \n\nNow, looking at the languages column for that row, it says French. There's no mention of Polish or English here. This suggests that either I might be missing information or perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe \"Renart the Fox\" has different versions? The film's original title in Row 4 is \"le roman de renart,\" and its languages are only French. However, it's possible that the version submitted under consideration was in Polish and English. But according to the table, the director is Thierry Schiel, and the result was not nominated. There's no indication of additional languages beyond French.\n\nSo, if the claim says \"Renart the Fox\" is in both Polish and English, but the table only lists French for its languages, then the claim might be false. However, perhaps I need to check other rows where the film title used in nomination is \"renart the fox.\" Wait, looking back, Row 4's film title is \"renart the fox,\" original title is \"le roman de renart,\" and languages are French. There's no Polish or English listed here.\n\nIs there any row with \"Renart the Fox\" that mentions Polish or English? Scanning through all rows, I don't see another entry for \"Renart the Fox.\" The only one related is in Row 4, which doesn't have those languages.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because the table doesn't support it.

But the claim is about whether the title is in French. In this row, the languages are Polish and English, not French. So even though it's listed as a nominated film, because of the languages, it doesn't support the claim that its French title was used.\n\nSo there's no row where \"your name is justine\" is listed with French as one of the languages.

It's saying that the original title of the film \"little secret\" is \"le roman de renart.\" So I need to look into the table and find where these two titles appear together in any row.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: year 1997, film title: elles, original title: elles...\nRow 2: back in trouble, same original...\nRow 3: i always wanted...; original is French.\nRow 4: renart the fox; original is le roman de renart...\nRow 5: your name is justine, same as original...\nRow 6: little secrets, original perl oder pica\nRow 7: nuits d'arabie, same as original...\nRow 8: refractaire, same as original.\n\nWait, so in Row 4, the film title used in nomination is \"renart the fox,\" and the original title is \"le roman de renart.\" So that's one pairing. But the claim refers to \"little secret\" having an original title of \"le roman de renart.\"\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\nRow 6: year 2007, film title used in nomination is \"little secrets,\" but the original title is \"perl oder pica.\" That doesn't match.\n\nWait, so maybe I missed something. Let me check all rows again because sometimes the titles might have variations or different order.\n\nAnother approach: look for any row where the original title is \"le roman de renart\" and the film title used in nomination is \"little secret.\" Or vice versa.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 4: film title used: renart the fox, original: le roman de renart. So here, the original is \"le roman...\" but the film title in nomination is \"renart the fox,\" which is a translation or adaptation of the original.\n\nBut the claim says that the original title for \"little secret\" is \"le roman...\". So I need to see if there's a row where the film title used is \"little secret\" and the original title is \"le roman de renart.\"\n\nLooking through all rows, in Row 6: film title used is \"little secrets,\" which seems like an English translation. The original is German (\"perl oder pica\"). So that doesn't match.\n\nIn Row 4, the film title is \"renart the fox\" and original is \"le roman...\" but it's not about \"little secret.\" So the claim might be mixing up these titles.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again:\n\nThe table has 8 rows. The one that stands out is Row 4: renart the fox (nomination title), original: le roman de renart. But the claim is about \"little secret\" having this original title.\n\nSo in the table, there's no row where the film title used in nomination is \"little secret,\" and the original is \"le roman...\" or vice versa. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because the only occurrence of \"le roman de renart\" is paired with \"renart the fox,\" not with \"little secret.\"\n\nWait, but I should double-check if \"little secret\" is another name for \"le roman de renart.\" Maybe in different languages? Let me see.\n\nIn Row 6: film title used is \"little secrets,\" original title is German. So it's a different language and different original title.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because the original title of \"little secret\" isn't \"le roman...\" but rather another title, and \"le roman...\" is paired with \"renart the fox.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"original_title\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"film_title_used_in_nomination\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
