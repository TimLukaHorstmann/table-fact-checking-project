    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 points.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. cup noodle honda is the only team that has the machine nsr250.\n2. cup noodle honda has less than 8 points.\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the teams and their machines are as follows:\n\n- Row 1: 1993, class: 250cc, team: cup noodle - honda, machine: nsr250\n- Row 2: 1994, class: 250cc, team: cup noodle - honda, machine: nsr250\n- Row 3: 1995, class: 500cc, team: hrc - honda, machine: nsr500\n- Row 4: 1996, class: 500cc, team: hrc - honda, machine: nsr500\n- Row 5: 1997, class: 500cc, team: repsol - honda, machine: nsr500v\n\nSo, for part 1, I need to see if cup noodle honda is the only team with nsr250. From the table:\n\n- In rows 1 and 2 (years 1993 and 1994), the team is cup noodle - honda with nsr250.\n- No other teams have nsr250; hrc, repsol have different machines.\n\nSo yes, cup noodle honda is the only team with nsr250. That part checks out.\n\nNow for part 2: Does cup noodle honda have less than 8 points? Let's look at their points in the table:\n\n- Row 1: points: 8\n- Row 2: points: 11\n\nSo, in both years (1993 and 1994), cup noodle honda had 8 and 11 points respectively. Both are above or equal to 8 points.\n\nThe claim says \"less than 8 points,\" but their points were exactly 8 and higher. Therefore, this part of the claim is not accurate because it's claiming they have less than 8 when in reality, they have at least 8.\n\nSince one part of the claim is incorrect, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to find the relevant cells that support or refute each part. For part 1, which checks if cup noodle honda is the only team with nsr250, I should look at the rows where this team has nsr250 and ensure no others do. So, row indices 0 and 1 (rows 1 and 2) for the column 'machine' being nsr250.\n\nFor part 2, checking points: in row 0, points are 8 which is not less than 8, and row 1 has 11. Therefore, rows 0 and 1 have the relevant points data that show they don't meet the \"less than 8\" condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because cup noodle honda does not have less than 8 points; their points were exactly 8 and 11.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
