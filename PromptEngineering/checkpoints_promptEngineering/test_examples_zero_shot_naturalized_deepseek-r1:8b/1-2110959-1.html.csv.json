    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 1948 - 49 season have a win % of 0.552\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to the 1948-49 season. Looking at the table, each row starts with the season in the format \"season: year-year\". So, scanning through:\n\nRow 1: 1947-48\nRow 2: 1948-49\n\nSo, Row 2 is the 1948-49 season.\n\nNext, I need to find the column that represents the win percentage. Looking at each row's columns:\n\nEach row has columns like \"season\", \"games\", \"won\", \"lost\", etc., and one of them is \"pct %\". That must be the win percentage column because it's commonly abbreviated as percentage.\n\nSo, for Row 2, I need to check the value under the \"pct %\" column. According to the table:\n\nRow 2: pct %: 0.552\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim given. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data point.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the 1948-49 season's win percentage, I identified Row 2 as that specific season and checked the \"pct %\" column, which indeed equals 0.552.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pct %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the team finish 1st oha in the season they have a win % of 0.769\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that there's at least one season where the team finished first in the OHA (Ohio Hockey Association) standings and also had a winning percentage of exactly 0.769. So I need to check if such a season exists in the table.\n\nLooking through the table, each row represents a different season with various statistics: games won, lost, tied, points, win percentage, goals for/against, and their standing in the OHA. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one, checking both the \"standing\" column and the \"pct %\" column to see if any season meets both criteria.\n\nStarting from Row 1: \n- Season: 1947-48\n- Standing: 6th oha\n- Pct %: ~0.528\nDoesn't meet both conditions.\n\nRow 2:\n- 1948-49\n- 4th oha\n- ~0.552\nNope.\n\nRow3:\n- 1949-50\n- 3rd\n- ~0.604\nNot 1st and not the right percentage.\n\nRow4:\n- 6th\n- ~0.491\nNo.\n\nRow5:\n- 5th\n- ~0.565\nNo.\n\nRow6:\n- 4th\n- ~0.598\nNo.\n\nRow7:\n- 1st oha\n- Pct %: 0.729\nClose, but the percentage is higher than 0.769. So not matching.\n\nRow8:\n- 1st\n- 0.673\nStill lower than 0.769.\n\nRow9:\n- 1st\n- 0.615\nNope.\n\nRow10:\n- 3rd\n- 0.5\nNot relevant.\n\nRow11:\n- 1st\n- ~0.673\nAgain, less than 0.769.\n\nRow12:\n- 1st oha\n- Pct %: 0.769\nAh, here we go! This row (Row12) is season 1958-59. The standing is 1st oha and the win percentage is exactly 0.769. So this matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there's at least one season where both conditions are met, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells in the table are relevant. Looking for \"standing\" and \"pct %\" columns, specifically Row12. The relevant columns would be \"standing\" and \"pct %\". So I need to note their row indices (which is 11 since rows start at 0) and column names.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include each of these two columns for Row12.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"standing\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pct %\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"for the 1950 - 51 season , there be 54 game play , with 30 won and 24 lost and 0 tie , for a standing of 1st oha\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down each part of the claim and see if it matches the corresponding data in the table. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different season from 1947-48 up to 1960-61. So, my first step is to locate the row that corresponds to the 1950-51 season.\n\nLooking at Row 4: season: 1950 - 51. That's the correct row for this claim.\n\nNext, I'll check each part of the claim against the data in Row 4.\n\nThe claim mentions \"54 game play\". In the table, under games for the 1950-51 season (Row 4), it's listed as 54. So that matches up.\n\nThen, the claim says \"with 30 won and 24 lost and 0 tie\". Let me cross-reference these numbers with Row 4. The 'won' column has 23, 'lost' has 24, and 'tied' is 7. Wait a minute, the claim says 30 won, but the table shows only 23 won. That's a discrepancy right there.\n\nSince one of the key figures in the claim doesn't match the actual data, I can already see that the claim isn't accurate. The number of wins is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions a standing of \"1st oha\". Looking at Row 4, under 'standing', it's listed as 6th. So not only are the wins wrong, but the standing is also different from what the claim states. The claim claims 1st place, but the table shows 6th.\n\nPutting this all together, there are multiple discrepancies between the claim and the actual data.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion. The claim says: \"the season with the lowest pct % be 1958 - 59 with 769\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's saying that in the table, the season 1958-59 has the lowest percentage (pct %) and the value is 0.769. Wait, the claim says \"769\", which doesn't make sense because pct % is a decimal. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Perhaps they meant 76.9% instead of 769? Or maybe the number after the colon in the table corresponds to something else.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: season (year), games, won, lost, tied, points, pct %, goals for, goals against, and standing. So I need to check the 'pct %' column for each row to find which season has the lowest value.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: 1947-48, pct%: 0.528\nRow 2: 1948-49, 0.552\nRow 3: 1949-50, 0.604\nRow 4: 1950-51, 0.491\nRow 5: 1951-52, 0.565\nRow 6: 1952-53, 0.598\nRow 7: 1953-54, 0.729\nRow 8: 1954-55, 0.673\nRow 9: 1955-56, 0.615\nRow 10: 1956-57, 0.5\nRow 11: 1957-58, 0.673\nRow 12: 1958-59, 0.769\nRow 13: 1959-60, 0.562\nRow 14: 1960-61, 0.438\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest pct %. Looking at all these values:\n\nThe highest is Row 7 with 0.729, and the lowest seems to be Row 14 at 0.438. So the season with the lowest pct % is 1960-61, not 1958-59 as the claim states.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"the season with the lowest pct% be 1958 - 59 with 769\". Since the claim mentions 769, which isn't a decimal, maybe there's confusion in the numbers. But looking at Row 12: 1958-59 has 0.769 as pct%, and that seems to be higher than other rows. For example, Row 14 is 0.438, which is lower.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because it's pointing to the wrong season. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\". The relevant cells would be the ones in Row 12 (pct%) and possibly the row for 1960-61 where the lowest actually is. But since the claim refers to 1958-59, I think only that cell is relevant to show it's wrong.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. So if the claim says the season with the lowest pct% is 1958-59 and 0.769, we need to verify both the season and the pct%. \n\nSo looking at the table:\n\nDoes 1958-59 have a pct% of 0.769? Yes, Row 12.\n\nIs that the lowest? No, because Row 14 has 0.438 which is lower.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because 1958-59 does not have the lowest pct%; instead, 1960-61 does.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 12: to check the season (1958-59)\nRow 14: to show that it's actually higher than another row\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to identify if 1958-59 has the lowest pct% in the table. Upon reviewing the data, Row 14 shows a lower pct% of 0.438 for the 1960-61 season. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pct %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"pct %}\n  ]\n}",
