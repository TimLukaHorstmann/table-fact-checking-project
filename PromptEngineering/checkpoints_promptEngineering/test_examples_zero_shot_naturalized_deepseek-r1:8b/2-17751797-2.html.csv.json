    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of football matches from December 1990. The claim is that the most points scored by a team in a single game was 5, and it was by Woking. My job is to check if this is true.\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row and find where Woking played. From the table, I can see that Woking is listed as the home team in Row 6. The score for that match is 5 - 1 against Merthyr Tydfil. So, that's a score of 5 points for Woking.\n\nNow, I have to make sure that no other team scored more than 5 points in any single game. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Chesterfield vs Bolton Wanderers. Score is 3-4. Max is 4.\nRow 2: Bournemouth vs Hayes. Score 1-0. Max 1.\nRow 3: Barnet vs Northampton Town. 0-0. No goals.\nRow 4: Replay, Northampton vs Barnet. 0-1. Max 1.\nRow 5: Burnley vs Stoke City. 2-0. Max 2.\nRow 6: Woking vs Merthyr Tydfil. 5-1. Max 5.\nRow 7: Crewe Alexandra vs Atherstone United. 1-0. Max 1.\nRow 8: Shrewsbury Town vs Chorley. 1-0. Max 1.\nRow 9: Wycombe Wanderers vs Peterborough United. 1-1. Max 1.\nRow 10: Replay, Peterborough vs Wycombe. 2-0. Max 2.\nRow 11: Fulham vs Cambridge United. 0-0. No goals.\nRow 12: Replay, Cambridge vs Fulham. 2-1. Max 2.\nRow 13: Whitley Bay vs Barrow. 0-1. Max 1.\nRow 14: Scunthorpe United vs Tranmere Rovers. 3-2. Max 3.\nRow 15: Huddersfield Town vs Blackpool. 0-2. Max 2.\nRow 16: Mansfield Town vs York City. 2-1. Max 2.\nRow 17: Rotherham United vs Halifax Town. 1-1. Max 1.\nRow 18: Replay, Halifax vs Rotherham. 1-2. Max 2.\nRow 19: Aldershot vs Maidstone United. 2-1. Max 2.\nRow 20: Wigan Athletic vs Hartlepool United. 2-0. Max 2.\nRow 21: Colchester United vs Leyton Orient. 0-0. No goals.\nRow 22: Replay, Leyton Orient vs Colchester. 4-1. Max 4.\nRow 23: Birmingham City vs Brentford. 1-3. Max 3.\nRow 24: Leek Town vs Chester City. 1-1. Max 1.\nRow 25: Replay, Chester City vs Leek Town. 4-0. Max 4.\nRow 26: Swansea City vs Walsall. 2-1. Max 2.\n\nLooking through all these scores, the highest score in a single game is indeed 5 by Woking against Merthyr Tydfil on Row 6. No other team scored more than 5 points in any match. So, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the most point score by a team in a single game be 5 , by woking\" is supported by the data.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant cells:**  \n- **Row 6**, column \"Score\" (Away Team) - 1, but Woking scored 5 points.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the majority of replay game be win by the away team\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a match with details like tie no (which might indicate whether it's a replay), home team, score, away team, and date. The claim specifically mentions \"replay games,\" so I need to focus on rows where the tie no is marked as 'replay'.\n\nI'll go through each row and identify which ones are replays. \n\nRow 1: tie no: 1 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 2: tie no: 2 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 3: tie no: 3 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 4: tie no: replay \u2013 this is a replay game.\nRow 5: tie no: 4 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 6: tie no: 5 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 7: tie no: 6 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 8: tie no: 7 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 9: tie no: 8 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 10: tie no: replay \u2013 another replay game.\nRow 11: tie no: 9 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 12: tie no: replay \u2013 third replay game.\nRow 13: tie no: 10 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 14: tie no: 11 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 15: tie no: 12 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 16: tie no: 13 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 17: tie no: 14 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 18: tie no: replay \u2013 fourth replay game.\nRow 19: tie no: 15 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 20: tie no: 16 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 21: tie no: 17 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 22: tie no: replay \u2013 fifth replay game.\nRow 23: tie no: 18 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 24: tie no: 19 \u2013 not a replay.\nRow 25: tie no: replay \u2013 sixth replay game.\nRow 26: tie no: 20 \u2013 not a replay.\n\nSo there are six replay games in total (rows 4,10,12,18,22,25). Wait, let me count again:\n\nRows marked as replay:\n4,10,12,18,22,25. That's six rows.\n\nNow I need to check each of these replays to see if the away team won a majority. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 4: tie no: replay, home team: northampton town, score: 0-1 (away team: barnet). So away team wins.\nRow 10: home team: peterborough united, score: 2-0 vs wycombe wanderers. Home win.\nRow 12: replay, home team: cambridge united, score: 2-1 vs fulham. Home win.\nRow 18: home team: halifax town, score: 1-2 vs rotherham united. Away team wins.\nRow 22: home team: chester city, score:4-0 vs leek town. Home win.\nRow 25: replay, home team: chester city, score:4-0 vs leek town. Home win.\n\nSo out of six replays, how many did the away team win? Let's see:\n\nRows where away won:\nOnly row 4 and row18. So two wins by away teams.\n\nTherefore, in the replay games, only 2 out of 6 were won by away teams, which is not a majority (since majority would require at least three or more). The claim states that \"the majority of replay game be win by the away team,\" but in reality, it's just two wins. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\":\"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\":12, \"column_name\":\"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\":18, \"column_name\":\"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\":22, \"column_name\":\"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\":25, \"column_name\":\"tie no\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"On the first day of the cup, none of the away team win a game.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It looks like it's a list of football matches, with details such as tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. Each row corresponds to a specific match.\n\nThe claim is about the first day of the cup. So, I need to figure out which matches are on the first day. Looking at the dates in the table, they range from 07/12/1990 to 17/12/1990. The earliest date is 07/12, which seems like the first day. Let me check that.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see several with dates:\n- Row 11: 07/12/1990\n- Row 12: 11/12/1990 (replay)\n- Row 13: 12/12/1990\n\nSo, the first day of the cup is probably 07/12/1990. Therefore, I need to check all matches on that date.\n\nNow, let's identify which rows are on the first day:\n- Only Row 11 has a match on 07/12/1990.\n\nIn Row 11, the home team is Fulham and the away team is Cambridge United. The score is 0 - 0, which means it was a draw. So, neither team won; both teams have zero wins here.\n\nThe claim says that none of the away teams won any games on the first day. But in this single match on the first day, the away team (Cambridge United) didn't win either. So, does this mean that no away team won a game? Yes, because there's only one match and it was a draw.\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about the first day. If all matches on the first day resulted in draws or were replays without any wins for away teams, then the claim holds. But I should check if there are other rows that might fall under the first day.\n\nLooking again, Row 11 is the only one on 07/12. The next day, 08/12, starts with Row 2 and others. So, Row 11 is indeed the only match on the first day.\n\nSince in that single match, neither team won, all away teams (in the first day's matches) didn't win either. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because there were no wins by any away team on that first day.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"On the first day of the cup, none of the away team win a game,\" we focus on matches from 07/12/1990. The only match that day (Row 11) is a draw with a score of 0-0. Since neither team won, all away teams indeed did not win any games on that first day.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"chester city play the highest scoring shut out game : 4 to 0.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a \"shut out\" means in football (soccer). A shut out occurs when a team's goalkeeper prevents the opposing team from scoring any goals. So, a shut out would mean that the home team scored some goals and the away team didn't score at all, resulting in a score like 4-0.\n\nThe claim mentions \"chester city play the highest scoring shut out game : 4 to 0.\" I need to check if there's a match where Chester City scored 4 goals and the opposing team scored 0. \n\nLooking through the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Chesterfield, not Chester City. So, irrelevant.\nRow 2: Bournemouth vs Hayes. Not related.\nRow 3: Barnet vs Northampton Town. No.\nRow 4: Replay game involving Northampton and Barnet. Not relevant.\nRow 5: Burnley vs Stoke City. No.\nRow 6: Woking vs Merthyr Tydfil. No.\nRow 7: Crewe Alexandra vs Atherstone United. No.\nRow 8: Shrewsbury Town vs Chorley. No.\nRow 9: Wycombe Wanderers vs Peterborough United. No.\nRow 10: Replay between Peterborough and Wycombe. Not relevant.\nRow 11: Fulham vs Cambridge United. No.\nRow 12: Cambridge United vs Fulham (replay). Not a Chester City game.\nRow 13: Whitley Bay vs Barrow. No.\nRow 14: Scunthorpe United vs Tranmere Rovers. No.\nRow 15: Huddersfield Town vs Blackpool. No.\nRow 16: Mansfield Town vs York City. No.\nRow 17: Rotherham United vs Halifax Town. No.\nRow 18: Halifax Town vs Rotherham (replay). Not relevant.\nRow 19: Aldershot vs Maidstone United. No.\nRow 20: Wigan Athletic vs Hartlepool United. No.\nRow 21: Colchester United vs Leyton Orient. No.\nRow 22: Leyton Orient vs Colchester (replay). Not relevant.\nRow 23: Birmingham City vs Brentford. No.\nRow 24: Leek Town vs Chester City. Wait, this is a match between Leek Town and Chester City. So home team is Leek Town, away is Chester City. The score is 1-1, so not a shut out.\nRow 25: Chester City vs Leek Town (replay). Score is 4-0. Here, the home team is Chester City, away is Leek Town. So Chester City scored 4 goals, and Leek Town didn't score any. That's a shut out where Chester City scored 4-0.\n\nSo in row 25, the game is a replay between Chester City and Leek Town, with Chester winning 4-0. This matches the claim of a shut out by Chester City with a score of 4-0.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is row_index 24 (since rows are zero-indexed) and the column is \"score\". Wait, but in the table, each row has columns like \"home team\", \"away team\", and \"score\". So I need to check which columns are relevant. The claim talks about Chester City playing a game where they scored 4-0. So the key information is that in that game, Chester City scored 4 goals and the opponent scored 0.\n\nIn row 25 (which is actually the 24th index), the score is 4-0 for Chester City as the away team against Leek Town. Wait no, in row 25, the home team is Chester City? Let me check:\n\nLooking at row 24: home team Leek Town, away Chester City, score 1-1.\n\nRow 25: home team Chester City, away Leek Town, score 4-0.\n\nSo yes, that's the game where Chester City scored 4 and the opponent scored 0. Therefore, the relevant cells are row_index 24 (row 25 in the list) for \"home team\" as it's Chester City, and \"score\" which is 4 to 0.\n\nWait, but in the JSON example, the relevant_cells include row_index and column_name. So in this case, the game where Chester City scored 4-0 is at row_index 24 (since the table starts from 0). Wait no, rows are numbered from 0 to 25. So row 24 corresponds to the 25th entry in the list.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with zero-indexing. Let me recount:\n\nThe table has 26 entries, so rows are 0-25. The claim is about Chester City scoring 4-0, which is found at row 24 (as per the JSON example). Wait no, in the table, row 24 is Leek Town vs Chester City, score 1-1.\n\nRow 25 is the replay: home team Chester City, away Leek Town, score 4-0. So that's row_index 25, column_name \"score\". But wait, the claim says Chester City plays a game where they have a shut out of 4-0. So the relevant cells are row 25 (row_index 25), and the columns would be \"home team\" (Chester City) and \"score\" (4-0).\n\nWait, but in the JSON example, it's looking for cells that verify the claim. The claim is about Chester City playing a game with a shut out of 4-0. So I need to find the row where Chester City was the home team and scored 4, opponent scored 0.\n\nThat would be row 25: home team Chester City, away Leek Town, score 4-0. Therefore, the relevant cells are row_index 25, columns \"home team\" and \"score\".\n\nWait, but in the JSON example, each cell is an object with row_index (int) and column_name (string). So for row 25, home team is Chester City, so that's one relevant column: \"home team\". For the score, it's 4-0, which is another relevant column. Therefore, both columns need to be checked.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the score needs to be verified, but I think both are necessary because the claim mentions both the home team (Chester City) and the score.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, with relevant_cells being row 25 for \"home team\" and \"score\".\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Chester City played a game with a shut out of 4-0, we look through the table:\n\n- In row 25 (index 25), the home team is Chester City, away team Leek Town. The score is 4-0.\n- This matches the claim: Chester City scored 4 goals and the opponent scored none.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE with relevant cells at row_index 25 for \"home team\" and \"score\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It seems like it's saying that in row 8 of the table, the home team scored zero points.\n\nFirst, I should locate row 8. Scanning through the rows, row 8 has the following details: tie no: 8, home team: wycombe wanderers, score: 1 - 1, away team: peterborough united, date: 12 / 12 / 1990. The score here is 1-1, which means both teams scored a goal each. Therefore, the home team (Wycombe Wanderers) didn't score zero points; they scored one point.\n\nSo, the claim that \"8 team score zero point\" would imply that row 8's home team scored zero, but in reality, they scored one.

Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has several rows, each representing a match between a home team and an away team. Each row includes information like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. There are also some entries labeled as \"replay,\" which probably means that the game was replayed due to some condition, maybe a draw or other issues.\n\nThe claim is about the majority of replay games being won by the home team. So I need to focus on rows where the tie number is marked as \"replay\" and check if in those cases, the home team won more than half of them.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 4: Tie no: replay, Home: Northampton Town, Score: 0-1, Away: Barnet. Here, the away team won.\n2. Row 10: Tie no: replay, Home: Peterborough United, Score: 2-0, Away: Wycombe Wanderers. Home team won here.\n3. Row 18: Tie no: replay, Home: Halifax Town, Score: 1-2, Away: Rotherham United. Away team won.\n4. Row 22: Tie no: replay, Home: Leyton Orient, Score: 4-1, Away: Colchester United. Home team won.\n\nSo, looking at the replay games (rows 4,10,18,22), I have four results:\n\n- Northampton Town lost\n- Peterborough United won\n- Halifax Town lost\n- Leyton Orient won\n\nOut of these four replay games, two were wins for the home teams and two were losses. That's a 50-50 split, not a majority.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the majority of replay game be win by the home team\" is false because there isn't a clear majority; it's evenly split.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the most point score by a team in a single game be 5 , by leek town.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the highest points scored by any team in a single match being 5, and specifically that it's Leek Town who achieved this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different game or match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. So I need to search through these rows to find if there's a game where a team scored 5 points, and specifically if it was Leek Town in one of those games.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Chesterfield vs Bolton Wanderers, score 3-4. The highest score here is 4.\nRow 2: Bournemouth vs Hayes, 1-0. Max score is 1.\nRow 3: Barnett vs Northampton Town, 0-0. No goals.\nRow 4: Replay game involving Northampton Town and Barnett, 0-1. Max score is 1.\nRow 5: Burnley vs Stoke City, 2-0. Max score is 2.\nRow 6: Woking vs Merthyr Tydfil, 5-1. Here, the away team scored 5 points. So that's a single game where a team scored 5 points.

Here, the home team scored 4 points, but it's Leyton Orient, not Leek Town.\nRow 23: Brentford vs QPR, wait no, row 23 is Leek Town vs Brentford? No, looking at the data, row 24: Leek Town vs Chester City, score 1-1. Max is 1.\nWait, actually, let me check again:\n\nLooking back, rows are numbered up to row 26.\n\nRow 24: Leek Town vs Chester City, score 1-1. So max score here is 1.\nRow 25: Replay game between Chester City and Leek Town, 4-0. Here, the home team scored 4 points, but it's Chester City, not Leek Town.\nRow 26: Swansea City vs Walsall, 2-1.\n\nWait, so I need to check all rows for any instance where a team scored 5 in a single game, and whether that was Leek Town.\n\nSo far, row 6 shows Woking scoring 5. That's the only occurrence of a 5-point score in a game. No other games have a 5-0 or similar result except that one.\n\nTherefore, while there is a team (Woking) that scored 5 points in a single game, it wasn't Leek Town. The claim specifically attributes this to Leek Town, which isn't supported by the data provided. There's no row where Leek Town has a score of 5; their highest seems to be 4 in a replay game (row 25) but that was Chester City.\n\nSo the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the most points scored by a team in a single game is 5, achieved by Leek Town. After reviewing all matches, only Woking reached 5 points in one game, not Leek Town. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"woking play the highest scoring shut out game : 4 to 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. A \"shut out\" in football (soccer) means that one team scored no goals, while the other did. The term \"highest scoring shut out\" implies that Woking not only had a shut out but also scored the most goals in that game. So, for their match, Woking must have won 4-0.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to find any matches where Woking is either the home or away team and check if they have a score of 4-0 against someone else.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 6: tie no:5, home team: woking, score:5 -1. So Woking scored 5 goals against Merthyr Tydfil.\n- Other rows mention Woking but not with a 4-0 score. For example, Row 26: Swansea City vs Walsall is 2-1, so not 4-0.\n\nI don't see any row where Woking has a score of 4-0 against another team. The closest is their own game where they scored 5 goals. So, there's no evidence in the table that Woking achieved a 4-0 shut out. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"on the first day of the cup, none of the home team win a game\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. \n\nFirst, I should figure out what \"the first day of the cup\" refers to in this context. From the table, it seems like each row represents a match in some competition, possibly a cup, with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date.\n\nThe claim says that on the first day, none of the home teams won their games. So I need to check all the matches that took place on the earliest dates to see if any home team won.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"date\" which is in the format mm/dd/yyyy or similar. The earliest date in this dataset seems to be 07/12/1990 (Row 11) and 08/12/1990 (Rows 2,3,5,6,14,19,20). So the first day would likely be December 7th, 1990.\n\nNow I need to check all matches from December 7th, 1990. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 11: Date is 07/12/1990. Home team: Fulham vs Cambridge United. Score 0-0. So it's a draw. No win for either home or away.\n\nNext, I need to see if any other matches on the first day had a home team winning. Since Row 11 was the earliest date, and it's a draw, I don't need to check beyond that because the claim is about the first day. So no wins by home teams on that day.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other matches from December 7th or earlier. Looking at all rows, Row 11 seems to be the earliest with 07/12/1990. So only that match happened on the first day of the cup in question here.\n\nSince none of the home teams won on that day, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut I should also check if any other matches from December 7th exist, but based on the table provided, Row 11 is the earliest with that date. So only one match, which was a draw.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cell is row_index 11, column_name 'score' because it shows 0-0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"7 team score zero point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions a specific scenario: there's a match where the home team has a score of zero points, specifically when the tie number is 7. So I need to look through the table for any row where \"tie no\" is 7 and check if the home team scored zero points.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one until I find the row with tie number 7. Let me scan the table:\n\nRow 1: tie no:1\nRow 2: tie no:2\n...\nWait, let's list them properly:\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Row 7: tie no:6\n- Row 8: tie no:7\n\nAh, there it is. So row 8 has tie number 7. Now, I need to check what the score for that row is.\n\nIn row 8, home team is shrewsbury town, and the score is 1 - 0 against chorley. So the home team scored 1 point, not zero. That means the claim about \"7 team score zero point\" isn't true for this row.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows with tie number 7 that I might have missed, but from the table provided, it seems only row 8 has tie no:7. \n\nSo, since none of the matches with tie number 7 had a home team scoring zero points, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in match number 7, the home team scored zero points. However, upon reviewing the table, the match at tie number 7 involves Shrewsbury Town as the home team with a score of 1-0 against Chorley. Therefore, no match at tie number 7 had a home team scoring zero.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
