    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"prix uip venezia be the nominating festival for germany\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"prix uip venezia,\" which from the table seems to be a specific category's name. Looking at the table, I see that in row 11, the nominating festival is \"prix uip venezia.\" So that part checks out\u2014it's indeed one of the festivals listed for Germany.\n\nNext, the claim says this festival is the \"nominating festival for germany.\" From the table, each row has a country associated with it. For example, row 11 has the country as Germany and the festival as prix uip venezia. So, that aligns with the claim.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other relevant rows that might contradict this. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Rows 1-10: Each has a different country and festival, so none relate to Germany and Venezia.\n- Row 11: This is where Germany's entry is listed with prix uip venezia as the nominating festival.\n- Rows after 11: They have countries other than Germany.\n\nSo, since row 11 explicitly states that Germany is associated with prix uip venezia, the claim seems to be correct. I don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would suggest another festival is the nominating one for Germany. Therefore, the claim appears to be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"nominating festival\"}]}",

The claim is: \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea be the short film nominate for uip berlin in 2004.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's stating that a specific short film named \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\" was nominated for the UIP Berlin in 2004.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row for this film and the relevant details. \n\nI'll start by scanning through all rows under the 'film' column since that's where the titles are listed. Let me go through each one:\n\nRow 1: j'attendrai le suivant\nRow 2: les baisers des autres\nRow 3: poveste la scara c\nRow 4: un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\nRow 5: fender bender\nRow 6: alt i alt\nRow 7: panique au village : les voleurs des cartes\nRow 8: love me or leave me alone\nRow 9: ich und das universum\nRow 10: la nariz de cleopatra\nRow 11: goodbye\nRow 12: 7:35 de la ma\u00f1ana\n\nFrom this, I can see that the film in question is indeed listed in Row 4. Now, let's check the 'nominating festival' column for that row. It says \"prix uip berlin,\" which matches the claim.\n\nAdditionally, we should verify the category and year mentioned in the claim. The category is given as \"short film 2004 prix uip,\" which aligns with both the claim and the table data.\n\nSo, all relevant information is present in Row 4: the film title, nomination for UIP Berlin, category, and year are consistent with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be Row 4 with 'film' as the column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"film\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions a film titled \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\". The claim says it was nominated for the Prix UIP Berlin. So, I need to find this film in the table and check its category and festival.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a film entry with details like category, film name, directors, country, and nominating festival. I'll go through each row one by one until I find \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\".\n\nRow 1: Film is \"j'attendrai le suivant\" \u2013 not matching.\nRow 2: \"les baisers des autres\" \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: \"poveste la scara c\" \u2013 no match.\nRow 4: \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\" \u2013 This is the film we're looking for. \n\nNow, checking the category for this row: it's listed as \"short film 2004 prix uip\". The festival mentioned is \"prix uip berlin\". So, the film was indeed nominated for Prix UIP Berlin.\n\nWait, but sometimes films might be listed with multiple directors or in different categories, but here it's straightforward.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's stating that Torbj\u00f8rn Sk\u00e5rild directed a film called \"alt i alt.\" My task is to check if there's any row in the table where Torbj\u00f8rn Sk\u00e5rild is listed as one of the directors for that specific film.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has 12 rows. Each row has several columns: category, film, director(s), country, and nominating festival. My focus here is on the \"director(s)\" column because that's where the claim's truthfulness lies.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if Torbj\u00f8rn Sk\u00e5rild is mentioned as a director for \"alt i alt.\" \n\nStarting from Row 1: The film is \"j'attendrai le suivant,\" directors are Philippe Orreindy. Not our guy.\n\nRow 2: \"les baisers des autres\" with Carine Tardieu. Nope.\n\nRow 3: \"poveste la scara c\" directed by Cristian Nemescu. Not Torbj\u00f8rn.\n\nRow 4: \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\" by Cristi Puiu. Still not matching.\n\nRow 5: \"fender bender\" directed by Daniel Elliott. No.\n\nRow 6: This is the one that catches my eye. The film here is \"alt i alt,\" and the director(s) are Torbj\u00f8rn Sk\u00e5rild. That matches exactly what the claim is saying. So this row is definitely relevant.\n\nRow 7: \"panique au village : les voleurs des cartes\" with directors Vincent Patar and St\u00e9phane Aubier. Not Torbj\u00f8rn, but also note that the country here is Belgium and France. Not relevant for our check.\n\nRows 8 to 12: These films don't match \"alt i alt,\" so no need to check further.\n\nWait, actually, I should make sure there are no other rows where Torbj\u00f8rn Sk\u00e5rild might be listed as a director for the same film. But looking at the table, Row 6 is the only one with both the film title and director matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there's a direct match in Row 6, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells are specifically the \"director(s)\" column of that row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the nominating festival for director be hold in 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It seems to suggest that a particular director's nomination was held in 2006. But looking at the table, all entries are from 2004. Each row lists the film, category, director(s), country, and the festival they were nominated for. The festivals listed include Prix UIP Ghent, Valladolid, Angers, Berlin, Tampere, Cracow, Grimstad, Vil\u00f2 do Conde, Sarajevo, Edinburgh, Venice, and Drama. These are all specific festivals, not necessarily tied to a particular year beyond 2004.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the nominating festival for director be hold in 2006.\" The key points here are the director (be) and the year 2006. Wait, looking at the directors in the table: Row 7 has directors Vincent Patar and St\u00e9phane Aubier from Belgium and France, but their festival is Grimstad, which isn't relevant to 2006. All other directors have festivals that don't relate to 2006 either.\n\nWait, actually, the claim might be saying that a director's nomination was held in 2006, but the table only goes up to 2004. So if all the entries are from 2004, there's no mention of any festival happening in 2006 for directors in this context.\n\nTherefore, since the claim refers to an event (nominating festival) occurring in 2006, and the table shows that all relevant festivals occurred in 2004, the claim is not supported by the table. Thus, it should be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests a director's nomination was held in 2006, but the table only lists 2004 events.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim \"the for prix uip berlin be short film be fender bender\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's trying to assert that the category \"prix uip berlin\" corresponds to a short film titled \"fender bender.\" So, in other words, there should be a row in the table where the category is \"prix uip berlin,\" the film is \"fender bender,\" and it's under the \"short film 2004 prix uip\" category.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check for this specific combination. The table has several rows, each with different categories, films, directors, countries, and festivals.\n\nLooking at Row 5: category is \"short film 2004 prix uip,\" film is \"fender bender,\" director(s) are Daniel Elliott, country is Estonia, and the festival is \"prix uip tampere.\" So here, the category is indeed \"prix uip,\" but the specific festival mentioned is \"tampere,\" not \"berlin.\"\n\nNext, I need to check if there's a row where both the category is \"short film 2004 prix uip\" and the festival is \"prix uip berlin,\" along with the film being \"fender bender.\" \n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 5 has \"fender bender\" but with \"tampere.\"\n- No other row seems to have both \"fender bender\" and \"prix uip berlin.\"\n\nTherefore, there's no row that satisfies all three conditions: category as \"short film 2004 prix uip,\" film as \"fender bender,\" and festival as \"prix uip berlin.\" So the claim is FALSE because the specific combination doesn't exist in the table.\n\nTo confirm, I should identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be Row 5 for the film name and the category, but since the festival isn't matching, those are the only ones to check. However, since none of the rows have all three attributes together, the claim fails.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"film\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"prix uip tampere be the nominating festival for un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asserting. It seems like the claim is stating two things:\n\n1. The festival in question is called \"prix uip tampere.\"\n2. This festival is the nominating festival for the film titled \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea.\"\n\nSo, I need to check both of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's a list of 12 rows, each representing different films with their categories, titles, directors, country, and nominating festival. The claim specifically mentions \"prix uip tampere\" as the festival and the film \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea.\"\n\nFirst, I should find the row where the film is \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea.\" Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 4: category: short film 2004 prix uip, film: un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea, director (s): cristi puiu, country: romania, nominating festival: prix uip berlin.\n\nSo, this is row 4. The film matches the title in the claim.\n\nNow, checking the nominating festival for this film. According to row 4, it's \"prix uip berlin.\" However, the claim states that the festival is \"prix uip tampere.\"\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here. The film's nominating festival is not \"prix uip tampere\" but \"prix uip berlin,\" which is different.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while the film exists in the table, the specific festival mentioned in the claim doesn't match the one listed for that film.\n\nAdditionally, I should look at other rows to see if any have \"prix uip tampere\" as their nominating festival. Let's check each row:\n\n- Row 5: category: short film 2004 prix uip, film: fender bender, director (s): daniel elliott, country: estonia, nominating festival: prix uip tampere.\n\nAh, here we go. In row 5, the film is \"fender bender\" and its nominating festival is \"prix uip tampere.\" So, that's where the festival name comes from.\n\nBut wait, the claim links \"prix uip tampere\" to a different film: \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea,\" which actually has \"prix uip berlin.\" Therefore, the claim incorrectly associates the festival with the wrong film.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- The correct festival for \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\" is \"prix uip berlin.\"\n- The festival \"prix uip tampere\" is associated with another film (\"fender bender\").\n- Therefore, the claim that \"prix uip tampere be the nominating festival for un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\" is FALSE.\n\nNow, to map this out, the relevant cells would be:\n\n1. The row where the film is \"un cartus de kent si un pachet de cafea\" (row 4), and the column \"nominating festival.\"\n2. The row where the festival is \"prix uip tampere,\" which is row 5, in the same column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at row indices 4 and 5, both looking at the \"nominating festival\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates \"prix uip tampere\" with a film that it actually doesn't. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominating festival\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominating festival\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
