    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row related to David Frost in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that Row 3 is about David Frost. His country is listed as \"south africa.\" So, according to the table, David Frost is from South Africa, not the United States.\n\nNow, let me check if there's any other relevant information in the table that might affect this claim. The claim is specifically about David Frost's place of origin, so the only relevant row is Row 3 where his country is listed as south africa. There are no conflicting or additional rows that mention him being from the United States.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other data in the table that might be related, but it seems like each row is about a different player with their respective details. Since David Frost's country is explicitly stated, there's no need to look elsewhere for confirmation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in Row 3 of the table, the claim that David Frost is from the United States is incorrect because he's actually from South Africa.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because David Frost's country is listed as south africa in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
