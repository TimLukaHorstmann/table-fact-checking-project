Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 10 corresponds to June 13.\n\nNext, I check the columns related to the record. In each row, there are fields like score, loss, attendance, and record. The record column shows the team's standing after that game.\n\nFor Row 10: date is June 13, opponent is Phillies, score is 4-3, loss is Spoljaric with a pitching record of 0-3, attendance is 26799, and the record listed is 29 - 32.\n\nSo, the claim mentions the record on June 13 is 29 - 32. According to the table, that's exactly what it shows for Row 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instruction about the record for June 13. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the record for june 13 be under 29 - 32\". So, I need to find the record corresponding to June 13 in the table and check if it falls below 29-32 wins-loss.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific date with various details. The 'record' column shows the team's win-loss record after that game. For June 13, which is Row 10, the opponent is the Philadelphia Phillies (Phillies), and the score is 4-3. The loss is attributed to Spoljaric with a score of 0-3.\n\nNow, I need to check what the team's record was on June 13. According to the table, on that day, after the game, the record became 29-32. Wait, but before the game, it might have been different. Let me clarify: The 'record' in each row is their standing after that particular game.\n\nSo, Row 10 has a date of June 13, and the record after the game is listed as 29-32. That's exactly what the claim is about. The claim states that \"the record for june 13 be under 29 - 32\". However, if their record was 29-32 on June 13, then it's not under that number\u2014it's equal to it.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim refers to before the game. Let me check: The 'record' is after the game, right? So, in Row 10, they played and ended up with 29-32. That would mean their record on June 13 after the game was 29-32, not under that number.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me look again: The 'record' is listed as 29-32 for Row 10. So if the claim says \"under 29-32\", it's claiming their record was worse than 29-32. But since they ended up at exactly 29-32, it's not under. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me confirm: The record after each game is recorded as wins-loss. So on June 13, their record became 29-32. So the claim says \"the record for june 13 be under 29 - 32\". Since it's exactly 29-32, not under, the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014maybe the claim is about before June 13. Let me check: The table doesn't show the record before the game; each row only shows the result after the game. So perhaps on June 12, their record was 28-32, and after June 13, it became 29-32.\n\nSo, if someone claims that on June 13, their record was under 29-32, but in reality, after that game, it reached 29-32, then the claim is incorrect. Therefore, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe record for June 13 as per the table shows a win-loss of 29-32, which means the team did not have a record under 29-32 on that date.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** Locate the row corresponding to June 13, which is Row 10.\n2. **Check Record Value:** In Row 10, the 'record' column shows 29-32.\n3. **Analyze Claim:** The claim asserts that this record is under 29-32. Since it equals 29-32, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
