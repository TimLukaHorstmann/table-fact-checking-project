    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim that \"in the 1987-88 season, Newell's Old Boys scored 55 points\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The key elements are:\n1. Season: 1987-88\n2. Team: Newell's Old Boys\n3. Points: 55\n\nI'll start by examining the table to find any rows related to the 1987-88 season and Newell's Old Boys.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different team with various statistics for three seasons: 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89. The relevant columns for this claim are:\n- \"team\": To identify which row belongs to Newell's Old Boys.\n- \"average\": Although not directly relevant here, it might be used in some calculations, but since the claim is about points specifically, I'll focus on that column.\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any of them match both the team and the season mentioned in the claim. \n\nStarting from Row 1: It's Independiente with data for all three seasons, including 1987-88 as 37 points. Not Newell's Old Boys.\n\nRow 2: This is Newell's Old Boys. Let me note down the values:\n- 1986-87: 48\n- 1987-88: 55\n- 1988-89: 33\n\nThis row matches both the team and the season specified in the claim, with points for 1987-88 being 55.\n\nBefore finalizing, I should check if any other rows might have conflicting information. Let's see:\n\nRow 3: San Lorenzo has 49 points in 1987-88, which doesn't match Newell's Old Boys.\n\nRows 4 to 19 don't mention Newell's Old Boys, and Row 20 is another team entirely.\n\nSo, it seems that only Row 2 accurately reflects Newell's Old Boys' performance in the 1987-88 season with 55 points. Therefore, the claim appears to be supported by this data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check for \"Newell's Old Boys\" in the 1987-88 season and look at their points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Maybe it's trying to say something like \"When points are 107 and in 1987-88 season, there were 31 games played.\" But I'm not entirely sure. Let me parse the claim more carefully.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different team with several columns: team name, average, points, played games, and then three seasons: 1986-87, 1987-88, and 1988-89. The claim mentions \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31.\" So I think it's trying to say that for a team where points are 107 and in the 1987-88 season, they played 31 games.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, most teams have \"played: 114\" except some later ones. For example, row 15 (deportivo mandiy\u00fa) has played:38, rows 20 (deportivo armenio) have played:76, and others like row 19 have played:38. So perhaps the claim is about a team that has points=107 and in 1987-88 season, they played 31 games.\n\nLooking through the table to find any team with points=107. Let me scan each row:\n\nRow 14: team: ferro carril oeste, points:107, average:0.939. Their 1986-87 is 44, 1987-88:33, and 1988-89:30. So in 1987-88, they played 33 games? Wait, the column says \"points:107\" but for ferro carril oeste, the points are 107. Their 1987-88 season has 33 points? Or is it that they played 33 games? Wait no, wait the table's structure is:\n\nEach row has team, average, points, played, then three seasons with their respective numbers.\n\nSo for ferro carril oeste (row14):\n\n- points:107\n\n- played:114 in total. For each season:\n\n1986-87:44,\n\n1987-88:33,\n\n1988-89:30.\n\nWait, so the 1987-88 season has 33 points? Or is it that they played 33 games? Wait no, I think \"points\" is a separate column from \"played.\" So for each team, points are their total points for that season. The \"played\" number refers to how many games they played in the league that season.\n\nWait no, perhaps \"played\" is the total games played across all seasons. Let me check:\n\nLooking at row14: played:114, which I think is the total number of games played over the three seasons listed (1986-87, 1987-88, 1988-89). So each season's games are separate.\n\nWait no, actually, looking back, in the table, it seems that for each team, \"played\" refers to the total number of games they played across all three seasons. For example, most teams have \"played:114\", which probably means they played 114 games in total across 86-87, 87-88, and 88-89.\n\nBut wait, looking at row14 (ferro carril oeste):\n\nThey have:\n\npoints:107,\n\naverage:0.939,\n\nplayed:114,\n\n1986-87:44,\n\n1987-88:33,\n\n1988-89:30.\n\nSo each season's data is likely the number of games played in that specific season, not points. So for 1987-88, they played 33 games.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"when 1987 - 88 be 31,\" which would mean 31 games played in 87-88.\n\nSo let me look for a team where:\n\nPoints =107 and in the 1987-88 season, they played 31 games.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow14: points=107, in 87-88 they played 33.\n\nIs there any other row with points=107? No, seems only ferro carril oeste has points=107. So in their 87-88 season, they played 33 games, not 31.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because that team's 87-88 games are 33, not 31.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again: \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31.\"\n\nMaybe it's trying to say that for a team with points=107, in their 87-88 season, they played 31 games, and also have total games=114.\n\nLooking at row14:\n\nPoints:107,\n\nPlayed:114 (total),\n\nIn 87-88:33 games.\n\nSo if the claim says when points=107 and in 87-88=31, but actual is 33. So it's false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misphrased, and they meant that for a team with points=107, their played games in 87-88 are 31, which isn't the case here because ferro carril oeste has 33 games in 87-88.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect, so answer is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when a team's points are 107 and they played 31 games in the 1987-88 season. Checking the table, only ferro carril oeste has 107 points, but their 1987-88 games were 33, not 31.\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":14, \"column_name\":\"points\"}]}",
