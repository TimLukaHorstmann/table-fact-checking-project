    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the structure of the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be no competition in the women double the year that there be no competition in both the men double and the men single.\"\n\nBreaking this down, it's about checking whether in a particular year, if both men's doubles and men's singles have no competitions, then the women's doubles should also have no competition. Wait, actually, I need to parse the claim correctly. The claim seems to state that in a given year, if there's no competition in both the men's double and the men's single, then there is no competition in the women's double as well.\n\nWait, actually, it might be phrased differently. Let me read it again: \"there be no competition in the women double the year that there be no competition in both the men double and the men single.\" So it's saying that in a certain year, if both the men's doubles and men's singles have no competitions, then the women's doubles also have no competition.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim could be rephrased as: In a given year where there are no competitions in the men's doubles and men's singles, there should also be no competition in the women's doubles.\n\nSo my task is to check if this statement holds true based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year (but some rows have two years, like row 2: 1992 1996), and then for each gender, there are competitions or not. The columns are men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nI need to find all the years where both the men's doubles and men's singles have no competition. Then, in those same years, check if the women's doubles also have no competition.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is a bit confusing. It says \"there be no competition in the women double the year that there be no competition in both the men double and the men single.\" So it's saying that in any year where both men's doubles and men's singles have no competitions, the women's doubles must also have none.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's stating that whenever both men's doubles and men's singles are absent, then the women's doubles must also be absent. So I need to look for years where both men's doubles and men's singles are 'no competition', and in those same years, check if women's doubles are also 'no competition'.\n\nNow, looking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: year 1991\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow (competition exists)\n- Women's singles: Inga Beridse\n- Men's doubles: no competition\n- Women's doubles: no competition\n- Mixed doubles: no competition\n\nSo in 1991, men's doubles and men's singles both have no competitions? Wait, men's singles has a name, so it's a competition. So for row 1, men's singles is not no competition.\n\nRow 2: years 1992 and 1996\n- Men's singles: no competition\n- Women's singles: no competition\n- Men's doubles: no competition\n- Women's doubles: no competition\n- Mixed doubles: no competition\n\nSo both men's doubles and men's singles have no competitions in these years. Now, check women's doubles: also no competition.\n\nRow 3: 1997\n- Men's singles: Mjawia Malchas (competition exists)\n- So not relevant because men's singles is present.\n\nRow 4: 1998\n- Men's singles: same as row 1\n- So competitions exist, so not applicable.\n\nRow 5: years 1999 and 2000\n- Men's singles: no competition\n- Women's singles: no competition\n- Men's doubles: no competition\n- Women's doubles: no competition\n- Mixed doubles: no competition\n\nSame as row 2. So again, in these years, both men's doubles and men's singles have no competitions, and women's doubles also have none.\n\nRow 6: 2001\n- Men's singles: Malchas (competition exists)\n- So not applicable.\n\nRow 7: 2002\n- Men's singles: Mamuka Dsodsuaschwili (competition exists)\n- Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: 2003\n- Men's singles: Edgar Eremian (competition exists)\n- Not applicable.\n\nRow 9: 2004\n- Men's singles: Nodar Sardlischwili (competition exists)\n- So not relevant.\n\nRow 10: 2005\n- Men's singles: Mamuka Dsodsuaschwili (competition exists)\n- So no.\n\nRow 11: years 2006 and 2007\n- Men's singles: no competition\n- Women's singles: no competition\n- Men's doubles: no competition\n- Women's doubles: no competition\n- Mixed doubles: no competition\n\nSo again, both men's doubles and singles have no competitions. Now, check women's doubles: also none.\n\nWait, so in rows 2,5,11, whenever both men's doubles and singles have no competitions, women's doubles also have none.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any other years where this condition is met.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 1: 1991\n- Men's singles: competition exists \u2192 so doesn't satisfy the condition (since condition requires men's singles to have no competition)\n\nRows 2,5,11: all have both men's singles and doubles as no competitions. And in these rows, women's doubles are also no competitions.\n\nIs there any row where both men's doubles and singles are no competition, but women's doubles are a competition?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: women's doubles: no\n\nRow 2: women's doubles: no\n\nRow5: same as row2\n\nRow11: same\n\nSo in all cases where both men's doubles and singles have no competitions, women's doubles also have none.\n\nTherefore, the statement in the claim holds true for all instances in the table provided. Hence, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves verifying whether, in a given year where both men's doubles and men's singles have no competitions, the women's doubles also have no competition. After analyzing each row of the table, it's observed that whenever both men's doubles and men's singles are absent (no competition), the women's doubles are also absent.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that there was no competition in women's singles for the years 1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each year mentioned in the claim one by one and check if there's any competition listed in the women's singles column for those years.\n\nStarting with 1992: Looking at Row 2 (since row indices start at 0), the women's singles is marked as \"no competition\". So that's correct.\n\nNext, 1996: This is also covered in Row 2. Women's singles are again \"no competition\".\n\nThen, 1999 and 2000: These fall under Row 5 (years 1999-2000). The women's singles for both years are listed as \"no competition\". So that checks out.\n\nNow, 2006 and 2007: Both of these are in Row 11. For both years, the women's singles column says \"no competition\".\n\nI need to make sure I'm looking at the correct rows. Let me count:\n\n- 1992 is Row 2\n- 1996 is also Row 2\n- 1999 and 2000 are Row 5\n- 2006 and 2007 are both in Row 11\n\nAll of these entries show no competition in women's singles, so the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to list the relevant cells. Each relevant cell is a row where the claim's year exists and the column is women's singles.\n\nSo for each year:\n\n- 1992: Row 2, \"women's singles\"\n- 1996: Row 2, \"women's singles\"\n- 1999: Row 5, \"women's singles\"\n- 2000: Row 5, \"women's singles\"\n- 2006: Row 11, \"women's singles\"\n- 2007: Row 11, \"women's singles\"\n\nI should list each of these as separate entries in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"there be no competition in women 's double or in men 's double in the year when arthur chatschatourow win the men 's single.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify what parts of the claim are relevant to the table data.\n\nThe key elements in the claim are:\n1. Arthur Chatschatourow wins the men's singles.\n2. In that same year, there is no competition (i.e., \"no competition\") in both women's doubles and men's doubles.\n\nSo I need to find the row(s) where Arthur Chatschatourow won men's singles and then check if, in those rows, women's doubles and men's doubles are marked as \"no competition.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 1 (1991)**: Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow. But for that row, both women's and men's doubles are listed as \"no competition.\" So this row seems relevant.\n\n- **Other rows**: I should check if there are any other years where Arthur Chatschatourow won men's singles. Scanning through the table:\n\n  - Row 3 (1997): Men's singles is Mjawia Malchas.\n  - Row 4 (1998): Men's singles is Mjawia Malchas.\n  - Row 5 onwards: No mention of Arthur Chatschatourow winning men's singles again.\n\nSo, only Row 1 has Arthur Chatschatourow in the men's singles. Now, for that row, women's doubles and men's doubles are both \"no competition.\"\n\nWait, but looking at Row 1 details:\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow\n- Women's singles: Inga Beridse\n- Men's doubles: No competition\n- Women's doubles: No competition\n- Mixed doubles: No competition\n\nSo in that year (1991), the women's doubles and men's doubles indeed have no competition. Therefore, the claim holds true for 1991.\n\nNow, considering the claim says \"in the year when Arthur Chatschatourow wins the men's single,\" it refers to that specific year. Since in 1991 both women's and men's doubles had no competition, the claim is supported as TRUE.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows where Arthur might have won but I don't see any, so only Row 1 is relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for the year Arthur Chatschatourow won men's singles and confirm that both women's doubles and men's doubles had no competition in that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Men 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Women 's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Men 's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I'm looking for whether there were competitions in women's singles for those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year (and sometimes spans two years, like Row 11 covers 2006 and 2007). For each year, the table lists who won men's singles, women's singles, etc., if there was competition. If it says 'no competition', that means no one participated or the event didn't occur.\n\nSo I need to check for each of the specified years (1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2007) whether women's singles had a competition.\n\nLet me go through each year:\n\n1. **1992**: Looking at Row 2. It says women's singles: no competition.\n2. **1996**: Also in Row 2, same as above\u2014women's singles: no competition.\n3. **1999**: Row 5 covers 1999 and 2000. For 1999, it's 'no competition'.\n4. **2000**: Similarly, Row 5 for 2000 also says 'no competition'.\n5. **2006**: Row 11 covers 2006 and 2007. Both years have no competition in women's singles.\n6. **2007**: Same as above\u2014no competition.\n\nSo, for all the specified years (1992, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007), there was no competition in women's singles. Therefore, the claim that \"there be a lot of competition\" is false because none of those years had any competitions.\n\nWait, I should double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me verify:\n\n- Row 2 (1992/1996): both years have no competition in women's singles.\n- Row 5 (1999/2000): same result.\n- Row 11: 2006 and 2007, no competition.\n\nYes, all these checks out. So the claim is indeed false because there was no competition in women's singles during those specified years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"natia marianaschwili tschachoian gaiane win the women 's double every year after 2001.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three things:\n1. The person's name: natia marianaschwili tschachoian gaiane.\n2. The event: women's doubles.\n3. The timeframe: every year after 2001.\n\nSo, I need to check if this specific person won the women's doubles each year starting from 2002 onwards (since it's \"after 2001\").\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and details various competitions like men's singles, women's singles, etc. The relevant columns for the claim would be 'women 's doubles' since that's where we need to track wins.\n\nI'll go through each row starting from 2002 onwards (since it's after 2001) and check if natia marianaschwili is listed in the women's doubles competition for those years.\n\nRow 1: Year 1991 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Year 1992-1996 \u2013 no competition, irrelevant.\nRow 3: 1997 \u2013 different people.\nRow 4: 1998 \u2013 same as above.\nRow 5: 1999-2000 \u2013 no competition.\nRow 6: 2001 \u2013 let's see. The mixed doubles are mentioned, but women's doubles for 2001 is \"natia marianaschwili tschachoian gaiane.\" Wait, the claim says \"every year after 2001,\" so maybe 2002 onwards.\n\nSo starting from row 7: 2002. Women's doubles: no competition.\nRow 8: 2003. No competition.\nRow 9: 2004. The women's doubles are \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa.\" Not the person in question, so that's a different player.\n\nRow 10: 2005. Women's doubles: \"natela mirianaschwili ina davidowa\" again. Different from natia marianaschwili.\n\nRow 11: 2006-2007. No competition for women's doubles.\n\nWait, but row 6 is year 2001. Let me check that again. In row 6 (year 2001), the women's doubles are \"natia marianaschwili tschachoian.\" So in 2001, she won the women's doubles. The claim says \"every year after 2001,\" which would mean starting from 2002 onwards.\n\nBut looking at the table, for years 2002 and beyond, there's no record of her winning the women's doubles again. For example, row 7 (2002) has no competition in women's doubles, and rows 8-11 also don't list her as a winner in that category after 2001.\n\nTherefore, she only won in 2001, not every year after that.

The table has information about various competitions from different years, broken down into men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row corresponds to a specific year or range of years, and the columns list who participated or if there was no competition.\n\nThe claim I need to check is: \"in 2003, there be no competition for men 's double and women 's double, but edgar eremian play in the mixed double.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's making two assertions about the year 2003:\n\n1. There was no competition in men's doubles or women's doubles.\n2. Edgar Eremian participated in the mixed doubles.\n\nSo I need to look at row 8 of the table because it's for the year 2003. Let me find row 8:\n\nRow 8: year: 2003, men 's singles: edgar eremian, women 's singles: gaiane tschachoian, men 's doubles: no competition, women 's doubles: no competition, mixed doubles: no competition.\n\nNow, checking the relevant columns for each assertion:\n\n1. For \"no competition\" in men's doubles and women's doubles, I look at the column headers:\n   - Men 's doubles: no competition\n   - Women 's doubles: no competition\n\n2. For Edgar Eremian playing in mixed doubles, I check if there was a mixed doubles competition in 2003.\n\nLooking at row 8:\n\n- Men 's doubles and women 's doubles both say \"no competition,\" so the first part of the claim is supported.\n- Mixed doubles also says \"no competition.\" Wait, that's a problem because the second part claims that Edgar Eremian played in mixed doubles. But according to the table, there was no competition, meaning no one participated.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. The table shows no mixed doubles competition in 2003, which means Edgar Eremian couldn't have played there. Therefore, the claim is false because both parts can't be true simultaneously.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 2003, men's and women's doubles had no competition but Edgar Eremian participated in mixed doubles.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be a lot of competition in women 's double the year that there be no competition in the men 's double and when arthur chatschatourow win the men 's single.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components. There are two main parts:\n\n1. In a particular year, there is \"a lot of competition\" in women's doubles.\n2. In the same year, there is no competition in men's doubles.\n3. Additionally, Arthur Chatschatourow wins the men's singles that year.\n\nSo, I need to find a row in the table where all these conditions are met: women's doubles have competition, men's doubles do not, and men's singles are won by Arthur Chatschatourow.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table to check for these conditions.\n\nStarting with Row 1 (1991):\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow.\n- Women's singles: Inga Beridse.\n- Men's doubles: No competition.\n- Women's doubles: No competition.\n- Mixed doubles: No competition.\n\nHere, men's doubles and women's doubles are both no competition. Since the claim requires a lot of competition in women's doubles, this row doesn't satisfy that condition because women's doubles have no competition. So, Row 1 is out.\n\nRow 2 (1996):\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure, it seems each row represents a specific year, but sometimes two years are listed together, like \"year: 1992 1996\" in Row 2. That might be an error or perhaps indicating that there's no competition from 1992 to 1996. For now, I'll treat each entry as per the given data.\n\nRow 2 lists year 1992 and 1996 with all competitions (including doubles) having no competition. So, women's doubles are no competition here, which doesn't meet the claim's condition. So, Row 2 isn't relevant.\n\nRow 3 (1997):\n- Men's singles: Mjawia Malchas.\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachoian.\n- Men's doubles: Mjawia Malchas and Georgi Enukidse.\n- Women's doubles: Gaiane Tschachoian and Ia Chartonischwili.\n- Mixed doubles: Mjawia Malchas, Chatuna Chelidse.\n\nIn this row, men's doubles have competition, so it doesn't meet the condition of no competition in men's doubles. So, Row 3 is out.\n\nRow 4 (1998):\n- Men's singles: Mjawia Malchas.\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachoian.\n- Men's doubles: Mjawia Malchas and Georgi Enukidse.\n- Women's doubles: Gaiane Tschachoian and Chatuna Chelidse.\n- Mixed doubles: Mjawia Malchas and Gaiane Tschachoian.\n\nAgain, men's doubles are competitive here. So, no match for the claim.\n\nRow 5 (1999-2000):\nThis row has \"year: 1999 2000\" with all competitions as no competition. Since women's doubles have no competition, this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 6 (2001):\n- Men's singles: Mjawia Malchas.\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachoian.\n- Men's doubles: Mjawia Malchas and Georgi Enukidse.\n- Women's doubles: Natia Marianaschwili Tschachoian Gaiane.\n- Mixed doubles: Mjawia Malchas and Gaiane Tschachoian.\n\nHere, men's doubles are competitive. So, no match for the claim.\n\nRow 7 (2002):\n- Men's singles: Mamuka Dsodsuaschwili.\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachoian.\n- Men's doubles: No competition.\n- Women's doubles: No competition.\n- Mixed doubles: No competition.\n\nIn Row 7, men's doubles are no competition. So, women's doubles must have competition for the claim to hold. However, women's doubles here are also no competition. Therefore, this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nRow 8 (2003):\n- Men's singles: Edgar Eremian.\n- Women's singles: Gaiane Tschachoian.\n- Men's doubles: No competition.\n- Women's doubles: No competition.\n- Mixed doubles: No competition.\n\nSimilar to Row 7, men's doubles are no competition, but women's doubles also have no competition. So, this row doesn't meet the claim's conditions.\n\nRow 9 (2004):\n- Men's singles: Nodar Sardlischwili.\n- Women's singles: Natela Mirianaschwili.\n- Men's doubles: Nodar Sardlischwili and Edgar Eremian.\n- Women's doubles: Ia Chartonischwili? Wait, the table is a bit unclear here. The women's doubles for 2004 might be \"Natela Mirianaschwili\" but with partners? Let me check:\n\nWait, the row says:\nMen's singles: Nodar Sardlischwili.\nWomen's singles: Natela Mirianaschwili.\nMen's doubles: Nodar Sardlischwili and Edgar Eremian.\nWomen's doubles: [Ia Chartonischwili? Or something else].\nMixed doubles: [Possibly same as women's doubles or different].\n\nAssuming that in 2004, women's doubles have competition (since the claim requires it), but men's doubles are also competitive here. Therefore, men's doubles don't meet the no-competition condition.\n\nRow 10 (assuming there isn't one) is perhaps a wrap-up, so maybe we need to check again.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed something. Let me recheck each row carefully.\n\nLooking for a year where:\n1. Women's doubles have competition (i.e., not no competition).\n2. Men's doubles have no competition.\n3. Men's singles are won by Arthur Chatschatourow.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nRow 1: Men's singles - Arthur Chatschatourow, but women's doubles - no competition. So, doesn't fit condition 1.\n\nRow 3 onwards: Men's singles are either Mjawia or others, not Arthur. Only Row 1 has Arthur in men's singles.\n\nWait a minute! That's crucial. The claim requires that Arthur Chatschatourow wins the men's singles. From the table, only Row 1 (1991) lists him as the winner of men's singles. All other rows have different winners. Therefore, no other row satisfies the third condition except Row 1.\n\nBut in Row 1, women's doubles are no competition, which doesn't satisfy condition 1. So, none of the rows meet all three conditions. That suggests that there is no year where all three conditions are met.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false as per the table data provided.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I haven't missed any rows or misread anything.\n\nLet me list out all rows with their details:\n\n1. 1991:\n   - Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow\n   - Women's singles: Inga Beridse\n   - Men's doubles: No competition\n   - Women's doubles: No competition\n   - Mixed doubles: No competition\n\n2. 1992-1996:\n   - All competitions: no competition\n   - Women's doubles: no competition\n\n3. 1997:\n   - Men's singles: Mjawia Malchas\n   - Men's doubles: Yes, he and Georgi Enukidse.\n\n4. 1998:\n   - Men's doubles: yes.\n\n5. 1999-2000:\n   - All competitions: no competition\n\n6. 2001:\n   - Men's doubles: yes.\n\n7. 2002:\n   - Men's doubles: no, women's doubles: no.\n\n8. 2003:\n   - Men's doubles: no, women's doubles: no.\n\n9. 2004:\n   - Men's doubles: yes, women's doubles: not sure, but likely yes or no? Let me check again:\n\nIn Row 9 (2004), the entries are:\n\nMen's singles: Nodar Sardlischwili\nWomen's singles: Natela Mirianaschwili\nMen's doubles: Nodar Sardlischwili and Edgar Eremian\nWomen's doubles: [Not explicitly stated, but in original table, it might have been written as \"Natela Mirianaschwili\" or similar. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nRow 9: \n- Men's singles: Nodar Sardlischwili\n- Women's singles: Natela Mirianaschwili\n- Men's doubles: Nodar Sardlischwili and Edgar Eremian\n- Women's doubles: [Possibly Natela Mirianaschwili? Or someone else]\n- Mixed doubles: [Possibly same as women's doubles or different].\n\nAssuming that in 2004, the women's doubles are also competitive with Natela, but men's doubles are competitive as well. So, no competition in women's doubles? Wait, not necessarily. If a player is listed without a partner, it might mean they are alone, implying no doubles.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the structure isn't very clear. Maybe the table has separate columns for each category with 'No competition' or names. So, perhaps:\n\nEach row has columns: Men's singles, Women's singles, Men's doubles, Women's doubles, Mixed doubles.\n\nSo in Row 1 (1991):\n\nMen's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow\nWomen's singles: Inga Beridse\nMen's doubles: No competition\nWomen's doubles: No competition\nMixed doubles: No competition\n\nIn Row 2 (1992-1996):\n\nAll categories: No competition.\n\nRow 3 (1997):\n\nMen's singles: Mjawia Malchas\nWomen's singles: [Not listed? Or same as Men's?]\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nEach row likely has all five categories. So in Row 1:\n\n1991:\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow\n- Women's singles: Inga Beridse\n- Men's doubles: No competition\n- Women's doubles: No competition\n- Mixed doubles: No competition\n\nRow 2 (1992-1996):\n- Men's singles: [Not listed? Or same as women's?]\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nBut wait, the initial instruction said:\n\n\"Please provide your task breakdown here.\"\n\nSo perhaps in each row, it's:\n\nMen's singles, Women's singles, Men's doubles, Women's doubles, Mixed doubles.\n\nThus, Row 1:\n\n1991:\n- Men's singles: Arthur Chatschatourow\n- Women's singles: Inga Beridse\n- Men's doubles: No competition\n- Women's doubles: No competition\n- Mixed doubles: No competition\n\nRow 2 (1992-1996):\n- All categories: [Not specified, but from initial, probably all 'No competition']\n\nSo:\n\nMen's singles: [No competition]\nWomen's singles: [No competition]\nMen's doubles: [No competition]\nWomen's doubles: [No competition]\nMixed doubles: [No competition]\n\nRow 3 (1997):\n- Men's singles: Mjawia Malchas\n- Women's singles: [Not specified, but since men's is someone else, women's might be same or different? Wait, actually, in the initial data provided by the user, each row should have all five categories.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nRow 3 (1997):\nMen's singles: Mjawia Malchas\nWomen's singles: [Not specified, but likely 'No competition' because men are playing]\nWait, no. Each category is either a name or 'No competition'. So:\n\nIf Men's singles is someone, Women's singles could be the same or different.\n\nBut without explicit data, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Row 3 (1997):\n\nMen's doubles: Yes, because Mjawia Malchas is there.\n\nWait, no. In Row 1, Men's singles is Arthur, Men's doubles is No competition.\n\nIn Row 3, Men's singles is Mjawia, so Men's doubles might be different or same? Wait, not necessarily.\n\nBut regardless, for our task, we need to check in each row whether:\n\n1. Women's doubles are NOT 'No competition' (i.e., have a name)\n2. Men's doubles are 'No competition'\n3. Men's singles is Arthur Chatschatourow\n\nFrom the table:\n\nOnly Row 1 has Men's singles as Arthur, but there, Women's doubles are No competition.\n\nRows beyond that do not have Men's singles as Arthur; only Row 1 does.\n\nTherefore, no other row meets all three conditions.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying if there exists a year where three specific conditions are met: Arthur Chatschatourow won the men's singles, the women's doubles had competition (i.e., not \"no competition\"), and the men's doubles were also without competition. \n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Men's Singles Won by Arthur Chatschatourow:** \n   - Only in 1991 does Arthur win the men's singles.\n\n2. **Women's Doubles Had Competition:**\n   - In 1991, women's doubles are listed as \"No competition,\" which means they didn't have a contest.\n\n3. **Men's Doubles Were Without Competition:**\n   - In 1991, men's doubles also were without competition.\n\n**Conclusion:** No year satisfies all three conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the claim is false based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** There is no such year; the claim is false.",
