    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"kansas city have no post - season record in 2013\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about Kansas City's post-season record in 2013. From the table, I can see that the last column is \"mlb affiliate,\" and each row represents a different season from 2001 to 2013. \n\nLooking at Row 13: season: 2013, manager: brian buchanan, record: 44 - 42, win %: 512, post - season record: -, post - season win %: -, mlb affiliate: kansas city.\n\nThe key here is that the \"post - season record\" for 2013 is \"-\", and so is the \"post - season win %.\" That suggests they didn't have a post-season in 2013. But wait, Kansas City's affiliate in 2013 was the Kansas City Royals, right? So, did they make the playoffs that year?\n\nI know from real-life knowledge that the Kansas City Royals had a good season in 2013, finishing with a record of 44-42 and a win percentage of .512. They were actually in the playoff hunt but didn't make it to the post-season because they finished third in their division behind the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox. So, they didn't qualify for the playoffs, which means their post-season record would indeed be \"-\", indicating no play-offs.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct as per the table. The relevant cell is Row 13, specifically the \"post - season record\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013. According to the table, Row 13 for 2013 shows a \"-\" in both post-season record and win percentage, indicating no post-season participation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"houston have no post - season record\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that Houston doesn't have a post-season record. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a season from 2001 to 2013. Each row has several columns: season, manager, regular season record, win %, post-season record, post-season win %, and MLB affiliate. The claim is about Houston's post-season record, so I should focus on the \"post - season record\" column.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row to check if any of them have Houston listed as their affiliate. Starting from Row 1: Houston affiliate with Joe Cannon. Then, Row 2 also says Houston under Joe Cannon. Wait, but the claim is about Houston having no post-season record. So, if a team has a post-season, they would have some record there; otherwise, it's left blank or marked as \"-\".\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Post-season record is 4-0.\nRow 2: It's \"-\", meaning no record because they didn't make the playoffs.\nRow 3: Houston again, with a post-season record of 0-2.\nRow 4: \"-\", so no post-season.\nRow 5: \"-\", same here.\nRow 6: 0-2 as well.\nRow 7: \"-\", no post-season.\nRow 8: \"-\", same.\nRow 9: \"-\", no post-season.\nRow 10: \"-\", so they didn't make it either.\nRow 11: \"-\", again, no post-season.\nRow 12: \"-\", no play-offs.\nRow 13: Kansas City is the affiliate here, so not Houston.\n\nNow, the claim is about Houston having \"no\" post-season record. So, I need to see if in any of the Houston-affiliated rows (Rows 1-2 and Rows 3-6) have \"-\" as their post-season record. Wait, but Rows 3 and 6 also show that when Houston made the playoffs, they had records. So, does \"no\" mean all instances where they didn't make it?\n\nBut the claim is a general statement: \"houston have no post - season record.\" That would imply that in every year, Houston did not have a post-season record. But looking at Rows 1 and 3 and 6, Houston did have post-season records\u2014either winning or losing. So, their post-season record isn't always \"-\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are years where Houston had a post-season record.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because some rows show that Houston had post-season records.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
