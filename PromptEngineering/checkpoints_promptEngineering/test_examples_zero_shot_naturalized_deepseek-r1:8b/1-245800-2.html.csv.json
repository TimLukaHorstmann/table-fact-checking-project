    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about the Salyut 6 missions is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"expedition salyut 6 - eo - 1 have a crew of yuri romanenko georgi grechko and salyut 6 - ep - 1 have a crew of vladimir dzhanibekov oleg makarov.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's making two specific statements about two different expeditions: one labeled \"salyut 6 - eo - 1\" and another as \"salyut 6 - ep - 1.\" The claim states that the crew for EO-1 includes Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko, while the EP-1 crew includes Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov.\n\nTo verify this, I should look into the table provided. Each row in the table represents a different expedition with details like the expedition number (EO or EP), the crew members, launch date, flight up/down information, landing date, and duration.\n\nI need to find rows that match the expeditions mentioned in the claim: EO-1 and EP-1.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Expedition is \"salyut 6 - eo - 1.\" The crew listed here is Yuri Romanenko, Georgi Grechko. That matches exactly what the claim states for EO-1. So this is relevant.\n\nRow 2: Expedition is \"salyut 6 - ep - 1.\" The crew includes Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov. This also aligns with the claim's statement about EP-1. So this row is also relevant.\n\nRows beyond that don't mention EO-1 or EP-1, so they can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in rows 1 and 2 respectively.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by the corresponding rows in the table, confirming both crew compositions accurately.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crew\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crew\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"expedition salyut 6 - eo - 1 last more than 80 day longer than expedition salyut 6 - ep - 1\". \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant to this claim. Looking at the table, each row has an expedition name, crew, launch date, flight up and down, landing date, duration in days.\n\nThe claim is comparing two specific expeditions:\n1. Salyut 6 - eo - 1\n2. Salyut 6 - ep - 1\n\nI need to find their respective rows. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: salyut 6 - eo - 1\n- Row 2: salyut 6 - ep - 1\n\nGreat, so those are the two rows we need.\n\nNow, checking the durations:\n- For Salyut 6 - eo - 1 (Row 1), the duration is 96.42 days.\n- For Salyut 6 - ep - 1 (Row 2), the duration is 5.96 days.\n\nThe claim states that the first one is more than 80 days longer than the second. So, let's calculate the difference: 96.42 - 5.96 = 90.46 days. \n\nSince 90.46 is indeed more than 80, the claim seems to hold true based on these numbers.\n\nTherefore, I should check if the relevant cells are correctly identified as Row 1 (columns: duration) and Row 2 (same). So, the answer should be TRUE with those two rows specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"duration\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"duration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that the longest expedition is Salyut 6 - eo - 4 with a duration of 184.84 days, and the next longest is Salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 175.02 days.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each row of the table and identify which rows have an 'duration (days)' value because that's what the claim is about. Let me list out all the rows and their durations:\n\nRow 1: 96.42\nRow 2: 5.96\nRow 3: 7.93\nRow 4: 139.62\nRow 5: 7.92\nRow 6: 175.02\nRow 7: 184.84\nRow 8: 7.87\nRow 9: 3.93\nRow 10: 7.86\nRow 11: 7.86\nRow 12: 12.8\nRow 13: 74.73\n\nNow, looking for the highest durations, I can see that Row 4 has 139.62 days and Row 6 has 175.02 days. Then Row 7 is the longest at 184.84 days.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says Salyut 6 - eo - 4 is the longest with 184.84 days, which matches Row 7. It also mentions that the next longest is Salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 175.02, but looking at Row 6, it's labeled as Salyut 6 - eo - 3.\n\nBut hold on, I think there might be a mistake here. The claim says \"the next longest,\" so after Salyut 6 - eo -4, the next should be the next highest duration. So after 184.84, Row 6 is 175.02, which is indeed the next highest before Row 4's 139.62.\n\nWait, no, actually Row 4 is 139.62 days, which is less than both 175 and 184. So the order from longest to shortest would be:\n\n1. Salyut 6 - eo -4: 184.84\n2. Salyut 6 - eo -3: 175.02\n3. Salyut 6 - eo -2: 139.62 (Row 4)\n4. The rest are much shorter.\n\nSo the claim correctly identifies that Salyut 6 - eo -4 is the longest, and the next is eo -3.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Salyut 6 expeditions is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim and then verify it step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the longest expedition after 5 june 1980 be expedition soyuz t - 4 with a duration of 74.73 day.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table are relevant to this claim. Since the claim refers to an expedition after June 5, 1980, I'll need to look at rows where the launch date is after that date.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Launch date December 10, 1977 \u2013 too early.\n- Row 2: January 10, 1978 \u2013 too early.\n- Row 3: March 2, 1978 \u2013 too early.\n- Row 4: June 15, 1978 \u2013 just after June 5, 1980? Wait, no, 1978 is before 1980. So it's way earlier.\n- Row 5: June 27, 1978 \u2013 same as above, much earlier.\n- Row 6: February 25, 1979 \u2013 still in the 70s.\n- Row 7: April 9, 1980 \u2013 that's after June 5, 1980. This is a candidate.\n- Row 8: May 26, 1980 \u2013 also after June 5, 1980. Another candidate.\n- Row 9: June 5, 1980 \u2013 exactly on the date mentioned, so it's right at the cutoff point. Let me include this one as well.\n- Rows 10-13: July 23, 1980; September 18, 1980; November 27, 1980; March 12, 1981. All after June 5, 1980.\n\nSo, rows 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 are relevant because their launch dates are on or after June 5, 1980.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"the longest expedition,\" so I need to find which of these has the highest duration. The claim specifically points to Soyuz T-4 with a duration of 74.73 days.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nRow 7: Expedition is Salyut 6 - eo - 6 (Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, Row 7's expedition is Salyut 6 - eo - 4. Duration is 184.84 days. That's longer than 74.73.\n\nWait, but the claim refers to Soyuz T-4 as the longest after June 5, 1980. Let me check which expeditions correspond to Soyuz T-4.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 7: flight up is Soyuz 35, landing down Soyuz T-3? Wait no, row 12 mentions Soyuz T-3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for Soyuz T-4. Let me scan each row.\n\nLooking through the rows again:\n\n- Row 12: flight up Soyuz T-3\n- Row 13: flight up Soyuz T-4\n\nAh, so row 13 is Salyut 6 - eo - 6, launched on March 12, 1981. Its duration is 74.73 days.\n\nWait, but row 7 has a duration of 184.84 days. So that's longer than 74.73.\n\nSo the claim says Soyuz T-4 with 74.73 days is the longest after June 5, 1980. But row 7 (Salyut 6 - eo - 4) was launched on April 9, 1980, so it's before June 5? Wait, no: wait, Salyut 6 - eo - 4's launch date is April 9, 1980, which is before June 5. So row 7 is not after the cutoff.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check the rows:\n\nRow 7: April 9, 1980 \u2013 that's in 1980 but before June 5? Wait, June 5 is in 1980 as well, so if a launch date is June 5 or later, it's after. So row 7 is April 9, which is before June 5, so not relevant for the claim.\n\nWait no, wait: the claim says \"after 5 june 1980,\" so any expedition launched on or after June 5, 1980, is considered. So let me check again:\n\nRow 7: April 9, 1980 \u2013 before June 5, so not relevant.\nRow 8: May 26, 1980 \u2013 also before June 5, so not relevant.\nRow 9: June 5, 1980 \u2013 exactly on the date, so included as after or on.\nRow 10: July 23, 1980 \u2013 after.\nRow 11: September 18, 1980 \u2013 after.\nRow 12: November 27, 1980 \u2013 after.\nRow 13: March 12, 1981 \u2013 after.\n\nNow, among these, row 9 is Soyuz T-4? Wait no. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the \"flight up\" column for each relevant row:\n\nRow 7: flight up Soyuz 35\nRow 8: flight up Soyuz t -3 (row 12)\nWait, perhaps I need to check which rows have flight up as Soyuz T-4.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nOnly row 13 mentions Soyuz T-4. It's Salyut 6 - eo -6, launched March 12, 1981, with duration 74.73 days.\n\nSo, in the relevant rows (7-13), which ones have the highest duration? Let me list their durations:\n\nRow 9: duration is 74.73\nRow 13: duration is also 74.73\nWait, no, row 13's duration is 74.73 as well.\nBut let me check each relevant row:\n\nRow 9: duration is 74.73 (Soyuz T-4)\nRow 12: duration is 12.8\nRow 7: but wait, if it's April 9, 1980, which is before June 5, so not counted.\nWait no, row 7 is Salyut 6 - eo -4, launched April 9, 1980 \u2013 so that's before the cutoff. So only rows starting from row 9 onward are relevant.\n\nSo among the relevant rows:\n\n- Row 9: Soyuz T-4, duration 74.73\n- Row 12: duration 12.8\n- Row 13: Soyuz T-4? Wait no, row 13's flight up is Soyuz T-4. So it's another expedition with the same name but different duration.\n\nWait, wait, looking at row 13: Salyut 6 - eo -6, flight up Soyuz T-4, duration 74.73.\n\nSo both row 9 and row 13 have Soyuz T-4 as their flight up, but row 9 is on June 5, 1980, with duration 74.73 days. Row 13 is March 12, 1981, also duration 74.73.\n\nWait no, the durations: row 9's duration is 74.73, and row 13's duration is 74.73 as well? Wait, in the table:\n\nRow 9's duration is listed as 74.73.\n\nRow 13's duration is 74.73.\n\nSo both have the same duration.\n\nBut then, are there any longer durations?\n\nLooking at other relevant rows:\n\n- Row 12: duration 12.8\n- Row 10: I think row 10 has duration not specified? Wait no, let me check each row.\n\nWait the user's table is a bit unclear, but assuming that the 'duration' is the third column.\n\nLet me list all relevant rows and their durations:\n\n1. Row 9 (June 5, 1980): Salyut 6 - eo -6, flight up Soyuz T-4, duration 74.73\n2. Row 10: not sure, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's table is in markdown with headers:\n\nColumns are:\n1. Mission Name\n2. Launch Date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n3. Duration (days)\n\nSo for row 9:\n\nMission: Salyut 6 - eo -6\n\nLaunch Date: 1980-06-05\n\nDuration: 74.73 days.\n\nSimilarly, row 13:\n\nMission: Salyut 6 - eo -6\n\nLaunch Date: 1981-03-12\n\nDuration: 74.73 days.\n\nSo both have the same duration of 74.73 days.\n\nNow, are there any other relevant rows with higher durations?\n\nLooking at row 7 and 8:\n\nRow 7: mission Salyut 6 - eo -4, launch date 1980-04-09, duration not sure, but probably less than 74.73 as it's launched earlier in the year.\n\nRow 8: Salyut 6 - eo -5, launch date 1980-05-26, duration maybe higher but not exceeding 74 days, perhaps.\n\nBut without exact numbers, I can't say for sure.\n\nHowever, the key point is that both row 9 and row 13 have Soyuz T-4 as their flight up and each has a duration of 74.73 days.\n\nSo the claim says that Soyuz T-4 with duration 74.73 days is the longest after June 5, 1980. But wait, if there's another mission (row 13) also with the same duration but launched later, then both are equally long.\n\nBut perhaps the claim refers to row 9, the one on June 5, 1980.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is referring only to row 13 as Soyuz T-4, and not considering others. I might need to clarify, but assuming that the user's table has only row 13 as Soyuz T-4 with duration 74.73 days, and no longer ones after June 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is making a mistake in identifying the Soyuz T-4 missions.\n\nBut based on the table provided:\n\nMissions after June 5, 1980:\n\n- Salyut 6 - eo -6 (row9): duration 74.73\n- Salyut 6 - eo -6 (row13): duration 74.73\n\nSo both have same duration. Therefore, the claim that Soyuz T-4 with 74.73 days is the longest after June 5, 1980, would be incorrect because there's another mission with the same duration.\n\nTherefore, the answer should point out that while Soyuz T-4 has a long duration, it's not necessarily the longest, as another mission also shares this duration.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Soyuz T-4 with a duration of 74.73 days is the longest after June 5, 1980, is partially accurate but incomplete. While both Salyut 6 - eo -6 missions launched on June 5, 1980 (row9) and March 12, 1981 (row13) have the same duration of 74.73 days, they are not the sole longest durations in the dataset. Therefore, the statement needs clarification to accurately reflect that multiple missions share this longest duration.\n\nAnswer:\nThe Soyuz T-4 with a duration of 74.73 days is one of the longest missions after June 5, 1980, but it shares this distinction with another mission, Salyut 6 - eo -6 launched on March 12, 1981.",

No, Row 1 is EP - EO - 1. So no, only Row 2 is EP - 1 with the crew mentioned. Therefore, the claim's first part seems incorrect because Yuri Romanenko and Georgi Grechko are from EP - EO - 1 (Row 1), not EP - 1.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the claim: Salyut 6 - EO - 1 has Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Oleg Makarov as crew. Checking Row 2 again, yes, that's exactly who they are. So this part of the claim is correct.\n\nBut wait, the first part is incorrect because it attributes EP - 1's crew to the wrong individuals.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Salyut 6 expeditions is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. The user wrote: \"the longest expedition be salyut 6 - eo - 4 at the longest expedition be salyut 6 - eo - 4 at 184.84 day duration and the next longest be salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 6 5.96 day day duration and the next longest be salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 175.02 day.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It looks like they're trying to say that Salyut 6 - EO - 4 is the longest expedition with 184.84 days, followed by two instances of Salyut 6 - EO - 3, one with 5.96 days and another with 175.02 days.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, I see multiple rows for each expedition type. Each row represents a specific mission of that type. For example, Salyut 6 - EO - 1 has several entries, probably different crew members launching on different dates.\n\nSo, to check the claim, I need to find out which expedition types have the longest duration and whether their durations match what's stated in the claim.\n\nLet me list all the expeditions with their duration:\n\n1. EO-1: 96.42 days\n2. EP-1: 5.96 days\n3. EP-2: 7.93 days\n4. EO-2: 139.62 days\n5. EP-3: 7.92 days\n6. EO-3: 175.02 days\n7. EO-4: 184.84 days\n8. EP-5: 7.87 days\n9. EP-6: 3.93 days\n10. EP-7: 7.86 days\n11. EP-8: 7.86 days\n12. EO-5: 12.80 days\n13. EO-6: 74.73 days\n\nFrom this list, the longest duration is EO-4 at 184.84 days. Then, looking for the next longest, it's EO-3 at 175.02 days.\n\nWait, but in the claim, after EO-4, it says \"the next longest be salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 5.96 day day duration.\" That doesn't make sense because EO-3 is way longer than that. The claim seems to have a mistake there. Alternatively, maybe they meant another EP-3? But looking back, the only EP-3 is mission number 5 with 7.92 days.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo or mixed up numbers. Let me check:\n\nThe claim says: \"the next longest be salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 6 5.96 day day duration.\" Maybe they meant 5.96 days for another EP-1? But EP-1 is much shorter, only 5.96 days. Alternatively, maybe the claim is saying that after EO-4 (184.84), the next longest is EO-3 (175.02) and then EO-2 (139.62). However, in the claim, it's stating \"next longest be salyut 6 - eo - 3 at 5.96 day,\" which doesn't align with the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to list the expeditions in order: EO-4 (184.84), then EO-3 (175.02), and then EP-1 (96.42). But the claim incorrectly states that after EO-4 comes an EP-3 with 5.96 days, which is not correct.\n\nSo, the claim seems to be incorrect because it mentions the duration of EP-3 as 5.96 days, but in reality, that's for a different mission (EP-1). Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly lists the durations of the expeditions. It states that after EO-4 comes an EP-3 with 5.96 days, which is actually for EP-1.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Duration\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"yuri romanenko be a member of the flight up soyuz t - 4 crew and also the flight upsoyuz t - 6 crew.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Yuri Romanenko is part of the Soyuz T-4 flight-up crew.\n2. Yuri Romanenko is part of the Soyuz T-6 flight-up crew.\n\nI need to check each row in the table for any mention of Yuri Romanenko and see if he was on these specific flights.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Expedition Salyut 6 - EO - 1, includes Yuri Romanenko as crew. Flight up is Soyuz 26.\nRow 11: Expedition Salyut 6 - EP - 8, crew includes Yuri Romanenko, flight up is Soyuz 38.\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a row where Yuri Romanenko was on the flight up of Soyuz T-4 and Soyuz T-6.\n\nFrom the table, I don't see any rows for Soyuz T-4 or Soyuz T-6 flights. The Soyuz t-2 is in Row 9, but that's under EP-6. The Soyuz t-3 is in Row 12, also under EO-5. There's no mention of T-4 or T-6.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row again:\n\nRows are labeled with Expedition names like Salyut 6 - EO-1, etc., and the flight up is listed as Soyuz x-y. For example, Row 9: flight up is Soyuz t-2.\n\nBut the claim mentions Soyuz T-4 and Soyuz T-6. Looking through all rows:\n\nRow 12: Flight up is Soyuz t-3.\nRow 13: Flight up is Soyuz t-4. Wait, here we go! Row 13 is Salyut 6 - EO-6, crew includes Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh. Flight up is Soyuz t-4.\n\nBut the claim says Yuri Romanenko was on T-4, but in reality, it's Row 1 (Soyuz 26) and Row 11 (Soyuz 38). So Yuri wasn't on T-4 or T-6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of Yuri Romanenko being part of either flight.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crew\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"crew\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the longest expedition after 5 June 1980 be expedition Soyuz 28 with a duration of 7.93 day.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows in the table are relevant. The claim mentions an event after 5 June 1980. So I should look for rows where the launch date is after this date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Launch date 10 December 1977 (before)\n- Row 2: 10 January 1978 (before)\n- Row 3: 2 March 1978 (before)\n- Row 4: 15 June 1978 (after)\n- Row 5: 27 June 1978 (after)\n- Row 6: 25 February 1979 (after)\n- Row 7: 9 April 1980 (after)\n- Row 8: 26 May 1980 (before)\n- Row 9: 5 June 1980 (the cutoff date, so after is needed)\n- Row 10: 23 July 1980 (after)\n- Row 11: 18 September 1980 (after)\n- Row 12: 27 November 1980 (after)\n- Row 13: 12 March 1981 (after)\n\nSo rows 4 to 13 are after 5 June 1980. The claim refers to \"the longest expedition after 5 June 1980,\" so we're focusing on these rows.\n\nNext, I'll look for the row where the crew or other details might correspond to Soyuz 28 with a duration of 7.93 days.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Row 4: Duration is 139.62 days.\n- Row 5: Duration is 7.92 days (close but not exactly 7.93)\n- Row 6: 175.02 days\n- Row 7: 184.84 days\n- Row 8: 7.87 days\n- Row 9: 3.93 days\n- Row 10: 7.86 days\n- Row 11: 7.86 days\n- Row 12: 12.80 days\n- Row 13: 74.73 days\n\nNone of these rows have a duration of exactly 7.93 days except for row 3, which is before the cutoff. Wait, row 3 has duration 7.93 but it's on 2 March 1978, which is before 5 June 1980. So that's not applicable.\n\nLooking at row 4: expedition EO-1, Soyuz 29 and 31. Duration is 139 days, way longer than others after the cutoff. But the claim refers to Soyuz 28 with 7.93 days. However, in the table, I don't see a row for Soyuz 28. The only Soyuz mentioned are numbers like 26, 38, etc., but not 28.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me check again:\n\n- Row 3: launch date 2 March 1978, duration 7.93 days. So that's Soyuz 26 (I think) with EO-1. But since it's before the cutoff, it doesn't count for the claim.\n\nTherefore, after 5 June 1980, there is no expedition named Soyuz 28 with a duration of 7.93 days. The closest is row 3, but it's too early.\n\nAdditionally, the only Soyuz numbers in the relevant rows are 29, 31, 38, T-3, T-4. So none are 28.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect. There's no expedition after 5 June 1980 named Soyuz 28 with a duration of 7.93 days.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is no expedition matching the criteria after the specified date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"duration\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
