    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on some data in a table. The claim is: \"On December 4, a game was played at the North Shore Event Centre.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and see what it's asking for. It specifies the date as December 4th and the venue as the North Shore Event Centre. My goal is to find if such a game exists in the provided table on that date at that location.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. So for December 4th, I need to check which rows have that date.\n\nI'll scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: December 3rd\n- Row 2: December 4th\n- Row 3: December 5th\n- Row 4: December 6th\n- Row 5: December 6th\n- Row 6: December 6th\n- Row 7: December 7th\n\nOnly Row 2 is on December 4th. Now, I need to check the venue for that row. Looking at Row 2's data: home team is the New Zealand Breakers, away team is Townsville Crocodiles, and the venue is North Shore Events Centre.\n\nThe claim says a game was played there on that date, which matches exactly with Row 2's details. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI don't need to consider any other rows because only Row 2 fits both the date and venue criteria.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions provided. The claim is: \"the game at the north shore event centre be play [sic] on december 4.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be verified. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Game location**: North Shore Event Centre\n2. **Date of the game**: December 4\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. My task is to check if there's a game on December 4th held at North Shore Event Centre.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date is December 3rd, venue is Win Entertainment Centre.\n- **Row 2**: Date is December 4th. The home team is New Zealand Breakers, away team is Townsville Crocodiles. Venue is North Shore Events Centre.\n\nThis matches both the date (December 4) and the venue (North Shore Event Centre). So, this row is relevant to the claim.\n\n- **Row 3**: December 5th, venue in Cairns Convention Centre.\n- **Row 4**: December 6th, venue Distinctive Homes Dome.\n- **Rows 5 and 6**: Both on December 6th but different venues.\n- **Row 7**: December 7th, Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\nNone of these other rows match the date (December 4) or the specific venue mentioned in the claim. So only Row 2 is relevant here.\n\nTherefore, since there's a game on December 4 at North Shore Events Centre, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the game at the north shore event centre be play on december 4,\" we check each row of the table for the date and venue mentioned. Only Row 2 matches both criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says: \"on december 4 , a game be play at the distinctive home dome event center.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The date mentioned is December 4th. Looking at the table, each row has a date. So I need to find which rows have December 4 as their date.\n\nNext, the home team in that game. The claim doesn't specify the home or away team, but it's about a game on December 4. So I should look for a row with date \"4 december\" and check the venue mentioned there.\n\nThe venue given in the claim is \"distinctive home dome event center.\" But looking at the table, each row lists the venue under \"venue\". For December 4, checking row 2: venue is \"north shore events centre\". That doesn't match. So if the claim says it's at \"distinctive home dome\", that's not what's in the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me check each row again. Row 1 is Dec 3, venue Win Entertainment Centre. Row 2 is Dec 4, venue North Shore Events Centre. So no match for the claimed venue.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there was no game on December 4 at the specified venue.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for a game on December 4 at \"distinctive home dome event center.\" In row 2 of the table, the date is December 4 with the venue as \"north shore events centre,\" which doesn't match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim: \"the match played on December 4 recorded a score of 102 - 94 with North Shore Event Centre as its venue.\"\n\nI'll start by looking for the row corresponding to December 4 in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Dec 3\nRow 2: Dec 4\nRow 3: Dec 5\nRow 4: Dec 6\nRow 5: Dec 6 (duplicate date, but different teams)\nRow 6: Dec 6 (another game on same day)\nRow 7: Dec 7\n\nSo Row 2 is the one for December 4.\n\nNow, checking the details in Row 2:\n- Home team: New Zealand Breakers\n- Score: 88 - 104\n- Away team: Townsville Crocodiles\n- Venue: North Shore Events Centre\n- Box score and report are just \"-\"\n\nWait a minute, the claim says the score was 102 - 94. But in Row 2, the score is listed as 88 - 104. That doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check if I read Row 2 correctly. The home team is New Zealand Breakers with a score of 88-104 against Townsville Crocodiles at North Shore Events Centre. So the claim's score (102-94) and opponent are different from what's in the table.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other rows for December 4 again. No, Row 2 is the only one on Dec 4. The score there doesn't match 102-94. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect based on the given data.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes tables might list away scores first or home last. Let me check if the score is written as away - home or home - away. In Row 2, it's listed as \"88 - 104\", and since the home team is New Zealand Breakers, that would mean their score is 88, and the away team Townsville scored 104. So the match was 88-104.\n\nThe claim says 102-94, which doesn't align with this. Also, the venue in Row 2 is correct as North Shore Events Centre, so that part matches.\n\nBut the score discrepancy means the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
