    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Scott Hoch is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that Scott Hoch has a score of 66 and is from the United States. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row seems to represent a player's performance in some event, with columns like place, player name, country, score, and to par. The rows are numbered starting from 0 up to 11, but sometimes there are multiple players sharing the same place, indicated by \"t1\" for tied at first, \"t4\", etc.\n\nI'll focus on Scott Hoch's row. Looking through the table:\n\nRow 0: place t1, player scott hoch, country united states, score 66, to par -4.\nRow 1: place t1, player craig parry...\nAnd so on.\n\nSo Scott Hoch is in Row 0. His score is listed as 66, which matches the claim's first part about having a score of 66. Now, his country is the United States, which aligns with the second part of the claim that he's from the United States.\n\nI don't see any information that contradicts this. His place is t1, but that doesn't affect whether the claim is true or false since it's about the score and country. The claim didn't mention anything about his placement, only the score and country.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied by Scott Hoch in Row 0 of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim made about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"lee janzen and craig stadler both be t4 place player and have the same score of 67.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided to find where Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler are listed. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 1: place t1, player Scott Hoch. Not them.\nRow 2: t1, Craig Parry. Nope.\nRow 3: t1, Joey Sindelar. Still not.\nRow 4: t4, Lee Janzen. Okay, found him at row index 3 (since it's zero-based or one-based? Wait, the instruction doesn't specify, but in programming, indexes usually start at 0, so maybe 4th row is row_index 3). His score is 67, to par -3.\n\nThen, looking for Craig Stadler. Continuing through the rows:\nRow 5: t4, Craig Stadler. So that's row index 4 (if zero-based) or 5 if one-based. His score is also 67.\n\nSo both Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler are in t4 place with 67 scores. That seems to check out. \n\nI need to make sure that the claim says both are t4, same score, which they are. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are found by checking the 'place' and 'score' columns for Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false by checking the table provided. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"Scott Hoch with a score under 66 be not from the United State.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it's trying to say that Scott Hoch, who scored under 66, is not from the United States? Or perhaps it's phrased differently. Let me parse it again.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has place, player, country, score, and to par. The first four rows (rows 1-3) are tied at t1 with a score of 66. Scott Hoch is in row 1, country: United States, score: 66. So his score is exactly 66, not under 66. Wait, the claim says \"score under 66.\" Since 66 isn't under 66, maybe the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a typo or misunderstanding. Let me check each player with a score under 66. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Scott Hoch, US, 66\n- Rows 4-5: Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler, both have 67.\n- Rows 6-11: Fred Couples, Raymond Floyd, Blaine McCallister, Rocco Mediate, Corey Pavin, Mike Smith, Robert Wrenn\u2014all have 68.\n\nSo none of the players in the table have a score under 66. The lowest is 66, and all higher-ranked players (t1) have 66. So if the claim is about Scott Hoch having a score under 66, that's false because he scored 66.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"be not from the United State.\" Maybe it's implying that someone with a score under 66 isn't from the US. But in the table, all players are from the US except maybe if I missed something. Let me check each row:\n\n- Scott Hoch: US\n- Craig Parry: Australia\n- Joey Sindelar: US\n- Lee Janzen: US\n- Craig Stadler: US\n- Fred Couples: US\n- Raymond Floyd: US\n- Blaine McCallister: US\n- Rocco Mediate: US\n- Corey Pavin: US\n- Mike Smith: US\n- Robert Wrenn: US\n\nSo only Craig Parry is from Australia. His score is 66 as well, same as others. But the claim specifically mentions Scott Hoch. So if someone has a score under 66, they are not from the US\u2014 but in this table, no one has a score under 66. So the statement's premise is wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"be not from the United State.\" If it's saying that Scott Hoch isn't from the US, but he is, so the claim would be false regardless. But the user's instruction says to check the claim against the table, and the relevant cells are based on whether each condition in the claim is met.\n\nThe claim has two parts: \"Scott Hoch\" with a score under 66 and not from the US. Since Scott Hoch's score is 66, which isn't under 66, the first part of the condition fails, making the entire statement false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no player with a score under 66 in the table, so the claim's premise isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Scott Hoch, who scored under 66, is not from the United States. However, Scott Hoch's score is exactly 66, not under 66. Additionally, all players in the table are from the US except Craig Parry, but the claim specifically refers to Scott Hoch. Since there are no players with scores under 66, the claim's premise is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"lee janzen and craig stadler both be under t4 place player with score less than 66.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let me break it down.\n\n1. **Players in question**: Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler.\n2. **Position requirement**: Both should be \"under t4 place.\" Wait, the table uses \"t4\" for tied position. So, being under t4 would mean their actual rank is better (lower number) than t4? Or does it mean they are part of the tie at t4? I think in golf terms, \"t4\" means they are tied for 4th place, so their individual ranking could be 4 or higher. So if someone is under t4, that might mean their actual position is lower than 4th, which would mean they are ranked better (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd). But I'm not entirely sure about the terminology here.\n\nWait, looking at the table, for row 4 and 5, place is t4. So if someone is under t4, that could mean their position is lower than 4th, but in reality, tied positions can complicate this. Maybe \"under t4\" means they are not tied for 4th, so their actual rank is better than 4th.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact phrasing here. So perhaps the claim is saying that both Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler have a position better (lower number) than t4, meaning their ranks are under t4, i.e., they are ranked higher (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd).\n\nNext, the score part: \"score less than 66.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- Rows 4 and 5 have a score of 67 for Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler.\n- The claim says their scores should be less than 66. So 67 is not less than 66, which would mean the claim is false because both players scored 67.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"under t4 place.\" Maybe it's about being in a tie for t4 or lower. But regardless of that, their score is 67, which is higher than 66, so they don't meet the second condition.\n\nSo putting it together: Both Lee Janzen and Craig Stadler are tied for 4th place (t4) but have scores of 67, which are not less than 66. Therefore, the claim that both are under t4 with score less than 66 is false because their scores are higher.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
