    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the Texas Longhorns women's basketball table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the texas longhorns woman 's basketball table show game vs different team show score on different location.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like they're talking about a table that shows games against different teams, with scores and locations. So the table should display various opponents, their respective records against Texas, scores from different venues, neutral sites, last meetings, etc.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with multiple rows each representing a specific game or matchup. Each row includes details like the opponent (e.g., Baylor, Colorado), overall record, Austin record, opponent's venue, neutral site, last 5 and 10 meetings, and current streak.\n\nThe claim mentions \"different team,\" which implies that the table should list games against multiple teams, not just one. In the table, there are 11 rows, each representing a different opponent (Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas A&M, Texas Tech). So it does show games against different teams.\n\nThe claim also mentions \"show score on different location.\" From the table columns, I can see several relevant cells. For each game, there's the opponent's venue and neutral site. The opponent's venue (e.g., Baylor's home) and neutral sites (like Austin, which is Texas' home) are mentioned in each row.\n\nSo, for example, looking at Row 1: Baylor vs. Texas, the opponent's venue is Baylor with a record of 22-13, while the neutral site (Austin) has a score of 27-5. This shows different locations (Baylor's home and Austin as a neutral site), each with their respective scores.\n\nEach row in the table provides both the opponent's venue and the neutral site where Texas played against them, along with the corresponding win-loss records for those locations. Therefore, the table does show game vs different teams and includes scores on different locations (venues).\n\nI also need to check if all parts of the claim are supported. The table indeed lists multiple opponents (different teams) and their respective venues and neutral sites, which are used to calculate the scores. Each relevant cell in the table contributes to verifying that aspect of the claim.\n\nSo, considering all this, the claim seems to be fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with baylor, iowa state, nebraska and oklahoma state.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part means. The claim mentions a \"current streak of l 2,\" which from the table seems to refer to the team's recent performance, indicated by 'l' for loss and the number 2, meaning two losses in a row. It then specifies that this streak should be the score with four teams: Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different opponent of Texas (UT). Each row has several columns like Overall Record, Austin (which I assume is Austin, Texas), Opponent's Venue, Neutral Site, Last 5 Meetings, Last 10 Meetings, and Current Streak. The current streak is denoted by a letter and number, such as 'l 2' for two losses.\n\nSo, my task is to check each of these four teams (Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, Oklahoma State) in the table and see if their current streak is 'l 2'. If all four have this streak, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nStarting with Baylor: I'll look for the row where Opponent is Baylor. From the table, that's Row 1. The Current Streak column here says 'l 2', so that checks out.\n\nNext, Iowa State: Looking for the row where Opponent is Iowa State. That's Row 3. The current streak there is also 'l 2'. So that's another check.\n\nMoving on to Nebraska: The opponent Nebraska is in Row 7. Checking the Current Streak column, it says 'l 2' as well. So three teams down, one more to go.\n\nLastly, Oklahoma State: The row for Oklahoma State is Row 9. The current streak here is 'l 2'. That means all four teams have a streak of two losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the current streak of l 2 applies to Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with data about Texas vs various opponents, and a claim to verify. The claim is: \"in the last 10 meetings, the score was tied 5-5 four times and two times at UT 8-2.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to find where in the table the information related to \"last 10 meetings\" is located. Looking at the columns, each row has details about different opponents, including \"last 10 meetings\". So for each opponent, there's a \"last 10 meetings\" value.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific scores: one tied game (5-5) that happened four times, and another score where Texas won with 8-2 that occurred twice. I need to check if the table supports this.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Baylor. Last 10 meetings are tied at 5-5. So that's one tied game.\nRow 3: Iowa State. Last 10 meetings tied again, so that's two tied games now.\nRow 4: Kansas. Last 10 meetings show UT 8-2 (Texas won). That's the first instance of the 8-2 score.\nRow 5: Kansas State. No mention of a tied game here; last 10 are Ksu 6-4. So not relevant for ties or 8-2.\nRow 7: Nebraska. Last 10 meetings UT 8-2, that's the second instance of the 8-2 score.\nRows 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 mention last 10 meetings as UT wins with varying scores, but not tied or 8-2 specifically.\n\nWait, so in Row 1: tied once, Row3: tied again, making it two tied games. The claim says four times, which isn't matching here because only two rows have tied in the last 10. So that part doesn't add up.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Baylor - tied (5-5)\nRow3: Iowa State - tied\nThat's two tied games, not four. So the claim says four times tied, but the table shows only two. That's a discrepancy.\n\nOn the other hand, for the 8-2 wins at UT, rows 4 and 7 each show UT 8-2, so that's two times as well. The claim says two times, which matches here.\n\nSo overall, the tied games are fewer than claimed (two instead of four), but the 8-2s match. Since the claim is about both parts needing to be true, having one part wrong makes the entire statement false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's assertion that there were four tied games in the last 10 meetings doesn't align with the table data, which only shows two tied games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"At opponent's venue, the score was a tie on 2 games, tie 4-4 against Kansas and tie 7-7 against Oklahoma.\" So, we're looking for two specific games where Texas played away (opponent's venue) and the game ended in a tie with specific scores.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent. I need to check rows where the opponent is either Kansas or Oklahoma because that's when the ties happened according to the claim.\n\nStarting with Texas vs. Kansas: In Row 4 of the table, the opponent's venue is tied at 4-4. The overall record and other stats are for Texas, but the key here is the tie in the opponent's venue with a score of 4-4. So that matches one part of the claim.\n\nNext, Texas vs. Oklahoma: In Row 8, the opponent's venue is also tied at 7-7. That seems to match the second part of the claim where there was a 7-7 tie against Oklahoma.\n\nI should check if both these conditions are met in the table.

So this part checks out.\n- It also mentions that this game is played at austin, which aligns with the 'austin' column in Row 3.\n\nNext, Texas vs. Kansas State (Row 5):\n- The claim again states \"ut , 6 - 2.\" Looking at Row 5, the 'austin' column shows UT's record as 6 - 2 as well.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Texas Longhorns Women's Basketball table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first understand what the claim is stating.\n\nThe claim says: \"the texas longhorns woman 's basketball table show game vs only 1 team show score on different location.\" So, breaking this down, it seems to suggest that in their table of games, Texas plays against a single opponent, and each game is listed at a different location. \n\nLooking at the table provided, I see rows for each opponent: Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas A&M, and Texas Tech. Each row represents a different opponent. So, this means that Texas plays against multiple teams, not just one.\n\nNow, checking the claim, it says \"game vs only 1 team.\" Since there are multiple entries for Texas playing against various opponents, the first part of the claim is incorrect because Texas doesn't play only one team. \n\nThe second part of the claim mentions \"show score on different location,\" which might refer to where each game was played. The table has columns like 'opponent's venue' and 'neutral site.' For example, against Baylor, it's listed as opponent's venue: UT with a record of 22-13. Against Colorado, it's the opponent's venue: UT with 6-2. So, some games are at different venues (like Baylor at Austin) and others might be neutral sites.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"different location,\" but in reality, many games are at the same location or different ones depending on the opponent. The key is whether each game's location is different from each other. However, since Texas plays multiple teams, the idea that they only play one team is incorrect, making the entire claim false.\n\nLooking through the table, all 11 rows represent different opponents, so the claim is definitely wrong because it's stating Texas plays only one team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Texas Longhorns Women's Basketball plays against multiple teams, not just one.

The claim is: \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with only baylor\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about a current streak of losing 2 games, specifically against Baylor. So I need to check each row where Texas plays Baylor and see if their current streak is \"l 2\" as per the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent that Texas plays.

Let me parse it again.\n\nI think the claim is saying that in the first 10 meetings, there have been four games where both teams scored 5-5 (tied) and two games where Texas won 8-2. So, for each opponent, we need to check their \"last 10 meetings\" column.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"in the first 10 meeting,\" which might be a typo and should be \"meetings.\" It's about the first 10 meetings, but looking at the table, it's unclear how that ties in because each row is for a specific opponent. So perhaps the claim is referring to the last 10 meetings between Texas and each opponent.\n\nWait, no, the term used is \"first 10 meeting,\" which might not be clearly defined. But in the table, there's \"last 5 meetings\" and \"last 10 meetings.\" So perhaps the claim refers to the \"last 10 meetings\" for each opponent.\n\nThe claim says that in these first 10 meetings (probably meaning the last 10), Texas has tied four times at 5-5 and won two times at 8-2. Wait, but how can a team have multiple scores? It seems like the claim is saying that over the last 10 meetings, there are four ties at 5-5 and two wins where Texas scored 8-2.\n\nBut looking at the table data:\n\nRow 1: last 10 meetings: tied 5-5\nRow 2: last 10 meetings: UT 8-2\nRow 3: last 10 meetings: tied 5-5\nRow 4: last 10 meetings: UT 7-3\nRow 5: last 10 meetings: KSU 6-4\nRow 6: last 10 meetings: UT 9-1\nRow 7: last 10 meetings: UT 8-2\nRow 8: last 10 meetings: tied 5-5\nRow 9: last 10 meetings: UT 7-3\nRow 10: last 10 meetings: tied 5-5\nRow 11: last 10 meetings: TTU 6-4\n\nWait, so each row has a different opponent. For example, Row 1 is Texas vs Baylor, so the \"last 10 meetings\" is tied 5-5.\n\nRow 2 is Texas vs Colorado, and their last 10 meetings are UT (Texas) 8-2.\n\nSimilarly, checking each row's last 10 meetings:\n\n- Row 1: tied 5-5\n- Row 2: UT 8-2\n- Row 3: tied 5-5\n- Row 4: UT 7-3\n- Row 5: KSU (opponent) 6-4\n- Row 6: UT 9-1\n- Row 7: UT 8-2\n- Row 8: tied 5-5\n- Row 9: UT 7-3\n- Row 10: tied 5-5\n- Row 11: TTU (opponent) 6-4\n\nSo, the \"last 10 meetings\" results for each opponent:\n\nLooking at how many times Texas (UT) has a tie and a win as per the claim.\n\nThe claim says that in these first 10 meetings (probably last 10), there are four ties at 5-5 and two wins where Texas scored 8-2. But from the table, let's count:\n\nTied games: Rows 1,3,8,10 \u2192 four times\nUT won with 8-2: Looking through the data, only Rows 2 and 7 have UT as the winner with 8-2.\n\nWait, Row 2: last 10 meetings: UT 8-2 (so one win)\nRow 7: last 10 meetings: UT 8-2 (another win)\nSo that's two wins where Texas scored 8-2.\n\nBut what about the rest? The claim says four times tied and two times UT won 8-2, which matches exactly with the data in Rows 1,3,8,10 for ties and Rows 2,7 for 8-2 wins.\n\nHowever, there are more than 10 opponents listed. Wait, no\u2014each row is a different opponent, so each represents their own \"first 10 meetings.\" But in reality, it's about the last 10 meetings between Texas and that specific opponent.\n\nWait, but the way the table is structured, each row corresponds to a particular opponent, and each cell gives the result of the last 10 games against that opponent. So the claim is saying across all opponents, in their first 10 meetings (last 10), there are four ties at 5-5 and two wins where Texas scored 8-2.\n\nWait no, perhaps the claim refers to each opponent's last 10 meetings. But actually, it's unclear because the table doesn't specify a specific set of first 10 meetings across all opponents. Each row is for one opponent only.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim might be referring to each individual opponent's last 10 meetings and counting how many times Texas tied at 5-5 and won by 8-2.\n\nBut in that case, the claim would have to specify per opponent, which it doesn't. It just says \"in the first 10 meeting,\" which is a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to all opponents collectively over their last 10 meetings. But that's not how the table works; each row is for one opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in interpreting \"first 10 meeting\" as the last 10. So maybe they meant the first 10 meetings against each opponent.\n\nBut looking at the data, each cell gives the result of the last 10 meetings. So if we consider that, then:\n\n- For Baylor (Row1): tied 5-5\n- Colorado (Row2): UT 8-2\n- Texas State (Row3): tied 5-5\n- TCU (Row4): UT 7-3\n- West Virginia (Row5): KSU vs UT, so that's not relevant as it's a different opponent.\nWait no, Row5 is Texas vs West Virginia? Wait no, the opponents are Baylor, Colorado, Texas State, TCU, West Virginia, etc. Each row is for a specific opponent.\n\nSo each row has their own last 10 meetings result against Texas.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that in these first 10 meetings (probably meaning the last 10), there have been four ties at 5-5 and two wins where Texas scored 8-2.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nTied games: Rows1,3,8,10 \u2192 four times\nUT won with 8-2: Rows2 and7 \u2192 two times\n\nSo that matches exactly. So the claim is correct based on these cells.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those where \"last 10 meetings\" show a tie or Texas win.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"At opponent's venue, the score was a tie in only 1 game, 4-4 against Kansas.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asking. It mentions two main points:\n1. At opponent's venue (i.e., when Texas plays at their opponent's home), there is a tie game.\n2. This tie occurred only in one game where the score was 4-4 against Kansas.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent that Texas has played against. Each row includes several pieces of information: overall record, Austin (which I assume refers to Texas's home games), the opponent's venue stats, neutral site stats, last five and ten meetings, and the current streak.\n\nI need to find any row where \"opponent's venue\" is mentioned with a tie game, specifically a 4-4 score against Kansas. \n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Baylor. Under opponent's venue, it says \"22 - 13\". No mention of a tie, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is Colorado. The opponent's venue has \"6 - 2\", again no tie.\n\nRow 3: Opponent is Iowa State. Their venue stats are \"5 - 2\", no tie.\n\nRow 4: Opponent is Kansas. Under opponent's venue, it says \"tied, 4 - 4\". Wait, that matches the score mentioned in the claim. So this row is relevant because it shows a tie game at the opponent's (Kansas) venue with a 4-4 score. \n\nRow 5: Opponent is Kansas State. Venue stats are \"4 - 3\", no tie.\n\nRows 6 to 11 don't mention any ties in their opponent's venues, so they aren't relevant.\n\nSo, only Row 4 has the condition where at the opponent's venue (Kansas), there was a tied game with a 4-4 score. The claim says this happened only once against Kansas, which seems to be correct based on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about various games involving the Texas team, and the claim is specific: \"ut , 58 - 15 be the result on the game at austin , texas v iowa state and kansa state.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that in a game played in Austin between Texas and Iowa State (and Kansas State), the result was a win for UT with a score of 58-15. Wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe claim is: \"ut , 58 - 15 be the result on the game at austin , texas v iowa state and kansa state.\" So, it's saying that in Austin, in games against Iowa State and Kansas State, Texas had records of 58-15. But looking at the table, each row is for a specific opponent. So I need to check if there are entries for both Iowa State and Kansas State where Texas has a 58-15 record.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: texas vs: iowa state\nRow 1: texas vs: colorado\nRow 2: texas vs: iowa state\nWait, no. Let me check each row properly.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure, each row starts with \"texas vs: opponent\". So I need to go through each relevant row and see if any of them have a result matching 58-15 in Austin.\n\nLooking for rows where Texas plays Iowa State:\n\nRow 2 is \"texas vs: iowa state\", but wait, no. Wait, let me recount the table. Each row starts with \"texas vs: opponent\". So the first row (Row 1) is texas vs baylor, second (Row 2) is colorado, third (Row3) is iowa state, fourth (Row4) is kansas, fifth (Row5) is kansas state, sixth (Row6) is missouri, seventh (Row7) nebraska, eighth (Row8) oklahoma, ninth (Row9) oklahoma state, tenth (Row10) texas a&m, eleventh (Row11) texas tech.\n\nSo, the rows where Texas plays Iowa State are Row3 and maybe others? Wait, no. Looking again:\n\nRow1: Baylor\nRow2: Colorado\nRow3: Iowa State\nRow4: Kansas\nRow5: Kansas State\nRow6: Missouri\nRow7: Nebraska\nRow8: Oklahoma\nRow9: Oklahoma State\nRow10: Texas A&M\nRow11: Texas Tech\n\nSo, the only row where Texas plays Iowa State is Row3. Let me check Row3.\n\nIn Row3, it's \"texas vs: iowa state\". The overall record for this game is listed as \"isu , 10 - 9\", which is a loss for Texas. So that doesn't match 58-15.\n\nThen, the claim mentions both Iowa State and Kansas State, so I also need to check for Kansas State.\n\nLooking for Row5: texas vs: kansas state. The overall record there is \"ut , 10 - 8\". That's a win but not 58-15.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"texas v iowa state and kansa state.\" Maybe it's two separate games? Or perhaps it's referring to both being in Austin with the same result?\n\nLooking again at the table:\n\nIn Row3 (Iowa State), Texas has an overall record of 10-9, which is a loss. So that doesn't match 58-15.\n\nIn Row5 (Kansas State), Texas has a 10-8 record, so also not matching.\n\nWait, but in Row10: texas vs: texas a&m, the overall result is \"t , 58 - 15\". Oh! That's a row where Texas plays Texas A&M with a score of 58-15. But the claim mentions Iowa State and Kansas State, not Texas A&M.\n\nSo that doesn't match. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because it refers to games against Iowa State and Kansas State, but in reality, only Texas A&M has that record. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check if any row for Iowa State or Kansas State shows a 58-15 result.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNo other rows have a 58-15 result except Row10, which is against Texas A&M. So the claim is incorrect because it refers to games against Iowa State and Kansas State where Texas has 58-15 wins, but according to the table, those specific opponents don't have that record.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in Austin, Texas had a 58-15 record against both Iowa State and Kansas State. However, checking the relevant rows:\n\n- **Iowa State (Row3)**: Texas lost with a score of 10-9.\n- **Kansas State (Row5)**: Texas won with a score of 10-8.\n\nNeither matches the claimed 58-15 result. Additionally, the 58-15 win is against Texas A&M in Row10, not the specified opponents.\n\n**Answer:** \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n1. Row3 - \"texas vs: iowa state\" (overall_result)\n2. Row5 - \"texas vs: kansas state\" (overall_result)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall_result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall_result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
