Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Hani said scored 3 goal total and Sabry Raheel score 1 goal total.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for Hani Said in the table. Scanning through the rows, I find Row 6: name: shikabala. Wait, no, that's Shikabala. Continuing down, Row 5 is Hani said with Egyptian Premier League:3, Egypt Cup:0, CAF Champions League:0, total:3. So Hani has a total of 3 goals.\n\nNext, Sabry Raheel should be in the table as well. Scanning through, I see Row 13: name: sabry raheel. Looking at his stats, Egyptian Premier League:1, Egypt Cup:0, CAF Champions League:0, total:1. So Sabry has a total of 1 goal.\n\nThe claim mentions both Hani scoring 3 goals and Sabry scoring 1. The table supports both statements, so the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each individual mentioned:\n\n- **Hani Said**: In Row 5, his total is 3 goals.\n- **Sabry Raheel**: In Row 13, his total is 1 goal.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in more than 1 event.\" \n\nFirst, I'll analyze what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only two players who have scored in more than one event. So I need to check how many events each of them participated in and if they scored in those.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their name and stats across different competitions: Egyptian Premier League (EPL), Egypt Cup, CAF Champions League, and their total goals.\n\nStarting with Gamal Hamza. His row is Row 7. In his EPL column, he has 1 goal, Egypt Cup 0, CAF Champions League 2, totaling 3 goals. So his EPL has 1, which I think refers to the number of matches he scored in. But wait, actually, each of these numbers (like 6 for Sherif Ashraf) is likely the number of goals, not matches. Wait, no\u2014the term \"egyptian premier league: 6\" probably means he scored 6 goals in that league. So each number is goals, not matches.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"score in more than 1 event.\" I need to clarify if \"event\" refers to a competition or the number of goals. Looking at the context, each column (EPL, Egypt Cup, CAF) represents a different competition, so an \"event\" here is probably a competition. So scoring in more than one event means participating and scoring in multiple competitions.\n\nSo, for Gamal Hamza: he has scored 1 goal in EPL, 0 in Egypt Cup, and 2 in CAF Champions League. That's three different competitions where he scored. But wait, the numbers are goals per competition, not matches. So does \"score in more than 1 event\" mean scoring in multiple events (competitions), regardless of how many goals each time? Or does it mean scoring more than one goal across all events?\n\nWait, let's look at the table again. Each row has four columns: name, EPL, Egypt Cup, CAF Champions League, and total. The numbers are goals scored in each competition.\n\nSo if a player scored in multiple competitions (events), like EPL, Egypt Cup, and CAF, that would mean they participated in more than one event and scored in them.\n\nTherefore, the claim is about players who have participated in more than one event (competition) and scored in those events. So we need to check which players have goals in two or more of these competitions.\n\nLet's go through each relevant player:\n\n1. Gamal Hamza: He has 1 in EPL, 0 in Egypt Cup, 2 in CAF. So he participated in three different competitions and scored in at least one per competition (since all are non-zero). But does he have goals in more than one event? Since he's in EPL, Egypt Cup, and CAF, that's three events. He has goals in each of them. So yes, he scored in more than one event.\n\n2. Junior Agogo: His row is Row 3. EPL: 3, Egypt Cup: 0, CAF: 1, total:4. So he participated in two competitions (EPL and CAF) where he scored goals. So he has scored in two events.\n\nNow, the claim says \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in more than 1 event.\" So we need to check if any other players have scored in more than one event.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: EPL:6, others 0. So only EPL.\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: EPL:5, others 0. Only EPL.\n- Junior Agogo: as above, two events.\n- Abdel Halim Ali: EPL:3, others 0. Only EPL.\n- Hani Said: same as above.\n- Shikabala: same.\n- Gamal Hamza: three events.\n- Ahmed Magdy: EPL:2, Egypt Cup:0, CAF:0. So only EPL.\n- Mostafa Gaafar: same as above.\n- Alaa Kamal: EPL:1, others 0. Only EPL.\n- Mahmoud Samir: same.\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: same.\n- Sabry Raheel: same.\n- Wisam El Abdy: same.\n- Own Goals: EPL:1, others 0. Only EPL.\n- Totals: EPL:34, Egypt Cup:0, CAF:4. So Total row.\n\nWait, the \"totals\" are probably aggregating all players' goals across competitions, but in this context, it's a separate row, so it's not a player but the sum.\n\nSo checking each player except the totals:\n\nOnly Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo have scored in more than one event (competition). Let me double-check:\n\n- Any other player: For example, amr el-safty has 0 in EPL, 1 in CAF. So he participated in two competitions but only scored in CAF. Wait no, his row is Row15: name: amr el - safty, egyptian premier league: 0, egypt cup: 0, caf champions league: 1. So he participated in CAF and others have 0. So he has goals only in CAF.\n\nSo he scored in one event (CAF), not more than one.\n\nWait, but the claim is about scoring in more than one event. So participants who have scored in two or more competitions.\n\nSo:\n\n- Gamal Hamza: EPL, Egypt Cup, and CAF. He has goals in all three. So yes.\n- Junior Agogo: EPL and CAF. He has goals in both, so yes.\n- Any others? Let's see.\n\nLooking for players who have non-zero in at least two competitions:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: only EPL\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: same\n- Abdel Halim Ali: same\n- Hani Said: same\n- Shikabala: same\n- Ahmed Magdy: same\n- Mostafa Gaafar: same\n- Alaa Kamal: same\n- Mahmoud Samir: same\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: same\n- Sabry Raheel: same\n- Wisam El Abdy: same\n- Own Goals: same\n\nAmr el-safty: only CAF\nTotal row.\n\nSo no, only Gamal and Junior have scored in more than one competition. Therefore, the claim is correct as per the data provided.\n\nWait, but let me check again for any other players who might have non-zero in two competitions.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: EPL:6, others 0 \u2192 only EPL\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: same.\n- Junior Agogo: EPL and CAF.\n- Abdel Halim Ali: same as above.\n- Hani Said: same.\n- Shikabala: same.\n- Gamal Hamza: all three competitions.\n- Ahmed Magdy: same as others.\n- Mostafa Gaafar: same.\n- Alaa Kamal: same.\n- Mahmoud Samir: same.\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: same.\n- Sabry Raheel: same.\n- Wisam El Abdy: same.\n- Own Goals: same.\n- Totals.\n\nNo, only Gamal and Junior have goals in two or more competitions. Therefore, the claim is accurate as per the given data.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided table, the statement that \"gamal hamza and junior agogo are the only players to score in more than one event\" holds true. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Gamal Hamza (Row 7):**\n   - Participated in three competitions: EPL, Egypt Cup, and CAF Champions League.\n   - Scored goals in each of these competitions.\n\n2. **Junior Agogo (Row 3):**\n   - Participated in two competitions: EPL and CAF Champions League.\n   - Scored goals in both competitions.\n\nOther players scored goals only in one competition or none, as detailed below:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: Only EPL\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: Only EPL\n- Abdel Halim Ali: Only EPL\n- Hani Said: Only EPL\n- Shikabala: Only EPL\n- Ahmed Magdy: Only EPL\n- Mostafa Gaafar: Only EPL\n- Alaa Kamal: Only EPL\n- Mahmoud Samir: Only EPL\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: Only EPL\n- Sabry Raheel: Only EPL\n- Wisam El Abdy: Only EPL\n- Own Goals: Only EPL\n\nTherefore, **Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are indeed the only players who scored in more than one event (competition)** based on the data provided.",

Let's start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the names in the table to find who \"shikabala\" and \"sabry raheel\" are. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 6: name: shikabala\n- Row 13: name: sabry raheel\n\nSo, I need to check their total goal counts.\n\nLooking at Row 6, under 'total', it says 3. For Row 13, sabry raheel's total is also 1.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the claim says shikabala has 2 more than sabry. If shikabala has 3 and sabry has 1, then the difference is 2, which would make the claim true. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up anything.\n\nAlso, looking at the columns, the 'total' column for each player is correct. Shikabala's total is indeed 3, and sabry raheel's total is 1. So subtracting those gives a difference of 2 goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the totals provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"shikabala score 2 more goal total than sabry raheel,\" I need to compare their total goals from the table.\n\n1. Locate shikabala's row (Row 6) and sabry raheel's row (Row 13).\n2. Check the 'total' column for each:\n   - Shikabala: 3 goals\n   - Sabry Raheel: 1 goal\n\nThe difference is indeed 2 goals (3 - 1 = 2).\n\n**Answer**: The claim is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant cells**:\n\n- shikabala's total: Row 6, 'total'\n- sabry raheel's total: Row 13, 'total'\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the name is \"gamal hamza.\" Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 7 is gamal hamza. Now, I need to check his performance in the CAF Champions League because the claim mentions scoring the most goals there.\n\nLooking at the columns under Row 7: egyptian premier league has 1, egypt cup has 0, and caf champions league has 2. So, in the CAF Champions League, gamal hamza scored 2 goals.\n\nNow, I need to verify if he scored the most goals in that competition. To do this, I should check other players' performance in the CAF Champions League as well. Let me look through all rows to see who else has a value under caf champions league.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- sherif ashraf: 0\n- mahmoud fathallah: 0\n- junior agogo: 1\n- abdel halim ali: 0\n- hani said: 0\n- shikabala: 0\n- gamal hamza: 2\n- ahmed magdy: 0\n- mostafa gaafar: 0\n- alaa kamal: 0\n- mahmoud samir: 0\n- ricardo alves fernandes: 0\n- sabry raheel: 0\n- wisam el abdy: 0\n- amr el - safty: 1\n- own goals: 0\n- totals: 4\n\nSo, looking at the caf champions league column, only gamal hamza has 2 and amr el-safty has 1. The highest score in CAF Champions League is 2 by gamal hamza.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"score the most goal,\" which implies that he had more goals than others. Since he scored 2, which is higher than any other player's 1 or 0, it seems true.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The total for CAF Champions League in the last row is 4. That might be the total number of goals scored by all players combined, not each individual's total. So gamal hamza's 2 is correct.\n\nSo yes, gamal hamza has the highest number of goals in CAF Champions League among all listed players.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim made is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"hani said scored 3 goal total and sabry raheel score 1 less goal than hani.\" So, there are two parts to this claim. I need to verify both parts using the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their name and statistics across different competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, CAF Champions League, and Total Goals. The columns seem to be consistent across all rows, so that's good.\n\nStarting with Hani Said. I need to find his total goals. Scanning through the table, Row 5 has the name \"hani said\" and under egyptian premier league: 3, egypt cup: 0, caf champions league: 0, total: 3. So that confirms the first part of the claim: Hani Said scored a total of 3 goals.\n\nNext, Sabry Raheel's performance. From the table, Row 13 is \"sabry raheel.\" His stats are egyptian premier league: 1, egypt cup: 0, caf champions league: 0, total: 1. So Sabry Raheel scored a total of 1 goal.\n\nNow, checking the second part of the claim: Sabry Raheel scores 1 less goal than Hani. Hani has 3 goals, and if Sabry has 1, then indeed, 3 - 1 = 2, but wait, that would mean Sabry scored 1 less. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the claim says \"sabry raheel score 1 less goal than hani.\" So Hani has 3, Sabry has 1. Is 1 equal to 3 - 2? Wait, no. 3 minus 1 is 2 less, not 1 less. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me think again. If Hani scored 3 goals and Sabry scored 1, then Sabry scored 2 less than Hani. But the claim says Sabry scored 1 less. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the numbers or there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total is not just the sum but something else. Wait, no, the 'total' column seems to be the sum of all goals across competitions. So Hani has 3 total goals, Sabry has 1. So Sabry scored 2 less than Hani, not 1 less.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again. For Row 5: hani said, egyptian premier league:3, egypt cup:0, caf champions league:0, total:3. Correct. For Row 13: sabry raheel, egyptian premier league:1, egypt cup:0, caf champions league:0, total:1. So indeed, Hani has 3, Sabry has 1.\n\nSo the difference is 2 goals less, not 1. That would make the second part of the claim incorrect because it says Sabry scored 1 less. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding 'scored 3 goal total.' Maybe it's per competition? But no, looking at the table, each player's total goals are summed up in the 'total' column. So Hani has 3 total, Sabry has 1, difference is 2, not 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Sabry scored 2 less goals than Hani, not 1 less.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that both Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo scored goals in at least one match (event). So I need to check their individual records from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with different competitions they participated in. The relevant columns for scoring are 'egyptian premier league' and 'caf champions league', since those are the events where players can score goals. \n\nLet me locate Gamal Hamza first. In the table, he's listed as Row 7. His egyptian premier league has a value of 1 and caf champions league has 2. Both numbers are greater than zero, so he scored in at least one event.\n\nNext, I'll look for Junior Agogo, which is Row 3. His egyptian premier league shows 3 goals, and caf champions league shows 1 goal. Again, both are above zero, meaning he scored in multiple events.\n\nNow, the claim specifies that these two are the only players who scored in at least one event. To confirm this, I need to check all other rows to ensure no other player has a score of 1 or more in either 'egyptian premier league' or 'caf champions league'.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Sherif Ashraf - egyptian premier league is 6 (scored), but he also has 0 in both cups. Total is 6.\nRow 2: Mahmoud Fathallah - 5 goals, so scored.\nRow 3: Junior Agogo - 3 and 1, so yes.\nRow 4: Abdel Halim Ali - 3 goals.\nRow 5: Hani Said - 3 goals.\nRow 6: Shikabala - 3 goals.\nRow 7: Gamal Hamza - 1 and 2, so yes.\nRow 8: Ahmed Magdy - 2 goals.\nRow 9: Mostafa Gaafar - 2 goals.\nRow 10: Alaa Kamal - 1 goal.\nRow 11: Mahmoud Samir - 1 goal.\nRow 12: Ricardo Alves Fernandes - 1 goal.\nRow 13: Sabry Raheel - 1 goal.\nRow 14: Wisam El Abdy - 1 goal.\nRow 15: Amr El-Safty - 0 in both, but he has 1 in total from own goals. Wait, the 'total' column might not be relevant unless specified. The claim is about scoring in events, so perhaps only looking at egyptian premier league and caf champions league.\n\nWait, Row 15: egyptian premier league is 0, caf champions league is 1. So he scored in at least one event as well. That's a problem because the claim says only Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the ones who scored.\n\nSimilarly, Row 16: Own Goals have 1 in egyptian premier league, so they scored there too.\n\nRow 17 is totals, probably not relevant for individual player stats.\n\nSo that means both Amr El-Safty and Own Goals also scored in at least one event. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely true because others also scored.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anyone else.\n\nRow 15: egyptian premier league is 0, caf champions league is 1. So he scored in caf champions league once.\nRow 16: own goals have egyptian premier league as 1. So they scored there.\n\nThat's two more players who scored in at least one event, making the claim false because it says only Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the ones who did so.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to check would be all rows where 'egyptian premier league' or 'caf champions league' have a value greater than zero, except for the two specified players.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Shikabala and Sabry Raheel in the table. Shikabala is listed as row 6, and Sabry Raheel is row 13. \n\nLooking at their stats:\n- Shikabala has 3 goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n- Sabry Raheel also has 1 goal in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nWait, according to the table, Shikabala's total is 3, and Sabry Raheel's total is 1. The claim says Shikabala scores 4 more than Sabry. But here, Shikabala only has 3 goals, which is 2 more than Sabry (since 3 - 1 = 2). That means the claim is wrong because it states 4 more instead of 2.\n\nI should check if there's any other relevant columns. The claim mentions 'goals,' so I need to look at the Egyptian Premier League column for both players. No other columns like Egypt Cup or Caf Champions League are mentioned, so only the Egyptian Premier League counts here.\n\nSo, the necessary cells to verify are Shikabala's goals and Sabry Raheel's goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Shikabala has 3 goals, while Sabry Raheel has 1, resulting in a difference of 2 goals, not 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"amr el - safty be only 1 of 2 players on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\" So the claim is saying that Amr El-Safty is one of two players who didn't score in the Egyptian Premier League. \n\nI should look into the table to find out how many players did not score in the Egyptian Premier League. Each row represents a player, and the \"egyptian premier league\" column shows their goals.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Sherif Ashraf - 6 goals.\nRow 2: Mahmoud Fathallah - 5 goals.\nRow 3: Junior Agogo - 3 goals. Wait, but in the total, it's 4. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or I'm misunderstanding. But regardless, he scored 3 in the league.\nRow 4: Abdel Halim Ali - 3 goals.\nRow 5: Hani Said - 3 goals.\nRow 6: Shikabala - 3 goals.\nRow 7: Gamal Hamza - 1 goal.\nRow 8: Ahmed Magdy - 2 goals.\nRow 9: Mostafa Gaafar - 2 goals.\nRow 10: Alaa Kamal - 1 goal.\nRow 11: Mahmoud Samir - 1 goal.\nRow 12: Ricardo Alves Fernandes - 1 goal.\nRow 13: Sabry Raheel - 1 goal.\nRow 14: Wisam El Abdy - 1 goal.\nRow 15: Amr El-Safty - 0 goals. So he didn't score at all.\nRow 16: Own Goals - 1 goal (probably a team goal, but in the context of players not scoring, this is tricky). The instruction says to consider own goals as contributing, so maybe they count towards the total, but it's unclear if they are scored by a player or not. However, since the claim is about players not scoring, perhaps own goals don't count.\nRow 17: Totals - 34 goals in the league.\n\nSo, let's list out the players with 0 goals in the league. From the data:\n\n- Amr El-Safty: 0\n- Own Goals: 1 (but unsure if this is a player or a team thing)\n\nWait, Row 16 is named \"own goals,\" which might be a category rather than a player. So perhaps that's not a player but a statistic. Therefore, only Amr El-Safty didn't score.\n\nBut the claim says he's one of two players who didn't score. So if there's only one such player (Amr) plus maybe own goals, but own goals aren't a player. So actually, only Amr is the player who didn't score in the league.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states he's one of two when in fact he's the sole player with 0 goals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because according to the table, Amr El-Safty is the only player listed with zero goals in the Egyptian Premier League. No other players have a score of zero in that column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "gamal hamza score the second highest goal in the caf champion league",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gamal hamza score the second highest goal in the caf champion league\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Gamal Hamza's information in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 7 is named Gamal Hamza. Looking at his stats: egyptian premier league has 1, egypt cup 0, caf champions league has 2, and total is 3.\n\nThe claim mentions that Gamal scored the second highest goal in the caf champions league. So, I need to check how many goals he scored there. From Row 7, he has 2 goals in the caf champions league. Now, I should look for other players who might have scored more than him to see if he's actually the second highest.\n\nLooking through the table, most of the players have either 0 or 1 goal in the caf champions league. For example:\n- Row 3: Junior Agogo has 1\n- Rows 4-6: Abdel Halim Ali, Hani Said, Shikabala each have 0\n- Row 7: Gamal Hamza has 2\n- Row 8 onwards mostly have 0 except Row 16 (own goals) with 1.\n\nWait, but I see that in Row 17, the totals for caf champions league are 4. So, if Gamal scored 2, then there must be two other players who scored more to make the total 4. But looking back at the table, only Gamal has 2 and maybe one more player? Let me check each row again.\n\nRow 7: Gamal - 2\nRow 15: Amr El-Safty - 1\nRow 16: Own goals - 1\nSo that adds up to 4. So the top scorers are Gamal with 2 and then two players with 1 each? Wait, no. If Gamal has 2, then the next highest would be 1, which is held by Amr and own goals.\n\nBut the claim says Gamal scored the second highest. If there's someone else who also scored 2 or more, that would change things. Looking at Row 3: Junior Agogo has 1, so not higher than 2. Rows 4-6 have 0. So, it seems Gamal is the only one with 2 goals in caf champions league.\n\nWait, no. The total for caf champions league is 4 (Row 17). So if Gamal scored 2, then there must be two more goals from other players. Let me see: Row 15 has Amr El-Safty with 1 and own goals also have 1. So that's a total of 4. Therefore, Gamal is the highest scorer with 2, and then the next highest are those with 1.\n\nWait, no. If the total is 4, and Gamal has 2, then there must be two more players who each scored 1, so the next highest would be 1. So, in that case, Gamal would have the highest (2) and the others have 1 or less. Therefore, he's the highest, not second.\n\nSo the claim says he is second. Since he actually has the highest, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Gamal Hamza scored 2 goals in the caf champions league, which is the highest, making him the top scorer rather than the second.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
