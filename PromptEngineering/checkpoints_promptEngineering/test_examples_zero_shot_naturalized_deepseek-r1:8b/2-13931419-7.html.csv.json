The claim says: \"the penguin and blue game on march 6 have an attendance of 9092.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions two teams: Penguins and Blues. They played on March 6th. I need to check if the attendance for that game is indeed 9092.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific date. Since the claim is about March 6, I'll focus on Row 2. The columns in the table are: date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, points.\n\nSo for Row 2:\n- Date: March 6\n- Visitor: Penguins\n- Home: Blues\n- Attendance: 9092\n\nThe attendance matches exactly what's in the claim, which is 9092. There's no discrepancy here; the number is correct. \n\nI should also check if any other rows might have similar data on March 6, but from the row indices, it's clear that Row 2 is the only one for March 6th.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is about a game between the blue and penguin teams on March 20th with a score of 2-4. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the date in the claim: March 20. I need to check which row corresponds to that date in the table. Scanning through the table rows:\n\nRow 1: March 2\nRow 2: March 6\nRow 3: March 7\nRow 4: March 9\nRow 5: March 13\nRow 6: March 16\nRow 7: March 17\nRow 8: March 20\n\nSo, Row 8 is the one for March 20. That means I need to focus on this row.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that the game was between \"blue\" and \"penguin.\" Looking at Row 8's data:\n\nVisitor: blues\nHome: penguins\n\nYes, so the teams are blues as visitors and penguins as home. The claim says it's a blue vs penguin game, which matches.\n\nNow, checking the score in Row 8: score is 2 - 4. So, that aligns perfectly with the claim of a 2-4 score.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other relevant columns to confirm the record and points, but since the claim doesn't mention them, maybe they aren't necessary unless needed for confirmation. However, in this case, the key pieces are date, teams, and score all matching.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if March 20 has a game between blues (visitor) and penguins (home) with a 2-4 score. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Date Check**: March 20 corresponds to Row 8.\n2. **Teams Involved**: Visitor is 'blues' and home is 'penguins'.\n3. **Score Verification**: The score in Row 8 is 2 - 4.\n\nAll conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the king and penguin game on march 20 have a score of 2 - 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts:\n1. **Game type**: King vs Penguin\n2. **Date**: March 20\n3. **Score**: 2-4\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details like date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, and points.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the game that matches all three criteria:\n- Visitor is King\n- Home team is Penguin\n- Date is March 20\n\nLet me scan the rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: March 2, visitor is Seals. Not relevant.\nRow 2: March 6, visitor Penguins vs Blues. Not Kings.\nRow 3: March 7, visitor Penguins vs North Stars. No.\nRow 4: March 9, visitor Kings vs Penguins.

No.\nRow 8: March 20, visitor Blues vs Penguins. Home team is Penguins, but visitor is Blues. Not Kings vs Penguins.\nRow 9: March 23, visitor Penguins vs North Stars. No.\nRow 10: March 24, visitor North Stars vs Penguins. No.\nRow 11: March 26, visitor Penguins vs Kings. Home is Kings, so reversed from the claim.\nRow 12: March 27, visitor Penguins vs Seals. No.\nRow 13: March 30, visitor Penguins vs Flyers. No.\nRow 14: March 31, visitor Flyers vs Penguins. No.\n\nHmm, none of the rows have a game where the visitor is King and home is Penguin on March 20. Wait, row 8 has date March 20 but visitor is Blues, not Kings. So no such game exists in the table that matches all criteria.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"}]}",
