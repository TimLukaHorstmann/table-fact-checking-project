    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the green bay packer be the opponent 2 time.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the Green Bay Packers were the opponents in two specific instances. So, my task is to check how many times the Green Bay Packers appear as the opponent in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like week number, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. My focus should be on the \"opponent\" column because that's where I need to see if the Packers are listed twice.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Oakland Raiders.\nRow 2: Chicago Bears.\nRow 3: Green Bay Packers.\nRow 4: Detroit Lions.\nRow 5: San Francisco 49ers.\nRow 6: Philadelphia Eagles.\nRow 7: Los Angeles Rams.\nRow 8: Cleveland Browns.\nRow 9: Detroit Lions again.\nRow 10: Atlanta Falcons.\nRow 11: Chicago Bears.\nRow 12: Cincinnati Bengals.\nRow 13: Green Bay Packers again.\nRow 14: New York Giants.\n\nFrom this, I can see that the Packers are opponents in row 3 and row 13. That's two times. So the claim says they were the opponent twice, which seems to be TRUE based on these two instances.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each time the Packers are the opponent, their row index and the column name \"opponent\" should be noted.\n\nSo in row 3 (which is index 2 if we start counting from 0), the opponent is Packers. Wait, wait\u2014no, rows are numbered starting from week 1 as row 1? Or does the first row correspond to row_index 0 or 1?\n\nWait, looking at the example JSON provided, it starts with row_index:0 for the first row. So in the table, the first row is row 1 but corresponds to index 0. Wait no, let me clarify.\n\nIn the table, each row is listed as Row 1, Row 2, etc., up to Row 14. The JSON example shows that relevant_cells are a list of objects with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\". So for the first row in the table, it's row 1, but in the JSON it would be row_index:0?\n\nWait no, looking at the user's example:\n\nThe example given is:\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo row 1 in the table would correspond to row_index:0? Or is it that each row in the table starts at index 0?\n\nWait, no. The user's instruction says that the table has rows from Row 1 to Row 14. Each row in the table corresponds to a specific week and game details.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 1: week:1\nRow 2: week:2\n...\nRow 14: week:14\n\nBut in the JSON, the relevant cells are given as {\"row_index\":0, ...}, which suggests that row_index starts at 0 for the first row in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The table is presented with Row 1 to Row 14, each corresponding to a specific week. The JSON example given by the user has relevant_cells as [{\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"Revenue\"}, ...], which implies that the first row of the table is index 0.\n\nTherefore, in the given table:\n\n- Row 1: row_index 0\n- Row 2: row_index 1\n- ...\n- Row 14: row_index 13\n\nSo, for each occurrence where the opponent is Green Bay Packers, I need to note their row_index and column_name \"opponent\".\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 3 (week:3): Opponent is Green Bay Packers. This would be row_index=2.\nRow 13 (week:13): Opponent is Green Bay Packers again. This is row_index=12.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"opponent\"}\n- {\"row_index\":12, \"column_name\":\"opponent\"}\n\nWait, but in the table, row 3 is week:3 and opponent: Green Bay Packers, which would be index 2. Row 13 is week:13, opponent: Green Bay Packers, so index 12.\n\nSo, these are the two instances where Packers are opponents. Therefore, the claim stating that they were the opponent twice is TRUE.\n\nHence, the answer should be \"TRUE\" with relevant_cells pointing to row_index=2 and row_index=12 for the \"opponent\" column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyzed each row of the table. The Green Bay Packers appear as the opponent in two instances: week 3 (row index 2) and week 13 (row index 12). This confirms that they were the opponent twice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim is: \"the earliest date be september 16 , 1973\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being claimed here. It seems like someone is saying that September 16, 1973, is the earliest date in the table. So my task is to check each row of the table and see if any other dates are earlier than September 16.\n\nLooking at the table, all the dates start from week 1 on September 16, 1973. Then week 2 is September 23, followed by weeks 3, 4, etc., through December. So the first date is indeed September 16, and there's no earlier date listed in any of the rows.\n\nI should check each row's date to confirm that none are before September 16. Let me go through them one by one:\n\nRow 1: September 16, 1973 \u2013 this is the earliest so far.\nRow 2: September 23, 1973\nRow 3: September 30, 1973\nRow 4: October 7, 1973\n...\nContinuing down, all subsequent rows have dates in September and then into October and November, December.\n\nNone of the other dates are before September 16. So the earliest date is indeed that first row's date. \n\nNow, considering the structure I need to provide, I should identify which cells are relevant. The claim refers to the \"earliest date\", so the specific cell in Row 1 (row_index: 0) under the \"date\" column.\n\nSo, the JSON response should mark it as TRUE because the earliest date is indeed September 16, and the relevant cell is row 0's date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data. The earliest date listed is September 16, 1973, in Row 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's about the team scoring the fewest points in games against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with specific details: opponent, result (points scored and allowed), venue, attendance, etc. The relevant columns here are \"opponent\" to find who the Vikings played against and \"result\" to get their scores.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the Los Angeles Rams as the opponents. So I need to look for rows where the opponent is the Los Angeles Rams. Let's scan through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Oakland Raiders\n- Week 2: Chicago Bears\n- Week 3: Green Bay Packers\n- Week 4: Detroit Lions\n- Week 5: San Francisco 49ers\n- Week 6: Philadelphia Eagles\n- Week 7: Los Angeles Rams\n- Week 8: Cleveland Browns\n- Week 9: Detroit Lions\n- Week 10: Atlanta Falcons\n- Week 11: Chicago Bears\n- Week 12: Cincinnati Bengals\n- Week 13: Green Bay Packers\n- Week 14: New York Giants\n\nOnly Week 7's opponent is the Los Angeles Rams. Now, looking at that week (Row 7), their result was \"w 10 - 9\". This means the Vikings scored 10 points and allowed 9 points.\n\nThe claim says \"the fewest point be score against...\" So I need to see if the Vikings scored fewer points than any other game against the Rams. But in this table, there's only one game against the Rams (Week 7). Since it's the only game, technically they have the fewest points scored against them because there are no others. However, that seems a bit odd because usually claims like this imply multiple games. Maybe the user meant to say \"lowest point differential\" or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there are more than one game against the Rams. In this table, only Week 7 is against them, so it's just one game. Therefore, in that single game, they scored 10 points, which is the fewest they've scored against the Rams (since there's no other data). So, the claim would be TRUE because they indeed scored fewer points than any other game against the Rams.\n\nBut to make sure, I should look at all games where the opponent is the Los Angeles Rams. Since only one game exists in this table, that's the only data point.\n</think>\n\nThe user provided a detailed table of football games and a claim about scoring against the Los Angeles Rams. By checking each row, only Week 7 involves the Los Angeles Rams, where the Vikings scored 10 points.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Opponent:** The claim refers to games against the Los Angeles Rams.\n2. **Locate Relevant Rows:** Only Row 7 (Week 7) matches this criterion.\n3. **Analyze Scores:** In Week 7, Vikings scored 10 points.\n4. **Determine \"Fewest\" Context:** Since only one game exists, they have the fewest points scored against the Rams.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

The dates are from September 16 to December 16, 1973. So, the last row is indeed December 16, 1973. \n\nNext, I need to compare the attendance numbers for that specific date with all other games.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that the smallest attendance in all the games listed is 44,818.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and identify the attendance numbers to find the minimum value. The table has 14 rows, each with a week number, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance.\n\nI'll list out all the attendances:\n\n1. Week 1: 44,818\n2. Week 2: 52,035\n3. Week 3: 48,176\n4. Week 4: 49,549\n5. Week 5: 56,438\n6. Week 6: 47,478\n7. Week 7: 47,787\n8. Week 8: 46,722\n9. Week 9: 47,911\n10. Week 10: 56,519\n11. Week 11: 46,430\n12. Week 12: 57,859\n13. Week 13: 53,830\n14. Week 14: 70,041\n\nNow, to find the smallest attendance, I'll compare these numbers. The numbers range from about 46k down to just over 40k and up to nearly 70k.\n\nLooking at each number:\n\n- The lowest seems to be around Week 8 with 46,722.\n- Then there's Week 11: 46,430 which is lower than some others but higher than Week 8.\n- Wait, no. Let me check again. Week 8 is 46,722 and Week 11 is 46,430. So 46,430 is actually lower than 46,722? No, wait, 46,430 is less than 46,722 because the first number is 46 thousand and the second is also 46 thousand but the next digits: 43 vs. 72. Wait no, that's incorrect because 430 is more than 722 in the thousands place. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, wait. 46,430 is less than 46,722 because after the thousands, 4 is less than 7. So yes, 46,430 is lower than 46,722. But let me check all numbers again.\n\nLooking at each attendance:\n\n1. 44,818 \u2013 this is clearly lower than others.\n2. 52,035\n3. 48,176\n4. 49,549\n5. 56,438\n6. 47,478\n7. 47,787\n8. 46,722\n9. 47,911\n10. 56,519\n11. 46,430 \u2013 this is lower than the previous low of Week 1.\n12. 57,859\n13. 53,830\n14. 70,041\n\nSo actually, the lowest attendance seems to be in Week 1: 44,818, followed by Week 11 at 46,430 and Week 8 at 46,722.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. I think I made a mistake earlier. The first row is Week 1 with 44,818, which is the smallest number in the list because all other attendances are higher than that. So if the claim says \"the smallest attendance be 44818,\" then that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Looking at the attendances:\n\n- Row 1: 44,818 (Week 1)\n- Rows 2 and onwards have higher attendances up to Week 14 with 70,041.\n\nSo yes, the smallest attendance is indeed 44,818 in Week 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because 44,818 is the lowest attendance across all games listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the first row's attendance of 44,818 is the smallest among all listed attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that November 4, 1973, is the earliest date in the table. So, my task is to find out if any game was played before November 4, 1973, and if none were, then November 4 would indeed be the earliest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games for that season. The \"date\" column lists when each game took place.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the claim \"the fewest point be score against the green bay packer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on a given table. The table has 14 rows with details about each game played by a team, presumably the Minnesota Vikings, in the 1973 season.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"the fewest point be score against the green bay packer.\" So, it seems like they're claiming that when playing against the Green Bay Packers, the Vikings scored the fewest points compared to their other games. Alternatively, maybe it's about the lowest score (most points allowed) in their matchups against the Packers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The \"result\" column shows the Vikings' score first, then the opponent's. For example, in Row 1, it's a win with 24-16, so the Vikings scored 24 points against the Raiders.\n\nI need to find all games where the opponent is the Green Bay Packers and extract their scores. Then compare those scores to other games or perhaps see if they have the lowest score overall.\n\nSo let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Raiders, so not Packers.\nRow 2: Bears, nope.\nRow3: Packers! Result is w 11 - 3, so Vikings scored 11 points. That's one data point.\nRow4: Lions, no.\nRow5: 49ers, no.\nRow6: Eagles, no.\nRow7: Rams, no.\nRow8: Browns, no.\nRow9: Lions again, no.\nRow10: Falcons, no.\nRow11: Bears, no.\nRow12: Bengals, no.\nRow13: Packers again. Result is w 31 - 7, so Vikings scored 31 points here.\nRow14: Giants, no.\n\nSo the Vikings played two games against the Packers in this season:\n\n- Week3 (Row3): Scored 11 points, lost? Wait, no, result is \"w 11 - 3\", so they won by 8 points. So 11 points for.\n- Week13 (Row13): Scored 31 points, won by 24 points.\n\nNow, the claim is about the fewest point score against Packers. If it's saying that they scored the fewest points in these games compared to other opponents or overall, we need to check if 11 is indeed the lowest among all their scores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's implying that against Packers, they had the fewest points scored by them, which would mean 11 is less than any other opponent. But I think it's more likely about the fewest points allowed, i.e., the Vikings gave up fewest points in these games.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"the fewest point be score against the green bay packer.\" So maybe they are claiming that in their games against Packers, they scored the fewest points compared to other games. But looking at their scores:\n\nIn Row3: 11 points\nRow13: 31 points\n\nSo their scores against Packers are 11 and 31. Now, are these the lowest scores among all their games? Let's check other opponents.\n\nFor example, against the Raiders (Row1): Vikings scored 24.\nAgainst Bears (Rows2 and 11): 22 and 31 respectively.\nAgainst Packers: 11 and 31.\nWait, in Row3, they scored 11. Is that lower than any other opponent? Let me see:\n\nOpponents and their game scores where Vikings won:\n\n- Raiders: 24\n- Bears: 22, 31\n- Packers:11,31\n- Lions:23,28\n- 49ers:17\n- Eagles:28\n- Rams:10\n- Browns:26\n- Falcons:20\n- Bengals:27\n- Giants:31\n\nWait, so the Vikings scored as low as 10 points in a game against the Rams (Row7: result w 10 -9). That's lower than the 11 they scored against Packers. So if the claim is about scoring the fewest points, then it's not true because they had a lower score against the Rams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that against Packers, they scored fewer points than any other opponent. But since they scored 10 against Rams and 11 against Packers, Packers are not the ones with the fewest. So the claim would be false.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me read it again: \"the fewest point be score against the green bay packer.\" Maybe it's phrased as \"the fewest points scored by them (Vikings) against Packers compared to others.\"\n\nBut if that's the case, Vikings scored 11 and 31 against Packers. Other opponents have lower scores like 10. So again, not true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the lowest score allowed, i.e., the fewest points conceded. Let's check that.\n\nIn their games:\n\nAgainst Raiders: Vikings scored 24, Raiders scored 16.\nSo Vikings gave up 16 points.\n\nBut looking at all results:\n\nWait, each row shows Vikings' result as \"w X - Y\" or \"l X - Y\". So for example, in Row3, w11-3 means Vikings scored 11, Packers scored 3. So Vikings won that game and allowed only 3 points.\n\nIn Row13: w31-7, so Vikings scored 31, Packers scored7. So they allowed only 7 points.\n\nLooking at all their games:\n\nRow1: Raiders, Vikings won 24-16 \u2192 allowed 16\nRow2: Bears, lost? Wait, no: result is w22-20? Wait Row2 says \"w22 -20\"? Wait the user wrote \"result\" as \"w 11 -3\" for Packers. Let me check:\n\nWait, the user's data:\n\nRow1: result: w24 -16\nRow2: result: w22 - something?\nWait in the initial problem statement, it just says \"result\". So maybe the structure is [result] like \"w X - Y\", where X is Vikings' points, Y is opponents'.\n\nSo for Row1: w24-16 \u2192 Vikings scored 24, Raiders scored16\nRow2: w22-20? Or wait, actually the user wrote:\n\n\"For example, in Row3: result is w11 -3, so Vikings scored 11, Packers scored3.\"\n\nSimilarly, Row13: w31 -7.\n\nSo for each row, opponent's score is after the hyphen.\n\nTherefore, let me list all games where they are not against Packers and see what points they allowed:\n\nRow1: Raiders, Vikings won 24-16 \u2192 opponents scored16\nRow2: Bears, result: w22-20? Or wait, the user wrote \"result\" as \"w22 - something?\" No, actually in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\n\"For example, in Row3: result is w11 -3, so Vikings scored 11, Packers scored3.\"\n\nSo similarly, Row2 would be \"w22-20\", meaning Vikings scored22, Bears scored20.\n\nWait but the user didn't specify all results. So maybe I can only go by the opponents and the fact that in their games against Packers, they allowed 3 points (Row3) and7 points (Row13).\n\nSo in Row3: allowed 3\nIn Row13: allowed7\n\nNow, to see if this is the fewest points allowed.\n\nLooking at other opponents:\n\n- Raiders: Vikings scored24, Raiders scored16 \u2192 allowed16\n- Bears: Vikings scored22, Bears scored20 \u2192 allowed20\n- Lions: Vikings scored23, opponent scored? Wait, no, in Row4: result w23 - something?\nWait, the user didn't specify all results, only for Packers. So maybe I can't get exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is that Vikings scored the fewest points against Packers, which would be 11 and 31. But since they have a game where they scored10 (against Rams), this is lower than their scores against Packers. So again, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe it's about the opponent scoring the fewest points against Vikings. For example, in Row3: Packers scored3, which is very low. In Row13: Packers scored7. That might be the fewest points opponents scored against Vikings.\n\nLooking at other games:\n\n- Raiders scored16\n- Bears scored20 and 26 (in Rows2 and11)\nWait, wait no. Wait, in Row11: result w31 - something. If opponent is Bears again, their score would be? Let me see, the user didn't specify all results, only for Packers.\n\nThis makes it tricky because without knowing all opponents' scores, I can't accurately compare.\n\nBut perhaps the key point is that against Packers, Vikings allowed the fewest points (3 and7). If so, then the claim could be true.\n\nSo maybe the correct answer is that yes, Vikings scored the fewest points against Packers, or allowed the fewest points by opponents, making the claim true.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about Vikings scoring the least among their games against Packers, but since they have a game where they scored10, which is lower than 11 and31, then no.\n\nBut without knowing all results, it's hard to be certain. However, given that the user only gave specific examples for Packers, perhaps the intended answer is that Vikings allowed the fewest points against Packers (3 and7), making the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe Vikings scored the fewest points against the Green Bay Packers in their season, with games resulting in 11 and 31 points respectively. However, considering all opponents, they had a lower score against the Los Angeles Rams. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because the Vikings scored fewer points in some other games against different opponents.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the largest attendance be on september 16 , 1973\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the highest attendance in the season happened on September 16, 1973. To verify this, I need to check how many people attended each game and see if the one on September 16 has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week of the season with details like the opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The claim specifically mentions the date September 16, which corresponds to Row 1 (since the first row is Week 1). So, I should focus on that row's attendance.\n\nNext, I need to compare this attendance number against all other rows to see if it's the highest. Let me list out all the attendance figures:\n\n- Row 1: 44,818\n- Row 2: 52,035\n- Row 3: 48,176\n- Row 4: 49,549\n- Row 5: 56,438\n- Row 6: 47,478\n- Row 7: 47,787\n- Row 8: 46,722\n- Row 9: 47,911\n- Row 10: 56,519\n- Row 11: 46,430\n- Row 12: 57,859\n- Row 13: 53,830\n- Row 14: 70,041\n\nNow, I need to find the maximum attendance here. Looking at these numbers, the highest is in Row 14 with 70,041 attendees. That's much higher than Row 1's 44,818.\n\nWait, but the claim says that September 16 had the largest attendance. But according to my analysis, the game on December 16, which is Row 14, had a much larger attendance. So the claim isn't correct because the highest wasn't in September; it was later in the season.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the smallest attendance be 56438\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"smallest attendance.\" Looking at the table, the columns related to this would likely be 'attendance'. The claim specifies that this smallest attendance should be 56,438.\n\nNext, I need to check all the rows in the 'attendance' column to find the minimum value. Each row has a week number and various details, including attendance numbers.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Week 1: Attendance is 44,818.\n2. Week 2: 52,035.\n3. Week 3: 48,176.\n4. Week 4: 49,549.\n5. Week 5: 56,438.\n6. Week 6: 47,478.\n7. Week 7: 47,787.\n8. Week 8: 46,722.\n9. Week 9: 47,911.\n10. Week 10: 56,519.\n11. Week 11: 46,430.\n12. Week 12: 57,859.\n13. Week 13: 53,830.\n14. Week 14: 70,041.\n\nLooking at all these numbers, the smallest attendance is in Week 1 with 44,818 and increases to higher numbers except for a few mid-range attendances. Wait, no\u2014Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me list them again:\n\nWait, looking back, the lowest number is actually 44,818 in Week 1, then it goes up, but later there are lower numbers like 46,430 (Week 11), 46,722 (Week 8), and others around that range. So I need to find the minimum attendance across all games.\n\nLooking at each week's attendance:\n\n- Week 1: 44,818\n- Week 2: 52,035\n- Week 3: 48,176\n- Week 4: 49,549\n- Week 5: 56,438\n- Week 6: 47,478\n- Week 7: 47,787\n- Week 8: 46,722\n- Week 9: 47,911\n- Week 10: 56,519\n- Week 11: 46,430\n- Week 12: 57,859\n- Week 13: 53,830\n- Week 14: 70,041\n\nSo the smallest attendance is 44,818 in Week 1. The claim says the smallest attendance is 56,438, which is not correct because that's a higher number than some others.\n\nWait no\u2014the user said \"the smallest attendance be 56438.\" That would mean they are claiming that 56,438 is the minimum. But from my calculation, the actual minimum is much lower at 44,818.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the smallest attendance is 56,438, but the lowest attendance in the table is actually 44,818. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: The 'attendance' column is crucial as it contains numerical data needed to verify the claim.\n2. **List all attendances**: Extract the attendance numbers from each row.\n3. **Find the minimum attendance**: Identify the smallest number, which is 44,818 in Week 1.\n4. **Compare with the claim**: The claim asserts the smallest is 56,438, but it's not; thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
