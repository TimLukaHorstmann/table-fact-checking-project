The claim states: \"Paul Pierce led the team in points for 5 of the 7 games.\" So, I should check each game listed in the table to see how many times Paul Pierce was the leading scorer.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1 (Game 76): High points are attributed to Paul Pierce with 32 points. So that's 1 game where he led.\n\nRow 2 (Game 77): Paul Pierce again is listed as the high points scorer with 21 points. That's 2 games so far.\n\nRow 3 (Game 78): The high points here are Rajon Rondo with 31, so Paul doesn't lead this game. So still at 2.\n\nRow 4 (Game 79): Paul Pierce scores 28, which is the highest. Now we're up to 3 games led by him.\n\nRow 5 (Game 80): High points go to Paul Pierce again, 14 points. That's 4 games.\n\nRow 6 (Game 81): Paul Pierce with 31 points leads this game. So that's 5 times now.\n\nRows 7 (Game 82) isn't relevant here because the claim is about 7 games, but Game 82 is the 7th row. However, in Row 7, the high points are Glen Davis, so Paul didn't lead there. So total of 5 games where Paul led.\n\nThe table has rows from 1 to 7, corresponding to Games 76 to 82. The claim refers to 7 games, which I assume includes all these. So in Rows 1-6 (Games 76-81), Paul led in 5 of them: Game 76, 77, 79, 80, and 81. That's 5 games out of 7.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the claim says \"5 of the 7 games.\" Let me recount:\n\nRow 1 (Game 76): Yes\nRow 2 (Game 77): Yes\nRow 3 (Game 78): No\nRow 4 (Game 79): Yes\nRow 5 (Game 80): Yes\nRow 6 (Game 81): Yes\nRow 7 (Game 82): No\n\nSo that's 5 games where Paul led: rows 1,2,4,5,6.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"rajon rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Rajon Rondo had the highest number of assists with 12 in one game for the Celtics. So, I need to find a row in the table where Rajon Rondo's assists are the most (specifically 12) and it's listed as being for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: team is Charlotte, score is a win with 111-109 in 2OT. High points by Paul Pierce, rebounds by Kendrick Perkins, and assists by Rajon Rondo with 9.\nRow 2: team is Atlanta, score is a win with 104-92 in OT. High points by Paul Pierce again, rebounds by Kendrick Perkins, assists by Rajon Rondo with 6.\nRow 3: team is New Jersey, score is a win with 106-104 in OT. High points by Rajon Rondo (31), rebounds by a combination including him, and his assists are also highlighted as the highest with 9, but there's another assist leader mentioned as Stephon Marbury with 5.\nRow 4: team is Miami, score is a win with 105-98 in OT. High points by Paul Pierce (28), rebounds by Rajon Rondo (10), and assists by Rajon Rondo (12). This seems relevant because he has 12 assists here.\nRow 5: team is Cleveland, score is a loss with 76-107 in OT. High points by Paul Pierce (14), rebounds by Kendrick Perkins (6), assists by Rajon Rondo (6).\nRow 6: team is Philadelphia, score is a win with 100-98 in OT. High points by Paul Pierce (31), rebounds by Kendrick Perkins (12), and assists are shared between Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury (5 each). So no assist leader here.\nRow 7: team is Washington, score is a win with 115-107 in OT. High points by Glen Davis (21), rebounds by Leon Powe (13), and assists by Stephon Marbury (8).\n\nNow, focusing on Rajon Rondo's assist numbers:\n\nIn Row 4, Rajon Rondo has 12 assists, which is the highest in that game. The team listed for that row is Miami, not Celtics. So the claim says \"for the Celtics,\" but he was playing against Miami.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if any other rows have Rajon Rondo as the Celtics player with high assists. Looking through all rows:\n\nRow 1: Charlotte\nRow 2: Atlanta\nRow 3: New Jersey\nRow 4: Miami\nRow 5: Cleveland\nRow 6: Philadelphia\nRow 7: Washington\n\nNone of these are for the Celtics. Therefore, there's no row where Rajon Rondo is playing for the Celtics and has 12 assists.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through them again:\n\n- Row 1: Charlotte\n- Row 2: Atlanta\n- Row 3: New Jersey (Nets)\n- Row 4: Miami Heat\n- Row 5: Cavaliers\n- Row 6: 76ers\n- Row 7: Wizards\n\nNo Celtics team is listed. So, the claim is incorrect because Rajon Rondo was not playing for the Celtics in any of these games where he had 12 assists.\n\nAlso, the claim says \"in one game,\" but regardless of the team, since it's not the Celtics, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the Celtics win all of the game they play at TD Banknorth Garden\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It\u2019s stating that whenever the Celtics play a game at TD Banknorth Garden, they win. So, I should check all the games listed in the table where the venue is TD Banknorth Garden and see if they all result in a win for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has seven rows (game numbers 76 to 82). Each row has details about a game, including the date, opposing team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and the team's record after that game.\n\nI need to focus on games played at TD Banknorth Garden. From the table, I can see that rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 list the venue as TD Banknorth Garden with an attendance of 18,624 each time except for row 7 which also says TD Banknorth Garden with 18,624.\n\nNow, let's check each of these games:\n\n- Row 1: Celtics (Boston) vs Charlotte. Score is W 111 - 109 in 2OT. So, Celtics win.\n- Row 2: Celtics vs Atlanta. Score is W 104 - 92 in OT. Celtics win.\n- Row 3: Celtics vs New Jersey. Score is W 106 - 104 in OT. Celtics win.\n- Row 4: Celtics vs Miami. Score is W 105 - 98 in OT. Celtics win.\n- Row 7: Celtics vs Washington. Score is W 115 - 107 in OT. Celtics win.\n\nSo, all the games at TD Banknorth Garden that the Celtics played resulted in a win for them. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on the data provided.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other rows where the venue is TD Banknorth Garden but might have been missed. Scanning through the table again:\n\n- Row 5: Venue is Quicken Loans Arena\n- Row 6: Venue is Wachovia Center\n\nSo yes, only Rows 1-4 and 7 are at TD Banknorth Garden, all of which are wins for the Celtics.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at row 3, it says \"high rebounds: rajon rondo , kendrick perkins , mikki moore (9)\" but that doesn't affect the outcome, just some stats. So no issue there.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true as all games listed at TD Banknorth Garden are wins for the Celtics.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that during a certain stretch, the Celtics won 6 out of their 7 games. Let me go through each row to check how many wins they have.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It's game 76 against Charlotte and they won with a score of w 111 - 109 (2OT). So that's one win.\nRow 2: Game 77 against Atlanta, another win. That makes it two.\nRow 3: Game 78 against New Jersey, they won again. Now we're at three wins.\nRow 4: Game 79 against Miami, another win. Four wins so far.\nRow 5: Game 80 against Cleveland, they lost (l 76 - 107). So that's one loss, but since the claim is about wins, this doesn't count towards the total.\nRow 6: Game 81 against Philadelphia, they won again. That brings the total to five wins.\nRow 7: Game 82 against Washington, another win. Now that's six wins.\n\nWait, so from games 76 to 82, there are seven games in total. The Celtics won six of them and lost one (game 80). So the claim says they won six out of seven, which matches what I see here. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. Each row has a 'score' column that indicates whether it's a win or loss. So for each game, the 'score' will be either 'w' or 'l'. The rows where the score starts with 'w' are the wins. Let me list them:\n\nRow 1: w\nRow 2: w\nRow 3: w\nRow 4: w\nRow 6: w\nRow 7: w\n\nOnly Row 5 is a loss, so Rows 0 to 5 (assuming rows start at 0) are wins. Wait, the row indices in the example start from 0, but looking back, the first row is game 76 as row 1. So perhaps I should consider row numbers starting at 1.\n\nSo, for each relevant row where they won:\n\nRow 1: game 76\nRow 2: game 77\nRow 3: game 78\nRow 4: game 79\nRow 6: game 81\nRow 7: game 82\n\nWait, but in the table provided, the rows are labeled as Row 1 to Row 7. So each row corresponds directly to a game number. Therefore, the relevant cells are all the 'score' columns where they won.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 1 (game 76): score is w\nRow 2 (game 77): score is w\nRow 3 (game 78): score is w\nRow 4 (game 79): score is w\nRow 6 (game 81): score is w\nRow 7 (game 82): score is w\n\nThat's six wins out of seven games. Therefore, the relevant columns are the 'score' in these rows.\n\nI need to list each as an object with row_index and column_name. So for each row, if it's a win, we include that cell.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 'score' columns from rows 1,2,3,4,6,7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest point total for a Celtic player in one game be 32, by Paul Pierce.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table and check for any instance where a Celtic player scored 32 points in a single game. The relevant columns here are 'high points' because that's where the leading scorer is noted.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Game 76 on April 1 against Charlotte. Paul Pierce has 32 points, which matches the claim exactly. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nRow 2: Game 77 on April 3 against Atlanta. Paul Pierce scores 21 points here, which is less than 32. So no support from this row.\n\nRows 3 through 7 don't mention Paul Pierce at all for high points. Instead, other players like Rajon Rondo or Glen Davis are noted, but none reach 32 points in a single game according to these rows.\n\nSo only Row 1 provides evidence that Paul Pierce had a game with 32 points. Therefore, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's an instance where Paul Pierce scored 32 points in one game.

That's one game.\n\nRow 2: Paul Pierce has 21 points, which is the highest for that game. So that's two games now.\n\nRow 3: The high points are listed as Rajon Rondo with 31. That means Paul didn't lead here. So he only led in 2 out of 7 so far.\n\nRow 4: Paul Pierce scores 28, which is the highest for that game. Now he's at 3 games.\n\nRow 5: Paul has 14 points, but I don't see another player listed with higher points? Wait, the score was l 76-107 (OT). So total points by his team were 76, but the opponent scored more. But as per the table, high points are only for his team. So if he has 14 and there's no one else listed higher, then he leads here. That makes it 4 games.\n\nRow 6: Paul scores 31, which is the highest. Now up to 5 games.\n\nRow 7: The high points are Glen Davis with 21, so Paul doesn't lead here. So total games where he led are Rows 1,2,4,5,6 \u2013 that's 5 games. But the claim says 6 out of 7. Hmm, I think I might have missed one.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 3: Rondo leads with 31, so Paul doesn't lead there.\n\nRow 7: Glen Davis leads with 21, so Paul doesn't.\n\nSo that's only 5 games where he led. So the claim is saying 6 out of 7, which isn't correct because it's actually 5.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Row 5. Let me check again.\n\nRow 5: game:80, team:Cleveland, score:l76-107 (OT). The high points are Paul with14, but did any other player have more? The row says \"high assists: rondo (6)\", but it doesn't mention another player scoring higher than Paul.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It's saying that Kendrick Perkins had the highest number of assists with 12 in a single game for the Celtics. So I need to look through each row of the table and find any occurrence where Kendrick Perkins recorded 12 assists in a game played by the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Game 76, April 1, Charlotte... Assists: Rondo has 9.\nRow 2: Game 77, April 3, Atlanta... Assists: Rondo has 6.\nRow 3: Game 78, April 8, New Jersey... Assists: Rondo and Marbury have 5 each.\nRow 4: Game 79, April 10, Miami... Assists: Rondo with 12. Wait, that's 12 assists by Rondo, not Perkins.\nRow 5: Game 80, April 12, Cleveland... Assists: Rondo has 6.\nRow 6: Game 81, April 14, Philadelphia... Assists: Tony Allen and Marbury have 5 each.\nRow 7: Game 82, April 15, Washington... Assists: Marbury with 8.\n\nNow, I need to check if any row shows Kendrick Perkins with 12 assists. From the table, in Row 4, Rondo has 12 assists, but that's for the Miami game. None of the rows show Kendrick Perkins with 12 assists. In fact, looking through all the high assists columns, it seems Perkins is never mentioned as having 12 assists.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check each row. High assists are listed in each row. For example, Row 4 mentions Rondo has 12 assists, but that's for the Miami game. None of the games show Perkins with 12 assists.\n\nSo the claim says \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game.\" But looking at the table, there is no row where Perkins has 12 assists for the Celtics. All the high assists are either by Rondo or others, not Perkins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Now, I need to check if in all these games, the Celtics lost.\n\nLooking at each game:\n\nRow 1: Team is Charlotte. The score is W 111 - 109 (2OT). So, the Celtics aren't even playing here; it's the Charlotte team. Wait, no, wait\u2014the claim is about the Celtics losing when they play at TD Banknorth Garden. So, if the Celtics are the home team there, then their record would matter.\n\nWait, actually, in Row 1, the game is between Charlotte and probably the Celtics, but maybe not? Wait, the table lists \"team: charlotte\" for row 1, so that game is Charlotte vs. someone else, likely the Celtics if they're playing at TD Banknorth Garden. But wait, if the team is Charlotte, then they're the away team or home team? Hmm.\n\nWait, no\u2014probably in each row, the 'team' column indicates which team is playing, but I think that might be the opponent's name. Wait, no: the table's structure is:\n\nRow 1:\ngame:76\ndate: april 1\nteam: charlotte\nscore: w 111 -109 (2OT)\nhigh points: Paul Pierce (32), etc.\n\nSo, 'team: charlotte' likely refers to the team playing against the Celtics. So, in Row 1, it's Charlotte vs. Celtics, and the result is a win for whoever scored W\u2014probably the Celtics won because they're the home team.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the Celtics losing all games at TD Banknorth Garden. So I need to see if, whenever they played there, they lost.\n\nLooking at each game where the location is TD Banknorth Garden (rows 1-4 and 7):\n\nRow 1: Team is Charlotte. The score is W 111 -109 (2OT). So that's a win for whoever scored W. Assuming it's the home team, which would be Celtics, so they won.\n\nRow 2: team: atlanta, score w 104-92 (ot). Home team wins again.\n\nRow3: team: new jersey, score w 106-104 (ot). So Celtics win.\n\nRow4: team: miami, score w 105-98 (ot). Celtics win again.\n\nRow7: team: washington, score w 115 -107 (ot). Celtics win here as well.\n\nWait, but in Row5 and Row6, they're not at TD Banknorth Garden. So the claim is about games where they play at that location\u2014they are winning all of them, not losing any. Therefore, the claim that they lose all games there is false because they actually won each game played at TD Banknorth Garden.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that in each of those games, it's indeed the Celtics playing at home. The 'team' column indicates the opponent, right? So if the game is at TD Banknorth Garden and the team listed is the opponent, then the Celtics would be the home team and their result would be W.\n\nYes, so all rows 1-4 and 7 have the Celtics winning when playing at TD Banknorth Garden. Therefore, the claim that they lose all games there is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a Celtics player's highest point total in a game is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest point total for a Celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by stephon marbury.\"\n\nFirst, I should go through each row of the table to find any instances where Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in a single game. Let me look at each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Game 76 on April 1 against Charlotte. The high points are listed as Paul Pierce with 32. So, Stephon Marbury didn't score 32 here.\n\nRow 2: Game 77 on April 3 against Atlanta. High points again go to Paul Pierce with 21. Stephon isn't mentioned here either.\n\nRow 3: Game 78 on April 8 against New Jersey. The high points are Rajon Rondo with 31. No mention of Stephon Marbury scoring 32.\n\nWait, but looking at the rebounds and assists, it shows multiple players for rebounds, but only Rajon Rondo is listed for both assists and points here. So no Stephon Marbury in this row either.\n\nRow 4: Game 79 on April 10 against Miami. Paul Pierce scores 28, which isn't 32, and there's no Stephon mentioned as high scorer.\n\nRow 5: Game 80 on April 12 against Cleveland. Paul Pierce has 14 points here. No Stephon Marbury with a high of 32.\n\nRow 6: Game 81 on April 14 against Philadelphia. Paul Pierce again scores 31, and the assists are split between Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury (5 each). But the high points are still Paul at 31, so no Stephon with 32 here.\n\nRow 7: Game 82 on April 15 against Washington. Glen Davis has 21 points, not Stephon. So nowhere in this table does Stephon Marbury have a game where he scored 32 points as the highest total.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row for any mention of Stephon Marbury's points. Scanning through again: Rows 1 and 2 only mention Paul Pierce, Row 3 is Rondo, Row 4 is Paul again, Row 5 is Paul, Row 6 is Paul, and Row 7 is Glen Davis. So in none of these does Stephon Marbury have a game where he scored 32 points as the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because there's no evidence in the table that Stephon Marbury ever scored 32 points in a single game during this period.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on whether Stephon Marbury scored 32 points in any game. After reviewing each row, none show him with 32 as the highest points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the Celtics lose 6 of their 7 games during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and see what the game outcomes are. The key columns for determining wins and losses seem to be \"score\" and \"record.\" In the score column, a 'w' indicates a win, while an 'l' indicates a loss. The record (win-loss) is also provided, but it's cumulative, so I need to focus on each individual game's result.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Game 76, Celtics (Charlotte team?) Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, the team column says \"charlotte,\" but that seems off because the Celtics are usually from Boston. Maybe it's a typo or mistake in the table. But regardless, for this problem, I think the team doesn't matter as much as whether they won or lost.\n\nWait, actually, the games might be across different teams, so perhaps each row is a separate game against different opponents. So the Celtics are playing multiple games here. The claim says \"during this stretch,\" which likely refers to these seven games (from game 76 to game 82).\n\nSo I need to count how many losses the Celtics have in these seven games.\n\nLet me list out the game results:\n\n- Row 1: Game 76, score w 111 - 109 (2OT) \u2192 Win\n- Row 2: Game 77, score w 104 - 92 (OT) \u2192 Win\n- Row 3: Game 78, score w 106 - 104 (OT) \u2192 Win\n- Row 4: Game 79, score w 105 - 98 (OT) \u2192 Win\n- Row 5: Game 80, score l 76 - 107 (OT) \u2192 Loss\n- Row 6: Game 81, score w 100 - 98 (OT) \u2192 Win\n- Row 7: Game 82, score w 115 - 107 (OT) \u2192 Win\n\nWait, that seems off. The Celtics are winning most of these games except for one loss in game 80.\n\nBut the claim says they lose 6 out of 7 games. That doesn't match because I'm only seeing one loss here.\n\nHold on, maybe I misread some scores. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: w \u2192 Win\nRow 2: w \u2192 Win\nRow 3: w \u2192 Win\nRow 4: w \u2192 Win\nRow 5: l \u2192 Loss\nRow 6: w \u2192 Win\nRow 7: w \u2192 Win\n\nSo only one loss. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they lost only once, not six times.\n\nWait, but the table's team names are \"charlotte,\" \"atlanta,\" etc., which might mean that these aren't all Celtics games. Oh! Maybe each row represents a different team's game, and the Celtics are playing against these teams. So if the team is listed as \"charlotte\" in Row 1, perhaps it's a Charlotte team, not the Celtics. That would mean that the Celtics are playing away games, so their own record isn't directly reflected here.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table seems to be about the Celtics because each row lists high points and assists by players like Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo, etc., who were Celtics players. So perhaps the team names in the table are opponents, not the Celtics themselves. That is, the Celtics are playing against Charlotte, Atlanta, New Jersey, Miami, Cleveland, Philadelphia, and Washington.\n\nIn that case, each row represents a game where the Celtics are playing away or home, but their own record is given at the end of each row (57-19, 58-19, etc.). So for each game, the Celtics have a certain outcome\u2014win or loss. Let's check each row to see if it's a win or loss from the Celtics' perspective.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 1: Celtics vs Charlotte? No, that doesn't make sense because the team is listed as \"charlotte.\" Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each row represents a game played by the Celtics against different opponents. So in Row 1, the game is the Celtics (team: charlotte?), but that seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in how the table is structured. Each row represents a single game, with details like team, date, score, etc. The \"team\" column indicates who they are playing against each time. So for example:\n\n- Row 1: Celtics vs Charlotte\n- Row 2: Celtics vs Atlanta\n- And so on.\n\nBut in the claim, it's about the Celtics losing games. So if we consider that each row is a game played by the Celtics, then the outcome (win or loss) affects their record. So the question is, how many times did the Celtics lose in these seven games.\n\nLooking at each score:\n\nRow 1: w \u2192 Win\nRow 2: w \u2192 Win\nRow 3: w \u2192 Win\nRow 4: w \u2192 Win\nRow 5: l \u2192 Loss\nRow 6: w \u2192 Win\nRow 7: w \u2192 Win\n\nSo only one loss in seven games. Therefore, the claim that they lost six of their seven games is FALSE because it's only one loss.\n\nAlternatively, if the table includes all Celtics games during this stretch (i.e., from Game 76 to Game 82), and each game is a Celtics game against different opponents, then yes, there's only one loss. Therefore, the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the Celtics' game outcome is listed as a loss.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:** The task requires determining how many times the Celtics lost in seven games, represented by the 'score' column indicating a loss (denoted as 'l').\n\n2. **Analyze Each Game Result:**\n   - **Game 76:** Win ('w')\n   - **Game 77:** Win ('w')\n   - **Game 78:** Win ('w')\n   - **Game 79:** Win ('w')\n   - **Game 80:** Loss ('l')\n   - **Game 81:** Win ('w')\n   - **Game 82:** Win ('w')\n\n3. **Count the Losses:** Only one game (Game 80) resulted in a loss.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there was only one loss, the claim that the Celtics lost six games is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The Celtics lost only once during this seven-game stretch, making the claim false.",
