    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"jessica shepley receive a winner's share of 14000 when she win the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for Jessica Shepley in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that Row 3 is about Jessica Shepley. Let me check the details for Row 3.\n\nIn Row 3:\n- Year: 2011\n- Dates: Jul 22 - 24\n- Champion: Jessica Shepley\n- Country: Canada\n- Score: 203 (13)\n- Tournament location: Beaver Meadow Golf Course\n- Purse: $100,000\n- Winner's share: $14,000\n\nSo, the winner's share is indeed listed as $14,000. The claim mentions that she won at Beaver Meadow Golf Course, which matches the location in Row 3.\n\nI should verify if there are any other rows with Jessica Shepley or if this is unique. Looking through all the rows, only Row 3 has her name. Therefore, the information in Row 3 directly supports the claim.\n\nNow, considering the instructions about relevant cells: I need to find which specific data points from the table confirm the claim. The key pieces are the champion's name and the winner's share amount.\n\nIn terms of structure, each row has columns like year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share. To validate the claim, I need to check two specific columns for Jessica Shepley's row: \"champion\" (to confirm it's her) and \"winner's share\" (to check the amount).\n\nSo, Row 3 has both the champion as Jessica Shepley and a winner's share of $14,000. Since these match the claim exactly, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to note which cells are relevant. Each relevant cell is identified by its row index and column name. For Row 3, the columns involved are \"champion\" and \"winner's share\". Therefore, I'll list those as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"in 2012, the champion was from the United States\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking at each row in the table and see how they relate to the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the rows that correspond to the year 2012. Scanning through the table, Row 2 is for 2012. That's where I should focus my attention because the claim specifically mentions 2012.\n\nIn Row 2, several pieces of information are provided:\n- Year: 2012\n- Dates: July 20 - 22\n- Champion: Jenny Gleason\n- Country: United States\n- Score: 211 (5)\n- Tournament Location: Beaver Meadow Golf Course\n- Purse: $100,000\n- Winner's Share: $15,000\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the claim. The claim is about whether the champion in 2012 was from the United States. Looking at the 'Country' column in Row 2, it says \"United States,\" which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTo ensure that there's no mistake, I'll cross-verify with other rows. For example, Row 1 is 2013 and the champion is from Thailand, so it doesn't affect the 2012 claim. Similarly, Rows 3 to 10 cover years before and after 2012, but since we're only concerned with 2012, those can be disregarded.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information that would suggest the champion in 2012 wasn't from the U.S. The 'Country' column for Row 2 is clear about this. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by the data provided.\n\nIt's also important to note that other columns like 'Champion', 'Score', and 'Purse' don't pertain directly to the country of origin, so they aren't relevant here. The only necessary piece of information is the 'Country' for 2012, which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSo, after carefully reviewing Row 2, I'm confident that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has information about various golf tournaments from 2004 to 2013. The claim says: \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asserting that starting from the year after 2012 (so 2013 and beyond), the winner's share was never less than 15,000. But looking at the table, I need to check each row after 2012, which would be rows for years 2013 onwards.\n\nWait, but actually, the claim says \"after 2012,\" so does that mean starting in 2013 or including 2012? The wording is a bit ambiguous. However, typically, \"after\" would mean starting from the next year, so 2013 and beyond. But to be thorough, I should check both 2012 and subsequent years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: 2013, winner's share 15,000\n- Row 2: 2012, winner's share 15,000\n- Rows 3-10 cover years from 2011 down to 2004.\n\nSo for the claim, I need to focus on rows where the year is after 2012. That would only be row 1 (2013). But wait, row 2 is 2012, which might also be included if \"after 2012\" includes 2012 itself. The claim isn't entirely clear.\n\nHowever, regardless of whether it's including 2012 or not, I should check all years starting from 2012 onwards to ensure that the winner's share never drops below 15,000. So let's consider rows for 2012 and 2013.\n\nRow 2 (2012): winner's share is 15,000.\nRow 1 (2013): winner's share is also 15,000.\n\nSo from 2012 onwards, the minimum winner's share in these years is 15,000. Wait, but looking at other rows:\n\n- Row 4: 2010, winner's share 15,400\n- Row 5: 2009, 12,600\n- Row 6: 2008, 11,200\n- Row 7: 2007, 10,500\n- Row 8: 2006, 9,800\n- Row 9: 2005, 9,100\n- Row 10: 2004, 9,100\n\nThese are all lower than 15,000, but they're for earlier years. The claim is about \"after 2012,\" so those don't apply.\n\nBut wait, the table includes years from 2004 to 2013, and the claim is about after 2012. So only rows 1 (2013) and row 2 (2012) are relevant.\n\nRow 1: 15,000\nRow 2: 15,000\n\nSo both meet or equal to 15,000. Therefore, from 2012 onwards, the winner's share is never less than 15,000.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing any rows after 2013. The table only goes up to 2013, so that's all we have. So there are no years beyond 2013 in the data. Therefore, the claim holds true for all applicable years.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking all relevant rows from 2012 onwards. Each of these rows has a winner's share of at least 15,000, satisfying the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion.\n\nThe claim is: \"champion jenny shin share 14000 dollar when she win.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a row where the champion is Jenny Shin and her winner's share is $14,000.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Champion is PK Kongkraphan. Not Jenny Shin.\nRow 2: Champion is Jenny Gleason. Also not Jenny Shin.\nRow 3: Champion is Jessica Shepley. Nope.\nRow 4: Champion is Jenny Shin. This looks promising. Let's check her details.\n\nIn Row 4, the year is 2010. Her score is 205 with a (11). The tournament location is Beaver Meadow Golf Course. The purse is $110,000, and her winner's share is $14,400. Wait, no, that's not $14,000. It's $14,400.\n\nWait, the claim says she shares $14,000 when she wins. But in Row 4, it's actually $14,400. So does this mean the claim is FALSE?\n\nBut I should double-check all rows to ensure there isn't another instance of Jenny Shin with a $14,000 winner's share.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table:\n\nRow 5: Champion Misun Cho, not Jenny Shin.\nRow 6: Mo Martin, nope.\nRow 7: Ji Min Jeong.\nRow 8: Charlotte Mayorkas.\nRow 9: Kyeong Bae.\nRow 10: Erica Blasberg.\n\nOnly Row 4 has Jenny Shin. So in that row, the winner's share is $14,400, not $14,000. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the amount doesn't match.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be Row 4 and the column for \"winner 's share\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list will include {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"winner's share\"}.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this claim means. It seems to be saying that for all purses (which I assume refer to prize money) awarded after 2012 (so from 2013 onwards), the winner's share is at least 15,400. If this is true, then there should be no such purse where the winner's share is less than 15,400 in the years 2013 and beyond.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, with various details including the year itself, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, winner's share, etc. My focus needs to be on two columns: \"year\" and \"winner's share.\" \n\nI should check all the rows where the year is 2013 or later. That means row 1 (2013), row 2 (2012?), wait, no\u2014wait, let me clarify. The claim says \"after 2012,\" so that would include 2013 and beyond. So I need to look at rows starting from 2013 up to the latest year in the table.\n\nWait, looking at the table, it goes from 2004 to 2013, with each row having a different year. So \"after 2012\" means years 2013, 2014, etc., but in this table, the latest is 2013. So I only need to check rows where the year is 2013.\n\nWait no, wait\u2014looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: 2013\nRow 2: 2012\nRow 3: 2011\nRow 4: 2010\nRow 5: 2009\nRow 6: 2008\nRow 7: 2007\nRow 8: 2006\nRow 9: 2005\nRow 10: 2004\n\nSo the rows are in order from 2004 to 2013. So \"after 2012\" would mean years 2013 onwards, but in this table, only 2013 is after 2012. So I need to check row 1 (2013) and any other rows where the year is 2013 or later, which in this case is just row 1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: The claim says \"after 2012,\" so that would include 2013, 2014, etc. But since the table only goes up to 2013, I only need to check that year's data. \n\nNow, for row 1 (2013), the winner's share is 15,000. The claim says \"less than 15400,\" so 15,000 is not less than 15,400? Wait, wait\u2014no, the claim is about being less than 15,400. So 15,000 is actually less than 15,400 because 15,000 is smaller than 15,400.\n\nWait no: 15,000 is 15 thousand, and 15,400 is 15 thousand four hundred. So yes, 15,000 is less than 15,400.\n\nTherefore, in row 1 (2013), the winner's share is 15,000, which is indeed less than 15,400.\n\nIf that's the case, then there is at least one purse after 2012 where the winner's share is less than 15,400. So the claim \"there be zero...\" would be FALSE because it's not true that all purses after 2012 have a winner's share of at least 15,400.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: The table shows row 1 (2013) with a purse of 100,000 and a winner's share of 15,000. Since the claim is about purses after 2012 having a winner's share less than 15,400, this row directly contradicts it because 15,000 is less than 15,400.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there exists at least one purse (in 2013) where the winner's share was less than 15,400.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"purses.\" Perhaps \"purse\" refers to the total prize money, and \"winner's share\" is a part of that. So in row 1, the purse is 100,000, and the winner's share is 15,000. The claim says that there are zero purses after 2012 where the winner's share is less than 15,400. But since in 2013, it's 15,000, which is less, the claim is false.\n\nSo to summarize: I need to check all rows with year > 2012 (i.e., 2013). For row 1, the winner's share is 15,000 < 15,400. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there exists a purse in 2013 where the winner's share was less than 15400.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** The claim refers to purses \"after 2012,\" which corresponds to rows with year >= 2013. In this table, only row 1 (2013) meets this criterion.\n\n2. **Examine the Winner's Share in These Rows:** For row 1, the winner's share is 15,000, which is less than 15,400.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since there is at least one purse after 2012 where the winner's share is below 15,400, the claim that there are none is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because in 2013, the winner's share was \\$15,000, which is less than \\$15,400. \n\n\\boxed{False}",
