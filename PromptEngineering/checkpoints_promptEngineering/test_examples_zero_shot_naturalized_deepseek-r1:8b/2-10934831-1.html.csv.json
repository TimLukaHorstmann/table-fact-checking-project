Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the warning sign have a red border and black text.\" So they're talking about a warning sign, specifically mentioning two attributes: the border color and the text color.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row seems to represent different types of signs with various attributes. The columns in the table are type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text / symbol. So for each row, these five attributes are listed.\n\nI need to focus on the first row since it's about a warning sign. Let me see what the table says about the warning sign.\n\nRow 1:\n- Type of sign: warning\n- Shape: triangular\n- Border: red\n- Background colour: yellow\n- Text / symbol: black\n\nSo, according to this, the border is indeed red and the text is black. That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows that might also be relevant. The claim specifically mentions \"warning sign,\" so only row 1 applies here.\n\nI don't think any other rows pertain to this claim because they're about different types of signs like prohibition, mandatory instructions, etc. So, no need to consider those unless the claim includes them, which it doesn't.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the claim's attributes are correctly matched in row 1. The border is red, so that's correct. The text / symbol is black as well, so both parts of the claim are supported.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. The warning sign has a red border and black text according to the table. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"border\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"text / symbol\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the warning sign has a yellow background colour and a triangular shape.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. It mentions two characteristics of a warning sign: the background color is yellow, and the shape is triangular.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different type of sign with various attributes like type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. The first row is for a warning sign, so that's the one I'm interested in for this claim.\n\nLet me check the relevant columns for the warning sign (Row 1). \n\n- **Background colour**: According to Row 1, it's yellow. So the first part of the claim about the background color checks out.\n  \n- **Shape**: The shape is listed as triangular. That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both aspects mentioned in the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. Since we're verifying two specific attributes for Row 1 (background colour and shape), I'll note their respective column names: \"background colour\" and \"shape.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are in Row 1 for both background color and shape.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table's first row which confirms both the yellow background colour and triangular shape of the warning sign.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"shape\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the warning and prohibition sign both have a red border.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. It mentions two signs: the warning and the prohibition sign. For each of these, I need to check if they have a red border according to the table.\n\nLooking at Row 1 for the warning sign. The type is 'warning,' so that's our first sign. The border column says 'red' here. So the warning sign has a red border. That matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, the prohibition sign is in Row 2. Type is 'prohibition.' Checking the border column, it also says 'red.' So both the warning and prohibition signs have red borders according to the table. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the relevant cells. For the warning sign, row index 0 (since it's the first row), columns are type, shape, border, etc. The 'border' column for Row 1 is indeed 'red.' For Row 2, same thing: type is prohibition, border is red.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the table that would contradict this. So both signs have a red border as per the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table where both the warning and prohibition signs have a red border.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"border\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"border\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the mandatory instruction sign have a blue background\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to the columns in the table. The claim mentions three attributes: type of sign, background colour, and possibly others like shape or border, but they're not directly part of the claim except for the specific ones mentioned.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different sign with various attributes. I need to focus on the rows where the type of sign is \"mandatory instructions\" because that's directly related to the claim.\n\nIn the table:\n- Row 3: type of sign is mandatory instructions. Let me check its background colour. The column for background colour in this row says blue. So that seems to support the claim.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells. The claim only mentions background colour, so I don't need to look at other columns unless they somehow affect the answer. For example, if the border color or text affected the perception of the background, but in this case, it's specifically about the background being blue.\n\nWait, let me double-check Row 3: type is mandatory instructions, shape is circular, border is white, background colour is blue, and text/symbol is white. So yes, the background is definitely blue here.\n\nAre there any other rows that might have \"mandatory instructions\" with a different background? Let me check all rows. Only Row 3 has mandatory instructions, so no others to consider.\n\nTherefore, based on this, the claim is fully supported by Row 3's background colour being blue.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"blue be the background color of the white border for the mandatory instruction sign.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse this claim into two main parts. The first part is about the background color and the second part is about the border color. Specifically, it mentions that blue is the background color and white is the border color for a particular type of sign.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different type of sign with various attributes like type of sign, shape, border, background colour, and text/symbol. My task is to find which rows are relevant to this claim.\n\nThe key terms here are \"background color\" and \"border\". The claim specifies that blue is the background color, so I need to look for cells where background colour is 'blue'. It also mentions a white border, so I should check if any row has 'white' as the border.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to verify the type of sign. The claim refers to \"mandatory instruction sign\", which corresponds to Row 3 in the table. So, I need to ensure that Row 3 is considered because it's about mandatory instructions.\n\nNow, checking Row 3: \n- Type of sign: mandatory instructions\n- Shape: circular\n- Border: white\n- Background colour: blue\n- Text/symbol: white\n\nThis row matches both the type and the color attributes mentioned in the claim. The background colour is indeed blue, and the border is white, which aligns with the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might be relevant, but since the claim specifically mentions \"mandatory instruction sign\", Row 3 is the primary focus. The other rows don't pertain to mandatory instructions unless specified otherwise, so they can be disregarded for this particular claim.\n\nTherefore, the cells that are relevant are from Row 3, specifically the background colour and border columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 3 where the background color is blue and the border is white for a mandatory instruction sign. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"background colour\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"border\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"the warning sign be circular with a red border and black text.\" So I need to check each part of this claim against the corresponding columns in the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the type of sign. The claim mentions a warning sign. In the table, each row has a 'type of sign' column. I should find which row corresponds to the warning sign. Let's go through them:\n\nRow 1: warning\nRow 2: prohibition\nRow 3: mandatory instructions\nRow 4: supplementary\nRow 5: directions (sometimes)\nRow 6: information\n\nSo Row 1 is the warning sign.\n\nNext, the shape of the sign. The claim says it's circular. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: triangular\nRow 2: circular\nRow 3: circular\nRow 4: rectangular\nRow 5: rectangular\nRow 6: rectangular\n\nSo Row 1 is triangular, not circular. That's a problem because the claim says it should be circular.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about the warning sign being circular, so I need to check if the warning sign (Row 1) has shape as circular. But according to the table, Row 1's shape is triangular. So that doesn't match the claim.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in assigning rows. Let me list them again:\n\nRow 1: type - warning, shape - triangular\n\nSo yes, Row 1's shape is triangular, which contradicts the claim stating it's circular.\n\nSo, since one of the attributes (shape) doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let's check all attributes to be thorough.\n\nBorder color for the warning sign: Row 1 says border is red. The claim mentions a red border, so that matches.\n\nBackground colour: Row 1 is yellow. The claim doesn't specify background, so it doesn't matter here.\n\nText/symbol: black in Row 1. Claim says black text, which matches.\n\nSo the shape is the only attribute conflicting with the claim. Since shape is crucial, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe warning sign's shape is triangular according to the table, not circular as stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"shape\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So I need to find the row where the type is \"warning.\" Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Type is warning. Got it.\n\nNow, let's check the other details mentioned in the claim.

Its shape is triangular, so that's not circular. The border for the warning sign is red, but since its shape isn't circular, this part of the claim might partially hold but the first part doesn't.\n\nRow 2 is about the prohibition sign. It has a circular shape and a red border. So, both aspects of the claim apply to this one.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim against the relevant rows:\n\n1. **Warning Sign**: From Row 1, the type is warning, shape is triangular, not circular. So, the warning sign doesn't meet the \"circular\" part of the claim.\n\n2. **Prohibition Sign**: From Row 2, the type is prohibition, shape is circular, and border is red. This matches both parts of the claim for the prohibition sign.\n\nThe claim says both signs are circular with a red border.
