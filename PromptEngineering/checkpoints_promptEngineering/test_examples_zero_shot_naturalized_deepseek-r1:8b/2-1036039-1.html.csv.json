    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the result of the 1990 world cup qualify competition be 1 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row has date, venue, score, result, and competition. The claim refers to a specific competition, so I need to find which rows match that.\n\nThe competitions listed are:\n- 1986 world cup qualifying\n- 1990 world cup qualifying\n- friendly (no year specified)\n- 1990 world cup\n- friendly again in 1995\n\nThe claim mentions \"1990 world cup qualify competition.\" Wait, there's a typo in the claim. It says \"qualify\" instead of \"qualifying,\" but looking at the table, the closest match is the competition name: 1990 world cup qualifying and 1990 world cup.\n\nI need to check for both because the claim might be referring to either one. Let me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: date May 19, 1985, venue Torrance, score 1-0, result 1-0, competition 1986 world cup qualifying. This is for 1986, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2: November 19, 1989, Port of Spain, score 1-0, result 1-0, competition 1990 world cup qualifying. So this row has the competition name matching part of the claim. The score is 1-0 and the result is also 1-0.\n\nRow 3: March 10, 1990, Tampa, score 1-0, result 2-1, competition friendly. Not relevant since it's a friendly match, not a World Cup qualifying or final.\n\nRow 4: June 10, 1990, Florence, score 1-3, result 1-5, competition 1990 world cup. Here, the competition is different; it's the actual World Cup, not the qualifying round.\n\nRow 5: May 28, 1995, Tampa, score 1-1, result 1-2, competition friendly. Not relevant.\n\nSo, the claim mentions \"1990 world cup qualify competition.\" The correct term might be \"qualifying,\" but assuming it's a typo and refers to the World Cup qualifying. In row 2, the result is 1-0, which matches the score and result given in the claim.\n\nHowever, I should check if the claim exactly states the result as 1-0 for that competition. The claim says \"result of the 1990 world cup qualify competition be 1 - 0.\" So yes, row 2's result is 1-0.\n\nBut wait, the user might have meant the final match. Row 4 has the 1990 World Cup with a score of 1-3 and result 1-5. That's the actual final, not the qualifying round. So if the claim refers to the qualifying competition, row 2 is correct. If it's referring to the finals, then no.\n\nBut since the claim says \"qualify,\" I think it's about the qualifying stage, which would be row 2. Therefore, the result is indeed 1-0, supporting the claim as TRUE.\n\nI need to identify the relevant cells. The columns are date, venue, score, result, competition. For row 2, the relevant columns are score and result because those directly show the 1-0 outcome. So I'll list both for relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2 where the score and result both show a 1-0 outcome in the 1990 World Cup qualifying competition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"the score of the match in torrance , california be 1 - 0.\"\n\nI'll start by analyzing each row of the table to see if any match the criteria mentioned in the claim. The claim is specifically looking for a match that took place in Torrance, California with a score of 1-0.\n\nLooking at Row 1: \n- Date: May 19, 1985\n- Venue: Torrance, California\n- Score: 1 - 0\n\nThis row seems to directly match the claim's criteria. The venue is Torrance, California, and the score is indeed 1-0.\n\nI should verify if there are any other rows that might also fit, but from a quick glance, the other rows have different venues or scores. For example, Row 2 is in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, with a score of 1-0, but since the venue doesn't match, it's not relevant here.\n\nRows 3 to 5 don't have Torrance as the venue, so they can be disregarded for this claim.\n\nSo, only Row 1 is relevant. The columns involved are \"date,\" \"venue,\" and \"score.\" However, since we're focusing on verifying the score in Torrance, California, the \"score\" column is directly relevant, along with the \"venue.\"\n\nWait, but the instructions mention that I need to list the relevant cells based on the claim's check. The claim checks two things: venue and score. So both \"venue\" and \"score\" columns for Row 1 are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells should include both the row index (0) and the column names (\"venue\" and \"score\") for that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 1 where the venue is Torrance, California, and the score is 1-0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the 1990 world cup competition be held at a venue in tampa florida.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if there's any information that matches the claim. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: May 19, 1985, Torrance, California. The score is 1-0 and result is 1-0 for the 1986 World Cup qualifying. That doesn't seem relevant because it's not about the 1990 World Cup and it's in California, not Florida.\n\nRow 2: November 19, 1989, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Score 1-0, result same, competition is 1990 World Cup qualifying. Again, it's a qualifying match but in Trinidad, so not the main 1990 World Cup or held in Tampa.\n\nRow 3: March 10, 1990, Tampa, Florida. The score is 1-0, result is 2-1, competition is friendly. So this is a friendly match in Tampa, Florida, but it's not the World Cup. The claim mentions the World Cup, so maybe this isn't directly relevant, but the venue is Tampa.\n\nRow 4: June 10, 1990, Florence, Italy. Score 1-3, result 1-5, competition is 1990 World Cup. This is the actual World Cup match held in Florence, not Tampa.\n\nRow 5: May 28, 1995, Tampa, Florida. Score 1-1, result 1-2, competition friendly again. So this is another friendly match in Tampa but not related to the World Cup.\n\nNow, looking at each row, none of them are the 1990 World Cup held in Tampa. The only time Tampa is mentioned is in Row 3 (a friendly) and Row 5 (another friendly), both before and after the World Cup in question. \n\nThe claim specifically mentions that the 1990 World Cup was held in Tampa, but according to the table, it wasn't. It was actually in Florence. So the claim is false because there's no row where the competition is the 1990 World Cup and venue is Tampa Florida.\n\nI should also check which cells are relevant. Since the claim mentions both \"1990 world cup\" and \"venue: tampa florida,\" I need to look for those columns. In each row, the columns are date, venue, score, result, competition.\n\nSo for the 1990 World Cup, that would be where competition is '1990 world cup' and venue is 'tampa florida'. But looking through all rows, none have both those conditions. So only if such a row existed it could support the claim. Since it doesn't, the answer is false, and no relevant cells because none of them match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the 1990 world cup qualify game hold in california be on november 19\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three main things: the event (1990 World Cup qualifying game), the location (California), and the date (November 19). \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. My goal is to find if there's a game in California on November 19, 1989 (since that's when November 19 would fall in 1990? Wait, actually, let me check the dates again.\n\nWait, the claim says \"November 19\", but I need to see if such a date exists in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: May 19, 1985 \u2013 not November.\nRow 2: November 19, 1989 \u2013 this is November 19, 1989, which is within the context of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup. So that's a possible match because it's November 19 and part of World Cup qualifying.\n\nBut wait, the date in the claim is \"November 19\", but I need to check if it refers to the same year as the competition. The competition for Row 2 is 1990 World Cup qualifying, so the game was indeed part of that process. \n\nNext, the location: venue in Row 2 is Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. So the claim says \"in California\", which doesn't match because this game was in Trinidad. Therefore, even though the date and competition might align, the location does not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be referring to a different game with the same date but a different year. Wait, November 19, 1989 is the only November 19 in the table, and it's not in California. There are other games in California: Row 1 is May 19, 1985 in Torrance, which was for 1986 World Cup qualifying. Then there's Row 3 on March 10, 1990 in Tampa, Florida; Row 4 June 10, 1990 in Florence, Italy; and Row 5 May 28, 1995 in Tampa again.\n\nSo the only game that is a World Cup qualifying match with the date November 19 is in Port of Spain. Therefore, the claim's assertion about California doesn't hold because the venue isn't there. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"the 1990 world cup qualify game hold in california be on november 19.\" So it's looking for a game that was both in California and on November 19. But none of the games in the table from 1990 are in California except Row 4 is June 10, 1990 in Florence, Italy\u2014no, wait, no, Row 1 is May 19, 1985 in Torrance, which is California, but that's for 1986 qualifying. So if someone refers to November 19, 1989 as a World Cup qualifying game, it would be incorrect because that was in Trinidad.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the 1990 World Cup qualifying game wasn't held in California on November 19. It was actually in Trinidad.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a 1990 World Cup qualifying match held in California on November 19. Checking the table, there's no entry for November 19, 1990, and the only November 19, 1989, game is in Trinidad, not California.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
