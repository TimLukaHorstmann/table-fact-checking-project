    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has various rows with different riding names, candidates, genders, residences, occupations, votes, and ranks. The claim specifically says: \"selkirk - interlake be the rid for the candidate patricia cordner who gain 9506 vote.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two main things: the riding name \"selkirk - interlake\" and the candidate \"patricia cordner,\" along with her votes. So I need to check if these elements match in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different riding and its corresponding candidate's information. So I should scan through each row to find where the riding is \"selkirk - interlake\" and see who the candidate there is.\n\nStarting from Row 1: riding is brandon-souris, candidate Jean Luc Bouch\u00e9. Not matching. Row 2: churchill, Fiona Shiells. No. Row 3: churchill again? Wait, no, row 3 is churchill with Niki Ashton. Row 4: dauphin-swan river-marquette, Ron Strynadka. Still not. \n\nRow 5: elmwood-transcona, Jim Maloway. Not matching. Row 6: kildonan-st paul, Ross Eadie. No. Row 7: portage-lisgar, Mohamed Alli. Row 8: provencher, Ross C Martin. Row 9: saint boniface, Matt Schaubroeck. Row 10: selkirk-interlake, Patricia Cordner. Oh, here we go! This matches the riding name in the claim.\n\nNow, checking her votes: row 10 has 9506 votes. That's exactly what the claim states. So all parts of the claim are verified by this row. There's no discrepancy or missing information; both the riding and candidate match, along with her vote count.\n\nI should also make sure there aren't any other rows that might confuse things, but since each riding is unique in the table, only row 10 matches \"selkirk - interlake\" with Patricia Cordner. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"riding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"candidate\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"votes\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
