    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"February 21 have a score of 5 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns in the table are relevant. The claim mentions February 21 and a score of 5-4. Looking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: game number, date (February), opponent, score, record, and points. \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where February 21 appears. Scrolling through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Feb 2\nRow 2: Feb 4\nRow 3: Feb 5\nRow 4: Feb 10\nRow 5: Feb 12\nRow 6: Feb 14\nRow 7: Feb 16\nRow 8: Feb 17\nRow 9: Feb 19\nRow 10: Feb 21 \u2192 This is the row we're interested in.\n\nSo, row_index 10 has February 21. Now, I need to check the score for this game. The column for the score is labeled \"score,\" which contains values like \"1 - 2\", \"5 - 1\", etc.\n\nLooking at row 10, the score is listed as \"5 - 4\". That matches exactly with the claim. Therefore, the score on February 21 is indeed 5-4.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything else, I'll double-check that there are no other rows for February 21 or similar dates. The next row after 10 is Feb 24 (row 11), so it's clear that row 10 is the only one matching February 21.\n\nSince the score in row 10 matches the claim, the statement should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim is: \"the score be 5 - 4 on February 24.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions a score of 5-4 and specifies that this happened on February 24th. So, my task is to find in the table if there's a row where the game number occurred on February 24th (or the closest equivalent) with a score of 5-4.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: game, date (in 'february'), opponent, score, record, and points. I need to focus on the 'game' column and the 'score' column for February 24th.\n\nI'll scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Game 54, February 2\n- Row 2: Game 55, February 4\n- Row 3: Game 56, February 5\n- Row 4: Game 57, February 10\n- Row 5: Game 58, February 12\n- Row 6: Game 59, February 14\n- Row 7: Game 60, February 16\n- Row 8: Game 61, February 17\n- Row 9: Game 62, February 19\n- Row 10: Game 63, February 21\n- Row 11: Game 64, February 24\n\nAh, here we go. Row 11 has the date February 24 and the game number 64. Now, let's check the score for this row. The score is listed as \"3 - 1.\" That's not 5-4.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check to make sure there isn't another game on February 24th further down. Let me look through the remaining rows:\n\n- Row 12: Game 65, February 26\n- Row 13: Game 66, February 28\n- Row 14: Game 67, February 29\n\nNo, only Row 11 is on February 24th with a score of 3-1. So the claim says the score was 5-4 on that date, but it's actually 3-1. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if any row has a score of 5-4 on February 24.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. Identify rows where the date is February 24.\n2. Examine the 'score' column for that row.\n3. Compare the found score with the claimed 5-4.\n\nOnly Row 11 matches February 24, but its score is 3-1, not 5-4.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
