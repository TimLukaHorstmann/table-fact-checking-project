    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"artist maggie toal have draw 7 for the song fee him with love.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The artist in question is Maggie Toal. From the table, I should find the row where the artist is Maggie Toal. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Artist is \"the memories\"\nRow 2: Artist is \"ann breen\"\nRow 3: Artist is \"fran meen\"\nRow 4: Artist is \"dreams\"\nRow 5: Artist is \"connor stevens\"\nRow 6: Artist is \"linda martin and friends\"\nRow 7: Artist is \"maggie toal\" \u2013 found this at row index 7.\nRow 8: Artist is \"liam reilly\"\n\nSo, the artist Maggie Toal is in row 7. Now, check if draw number is 7 for her. In row 7, 'draw' is 7, so that matches.\n\nNext part of the claim: the song. The song is \"fee him with love.\" Looking at the 'song' column for row 7: it's \"feed him with love.\" Wait, the claim says \"fee\" while the table has \"feed.\" I need to check if these are the same or different. They seem like variations of each other. Maybe it's a typo in one of them. Let me compare the words:\n\n\"Fee\" versus \"Feed\": Fee is more like a verb meaning to give money, but here it's part of a song title. \"feed\" is a verb meaning to provide food, but in this context, it's likely a song title. So perhaps the claim has a typo and meant \"feed,\" matching row 7.\n\nPoints: The table doesn't mention points for the song; it only mentions points per entry. Since the claim isn't about points, I don't need to check that column.\n\nPlace is also not mentioned in the claim, so that's irrelevant here.\n\nPutting it all together: Artist Maggie Toal has draw number 7 and the song \"feed him with love,\" which seems to match the claim despite the possible typo. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
