    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"On December 23, T.J. Ford was the highest scorer with 24 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to December 23. Looking at the table, each row has a 'date' column. Row 13 has the date December 23. So, that's row_index 13.\n\nNext, in row 13, I need to check the columns related to scoring. The relevant columns are 'high points'. In this row, the high points are listed as \"t j ford (24)\". That matches the claim exactly: T.J. Ford scored 24 points on December 23.\n\nI should also verify if there's any other column that might affect this, but since the claim is specifically about scoring and only mentions T.J. Ford, I don't need to look at assists or rebounds unless they could influence scoring, which they don't. So, the key cell is the 'high points' in row 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row 13, specifically the \"high points\" column where T.J. Ford scored 24 points on December 23.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"for game on december 20 , the high point get more than 25\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row corresponds to December 20. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Dec 1\nRow 2: Dec 2\n...\nRow 12: Dec 22\nWait, actually, looking again, the rows are from game 16 up to game 30. Let me list them with their dates:\n\nRow 0: Dec 1\nRow 1: Dec 2\nRow 2: Dec 6\nRow 3: Dec 8\nRow 4: Dec 10\nRow 5: Dec 11\nRow 6: Dec 13\nRow 7: Dec 15\nRow 8: Dec 17\nRow 9: Dec 19\nRow 10: Dec 20\nRow 11: Dec 22\nRow 12: Dec 23\nRow 13: Dec 27\nRow 14: Dec 29\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the games:\n\nGame numbers go from 16 to 30, so each row is game 16, 17,... up to 30. The dates are provided as December 1, then December 2, etc. So let's list them properly.\n\nRow 0: Game 16 - Dec 1\nRow 1: Game 17 - Dec 2\nRow 2: Game 18 - Dec 6\nRow 3: Game 19 - Dec 8\nRow 4: Game 20 - Dec 10\nRow 5: Game 21 - Dec 11\nRow 6: Game 22 - Dec 13\nRow 7: Game 23 - Dec 15\nRow 8: Game 24 - Dec 17\nRow 9: Game 25 - Dec 19\nRow 10: Game 26 - Dec 20\nRow 11: Game 27 - Dec 22\nRow 12: Game 28 - Dec 23\nRow 13: Game 29 - Dec 27\nRow 14: Game 30 - Dec 29\n\nSo December 20 is game 26, which is Row 10.\n\nNow, I need to check what the high points were for game 26 (Row 10). The columns relevant here are \"high points\".\n\nLooking at Row 10, under \"high points\": it says \"t j ford (23)\". So the highest scorer in that game had 23 points. \n\nThe claim is whether the high point was more than 25. Since 23 is less than 25, this would make the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about December 20's high points exceeding 25, we identified the relevant row and checked the high points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
