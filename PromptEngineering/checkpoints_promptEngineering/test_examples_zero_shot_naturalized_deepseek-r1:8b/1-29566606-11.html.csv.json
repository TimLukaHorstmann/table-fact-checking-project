    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says, \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a different programme with several columns: programme name, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, and new channel(s). My focus is on whether \"art attack\" was originally broadcast on CITV.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row in the table corresponds to \"art attack.\" Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: programme: celebrity big brother\nRow 2: programme: big brother\nRow 3: programme: absolutely fabulous\nRow 4: programme: art attack\nRow 5: programme: born to be different\n\nSo, Row 4 is the one for \"art attack.\" Now, I need to look at the original channel(s) column for this row. According to the table, the original channel for \"art attack\" is CITV.\n\nThe claim says that \"art attack was originally broadcast on CITV,\" which matches exactly with what's in the table. There's no conflicting information or other dates that would suggest otherwise. The only other information provided is about the removal and return dates, but those don't pertain to the original channel.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data as \"art attack\" was originally broadcast on CITV.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original channel(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"big brother will return on september 9 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that \"big brother\" returns on September 9, 2011. Now, I need to check if this information is present in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has several columns: programme, date of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, and new channel(s). My focus here is the \"programme\" column because the claim is about a specific show (\"big brother\") returning on a specific date. \n\nLet me check each row to see if any mention \"big brother\". Row 1 talks about \"celebrity big brother\", which is a spin-off, so that's not the main show. Row 2 has \"big brother\" as the programme. That seems relevant. So I'll focus on Row 2.\n\nIn Row 2, under \"date of return,\" it says September 9, 2011. That matches exactly with the claim, which mentions a return date of September 9, 2011 for big brother. \n\nNow, I need to confirm if this is indeed correct. The original removal date for \"big brother\" in Row 2 was September 10, 2010 on Channel 4, and it returned on September 9, 2011 on Channel 5. So the return date matches the claim.\n\nI should also check other rows to ensure there's no conflicting information, but Row 2 seems to be the only one with \"big brother\" as the programme. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by looking at the table and understanding each row, especially focusing on the relevant information for the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the programme is \"born to be different.\" From the table, I see that Row 5 corresponds to this programme. Now, I need to check when it was removed and when it returned.\n\nLooking at Row 5, the date of original removal has multiple entries: 2004, 13 September 2007, and 5 May 2009. Since the return date is what's in question, I'll focus on that. The date of return for \"born to be different\" is listed as 9 June 2011.\n\nThe claim states that it will return on August 18, 2011. Comparing these dates, June 9th is earlier than August 18th. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the actual return date was in June, not August.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect this conclusion. For example, looking at the new channel for \"born to be different,\" it says \"n/a (same channel as original),\" which means it returned on the same channel, but since the return date is different from what's claimed, that doesn't change the fact that the date in the claim is wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because the show actually returned earlier than August 18, 2011.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011.\" However, according to the table, it returned on June 9, 2011. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date of return\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
