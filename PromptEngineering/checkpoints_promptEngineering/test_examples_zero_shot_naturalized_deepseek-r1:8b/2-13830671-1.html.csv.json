    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"there be game with a score of 0 - 0 held on july 22, july 29, july 30, and august 6.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions four specific dates where a game ended with a 0-0 score. My task is to check the table for any games that fit these criteria on those dates.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, home team, score (home - away), away team, venue, crowd, and report. I'm interested in the 'score' column because it indicates whether a game ended with a 0-0 result.\n\nI'll go through each date mentioned in the claim one by one:\n\n1. **July 22**: Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 6 has date: July 22. The score is 0 - 0 for Central Coast Mariners against Adelaide United at Wade Park with a crowd of 4344 (Orange). This matches both the date and the score.\n\n2. **July 29**: Looking for July 29, I find Row 9 which is on that date. The score here is 0 - 0 between New Zealand Knights and Sydney FC at North Harbour Stadium with 3121 attendees. So another match with a 0-0 score.\n\n3. **July 30**: This date corresponds to Row 12, where Perth Glory plays Adelaide United with a score of 0 - 0 at Dorrien Gardens, attended by 3038 (West Perth). This is the third game that ended in a draw.\n\n4. **August 6**: The last date in the claim is August 6. Checking the table, Row 15 has this date where Queensland Roar and Central Coast Mariners played a 0 - 0 game at Clive Burghofer Stadium with 4571 people from Toowoomba. This matches as well.\n\nSince all four dates have games with a score of 0-0 in the table, the claim is supported by these entries. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking against the given table. The claim says, \"Home team melbourne victory have a score of 1 - 3 on july 29.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions three key things: the home team is Melbourne Victory, the score is 1-3, and the date is July 29.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find any row that matches all these criteria. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 10: Date is 29 July. Home team is Melbourne Victory with a score of 1 - 3 against Central Coast Mariners at Olympic Park in Melbourne. The crowd is 6593, and the report is negative. This row exactly matches all parts of the claim. \n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might also fit, but upon reviewing each row, only Row 10 fits the date, home team, score, and the away team isn't specified in the claim, so it's irrelevant here. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"sydney lose to perth\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means. It says Sydney lost a match against Perth. So I'm looking for instances where Sydney FC (the home team) played against Perth Glory and lost.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to find any matches involving these two teams. \n\nLooking at Row 1: Home team is Central Coast Mariners, away is Perth Glory. Score is 2-1. So Perth won this game. But Sydney isn't involved here.\n\nRow 2: Queensland Roar vs Sydney FC. Score is 1-2, so Sydney won. Not relevant for our claim.\n\nRow 3: Melbourne Victory vs Adelaide United. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: New Zealand Knights vs Newcastle Jets. No.\n\nRow 5: Sydney FC vs Newcastle Jets. Score is 2-1, Sydney won. Not what we're looking for.\n\nRow 6: Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United. Perth isn't here.\n\nRow 7: Perth Glory vs Melbourne Victory. Score is 1-1. So it's a draw. Doesn't count as a loss.\n\nRow 8: Queensland Roar vs New Zealand Knights. No relevant teams.\n\nRow 9: New Zealand Knights vs Sydney FC. The score is 0-0, so it's a draw. Not a loss for Sydney.\n\nRow 10: Melbourne Victory vs Central Coast Mariners. No.\n\nRow 11: Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar. No relevant teams.\n\nRow 12: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United. Again, a draw.\n\nMoving on to August:\n\nRow 13: Adelaide United vs New Zealand Knights. Not relevant.\n\nRow 14: Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory. No.\n\nRow 15: Queensland Roar vs Central Coast Mariners. No.\n\nRow 16: Sydney FC vs Perth Glory. The score here is 3-0. So Sydney won this game, not lost.\n\nSo in all the matches between Sydney FC and Perth Glory in this table, Sydney either won or it was a draw. There's no instance where Sydney lost to Perth.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"sydney lose to perth\" is false because there's no match in the provided data where Sydney lost to Perth.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the score be 1 - 3 on 22 july.\" So I need to look through the table provided and check if there's a match for this score on July 22nd.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to find the date \"22 july\" because that's when the event in question happened. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: 15th July\n- Row 2: 15th July\n- Row 3: 16th July\n- Row 4: 16th July\n- Row 5: 22nd July\n- Row 6: 22nd July\n- Row 7: 22nd July\n- Row 8: 22nd July\n- Row 9: 29th July\n- Row 10: 29th July\n- Row 11: 29th July\n- Row 12: 30th July\n- Row 13: 4th August\n- Row 14: 5th August\n- Row 15: 6th August\n- Row 16: 6th August\n\nSo the relevant rows are Rows 5, 6, 7, and 8 for the date \"22 july.\"\n\nNow, I need to check each of these rows to see if any have a score of 1 - 3.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"melbourne victory home team have the score 2 - 3\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim means. The home team in question here is Melbourne Victory. The claim says their score is 2-3. So I need to check if there's a row in the table where the home team is Melbourne Victory and their score is 2-3.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows from Row 1 to Row 16. Each row lists the date, home team, away team, score, venue, crowd, and report. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match the criteria. Starting from Row 1: Home team is Central Coast Mariners. Not Melbourne Victory, so skip. Row 2: Queensland Roar vs Sydney FC. No. Row3: Melbourne Victory as home team. Their score is 0-1 against Adelaide United. That's not 2-3. So, moving on.\n\nRow4: New Zealand Knights vs Newcastle Jets. Home team isn't Melbourne Victory. Next, Row5: Sydney FC vs Newcastle Jets. Not relevant. Row6: Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United. No match. Row7: Perth Glory vs Melbourne Victory. Their score is 1-1. Still not what we're looking for.\n\nRow8: Queensland Roar vs New Zealand Knights. No. Row9: New Zealand Knights vs Sydney FC. Not related. Row10: Melbourne Victory's home game with Central Coast Mariners, score 1-3. That's different from the claim. So still no match.\n\nWait, actually in Row10, Melbourne Victory is the away team. The home team is Central Coast Mariners. So that doesn't fit either because the claim says Melbourne Victory is the home team.\n\nContinuing: Row11: Newcastle Jets vs Queensland Roar. No. Row12: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United. Not relevant. Row13: Adelaide United vs New Zealand Knights. Home team is Adelaide, so no. \n\nRow14: Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory. Here, Newcastle Jets are the away team and Melbourne Victory is the home team? Wait, looking at the table, Row14 says \"newcastle jets\" as away team, so the home team is Melbourne Victory. The score in that row is 2-3, which matches the claim.\n\nWait no, let me check again: Row14's date is 5 August, home team is Newcastle Jets? No, wait. Let me clarify. Each row lists \"home team\" and \"away team\". So in Row14, the home team is Newcastle Jets because it says \"newcastle jets, score: 2 - 3, away team: melbourne victory...\". Wait no, actually looking at the table, I might have misread.\n\nWait, the claim says \"melbourne victory home team have the score 2 - 3\". So in the table, we need a row where the home team is Melbourne Victory and their score is 2-3. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking again: \n\nRow10: Home team is Central Coast Mariners vs Melbourne Victory (away). Score 1-3.\n\nRow14: Home team is Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory (away). Score 2-3.\n\nSo in Row14, the home team is Newcastle Jets, away team is Melbourne Victory. So that doesn't fit because the claim says Melbourne Victory is the home team.\n\nWait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me read each row carefully:\n\nRow10: date:29 july, home team: melbourne victory, score:1 - 3... No, wait: No, Row10 says \"home team: newcastle jets, score:0 - 0...\" Wait no, looking at the original table again.\n\nWait in the table provided by the user, I think there might be confusion because of how it's written. Let me parse each row correctly:\n\nLooking back, the user wrote the table as:\n\nRow1: date:15july, home team:central coast mariners, score:2-1, away team:perth glory... etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo in Row10: date:29 july, home team: melbourne victory, score:1 - 3, away team: central coast mariners. So here, the home team is Melbourne Victory with a score of 1-3.\n\nBut the claim says that Melbourne Victory's home game was 2-3.\n\nSo looking for a row where home team is Melbourne Victory and score is 2-3. Let me check each occurrence:\n\nRow10: Melbourne Victory as home, 1-3.\n\nRow14: Home team is Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory (away), with score 2-3.\n\nWait, so in Row14, the away team is Melbourne Victory, but their score is 2-3 against Newcastle Jets. So from the perspective of Melbourne Victory, they were the away team and scored 2 goals, while the home team Newcastle Jets scored 3. But that's not the same as being the home team with a score of 2-3.\n\nSo the claim says \"melbourne victory home team have the score 2 - 3\", meaning they are at home and their score is 2-3.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow10: Melbourne Victory is home, but score is 1-3. \n\nIs there any row where home team is Melbourne Victory and score is 2-3?\n\nLet me check the other rows again quickly.\n\nRow15 onwards? Wait, the table only goes up to Row16. Let me see if I missed any:\n\nLooking at Row13: Home team Adelaide United vs New Zealand Knights. No.\n\nRow14: Home team Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory (away). So that's 2-3 in favor of Newcastle Jets.\n\nRow15: date:6august... Not provided, but the user only gave up to Row16, which is \"newcastle jets, away team: melbourne victory...\" Wait no, I think the table given by the user goes from Row1 to Row16. So let me check if any row has Melbourne Victory as home with 2-3.\n\nI don't see such a row. The only time Melbourne Victory is the home team is in Row10 and perhaps others, but none of their scores are 2-3. In fact, in Row10 they scored 1-3.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine each occurrence where Melbourne Victory is the home team:\n\nLooking at the rows, after Row10:\n\nRow14: Home team Newcastle Jets vs Melbourne Victory (away), score 2-3.\n\nSo from Melbourne Victory's perspective, in that game, they were away and scored 2, but the claim says they were home with a score of 2-3. So it doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, there is no row where Melbourne Victory is the home team with a score of 2-3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row14: \n\ndate:5august, home team:newcastle jets, away team:melbourne victory, score:2 - 3.\n\nSo in this case, Newcastle Jets scored 2 goals and Melbourne Victory scored 3? Wait, no: the score is 2-3. So if it's written as \"score:2 - 3\", that would mean Newcastle Jets (home) scored 2, and Melbourne Victory (away) scored 3.\n\nWait, but usually in sports, higher score means they won. So if the home team scored 2 and away scored 3, then the result is a win for the away team.\n\nBut regardless of the result, the claim is about the home team's score being 2-3.\n\nSo in this case, Melbourne Victory was the away team with a score of 3, but the home team Newcastle Jets had 2. So it doesn't fit because the claim specifies that Melbourne Victory is the home team.\n\nTherefore, looking through all rows, I don't see any where Melbourne Victory is the home team with a score of 2-3. The closest is when they were away and scored 3, but as the away team.\n\nSo based on this, the claim would be false because there's no row in the table where Melbourne Victory is listed as the home team with a score of 2-3 against their opponent.\n</think>\n\n{\"response\": {\"status\": \"false\", \"reason\": \"There is no entry in the table where 'melbourne victory' is listed as the home team with a score of 2 - 3.\"}}",
