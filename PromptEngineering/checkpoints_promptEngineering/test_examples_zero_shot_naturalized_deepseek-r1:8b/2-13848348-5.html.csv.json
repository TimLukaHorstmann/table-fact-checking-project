    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the attendance on April 29 being 49,194 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each corresponding to a date in April. Each row lists several details: the opponent team, the score of the game, the loss (including who pitched and the score), attendance, and the team's record after that game.\n\nThe claim in question is specifically about the attendance for April 29 being 49,194. So my task is to find out if this specific number appears under the \"attendance\" column on that particular date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"date\" and then various other columns. I'll need to scan through each row until I find the one where the date is April 29. Once I locate that row, I can check the attendance number listed there.\n\nI notice that the dates start from April 1 up to April 30. So I'll go through them one by one. Let me see:\n\n- Row 1: April 1\n- ...\n- Continuing this way until I reach Row 29: April 30.\n\nWait, let's make it more efficient. Since I'm looking for April 29, I can count up to row 28 or 29. Let me check each row's date.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 27: April 28\nRow 28: April 29\nRow 29: April 30\n\nYes, so Row 28 is April 29. Now, I need to see what the attendance number is for that row.\n\nIn Row 28, the opponent is Tigers, the score is 6 - 4, loss by Hughes with a record of 14 - 14. The key here is the attendance column. According to the table, it's listed as 49,194.\n\nSo the claim says \"the attendance for April 29 be 49194\". From the table, that exact number appears under the attendance column on April 29. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map out which cells in the table are relevant. Each row has multiple columns: date, opponent, score, loss details, attendance, and record. The relevant cell for the attendance would be the \"attendance\" column in Row 28 (since that's April 29).\n\nSo the relevant_cells list should include only the cell from Row 28 where the column is \"attendance\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the attendance on April 29 being 49,194 is correct, I need to check the specific cell in the table. \n\n1. **Locate the Correct Date**: April 29 corresponds to row index 28.\n2. **Check Attendance Column**: In row 28, the attendance is listed as 49,194.\n\nSince this matches the claim exactly, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cell is identified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about the attendance on April 9 being 19007 is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the one that corresponds to April 9. The table has multiple rows with dates, so I need to scan them to identify which row is for April 9.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n- Row 1: April 1\n- Row 2: April 2\n- ...\n- Row 8: April 8\n- Row 9: April 9\n\nSo, row 9 is the one we need. Now, I'll check the \"attendance\" column for this specific row.\n\nIn row 9, under the attendance column, it's listed as 19007. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, since the attendance on April 9 is indeed 19007, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the attendance for april 29 be less than 49194\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. Each row represents a game on a specific date, with several attributes: date, opponent, score, loss (with pitcher details), attendance, and record. My focus here is on the \"attendance\" column for April 29.\n\nThe claim states that the attendance was less than 49,194 on April 29. So, I need to find the row corresponding to April 29 and check its attendance number.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"date\" field. Scanning through the dates provided:\n\nRow 1: April 1\nRow 2: April 2\n...\nRow 27: April 28\nRow 28: April 29\n\nSo, April 29 is Row 28. Now, I'll check what the attendance was for that row. According to the table, on April 29, the attendance was 49,194.\n\nThe claim says \"less than 49,194.\" Since 49,194 is equal to the actual attendance, it's not less than. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should identify which cell exactly this refers to. The relevant column is \"attendance,\" and the row index for April 29 is 28.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about the attendance on April 29 being less than 49,194 is TRUE or FALSE, I'll locate the specific data in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: April 29 corresponds to Row 28.\n2. **Check the \"attendance\" column for Row 28**: The value is 49,194.\n3. **Compare with the claim**: The attendance (49,194) is not less than 49,194; it's equal.\n\nSince the actual attendance matches the threshold exactly, the claim that it was less is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"April 8 have the highest attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The date mentioned is April 8th. The claim says that on this date, the attendance was the highest compared to other dates in the table. So my task is to check all the rows for the \"attendance\" column and see if April 8 has the maximum value.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific date with various details, including opponent, score, loss (if any), attendance, and the team's record after that game. The \"attendance\" numbers vary from row to row.\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the attendance number:\n\n- April 1: 55,112\n- April 2: 48,544\n- April 3: 47,785\n- April 4: 49,255\n- April 5: 52,247\n- April 6: 51,279\n- April 7: 41,302\n- April 8: 37,296\n- April 9: 19,007\n- April 10: 16,143\n- April 11: 37,624\n- April 12: 37,461\n- April 13: 37,876\n- April 14: 18,872\n- April 15: 20,923\n- April 16: 54,667\n- April 17: 55,088\n- April 18: 40,653\n- April 19: 41,776\n- April 20: 37,501\n- April 22: 25,012\n- April 23: 27,751\n- April 24: 27,243\n- April 25: 31,467\n- April 26: 35,765\n- April 27: 31,598\n- April 28: 20,689\n- April 29: 49,194\n- April 30: 49,513\n\nNow, I need to find the highest attendance. Let me list them in order:\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\nThe highest I see are around 55k. April 1 has 55,112 and April 17 has 55,088. Are there any higher? Let's check each number.\n\n- April 5: 52,247\n- April 6: 51,279\n- April 16: 54,667\n- April 30: 49,513\n\nWait, April 1 is the highest at 55,112. April 17 is next with 55,088, which is slightly lower but close.\n\nSo, the maximum attendance in the table is on April 1 at 55,112. Now, checking April 8th's attendance: it's 37,296, which is much lower than the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"April 8 have the highest attendance\" is FALSE because another date (April 1) has a higher attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the highest attendance was on April 1, not April 8. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
