The claim is: \"during the johnson v moraga event there be 2.4 million viewer.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the one that matches this event and viewership. Let me go step by step.\n\nRow 1: The event is just listed as \"event,\" so not relevant.\nRow 2: Event is \"velasquez vs dos santos\" \u2013 no match.\nRow 3: Event is \"evans vs davis\" \u2013 still not matching.\nRow 4: \"diaz vs miller\" \u2013 not the one in question.\nRow 5: \"shogun vs vera\" \u2013 no match either.\nRow 6: \"henderson vs diaz\" \u2013 also not relevant.\nRow 7: \"johnson vs dodson\" \u2013 getting closer, but not our event.\nRow 8: \"henderson vs melendez\" \u2013 still not matching.\nRow 9: Finally, the event is \"johnson vs moraga.\" This matches the claim's event.\n\nNow, looking at the viewers column for this row. The viewers are listed as 2.4 million. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant rows, but none of them match both the event name and the viewership number. So only Row 9 is relevant here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches exactly with the viewers for the \"johnson vs moraga\" event in Row 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"At the Johnson v Dodson event, the rating be 2.4.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to the Johnson vs Dodson event. Let me look at each row's event name.\n\nRow 1: It just says 'event' without a specific name.\nRow 2: \"velasquez vs dos santos\"\nRow 3: \"evans vs davis\"\nRow 4: \"diaz vs miller\"\nRow 5: \"shogun vs vera\"\nRow 6: \"henderson vs diaz\"\nRow 7: \"johnson vs dodson\" \u2013 This is the event we're interested in.\nRow 8: \"henderson vs melendez\"\nRow 9: \"johnson vs moraga\"\n\nSo, Row 7 is the correct row for the Johnson v Dodson event.\n\nNext, I need to check what the rating for that event is. Looking at Row 7's data:\n\n- Event: johnson vs dodson\n- Date: january 26 , 2013\n- Rating: 2.4\n\nThe claim says the rating is 2.4, which matches exactly with this row's rating.\n\nSo, the claim is fully supported by the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the Shogun vs Vera event is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nThe claim says: \"At the Shogun v Vera event, the rating was 1.4 and the viewer was 2.4 million.\" I need to check each part of this claim against the corresponding data in the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant row and column for the Shogun vs Vera event. Scanning through the table's events:\n\n- Row 1: event: event\n- Row 2: velasquez vs dos santos\n- Row 3: evans vs davis\n- Row 4: diaz vs miller\n- Row 5: shogun vs vera\n- So, the fifth row is the Shogun vs Vera event.\n\nNow, looking at the columns in each row. The relevant data points mentioned in the claim are \"rating\" and \"viewers.\" In the table's header, these correspond to the third and fourth columns respectively (since it's a naturalized format, each row has event, date, rating, share, viewers).\n\nSo, I need to check both the rating and the viewers for Row 5. Let's see:\n\nRow 5: event: shogun vs vera, date: august 4, 2012, rating: 1.4, share: 3, viewers: 2.4 million.\n\nComparing this with the claim:\n\n- Rating is indeed 1.4.\n- Viewers are 2.4 million.\n\nBoth match exactly. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The claim mentions \"the rating be 1.4 and the viewer be 2.4 million.\" Yes, in Row 5, both these numbers are present as 1.4 for rating and 2.4 million for viewers.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or missing information here.

The claim is: \"the johnson v moraga event schedule for july 27 , 2013 have a rating of 1.5\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify the relevant rows and columns in the table that might contain information about this claim. The table has nine rows, each corresponding to a different event with details like event name, date, rating, share, and viewers.\n\nThe claim mentions \"johnson v moraga\" as the event. Looking through the table, I need to find which row corresponds to this event. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 2: velasquez vs dos santos\nRow 3: evans vs davis\nRow 4: diaz vs miller\nRow 5: shogun vs vera\nRow 6: henderson vs diaz\nRow 7: johnson vs dodson\nRow 8: henderson vs melendez\nRow 9: johnson vs moraga\n\nSo, row 9 is the one that matches \"johnson vs moraga\". Now, looking at the date for this event, it's July 27, 2013. The claim also specifies the date as July 27, 2013, so that part matches.\n\nNext, I need to check the rating column for this event. In row 9, under \"rating\", it says 1.5. That's exactly what the claim is stating\u2014the rating is 1.5.\n\nSo, both the event name and date in the claim match the corresponding row and data in the table, specifically the rating being 1.5. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by matching the event details in row 9 of the table, confirming the rating is indeed 1.5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rating\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"there be 4.4 million viewers on December 8, 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any match this claim. Each row has an event, date, rating, share, and viewers. \n\nLet's go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Doesn't seem relevant because it's about a general event without specific details.\nRow 2: Event is Velasquez vs Dos Santos on November 12, 2011. The date here is November, so not December.\nRow 3: January 28, 2012. Not December.\nRow 4: May 5, 2012. Not December.\nRow 5: August 4, 2012. Also not December.\nRow 6: December 8, 2012. This matches the date in the claim. Let's check the viewers for this row. It says 4.4 million. That's exactly what the claim states.\nRow 7: January 26, 2013. Not relevant as it's a different year and month.\nRow 8: April 20, 2013. Doesn't match.\nRow 9: July 27, 2013. Also doesn't match.\n\nSo, only Row 6 has the date December 8, 2012 with viewers being 4.4 million. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row. \n\nI should also note that the claim specifies \"there be\" which implies existence rather than a specific event or something else.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that the number of viewers for the event \"Johnson vs Moraga\" is more than 3 million. So, my task is to find the relevant data from the table that pertains to this event and check its viewership.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different event with details like date, rating, share, and viewers. I need to identify which row corresponds to \"Johnson vs Moraga.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Velasquez vs Dos Santos (November 12, 2011)\n- Row 3: Evans vs Davis (January 28, 2012)\n- Row 4: Diaz vs Miller (May 5, 2012)\n- Row 5: Shogun vs Vera (August 4, 2012)\n- Row 6: Henderson vs Diaz (December 8, 2012)\n- Row 7: Johnson vs Dodson (January 26, 2013)\n- Row 8: Henderson vs Melendez (April 20, 2013)\n- Row 9: Johnson vs Moraga (July 27, 2013)\n\nSo, the event in question is in Row 9. Now, I need to check the \"viewers\" column for this row. According to the table, the viewership for this event is 2.4 million.\n\nThe claim says that the viewers are \"above 3 million.\" Since 2.4 million is less than 3 million, this would mean the claim is FALSE.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm considering all relevant cells.

Each row represents a different event with details like event name, date, rating, share, and viewers.

Viewers > 4.2 million\n\nLooking at Row 7's details:\n- rating: 2.4\n- viewers: 4.2 million\n\nFor the first condition, the rating is exactly 2.4, not greater than 2.4. So this condition isn't met.\n\nThe second condition about viewers is exactly 4.2 million, which is equal but not more than 4.2 million.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the johnson v moraga fight take place just after july 27, 2013 and have a rating of close to 1.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the event that matches \"Johnson vs Moraga\" in the table. Scanning through each row, I see Row 9 has the event as \"johnson vs moraga\" with the date \"july 27 , 2013\". So this is definitely the correct row to check.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the rating being close to 1. Looking at the 'rating' column for Row 9, it's listed as 1.5. Hmm, 1.5 isn't that close to 1, especially considering ratings might be rounded or have specific increments. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI should also check if the date is correct. The claim says \"just after july 27, 2013\", and Row 9 has exactly that date, so the timing is accurate.\n\nBut since the rating doesn't match closely to 1 as stated in the claim, the claim might be incorrect. However, I should double-check if there's another row that might fit better or if I misread something. Looking through all rows again, none other have \"Johnson vs Moraga\" except Row 9.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is false because the rating isn't close to 1; it's 1.5.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the validity of the claim, we checked for the specific event and date mentioned.

The claim says, \"the event henderson v melendez take place before april 20 , 2013.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's about an event involving Henderson vs Melendez and whether it happened before a specific date. So, my task is to find this event in the table and check its date against April 20, 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: event, date, rating, share, viewers. I'll go through each row one by one until I find the event that matches \"henderson v melendez.\"\n\nRow 1: The event is listed as a general term, not specific. So it's not the one.\n\nRow 2: Event is \"velasquez vs dos santos.\" No match.\n\nRow 3: \"evans vs davis.\" Not the one.\n\nRow 4: \"diaz vs miller.\" Nope.\n\nRow 5: \"shogun vs vera.\" Still not matching.\n\nRow 6: \"henderson vs diaz.\" Getting closer, but the opponent is Diaz, not Melendez.\n\nRow 7: \"johnson vs dodson.\" No match.\n\nRow 8: \"henderson vs melendez.\" Yes! This is the event we're looking for.\n\nNow, check the date associated with this event. In row 8, the date is \"april 20 , 2013.\" Wait a minute\u2014the claim says it takes place before April 20, 2013. But if the event happened on April 20, then it's not before that date. It's exactly on that day.\n\nSo, does an event taking place on the specified date count as \"before\"? Typically, when something is said to happen \"before\" a certain date, it means earlier than that date. So if the event occurs on the same day, it's not technically before it.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be false because the event happens on April 20, 2013, not before it.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where the event \"henderson vs melendez\" is found in row 8 with its date.

The claim is: \"the number of viewers for the fight on december 8 , 2012 be over 4.4 million.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see which rows are relevant. Each row represents a different event with details like date and viewers. The key here is the date, so I need to find the row where the event happened on December 8, 2012.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: no specific date mentioned.\n- Row 2: November 12, 2011.\n- Row 3: January 28, 2012.\n- Row 4: May 5, 2012.\n- Row 5: August 4, 2012.\n- Row 6: December 8, 2012. This matches the date in the claim.\n- Rows after that are later dates.\n\nSo, row 6 is the relevant one. Now, I need to check the viewers column for this row. The viewers listed are 4.4 million. \n\nThe claim says \"over 4.4 million.\" So, does 4.4 million count as over? Well, technically, \"over\" would mean more than 4.4 million. But here, it's exactly 4.4 million. \n\nHmm, so if the claim is about being \"over,\" then 4.4 million isn't strictly greater than itself. It's equal. So does that make the claim false? Or maybe depending on interpretation, sometimes \"over\" could include equal or greater. But in most cases, \"over\" implies more than.\n\nTherefore, the number of viewers is exactly 4.4 million, not over. So the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the viewers for the fight on December 8, 2012, are over 4.4 million. From the table, row 6 (index 6) lists viewers as 4.4 million.
