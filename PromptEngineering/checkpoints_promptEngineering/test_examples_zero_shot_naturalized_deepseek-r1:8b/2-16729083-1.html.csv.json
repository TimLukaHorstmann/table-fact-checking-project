    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into three parts:\n1. Opponent: Kansas City Chiefs\n2. Week: Week 14\n3. Attendance: 74,524\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check for these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has multiple rows, each corresponding to a different week and game. I need to find the row where the opponent is the Kansas City Chiefs (KC Chiefs), the week is Week 14, and the attendance matches 74,524.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is NY Giants\n- Row 2: Arizona Cardinals\n- Row 3: Baltimore Ravens\n- Row 4: KC Chiefs\n- Row 5: Seattle Seahawks\n- Row 6: San Diego Chargers\n- Row 7: New England Patriots\n- Row 8: Oakland Raiders\n- Row 9: San Diego Chargers again\n- Row 10: Washington Redskins\n- Row 11: Dallas Cowboys\n- Row 12: Miami Dolphins\n- Row 13: Seattle Seahawks again\n- Row 14: KC Chiefs again\n- Row 15: Oakland Raiders again\n- Row 16: Indianapolis Colts\n\nSo, the opponent Kansas City Chiefs appears in Week 4 and Week 14.\n\nNow, checking each occurrence:\n- Week 4: Opponent is KC Chiefs. But week number here is 4, not 14.\n- Week 14: Opponent is KC Chiefs again. Now, I need to check if the attendance for this particular game is 74,524.\n\nLooking at Row 14 (since it's week 14), the date is December 16, 2001. The result is a loss against KC Chiefs with an attendance of 77,778. Wait, that doesn't match the claimed attendance of 74,524.\n\nHmm, that's a problem because the attendance in Week 14 for KC Chiefs game is 77,778, not 74,524. So does this mean the claim is false?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check. Maybe there are two games against KC Chiefs: one in Week 4 and another in Week 14.\n\nIn Row 4, Week 4 vs KC Chiefs, attendance was 75,037.\nIn Row 14, Week 14 vs KC Chiefs, attendance is 77,778.\n\nNeither of these attendances matches 74,524. So the claim's attendance figure doesn't align with either occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the row numbers. Let me count again:\n\n- Row 1: Week 1\n- Row 2: Week 2\n- ...\n- Row 4: Week 4\n- ...\n- Row 14: Week 14\n\nYes, that's correct. So the attendance in Week 14 against KC Chiefs is 77,778, not 74,524.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues:\n1. The opponent is correctly identified as KC Chiefs in Week 14.\n2. However, the attendance doesn't match; it's 77,778 instead of 74,524.\n\nSince both conditions must be met for the claim to be true, the incorrect attendance makes the entire claim false.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524.\" It doesn't specify if it's a home or away game, but that shouldn't matter here. The key points are opponent and week number with specific attendance.\n\nThus, since the attendance is wrong, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that in Week 14 against the KC Chiefs, the attendance was 74,524. Checking the table:\n\n- In Week 14 (Row 14), the opponent is KC Chiefs with an attendance of 77,778, not matching the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
