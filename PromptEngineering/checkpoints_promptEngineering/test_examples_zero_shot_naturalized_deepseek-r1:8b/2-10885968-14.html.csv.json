    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells for verification.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim: \"north melbourne 's away team score be 13.11 (89)\". So, the claim is about checking if the away team named North Melbourne scored 13.11 (89) points in a game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like home team, their score, away team, the away team's score, venue, crowd, and date. Since the claim is about an away team's score, I'll focus on the \"away team\" column.\n\nNow, I need to find the row where the away team is North Melbourne. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home team is Footscray, away team is Hawthorn.\n- Row 2: Home team is Fitzroy, away team is Geelong.\n- Row 3: Home team is Essendon, away team is South Melbourne.\n- Row 4: Home team is St Kilda, away team is North Melbourne. Bingo! This is the relevant row.\n\nIn this row, the away team is North Melbourne, and their score is listed as \"13.11 (89)\". That matches exactly what the claim states. So, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row has multiple columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date. For this claim, we're interested in two pieces of information: the away team and their score.\n\nSo, for the relevant row (Row 4), the columns are:\n1. away team: North Melbourne\n2. away team score: 13.11 (89)\n\nThus, these two columns are relevant to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the score for the away team of north melbourne be 7.14 (56).\" So I'm looking for the away team's score where the home team is north melbourne.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has a home team and an away team with their respective scores. My task is to check if any row matches both the home team being north melbourne and the away team's score being 7.14 (56).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team - Footscray, Away team - Hawthorn, Score 17.15 (117). Not matching.\n\nRow 2: Home team - Fitzroy, Away team - Geelong, Score 13.18 (96). No match.\n\nRow 3: Home team - Essendon, Away team - South Melbourne, Score 12.6 (78). Nope.\n\nRow 4: Home team - St Kilda, Away team - North Melbourne, Score 13.11 (89). Wait, here the home team is St Kilda and away is North Melbourne. The score for North Melbourne is 13.11 (89), not 7.14 (56). So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: Home team - Richmond, Away team - Collingwood, Score 7.14 (56). Here the home team is Richmond, away is Collingwood. Their score is 7.14 (56). So this row doesn't have North Melbourne as either team.\n\nRow 6: Home team - Carlton, Away team - Melbourne, Score 6.22 (58). No match here either.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a row where the home team is North Melbourne because the claim mentions \"away team of north melbourne.\" But looking through all rows, I don't see any with North Melbourne as the home team. The only North Melbourne mentioned is in Row 4, where they are the away team against St Kilda.\n\nSo since there's no row where North Melbourne is the home team and their score is 7.14 (56), the claim doesn't hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the away team of North Melbourne scored 7.14 (56). Looking through each row, North Melbourne only appears as an away team in Row 4 against St Kilda, with a score of 13.11 (89), not 7.14 (56). Since there's no matching row where North Melbourne is the away team and has that score, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
