    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"both the bellevue bruin and the york panther play in the midland conference.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two mascots: the Bellevue Bruin and the York Panther. It says both play in the Midland Conference. So I need to check if these schools are indeed part of the Midland Conference according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details like school name, mascot, conference, national titles, and founding year. My task is to find the relevant rows for the two mascots mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with the Bellevue Bruin: I'll search the table for \"bellevue bruins.\" Scanning through each row, I see that Row 1 has school: bellevue university, mascot: bellevue bruins. So this is the relevant row for the Bellevue Bruin.\n\nNext, checking the York Panther. Looking at the mascots column, I find \"york panthers\" in Row 9, which lists york college as the school. The conference for york college is Midlands according to the table.\n\nNow, I need to confirm if both of these schools are in the Midland Conference. From the relevant rows, Row 1's conference is Midlands, and Row 9 also has conference: midlands. So both the Bellevue Bruin and York Panther do play in the Midland Conference.\n\nI should make sure there are no other interpretations. For instance, sometimes conferences might have subcategories or different levels, but according to the table provided, each school's conference is explicitly stated as either Midlands or Great Plains. Since both identified schools (Bellevue University and York College) list their conference as Midlands, the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim that both mascots play in the Midland Conference is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"According to date of founding, Peru State College be the oldest\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at what each part of the claim means. The claim is about the founding date of Peru State College and whether it's the oldest among some other colleges listed in the table. So, my goal is to find out which school has the earliest founded year because if Peru State's founding year is earlier than all others, then it would be the oldest.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different college with various attributes like school name, mascot, conference, national titles, and founding year. I'm particularly interested in the \"founded\" column here because that's what the claim is referencing.\n\nI should go through each row of the table and note down the founding years to see which one is the earliest. Let me list them out:\n\nRow 1: Founded in 1966\nRow 2: Founded in 1923\nRow 3: Founded in 1894\nRow 4: Founded in 1872\nRow 5: Founded in 1882\nRow 6: Founded in 1883\nRow 7: Founded in 1887\nRow 8: Founded in 1865\nRow 9: Founded in 1890\n\nNow, I need to identify the earliest founding year. The numbers go down as the years increase, but wait\u2014no, lower numbers mean earlier. So the smallest number here is 1865 (Row 8). That would be Peru State College's founding year.\n\nNext, I should check if all other colleges were founded after this year or not. Looking at each row:\n\n- All others have higher founding years than 1865. For example:\n  - Row 1: 1966 > 1865\n  - Row 2: 1923 > 1865\n  - Row 3: 1894 > 1865\n  - And so on, all the way to Row 9: 1890 > 1865\n\nSo Peru State College's founding year is indeed earlier than all the other listed colleges. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because Peru State was founded in 1865, making it older than all others.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I need to provide which cells are relevant. Since the claim refers to the founding date of Peru State College, I should look for that specific row and the \"founded\" column. \n\nLooking at the table again, Peru State College is in Row 8. So the relevant_cells would be row_index 8 and the column_name \"founded\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Peru State College has the earliest founding year among all listed colleges.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"only 1 school, york college, has won more than 20 titles.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. It's saying that among all the listed schools in the table, only York College has won more than 20 national titles. So my task is to check each row and see how many national titles each school has.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Bellevue University - 14 titles\nRow 2: College of Saint Mary - 0 titles\nRow 3: Concordia University - 1 title\nRow 4: Doane College - 10 titles\nRow 5: Hastings College - 3 titles\nRow 6: Midland University - 2 titles\nRow 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University - 19 titles\nRow 8: Peru State College - 2 titles\nRow 9: York College - 28 titles\n\nSo, I can see that each school's number of national titles is listed. Now, the claim specifies \"more than 20,\" so we're looking for any school with titles higher than 20.\n\nLooking at all the numbers:\n\n- York College has 28 titles.\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University has 19 titles.\n- Doane College has 10 titles.\n- Bellevue University has 14 titles.\n- The rest have significantly fewer: Hastings (3), Midland (2), Concordia (1), Peru State (2), Saint Mary (0).\n\nSo, only York College and Nebraska Wesleyan have titles above 20. Wait, no\u2014Nebraska Wesleyan has 19, which is just below 20. So the count would be only York with 28.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The user's claim says \"more than 20,\" so any school with 21 or more. York College is at 28, which is above 20. Nebraska Wesleyan is at 19, which is below 20. So only one school meets the criterion: York.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be row 9 (York College) and maybe row 7 (Nebraska Wesleyan) because their numbers are close but not over 20. But since the claim says \"only 1 school,\" we need to include all schools that have more than 20, which is only York.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"only 1 school, york college, has won more than 20 titles.\" So I need to make sure that no other school meets this condition. Checking the table again:\n\n- York:28\n- Wesleyan:19 (which is less)\n- Doane:10\n- Bellevue:14\n- Hastings:3\n- Midland:2\n- Peru State:2\n- Saint Mary:0\n\nSo only York has more than 20. Therefore, the claim is saying that only one school meets this, which is true.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought Wesleyan had 19, which is just below 20. So yes, only York qualifies. Therefore, the relevant cell is row 9 (York College) with national titles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only York College has won more than 20 national titles. From the table, York College is the only school with 28 titles, meeting this criterion. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Check each row's \"national titles\" column to find schools with titles above 20.\n2. **Evaluate Each School:**\n   - Bellevue University:14\n   - College of Saint Mary:0\n   - Concordia University:1\n   - Doane College:10\n   - Hastings College:3\n   - Midland University:2\n   - Nebraska Wesleyan University:19 (below 20)\n   - Peru State College:2\n   - York College:28\n3. **Determine Compliance:** Only York College exceeds the threshold of 20 titles.\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim is true as only one school meets the condition.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:** Only row 9 (York College) with \"national titles\" column relevant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"with a total of 0 , the lowest number of national title belongs to the college of saint mary\". \n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. The claim refers to a 'total' which is 0.\n2. It states that this total (0) corresponds to the lowest number of national titles.\n3. Specifically, it's attributed to \"the college of saint mary\".\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll need to find relevant cells that can verify these points.\n\nStarting with the 'national titles' column since the claim mentions that number. Each row represents a different school, and the 'national titles' are numerical values indicating how many titles each has won.\n\nNow, let's identify which rows correspond to the College of Saint Mary. Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 2: school: college of saint mary, ... national titles: 0.\n\nSo, the College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles. \n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest number among all the schools listed in the table.\n\nI'll list out each school's national titles:\n\n- Bellevue University: 14\n- College of Saint Mary: 0\n- Concordia University: 1\n- Doane College: 10\n- Hastings College: 3\n- Midland University: 2\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19\n- Peru State College: 2\n- York College: 28\n\nLooking at these numbers, the lowest is indeed 0, held by the College of Saint Mary. \n\nNow, checking if there are any other details in the claim that might affect this conclusion. The claim mentions \"with a total of 0\", which matches the national titles for the College of Saint Mary.\n\nThe only possible point to verify further is ensuring that all schools are considered and none have a lower number than 0. Since we're dealing with whole numbers, 0 is the smallest possible, so it's correctly identified.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the College of Saint Mary has the lowest number (0) of national titles among all listed institutions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row has information about a different school, including their mascot and conference, but more importantly for this task, their founding year.\n\nI need to identify the \"founded\" column because that's what the claim is referring to. So, each row in the table has a founded value. My job is to find out which school was founded most recently because that would make them the youngest.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Founded in 1966\nRow 2: Founded in 1923\nRow 3: Founded in 1894\nRow 4: Founded in 1872\nRow 5: Founded in 1882\nRow 6: Founded in 1883\nRow 7: Founded in 1887\nRow 8: Founded in 1865\nRow 9: Founded in 1890\n\nI'll list them out to compare:\n\n- Bellevue University: 1966\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nNow, comparing these founding years. The higher the year, the more recent the founding. So the most recent is Bellevue University at 1966. The next oldest would be Hastings College at 1882, then Midland at 1883, Concordia at 1894, York at 1890, Nebraska Wesleyan at 1887, Doane at 1872, Peru State at 1865, and Saint Mary with the earliest at 1923.\n\nSince Bellevue is the most recent, founded in 1966, it's indeed the youngest among all listed.

So that's one team from Nebraska in the Midlands conference.\n\nNext, it says \"the only Nebraska team to play in the Midland Conference.\" So the claim is suggesting that no other Nebraska schools are in the Midlands conference besides Bellevue Bruin.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other Nebraska-based teams in the Midlands. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Bellevue University - mascot Bellesvue Bruins, conference Midlands. That's one.\n\nRow 8: Peru State College - mascot Peru State Bobcats, conference Midlands. Wait, Peru is also in Nebraska, right? So that's another team from Nebraska in the Midlands. \n\nLooking at the other rows, let me see:\n\nRows 2-9: The rest are either College of Saint Mary (Midlands but not Nebraska), Concordia University (Great Plains), Doane College (Great Plains), Hastings College (Great Plains), Midland University (Great Plains), Nebraska Wesleyan University (Great Plains), York College (Midlands). Wait, York College is also in the Midlands conference. But does it say where they're located? The table doesn't specify locations besides the school names.\n\nSo, assuming that \"Nebraska\" refers to schools located in Nebraska. So Bellevue and Peru State are both in Nebraska and in the Midlands conference. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's at least another team (Peru State) playing in the Midland Conference from Nebraska.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about Peru State College. Is it indeed located in Nebraska? I think so, yes. So that would make two Nebraska teams in the Midlands: Bellevue and Peru State. Thus, the claim is FALSE because there's more than one team.\n\nNow, to find which cells are relevant. The claim mentions \"Bellevue Bruin\" (row 0) and refers to other Nebraska teams in the Midland Conference, so looking for other schools in Nebraska that are in Midlands. From the table, Row 8: Peru State College is also in Midlands and located in Nebraska.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0: school (Bellevue University)\nRow 8: school (Peru State College)\n\nWait, but the claim refers to \"Nebraska team,\" so we need to check if those schools are indeed in Nebraska. Since the table doesn't specify locations beyond the conference and mascot names, I have to assume that Bellevue is in Nebraska, and Peru State is as well.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 0 (Bellevue) for the Bruin part and row 8 (Peru State) because it's another Nebraska team in Midlands.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Peru State College is the last institution among those listed to have been founded in the 19th century. That means its founding year should be later than all other institutions' founding years mentioned in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row provides details about a school, including when it was founded. The claim specifically mentions Peru State College, so I'll focus on its founding year and compare it with others'.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Peru State College (Row 8) was founded in 1865.\n\nNow, I need to check if all other institutions listed were founded before 1865. If they all were, then Peru State would indeed be the last one established in the 19th century. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University (Row 1): Founded 1966 \u2013 That's in the 20th century, so this is irrelevant for our comparison.\n2. College of Saint Mary (Row 2): Founded 1923 \u2013 Also in the 20th century.\n3. Concordia University (Row 3): Founded 1894.\n4. Doane College (Row 4): Founded 1872.\n5.

York College (Row 9): Founded 1890.\n\nWait a minute, Concordia was founded in 1894, which is after Peru State's 1865 but still within the 19th century. So, if I'm considering 19th-century founding years, Peru State's 1865 would make it one of the earliest, not the latest. \n\nTo clarify, the later the founding year in the 19th century, the more recent it is within that century. For example, an institution founded in 1890 would be considered newer than one founded in 1872.\n\nBut the claim says Peru State is the last, meaning no other institutions were founded after it in the same century. However, since some institutions like York College (1890) and Concordia (1894) were founded later in the 19th century, Peru State isn't the last one.

The highest number (28) is achieved by York College, not Saint Mary. \n\nAnswer: FALSE  \nRelevant cells are all rows with \"national titles\" as they're needed to evaluate the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"Bellevue University be the first college founded in the 20th century.\" To check this, I need to look at the table provided and see if Bellevue University's founding date is earlier than all other universities listed.\n\nFirst, let me identify which row corresponds to Bellevue University. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: school: bellevue university... So that's Bellevue University in row 1.\n\nNext, I need to check the \"founded\" year for Bellevue University. From row 1, founded is 1966. That means Bellevue was founded in 1966.\n\nNow, I have to make sure that no other college in the table was founded before 1966. I'll go through each school one by one:\n\nRow 2: College of Saint Mary, founded 1923 \u2013 that's earlier than 1966.\nRow 3: Concordia University, founded 1894 \u2013 also earlier.\nRow 4: Doane College, founded 1872 \u2013 way before.\nRow 5: Hastings College, 1882 \u2013 still earlier.\nRow 6: Midland University, 1883 \u2013 earlier too.\nRow 7: Nebraska Wesleyan University, 1887 \u2013 again, before 1966.\nRow 8: Peru State College, 1865 \u2013 definitely earlier.\nRow 9: York College, 1890 \u2013 also earlier.\n\nSo all the other colleges in the table were founded before 1966. Since Bellevue University is the only one from row 1 with a founding year of 1966, and none of the others have a later founding year, the claim that Bellevue is the first college founded in the 20th century would be false because the other colleges were established earlier in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Bellevue University be the first college found in the 20th century\" is false because multiple universities listed in the table were founded earlier than Bellevue's 1966 founding year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
