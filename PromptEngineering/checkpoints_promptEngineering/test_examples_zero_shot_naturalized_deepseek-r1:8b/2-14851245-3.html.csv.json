The claim says: \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107 played on a clay surface on both July 16, 2007 and September 24, 2007.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for rows in the table where Ivana Abramovi\u0107 was either the winner or runner-up, specifically on those two dates.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: outcome is runner-up on Oct 15, 2001. Not relevant.\n- Rows 1 to 16: There's no mention of a player named Ivana Abramovi\u0107 until row 17 and onwards.\n- Row 17: Outcome is runner-up on Sep 24, 2007. Surface is clay. So this matches the second date (Sep 24, 2007) and it's clay.\n- Row 16: Runner-up on Jul 16, 2007, surface clay. This matches the first part of the claim.\n\nSo Ivana Abramovi\u0107 did play on clay on both those dates.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check for Ivana Abramovi\u0107 playing on a clay surface in July and September 2007.\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ivana Abramovi\u0107 playing at the Makarsha tournament more times than she played at the Mexico City tournament is true or false. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table provided. Each row represents a different tournament with various details like outcome, date, surface, partner, opponents, and score. The claim specifically mentions two tournaments: Makarsha and Mexico City. So my focus will be on these two.\n\nI'll start by looking for all rows where the tournament is either \"Makarsha\" or \"Mexico City.\" Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Tournament is Makarsha\n- Row 2: Bangkok\n- Row 3: Tallahassee\n- Row 4: Makarsha\n- Row 5: Makarsha\n- Row 6: Nonthaburi province\n- Row 7: San Luis Potos\u00e3\u00adn\n- Row 8: Rome\n- Row 9: Puebla\n- Row 10: Putignano\n- Row 11: Saint Gaudens\n- Row 12: Martina Franca\n- Row 13: Mexico City\n- Row 14: Puebla\n- Row 15: San Diego\n- Row 16: Dnipropetrovsk\n- Row 17: Podgorica\n- Row 18: Mexico City\n\nSo, Makarsha tournaments are in rows 1,4,5. Mexico City is in rows 13 and 18.\n\nNow, I need to check how many times Ivana Abramovi\u0107 participated at each of these tournaments. Looking for the column \"partner\": if the partner is Ivana Abramovi\u0107, that's her participation.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Partner is Raffaella Bindi (not Ivana)\nRow 4: Partner is Lenka Tvaroskova (not Ivana)\nRow 5: Partner is Jenny Belobrajdic (not Ivana)\nRow 13: Partner is Maria Abramovic (different last name, could be related but not the same as Ivana's last name? Wait, actually, in the data, row 13 has \"partner: maria abramovic\", which might be a typo or different person. So probably not Ivana.\nRow 18: Partner is Maria Abramovic again, so that's another Mexico City tournament.\n\nWait, but in rows where the outcome is runner-up or winner, we need to see if Ivana was the partner. From the data, Ivana's name as a partner isn't present except maybe row 13 and 18, which have \"maria abramovic.\" If that's a different person, then Ivana didn't participate in any of these tournaments.\n\nBut let me double-check each relevant row:\n\n- For Makarsha (rows 1,4,5): Partners are Raffaella Bindi, Lenka Tvaroskova, Jenny Belobrajdic. None is Ivana.\n- For Mexico City (rows 13,18): Partners are Maria Abramovic both times.\n\nSo, Ivana didn't play in any Makarsha tournaments nor in any Mexico City tournaments as per the partner column. Therefore, she played zero times at both, so there's no difference between the two; thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Ivana Abramovi\u0107 played more times at the Makarsha tournament than the Mexico City tournament. However, upon examining the table, there are no instances where \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107\" appears as a partner in either of these tournaments. Therefore, she didn't play in any of them, making the comparison irrelevant.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- No relevant cells as Ivana did not participate in any of the specified tournaments.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107 partner with Maria Abramovic more time than any of the other players she partnered with.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each row in the table represents. Each row seems to be about a tournament where a player named Ivana Abramovi\u0107 participated. For each tournament, the row includes details like the outcome (whether she was a winner or runner-up), the date, the surface type, her partner's name, her opponents, and the score.\n\nThe key here is to find out how many times Ivana partnered with Maria Abramovic compared to her other partners. So I need to go through each row where Ivana is the participant and check who she was paired with.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 7: outcome runner-up, date Nov 22, 2004, tournament San Luis Potos\u00e3\u00ed, surface hard, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 8: outcome runner-up, date March 21, 2005, tournament Rome, surface clay, partner Stefanie Haidner. Here, Ivana's partner isn't Maria.\n- Row 9: outcome winner, date Nov 15, 2005, tournament Puebla, surface hard, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 10: outcome runner-up, date April 3, 2006, tournament Putignano, surface hard, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 11: outcome winner, date May 15, 2006, tournament Saint Gaudens, surface clay, partner Alla Kudryavtseva. Not Maria.\n- Row 12: outcome winner, date July 31, 2006, tournament Martina Franca, surface clay, partner Aurelie Vedy. Not Maria.\n- Row 13: outcome runner-up, date Nov 14, 2006, tournament Mexico City, surface clay, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 14: outcome runner-up, date Nov 21, 2006, tournament Puebla, surface hard, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 15: outcome winner, date Nov 29, 2006, tournament San Diego, surface hard, partner Hana Sromova. Not Maria.\n- Row 16: outcome runner-up, date July 16, 2007, tournament Dnipropetrovsk, surface clay, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 17: outcome runner-up, date Sep 24, 2007, tournament Podgorica, surface clay, partner Maria Abramovic.\n- Row 18: outcome runner-up, date Oct 22, 2007, tournament Mexico City, surface hard, partner Maria Abramovic.\n\nSo from the above, I can list out all Ivana's partners:\n\n1. Row 7: Maria\n2. Row 8: Stefanie Haidner\n3. Row 9: Maria\n4. Row 10: Maria\n5. Row 11: Alla Kudryavtseva\n6. Row 12: Aurelie Vedy\n7. Row 13: Maria\n8. Row 14: Maria\n9. Row 15: Hana Sromova\n10. Row 16: Maria\n11. Row 17: Maria\n12. Row 18: Maria\n\nCounting the number of times Ivana partnered with Maria: Let's see, rows 7,9,10,13,14,16,17,18. That's 8 times.\n\nNow, checking other partners:\n\n- Stefanie Haidner: 1 time\n- Alla Kudryavtseva: 1 time\n- Aurelie Vedy: 1 time\n- Hana Sromova: 1 time\n\nSo Maria is partnered with her 8 times, and all others are only once. Therefore, the claim that Ivana partners with Maria more than any other is true because Maria appears significantly more frequently as her partner compared to the others.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to analyze how many times Ivana Abramovi\u0107 partnered with Maria Abramovic compared to her other partners.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We look for rows where Ivana's partner is Maria Abramovic and also check if there are other distinct partners.\n\n2. **Count Partnerships**:\n   - Maria Abramovic: 8 instances (Rows 7,9,10,13,14,16,17,18)\n   - Other Partners: Each appears only once (Stefanie Haidner, Alla Kudryavtseva, Aurelie Vedy, Hana Sromova).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since Maria is partnered with more times than any other player, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the table, I see her name in row 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.\n\nWait, actually, looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Partner is Raffaella Bindi\n- Row 2: Partner is Kim Jin-hee\n- Row 3: Partner is Jacqueline Trail\n- Row 4: Partner is Lenka Tvaroskova\n- Row 5: Partner is Jenny Belobrajdic\n- Row 6: Partner is Remi Tezuka\n- Row 7: Partner is Maria Abramovic (Ivana's sister)\n- Row 8: Partner is Stefanie Haidner\n- Row 9: Partner is Maria Abramovic again\n- Row 10: Partner is Maria Abramovic\n- Row 11: Partner is Alla Kudryavtseva\n- Row 12: Partner is Aurelie Vedy\n- Row 13: Partner is Maria Abramovic\n- Row 14: Partner is Maria Abramovic\n- Row 15: Partner is Hana Sromova\n- Row 16: Partner is Maria Abramovic\n- Row 17: Partner is Maria Abramovic\n- Row 18: Partner is Maria Abramovic\n\nSo, Ivana isn't listed as a partner in any of these rows. Therefore, she might not have participated at all based on the given data.\n\nNext, I should check if there are any opponents that match her name, but looking through the opponents column, none seem to be \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107.\" So, it's possible she didn't play.\n\nNow, considering the claim mentions she played on clay and hard surfaces each 9 times. Since she isn't a partner in any of these matches, she wouldn't have the counts mentioned.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107 have an outcome of runner - up 4 more times than she win.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify how many times Ivana Abramovi\u0107 was a runner-up and how many times she won in the tournaments listed.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: Partner is Raffaella Bindi. No match for Ivana.\nRow 2: Partner is Kim Jin-hee. Not Ivana.\nRow 3: Partner is Jacqueline Trail. Not Ivana.\nRow 4: Partner is Lenka Tvaroskova. Not Ivana.\nRow 5: Partner is Jenny Belobrajdic. Not Ivana.\nRow 6: Partner is Remi Tezuka. Not Ivana.\nRow 7: Partner is Maria Abramovic. Wait, that's different\u2014Maria, not Ivana. So maybe the name is a bit off? Or perhaps it's a typo in the table. I'll need to check if this could be Ivana.\n\nWait, looking again, Row 7 has \"partner: maria abramovic.\" If the claim refers to Ivana Abramovi\u0107, then unless Maria is sometimes used as a variant of Ivana (which isn't common), it's a different person. So, perhaps Ivana isn't present here.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 8: Partner is Stefanie Haidner. Not Ivana.\nRow 9: Partner is Maria Abramovic. Again, same as Row 7\u2014assuming it's Maria, not Ivana.\nRow 10: Partner is Maria Abramovic. Same as above.\nRow 11: Partner is Alla Kudryavtseva. Not Ivana.\nRow 12: Partner is Aurelie Vedy. No.\nRow 13: Partner is Maria Abramovic. Again, same person as before.\nRow 14: Partner is Maria Abramovic. Same.\nRow 15: Partner is Hana Sromova. Not Ivana.\nRow 16: Partner is Maria Abramovic.\nRow 17: Partner is Maria Abramovic.\nRow 18: Partner is Maria Abramovic.\n\nSo, in all these rows where Ivana might be referred to, the partner names don't match \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107.\" Instead, it's \"Maria Abramovi\u0107\" and others. Therefore, perhaps there are no wins or runner-ups by Ivana in this table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe Ivana is using different last names or something? The claim says \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107,\" so I should look for exact matches.\n\nLooking back at the partners:\n\nRow 7: Maria Abramovic\nRows 9-18: Same as above.\n\nSo, none of these are Ivana. Therefore, Ivana didn't have any wins or runner-ups in this table.\n\nWait, but what if Ivana is a participant but not listed as the partner? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. Let me check the structure.\n\nThe columns seem to be: row_index, tournament details like \"partner,\" \"outcome,\" etc. So, each row has details about a particular player in that tournament, including their outcome (win or runner-up) and who their partner was.\n\nIf Ivana is not listed as any of these partners, then she didn't participate in any tournaments here, so her outcomes aren't recorded. Thus, the number of times she won or was runner-up would be zero.\n\nThe claim states that she has 4 more runner-ups than wins. If she hasn't participated at all, both counts are zero, which doesn't satisfy the condition of being ahead by 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Ivana Abramovi\u0107 didn't have any outcomes recorded in this table, so she can't have 4 more runner-ups than wins.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row again for \"Ivana.\" Maybe she's listed under a different column?\n\nWait, perhaps the columns are: row_index, outcome (like 'runner-up' or 'win'), and then partner info. So, in that case, I need to look at the \"outcome\" column.\n\nBut looking back, the table structure isn't explicitly given with column names beyond what's shown. The user mentioned \"partner,\" \"outcome,\" etc., but it's unclear which columns are which.\n\nWait, perhaps each row has multiple details. For example, in Row 7: partner is Maria Abramovi\u0107, and outcome might be 'runner-up' or 'win.' But without knowing the exact structure, I'm assuming that the relevant columns are \"outcome\" and whether the person is Ivana.\n\nBut given that none of the partners match Ivana's name, it's safe to conclude she isn't present here. So her outcomes aren't listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ivana Abramovi\u0107 has been a runner-up four times more than she has won. By examining each row in the table, we look for any instances where \"Ivana Abramovi\u0107\" is the partner or participant. However, all entries show different partners, primarily \"Maria Abramovi\u0107.\" Since Ivana isn't listed as a partner in any of these tournaments, her outcomes aren't recorded here.

I'm particularly interested in rows where Ivana is mentioned as a player, especially in tournaments held in Mexico City.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Outcome is runner-up, tournament is Makarska. No mention of Mexico City.\n2. **Row 2**: Winner in Bangkok. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 3**: Runner-up in Tallahassee. Nope.\n4. **Row 4**: Runner-up in Makarska again. Still not Mexico City.\n5. **Row 5**: Winner in Makarska. No match here.\n6. **Row 6**: Winner in nonthaburi province, Thailand. Not Mexico City.\n7. **Row 7**: Runner-up in San Luis Potos\u00e1n. No.\n8. **Row 8**: Runner-up in Rome. Doesn't apply.\n9. **Row 9**: Winner in Puebla, Mexico. This is a different city, so not relevant to Mexico City.\n10. **Row 10**: Runner-up in Putignano, Italy. No match here either.\n11. **Row 11**: Winner in Saint Gaudens, France. Not Mexico City.\n12. **Row 12**: Winner in Martina Franca, Spain. Still no.\n13. **Row 13**: Runner-up in Mexico City! Wait a minute, this is the first time I'm seeing Mexico City. The outcome is runner-up, so Ivana must have participated here. This directly contradicts the claim that she never played there.\n\n14. **Row 14**: Runner-up in Puebla again, which is different from Mexico City.\n15. **Row 15**: Winner in San Diego. Not relevant.\n16. **Row 16**: Runner-up in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine. No match here.\n17. **Row 17**: Runner-up in Podgorica, Montenegro. Doesn't apply.\n18. **Row 18**: Runner-up in Mexico City again! So Ivana participated twice in Mexico City tournaments.\n\nBased on these findings, there are two rows (13 and 18) where the tournament is Mexico City, and Ivana is listed as a runner-up. This clearly shows she did play in Mexico City, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Ivana Abramovic never played in the Mexico City tournament\" is FALSE because the table shows she participated twice in the Mexico City tournaments (rows 13 and 18).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"Ivana Abramovic always wins when she plays with Maria Abramovic\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what each row in the table represents. Each row seems to detail a specific match or tournament where a player, identified by their outcome (winner or runner-up), participated. The relevant columns here are:\n\n- **Outcome**: Whether the player was the winner or runner-up.\n- **Partner**: The name of the partner during the match.\n- **Opponents**: The names of the opponents in the match.\n\nThe claim suggests that whenever Ivana Abramovic plays with Maria Abramovic, she always wins. So, my goal is to check all instances where both \"Ivana Abramovic\" and \"Maria Abramovic\" are playing together as partners, and see if Ivana's outcome is consistently a win.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table to find relevant matches:\n\n1. **Row 1**: No mention of either player.\n2. **Row 2**: Partners are Kim Jin-hee and Mi-RA Jeon; no relevance.\n3. **Row 3**: Partner is Jacqueline Trail; not Maria.\n4. **Row 4**: Partner is Lenka Tvaroskova; no match.\n5. **Row 5**: Partner is Jenny Belobrajdic; irrelevant.\n6. **Row 6**: Partner is Remi Tezuka; no match.\n7. **Row 7**: Partners are Maria Abramovic and Hannah Collin; Ivana isn't mentioned here, so irrelevant.\n8. **Row 8**: Partners are Stefanie Haidner; no match.\n9. **Row 9**: Partner is Maria Abramovic; Ivana isn't the winner here (she's a runner-up).\n10. **Row 10**: Partners are Maria Abramovic and Anastasia Rodionova; again, Ivana isn't playing, so irrelevant.\n11. **Row 11**: Partners are Alla Kudryavtseva; no match.\n12. **Row 12**: Partner is Aurelie Vedy; no match.\n13. **Row 13**: Partners are Maria Abramovic and Larissa Carvalho; Ivana isn't mentioned, so irrelevant.\n14. **Row 14**: Partners are Maria Abramovic; again, not playing with Ivana.\n15. **Row 15**: Partner is Hana Sromova; no match.\n16. **Row 16**: Partners are Maria Abramovic and Amina Rakhim; irrelevant as Ivana isn't playing.\n17. **Row 17**: Partners are Maria Abramovic and Danica Krstajic; not relevant.\n18. **Row 18**: Partners are Maria Abramovic and Arantxa Rus; no match.\n\nWait, in Row 9, Ivana is the runner-up with partner Maria, which means she lost. The claim states that she always wins when they play together, but here she loses. That's a counterexample.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any instances where both Ivana and Maria are partners and Ivana wins. From my scan, only Row 9 is relevant, but in that case, she loses. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported as she doesn't always win.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"Ivana Abramovic always wins when she plays with Maria Abramovic,\" we need to identify all instances where both players partner together and check Ivana's outcomes.\n\n**Relevant Rows:**\n- **Row 9**: Ivana is the runner-up, not the winner.\n\nSince there is at least one instance where Ivana doesn't win when partnering with Maria, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"Ivana Abramovich always wins when matching against Petra Rclavska\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through each row and check for relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Outcome is runner-up, not winner. Opponents are Petra Raclavska and Blanka Kumbarova. So here, Ivanova didn't win against Petra. But I'm looking for where she did win.\n\nRow 2: Winner, opponents are Mi-Ra Jeon and Manisha Malhotra. Doesn't involve Petra.\n\nRows 3-5: These don't mention either of them in the opponents or partners. So nothing here.\n\nRow 6: Opponents are Amanda Augustus and Debby Haak. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Runner-up, opponents aren't mentioned as Petra.\n\nRow 8: Runner-up, opponent is Valentina Sulpizio. No.\n\nRow 9: Winner, but opponents are Betina Jozami and Veronica Spiegel. Not Petra.\n\nRows 10-11: Partners or opponents don't include either of them.\n\nRow 12: Opponent Edina Gallovits-Hall. Not relevant.\n\nRow 13: Runner-up, opponent Larissa Carvalho. No.\n\nRow 14: Runner-up, opponent Maria Fernanda Alves. No.\n\nRow 15: Winner, opponent Christina Fusano. Not Petra.\n\nRows 16-18: Opponents are Amina Rakhim and Arina Rodionova, Danica Krstajic, etc. None are Petra.\n\nSo the only time Ivanova played against Petra Raclavska was in Row 1 where she lost as a runner-up. There's no instance where she faced Petra and won. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponents\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Ivana Abramovic play with Maria Abramovic only 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It says that Ivana Abramovic played with Maria Abramovic only once. So I need to look for instances where both players were in a match together in the table.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is runner-up, partners are Raffaella Bindi and Petra Raclavska Blanka Kumbarova. No Maria here.\nRow 2: Winner, partner is Kim Jin-hee. Opponents include Mi-RA Jeon and Manisha Malhotra. No Maria as a partner or opponent.\nRow 3: Runner-up, partner is Jacqueline Trail. Opponents are Jessica Lehnhoff Vanessa Webb. No Maria.\nRow 4: Runner-up, partner Lenka Tvaroskova. Opponents Tina Hergold Yevgenia Savranska. No Maria.\nRow 5: Winner, partner Jenny Belobrajdic. Opponents Zsuzsanna Fodor Dorottya Magas. No Maria.\nRow 6: Winner, partner Remi Tezuka. Opponents Amanda Augustus Debby Haak. No Maria.\nRow 7: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. Here's the first time both Ivana and Maria are partners.\nRow 8: Runner-up, partner Stefanie Haidner. Opponents include Valentina Sulpizio Sandra Zahlavova. Maria isn't here as a partner or opponent.\nRow 9: Winner, partner Maria Abramovic. So they played together again.\nRow 10: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. They play together once more.\nRow 11: Winner, partner Alla Kudryavtseva. No Maria involved.\nRow 12: Winner, partner Aurelie Vedy. Opponents include Edina Gallovits-Hall Mervana Jugic-Salkic. No Maria.\nRow 13: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. Another match together.\nRow 14: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. They play again.\nRow 15: Winner, partner Hana Sromova. Opponents include Christina Fusano Aleke Tsoubanos. No Maria here.\nRow 16: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. So they are partners once more.\nRow 17: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. Another match.\nRow 18: Runner-up, partner Maria Abramovic. They play together again.\n\nSo from Row 7 to Row 18, whenever Maria Abramovic is the partner, Ivana must be the opponent or vice versa? Wait, no, in each case, the 'outcome' column shows whether it's a win or runner-up, but the partners are listed as one person. So if the outcome is a win, that means the player with the given partner won. If it's a runner-up, the other player lost.\n\nWait, actually, looking at Row 7: Outcome is runner-up, and partner is Maria. That implies that Ivana was playing against someone else, perhaps. But I'm not sure how to determine whether Ivana and Maria were opponents or partners here.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify the structure of the table. Each row seems to represent a match where one person was playing with their partner (the 'partner' column), while the other two players in the 'opponents' are likely the opponents.\n\nWait, no, looking at Row 7: Outcome is runner-up, partner is Maria. So perhaps Ivana is the one who lost, meaning that Maria and someone else won? Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused about how to interpret the table structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a match where two players are partners, and the other two are opponents. But in this case, for example, Row 7: Partner is Maria, so Ivana must be one of the opponents? Or is it that both are playing as partners?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is to find rows where both Ivana and Maria were partners. Because if they played together, then each such instance counts towards the claim.\n\nLooking back, in Row 7, the partner is Maria, so perhaps Ivana was her opponent or herself? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row has a player (the one with outcome), their partner, and two opponents.\n\nSo for example, in Row 7: Outcome is runner-up, partner is Maria. So the person who ran up is someone else, not necessarily Ivana or Maria. Wait, but how do we know which player is which? The 'partner' column lists the partner of the main player, perhaps. Or maybe the main player is the one whose result is listed.\n\nWait, this is unclear. Maybe I need to look at the claim again: \"Ivana Abramovic play with Maria Abramovic only 1 time.\" So we're looking for instances where both played together, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIf in any row, Ivana is playing with Maria as partners, then that's a match they played together. The count of such rows would determine how many times they played together.\n\nBut from the table, I can see that starting from Row 7 onwards, whenever Maria is listed as the partner, it might indicate that the main player (maybe Ivana) was partnered with Maria in that match.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure who the 'player' is. Each row seems to represent a different player's match, perhaps? Or maybe each row represents a match, with the partners and opponents. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'opponent' column lists two players, while the partner is one person. So if Ivana is an opponent in any row where Maria is the partner, then they are playing against each other, which would mean they played together once.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to parse the table correctly. Maybe it's better to focus on the columns: 'row_index' (which seems like the index of the row), 'partner', and 'opponents'.\n\nWait, looking at Row 7:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"Partner\",\n  \"cell_value\": \"Maria Abramovic\"\n}\n\nAnd opponents are Danica Krstajic Sandra Martinovic.\n\nSo perhaps in this match, the person playing with Maria is someone else (maybe Ivana?), but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the 'partner' column refers to the opponent they're playing against. That doesn't make much sense either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured such that each row represents a player, their partner, and two opponents. So if Ivana is one of the opponents when Maria is the partner, then they played together once.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to determine which cells are relevant for the claim without knowing exactly who is playing whom in each match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'partner' column indicates the person they're playing with, so whenever Maria is the partner, and Ivana is one of the opponents, that counts as a play together.\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain. However, based on the data given, the relevant cells would be any row where both Ivana and Maria are listed in the same match, regardless of their positions (partner or opponent).\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 7: Partner is Maria. So if Ivana is an opponent here, they played together once.\n- Row 9: Winner, partner Maria.\n- Row 10: Runner-up, partner Maria.\n- Row 13: Runner-up, partner Maria.\n- Row 14: Runner-up, partner Maria.\n- Row 16: Runner-up, partner Maria.\n- Row 17: Runner-up, partner Maria.\n\nSo in each of these rows, if Ivana is an opponent when Maria is the partner, that's a play together. If not, then perhaps not.\n\nBut without knowing who the opponents are specifically, it's hard to say whether Ivana was playing against Maria or with her in each case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'opponent' column lists two players, and if either of them is Maria when the partner is Ivana, that counts as a play together. But again, I'm not sure.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, perhaps the safest approach is to consider all rows where Maria is listed as a partner, and count each such instance as a play together by Ivana. Even though it might not be accurate, it's the only way to proceed without more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'player' in the match is determined by the row index. So each row represents a different player, their partner, and opponents. Therefore, if Ivana is the main player in any row where Maria is her partner, that's a play together.\n\nBut I'm not sure which rows correspond to Ivana.\n\nThis is getting too confusing without more context about who is playing whom in each match.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the best way to answer is to consider all instances where Maria is listed as a partner and count them. If we assume that each row represents a play by someone else, then Ivana could be playing with Maria multiple times.\n\nBut since the claim is that they played together only once, if there are more than one such instances, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFrom Row 7 onwards (assuming starting from when Maria becomes a partner), there are multiple rows where Maria is listed as partner. That suggests Ivana might have played with Maria multiple times, which would mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nHowever, without knowing who is playing whom, it's impossible to be certain.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the data provided, it seems that Ivana and Maria may have played together more than once, depending on how the table is structured. Therefore, the claim that they played together only once might be inaccurate.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that there are multiple instances where Maria is listed as a partner in different matches (Rows 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 17). Assuming each of these represents a match involving Ivana and Maria as partners, it suggests they played together on several occasions. Therefore, the claim that Ivana and Maria played together only once does not hold.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect. Ivana and Maria played together more than once.",
