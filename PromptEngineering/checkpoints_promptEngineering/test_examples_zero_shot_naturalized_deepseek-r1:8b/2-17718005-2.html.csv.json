    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Warrington Town is correct based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the Warrington Town team be in the 4th position with 45 goals against.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate the row for Warrington Town in the table. Looking through each row, I see that Row 4 is for Warrington Town. That's straightforward enough.\n\nNext, I need to check their position. According to the table, they are listed as position: 4. So that part checks out. The claim mentions they're in the 4th position, which matches what's shown here.\n\nNow, looking at goals against for Warrington Town. In Row 4, under the column \"goals against,\" the number is 45. That's exactly what the claim states, so that part also aligns correctly.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The claim doesn't mention any other statistics, so as far as I can see, both position and goals against are correct based on the table. There's no conflicting information in other columns like goals for or points that would negate this.\n\nI think I've covered all parts of the claim. Both position and goals against match what's stated, so the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
