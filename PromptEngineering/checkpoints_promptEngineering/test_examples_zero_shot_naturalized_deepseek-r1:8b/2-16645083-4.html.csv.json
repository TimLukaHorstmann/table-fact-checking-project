    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"green bay have a swim score of 9 , a volleyball score of 1 , and a total score of more than 35.\" \n\nFirst, I'll go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nThe first part of the claim mentions that green bay has a swim score of 9. Looking at the table, row 3 is for green bay. In row 3, under swimming, the value is 9. So this part checks out. \n\nNext, the claim states that green bay has a volleyball score of 1. In the same row (row 3), the volleyball column shows 1. That's correct as well.\n\nThe third part says that their total score is more than 35. The total for green bay in row 3 is 40. Since 40 is greater than 35, this condition also holds true.\n\nSince all three parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table, I can confirm that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"swimming\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"volleyball\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"they do not play volleyball in green bay\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says that they don't play volleyball in Green Bay. So, I'm looking for information related to volleyball in Green Bay's row.\n\nI should check each relevant cell in the table. The claim is about volleyball, so I need to focus on the \"volleyball\" column specifically in the Green Bay row.\n\nLooking at Row 3 (since it's the third row and school is Green Bay), under the \"volleyball\" column, I see that the value is 1. So, there is a 1 recorded, which indicates that they do play volleyball in Green Bay at least once according to the data.\n\nTherefore, since the table shows that volleyball is played in Green Bay (the number is 1), the claim that \"they do not play volleyball in green bay\" would be false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"they do not play volleyball in green bay,\" we examine the \"volleyball\" column for the Green Bay row. The value is '1', indicating volleyball is played.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"volleyball\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"there be not a school that have a bask score along with an indoor track score of 0 , and a swim score of 5.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that there does not exist any school in the table where the bask (basketball) score is something, along with both an indoor track score of 0 and a swim (swimming) score of 5. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe claim: \"there be not a school that have a bask score along with an indoor track score of 0 , and a swim score of 5.\" So, in other words, does any school have both bask score (maybe non-zero?), indoor track score exactly 0, and swimming score exactly 5? Or is the claim saying that no such school exists?\n\nWait, actually, the phrasing is a bit tricky. It might be more accurately read as: \"there is not [a situation where] a school has a bask score, along with an indoor track score of 0, and a swim score of 5.\" So, it's asserting that no such school exists where all three conditions are met simultaneously.\n\nSo, I need to check each row in the table to see if any school has both an indoor track score of 0, a swim (swimming) score of exactly 5, and some bask score. If such a row exists, then the claim would be false because there is at least one school meeting those criteria. Otherwise, it's true.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Cleveland State\n- indoor track: -\n- swimming: 0\n\nSo, no.\n\nRow 2: Detroit\n- indoor track: 4\n- swimming: -\n\nNo.\n\nRow 3: Green Bay\n- indoor track: -\n- swimming:9\n\nNo.\n\nRow4: Milwaukee\n- indoor track:9\n- swimming:3\n\nNo.\n\nRow5: UIC\n- indoor track:0\n- swimming:0\n\nSo, indoor track is 0, but swim is 0. So, not matching.\n\nRow6: Valparaiso\n- indoor track:0\n- swimming:0\n\nSame as above.\n\nRow7: Wright State\n- indoor track:0\n- swimming:5\n\nWait, here's a possible match! Let me check:\n\nSchool: Wright State\nbask: 0\ngolf: -\nsoccer:4\nsoft:4\nswimming:5\ntennis:0\nindoor track:0\noutdoor track:0\nvolleyball:0\ntotal:13\n\nSo, indoor track is 0 and swim is 5. Now, what's the bask score? It's 0.\n\nThe claim mentions \"bask score along with...\" So, does having a bask score (which could be 0) count as \"have\" that score? I think so because it says \"along with\", meaning both conditions must be met.\n\nTherefore, Wright State has an indoor track score of 0 and swim score of 5. Bask is also 0. So, this school meets all three criteria: bask (any number), but specifically looking for a bask score, which it does have as 0.\n\nSo, that would mean the claim is false because such a school exists.\n\nWait, let me double-check the other rows to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nRow8: Youngstown State\n- indoor track:3\n- swimming:0\n\nNope.\n\nSo, only Row7 has both indoor track 0 and swim 5. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because such a school exists.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no school has a bask score along with an indoor track score of 0 and a swim score of 5. Upon reviewing each row, Wright State University in Row7 meets all these criteria: Indoor Track is 0, Swim is 5, and Bask is 0.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:** The claim asserts that no school has both an indoor track score of 0, a swim score of 5, and any bask score (including 0).\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Row:**\n   - **Row7 (Wright State):** Indoor Track is 0, Swim is 5, Bask is 0.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Since Wright State meets all the conditions listed in the claim, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"indoor track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"swim\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"bask\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"they do not have a swimming competition at wright state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for the row that corresponds to Wright State in the table. Scanning the schools listed: Row 1 is Cleveland State, Row 2 Detroit, Row 3 Green Bay, Row 4 Milwaukee, Row 5 UIC, Row 6 Valparaiso, Row 7 Wright State, and Row 8 Youngstown State. So Wright State is in Row 7.\n\nNow, I need to check the swimming column for this row. The columns are: school, bask, golf, soccer, soft, swimming, tennis, indoor track, outdoor track, volleyball, total. So the relevant column here is \"swimming.\"\n\nLooking at Row 7 (Wright State), under the swimming column, it says 5. That's a positive number, which usually indicates that there is a competition or participation in that sport.\n\nSo since there's a value of 5 in the swimming column for Wright State, that means they do have a swimming competition there. Therefore, the claim that \"they do not have a swimming competition at wright state\" would be FALSE because there is evidence they do have one.\n\nNow, to make sure I'm following the instructions correctly: I need to list all relevant cells that support this conclusion. Since only the swimming column in Row 7 is relevant, that's the only cell needed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Wright State has a swimming competition with a value of 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"swimming\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
