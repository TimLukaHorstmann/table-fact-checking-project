    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"On November 12, 1995, there was an attendance of 51342.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which row corresponds to November 12, 1995. Let me look through each row's date:\n\n- Row 1: September 3, 1995\n- Row 2: September 10, 1995\n- Row 3: September 17, 1995\n- Row 4: September 24, 1995\n- Row 5: October 8, 1995\n- Row 6: October 15, 1995\n- Row 7: October 22, 1995\n- Row 8: October 30, 1995\n- Row 9: November 5, 1995\n- Row 10: November 12, 1995\n- Row 11: November 19, 1995\n- ...and so on.\n\nLooking at this list, Row 10 is November 12, 1995. So the relevant row index is 9 because I think the rows start counting from 0 or 1? Wait, in the table provided, each row has a week number starting from 1 to 16. So Row 1 corresponds to Week 1, which is September 3, 1995. Therefore, Row 10 would be Week 10, November 12, 1995.\n\nWait no, actually, let me count the rows properly. The first row is week 1, so each subsequent row increases by one week. So Row 1: week 1, Row 2: week 2, ..., Row 16: week 17? Wait, that doesn't make sense because weeks go from 1 to 16 across the table. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait no, let me check again:\n\n- Week 1: September 3, 1995 (Row 1)\n- Week 2: September 10 (Row 2)\n- Week 3: September 17 (Row 3)\n- Week 4: September 24 (Row 4)\n- Week 6: October 8 (Row 5) \u2013 Wait, the weeks are not sequential here; there's no week 5. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 1: week 1\nRow 2: week 2\nRow 3: week 3\nRow 4: week 4\nRow 5: week 6\nRow 6: week 7\nRow 7: week 8\nRow 8: week 9\nRow 9: week 10\nRow 10: week 11\n...and so on.\n\nSo the weeks skip some numbers. For example, there's no Week 5 in the table. So when looking for November 12, 1995, I need to find which row that is. \n\nLooking through the dates:\n\n- Row 9: November 5, 1995 (Week 10)\n- Row 10: November 12, 1995 (Week 11)\n\nSo the date in question is November 12, 1995, which is Row 10. Therefore, the row index would be 10 if rows start at 1, or perhaps 9 if starting from 0.\n\nWait, the table shows Row 1 as week 1, so Row numbering starts at 1. So the claim's date is November 12, 1995, which corresponds to Row 11? Wait no, in the list above:\n\nRow 9: November 5 (Week 10)\nRow 10: November 12 (Week 11)\nSo November 12 is Row 10.\n\nNow, I need to check the \"attendance\" for that row. So Column name would be \"attendance\", and the value is 51342 according to the claim.\n\nLooking at Row 10's details:\n\n- Week: 11\n- Date: November 12, 1995\n- Opponent: Arizona Cardinals\n- Result: w 30 - 24 (OT)\n- Attendance: 51342\n\nYes, that matches exactly. So the attendance for that game was 51,342.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all the conditions are met in Row 10 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because November 12, 1995, corresponds to Row 10 with an attendance of 51342.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"during week 7 , the attendance be 55703\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the data. The table has multiple rows, each corresponding to a specific week. Each row includes information like the week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. My task is to check if the attendance figure for Week 7 matches the claim made.\n\nLooking at the claim: it states that during Week 7, the attendance was 55,703. To verify this, I need to locate the row in the table that corresponds to Week 7 and then check the attendance number associated with it.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the one labeled as Week 7. Let's see:\n\n- Row 1: Week 1\n- Row 2: Week 2\n- Row 3: Week 3\n- Row 4: Week 4\n- Row 5: Week 6\n- Row 6: Week 7\n\nAh, there it is\u2014Row 6 is for Week 7. Now, I need to check the attendance number for this row. According to the table, in Row 6 (Week 7), the attendance was 55,703.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Sometimes when skimming through data, it's easy to overlook details. So, confirming again: Week 7 is indeed Row 6, and the attendance for that row is 55,703 as provided in the claim. That matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, since the attendance figure for Week 7 in the table matches the number given in the claim, the claim should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during Week 7, the attendance was 55,703. Checking the table, Week 7 corresponds to Row 6, which indeed has an attendance of 55,703.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has a bunch of rows with information about football games, including the week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"during week 16 , the team lose to the san francisco 49ers wtih a score of 37 - 30.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim. It's making two specific claims here. The first is about the week number, which is week 16. The second is that the opponent was the San Francisco 49ers and that the result was a loss with a score of 37-30.\n\nSo, I should check each part against the table to see if it aligns.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for row where week is 16. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 15: week:16, date: december 18 , 1995, opponent: san francisco 49ers, result: l 37 - 30 (attendance:64975).\n\nSo that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, let me check each part of the claim against this row.\n\nFirst, the week is indeed 16. So that matches.\n\nNext, the opponent is San Francisco 49ers, which also matches the claim.\n\nThe result is a loss, as indicated by \"l\" in \"result: l 37 - 30.\" The score is 37-30, so both the score and the outcome (loss) align with the claim.\n\nTherefore, all aspects of the claim are supported by the table data. There's no discrepancy or missing information here.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be row 15, specifically looking at \"week\" and \"opponent\" and \"result.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table, confirming that in week 16 against the San Francisco 49ers, the team lost with a score of 37-30.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the attendance at a game is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"before november 12 , 1995 , there be an attendance of 51342.\" So, the claim is stating that before November 12, 1995, the attendance was 51,342. \n\nNext, I need to examine the table to find any relevant data points. The table has multiple rows with details about games played each week, including the date and attendance numbers.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's an attendance figure that corresponds to before November 12, 1995. Let's list out the relevant weeks and their dates:\n\n- Week 1: September 3, 1995\n- Week 2: September 10, 1995\n- Week 3: September 17, 1995\n- Week 4: September 24, 1995\n- Week 6: October 8, 1995\n- Week 7: October 15, 1995\n- Week 8: October 22, 1995\n- Week 9: October 30, 1995\n- Week 10: November 5, 1995\n- Week 11: November 12, 1995\n\nThe claim specifies \"before November 12,\" so we're looking at all games up until the week ending on November 12. The row for Week 11 is November 12, which is exactly the date in the claim. However, since the claim is about before that date, we need to consider only weeks before Week 11.\n\nNow, I'll look for any attendance numbers in the table where the date is before November 12, 1995. Let's check each week up to Week 10:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance 63,036\n- Week 2: Attendance 52,234\n- Week 3: Attendance 60,088\n- Week 4: Attendance 57,853\n- Week 6: Attendance 56,430\n- Week 7: Attendance 55,703\n- Week 8: Attendance 60,332\n- Week 9: Attendance 61,238\n- Week 10: Attendance 62,839\n\nNone of these attendances equal 51,342. The closest is Week 6 at 56,430, which is higher than 51,342. Therefore, there's no attendance figure in the table for any game before November 12, 1995, that matches 51,342.\n\nThe claim says \"there be an attendance of 51342\" before November 12, but looking through all prior weeks, none have this specific number. This suggests that the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"before week 16, the score be a loss of 37 - 30.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It mentions that before week 16, there was a game where the team lost with a score of 37-30. So, my task is to check if such a game occurred before week 16 in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like the date, opponent, result, and attendance. The weeks are from 1 to 17, with week 16 being December 18, 1995 against the San Francisco 49ers, resulting in a loss of 37-30. So, that's the exact game mentioned in the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"before week 16.\" That means we need to check if this particular loss occurred before week 16. However, looking at the table, week 16 is the 16th week of the season, and the game on December 18, 1995, is indeed week 16. So, technically, it's not before week 16; it's happening in week 16.\n\nBut wait again, maybe I'm misinterpreting \"before week 16.\" Does that mean any game prior to week 16, i.e., weeks 1 through 15? If so, then the claim is saying that there was a loss with a score of 37-30 before week 16. But looking at all the games from week 1 to week 15, I don't see another game with a result of l 37 - 30.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nWeeks 1-15:\n\nRow 1: Week 1, loss 31-14\nRow 2: Week 2, win 20-10\nRow 3: Week 3, loss 23-17 (OT)\nRow 4: Week 4, win 44-24\nRow 5: Week 6, win 23-17 (OT)\nRow 6: Week 7, loss 20-17 (OT)\nRow 7: Week 8, loss 38-21\nRow 8: Week 9, loss 14-6\nRow 9: Week 10, win 27-24\nRow 10: Week 11, win 30-24 (OT)\nRow 11: Week 12, win 43-24\nRow 12: Week 13, loss 44-38\nRow 13: Week 14, win 31-17\nRow 14: Week 15, win 27-11\n\nNone of these games have a result of l 37 - 30. The only game with that exact score is in week 16, which is the same week as the claim's reference to week 16.\n\nSo, does \"before week 16\" include week 16 or not? I think it doesn't because week 16 is the cutoff. So if the loss happened in week 16, then before week 16 would be up to week 15, which doesn't have that score. Therefore, the claim's statement is incorrect because there was no such loss before week 16.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is referring to any game before week 16, regardless of when it happened in the season. But in this case, the only l 37-30 is in week 16 itself. So, the claim says \"before week 16,\" which would mean games prior to week 16, i.e., weeks 1-15. Since none of those have that result, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if \"before week 16\" includes week 16 as well, then the claim is TRUE because there was a loss in week 16 with that score. But I think usually, when someone says \"before week X,\" they mean before that week, not including it. So, it's more likely FALSE.\n\nBut wait again, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is about the existence of such a game before week 16. Since the game in week 16 is after week 15 but in the same season, if the user means games played before week 16 (i.e., prior to that week), then it's not there. But if \"before week 16\" refers to in previous seasons or something else, which doesn't make sense here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is FALSE because the loss of 37-30 happens in week 16 itself, not before it.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",
