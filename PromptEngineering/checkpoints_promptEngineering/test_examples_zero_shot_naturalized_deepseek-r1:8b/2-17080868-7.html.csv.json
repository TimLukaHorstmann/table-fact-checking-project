    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says, \"minnesota have an attendance of 11921 at the target center.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. It's about Minnesota having a specific attendance number at Target Center for one of their games.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized into rows, each representing a game with various attributes like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. \n\nI need to find out if there's a row where the team is Minnesota, the location is Target Center, and the attendance matches 11921.\n\nStarting from Row 1: The team is Minnesota, date January 2. The location is Target Center with an attendance of 11921. That seems to match exactly what the claim says.\n\nI should check if any other rows have Minnesota as the team at Target Center, but looking through all 14 rows, only Row 1 has Minnesota playing at Target Center. \n\nTherefore, since there's a corresponding row where Minnesota had 11921 attendance at Target Center, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
