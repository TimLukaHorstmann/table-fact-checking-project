    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"25.7 million international tourist visit russia in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to find where Russia is mentioned. Scanning through, I see that Row 9 has country: russia, which matches the claim's mention of Russia.\n\nLooking specifically at Row 9, under \"international tourist arrivals (2012),\" it says 25.7 million. That exact number is in the 2012 column for Russia. So the data in this cell directly supports the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect the answer. The change columns don't influence whether the number itself is correct; they only show the increase from previous years. Since the claim is about the exact figure in 2012, those changes aren't necessary unless I'm verifying something else, but here it's just the count.\n\nSo, all the information needed to confirm the claim is present in Row 9 under \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\". No other rows or columns provide additional relevant data for this specific claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the UNWTO region of Asia is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"in the unwto region of asia , 57.7 million international tourist arrival (2012) which be less than in 2011\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It seems to say that in the Asia region, the number of international tourist arrivals in 2012 was 57.7 million, and this figure was actually lower compared to 2011. So, I need to check if the data in the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's organized into rows with various details. The key columns relevant here are \"country\", \"unwto region\", and the numbers for each year (2012, 2011) along with the changes between those years. \n\nSince the claim is specifically about the Asia region, I should focus only on rows where the \"unwto region\" is Asia. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Europe\n- Row 2: North America\n- Row 3: China (and its region is Asia)\n- Rows 4 to 9: European countries\n\nSo, the only row in the Asia region is Row 3. Let's examine this row closely.\n\nIn Row 3:\n- Rank: 3\n- Country: China\n- UNWTO Region: Asia\n- International Tourist Arrivals (2012): 57.7 million\n- International Tourist Arrivals (2011): 57.6 million\n\nThe change from 2011 to 2012 is +0.3%, which means there was an increase, not a decrease.\n\nNow, the claim says that in 2012, the arrivals were less than in 2011. However, according to the data, China's tourist arrivals increased slightly from 57.6 million to 57.7 million. Therefore, the number of international tourists in 2012 was actually higher than in 2011, not lower.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect based on the provided data. The relevant cells are Row 3, which provides the necessary numbers for both years in the Asia region.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"international tourist arrivals (2012)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
