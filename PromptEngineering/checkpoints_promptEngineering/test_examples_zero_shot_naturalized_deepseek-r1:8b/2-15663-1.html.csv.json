    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"43243 live birth have a migration of -14873.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two specific numbers: 43243 and -14873. The claim links these numbers to \"live births\" and \"migration,\" so I need to find if there's a row in the table where live births are exactly 43243 and migration is -14873.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row has several columns related to population averages, live births, deaths, natural change, etc. The relevant columns for the claim are \"live births\" and \"migration.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check these values. \n\nStarting from Row 1: Live births are 49,291 and migration is -26,342. Not matching.\nRow 2: Live births 47,464; migration -21,177. Still not matching.\nRow 3: Live births 45,559; migration -18,789. Nope.\nRow 4: Live births 44,843; migration -18,959. Not it.\nRow 5: Live births 46,370; migration -19,436. Close but not the numbers given in the claim.\nRow 6: Live births 43,243; migration -14,873. Wait a minute, that's live births as 43,243 and migration as -14,873. The claim says live births are 43,243 and migration is -14,873. That matches exactly!\n\nSo I should check if this row (Row 6) has these exact numbers. Yes, it does. Therefore, the claim is supported by Row 6's data.\n\nNow, to confirm that there's no other row with these same values, I'll continue checking:\n\nRow 7: Live births 43,385; migration -13,470. Different from the claim.\nRow 8: Live births 43,112; migration -13,741. Still not matching.\nRow 9: Live births 42,782; migration -14,515. No match.\nRow 10: Live births 40,508; migration -9,718. Doesn't fit.\nRow 11: Live births 39,673; migration -14,488. Different numbers.\nRow 12: Live births 39,348; migration -15,000. Again, not the same as the claim.\n\nSince only Row 6 matches both the live births and migration numbers specified in the claim, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are from Row 6 for \"live births\" and \"migration.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data found in Row 6 of the table. Specifically, the row contains the exact values mentioned in the claim for both \"live births\" and \"migration.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live births\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"migration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
