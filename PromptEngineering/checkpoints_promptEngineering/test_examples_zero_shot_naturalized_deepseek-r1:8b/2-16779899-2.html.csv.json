    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down what I need to do step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"week 15th's game on december 14 , 1986 be a win of 34 - 3.\" So, they're saying that in week 15, which took place on December 14, 1986, against a specific opponent, the team won by a score of 34-3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week. The rows are numbered from 1 to 16. I need to find the relevant row for week 15 and check the details there.\n\nRow 15: week: 15, date: december 14 , 1986, opponent: cleveland browns, result: l 34 - 3, attendance: 58062.\n\nWait a second, so in week 15, they played against the Cleveland Browns. The result was a loss, not a win. The score is listed as \"l 34 - 3\", which I think stands for a loss with a score of 3-34 (since usually it's written as home team - visiting team). So, if the claim says they won by 34-3, that's incorrect because they actually lost.\n\nBut let me make sure. The result column shows \"l 34 - 3\". That 'l' probably stands for loss. So yes, they lost the game, not won it. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, regarding which cells are relevant: The key information needed to verify the claim would be the week number (to confirm it's week 15), the date (December 14, 1986), and the result. So, I need to identify these columns in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. So the relevant columns are \"week\", \"date\", and \"result\".\n\nIn the JSON output, each relevant cell is an object with \"row_index\" (the row number) and \"column_name\". Since rows start at 1, I'll need to note that row 15 corresponds to week 15.\n\nSo, for the date, row_index is 15, column_name is \"date\", and it's December 14, 1986. For the result, row_index is 15, column_name is \"result\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include these two entries: one for the date and another for the result.\n\nPutting this together, I can now construct the JSON response as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check the details of week 15 in the table. The game on December 14, 1986, resulted in a loss with a score of 34-3, not a win.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
