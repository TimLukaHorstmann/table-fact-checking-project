    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001\". \n\nFirst, I should look at the year 2001 in the table to see if there's any relevant information about Susan Sarandon. From the table, row 3 corresponds to 2001. It mentions the category as \"favorite voice from an animated movie\" and the film is \"rugrats in paris : the movie\". The winner/nominee(s) are listed as Susan Sarandon with a result of \"won\". \n\nSo, Susan Sarandon was indeed the winner in the category of favorite voice from an animated movie for the film \"rugrats in paris : the movie\" in 2001. This matches the claim exactly, so the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Susan Sarandon won in 2001 for her role in \"rugrats in paris : the movie\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"bruce willis be nominate for the film rugrats go wild\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions Bruce Willis being nominated for a film called \"Rugrats Go Wild.\" So, looking at the table provided, I should look for any row that matches both the name of the person (Bruce Willis) and the movie title (\"Rugrats Go Wild\") in the same category.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table to see if there's a match. \n\nRow 1: year is 1997, category is favorite movie actress, film is \"Harriet the Spy,\" winner/nominee is Rosanne O'Donnell. This doesn't involve Bruce Willis or \"Rugrats Go Wild.\"\n\nRow 2: year 1999, category favorite movie, film \"The Rugrats Movie.\" Winner is N/A, result won. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 3: 2001, category favorite voice from an animated movie, film \"Rugrats in Paris: The Movie,\" winner Susan Sarandon, result won. Still not matching the claim.\n\nRow 4: 2004, category favorite voice from an animated movie, film \"Rugrats Go Wild.\" Winner is Bruce Willis, and the result is nominated. Oh, this looks promising because it's the same film title as in the claim and the winner is Bruce Willis.\n\nSo, this row directly relates to the claim since both the person (Bruce Willis) and the film (\"Rugrats Go Wild\") are mentioned here. \n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might also match, but looking through the rest of the table:\n\nRow 5: Jim Carrey for \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\" \u2013 not Bruce or the right movie.\n\nRow 6: Jack Black for \"Nacho Libre\" \u2013 again, different person and movie.\n\nRow 7: Dakota Fanning for \"Charlotte's Web\" \u2013 no match.\n\nRow 8: Johnny Depp for \"Rango\" \u2013 wrong person and different film.\n\nSo, only Row 4 matches the claim. Therefore, the information in that row supports the statement given.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by a specific entry in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"the winner / nominee (s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n1. Year: 2007\n2. Category: favorite movie actor\n3. Winner/Nominee(s): Rosie O'Donnell\n\nNow, I need to check each row of the table to see if it matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: year 1997, category favorite movie actress, film harriet the spy, winner/nominee(s) rosie o'donnell, result nominated. So this is for a movie actress in 1997, not a movie actor and not in 2007.\n\nRow 2: year 1999, category favorite movie, film rugrats movie, winner/nominee(s) n/a, result won. Doesn't match the year or category.\n\nRow 3: year 2001, category favorite voice from an animated movie, film rugrats in paris : the movie, winner/nominee(s) susan sarandon, result won. Again, not matching the year or category.\n\nRow 4: year 2004, category favorite voice from an animated movie, film rugrats go wild, winner/nominee(s) bruce willis, result nominated. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: year 2005, category favorite movie actor, film lemony snicket's a series of unfortunate events, winner/nominee(s) jim carrey, result nominated. This is for 2005, so not 2007.\n\nRow 6: year 2007, category favorite movie actor, film nacho libre, winner/nominee(s) jack black, result nominated. So in 2007, the favorite movie actor is Jack Black, not Rosie O'Donnell.\n\nRow 7: year 2007, category favorite movie actress, film charlotte's web, winner/nominee(s) dakota fanning, result won. This is for a movie actress, so not relevant to the claim which is about an actor.\n\nRow 8: year 2012, category favorite voice from an animated movie, film rango, winner/nominee(s) johnny depp, result nominated. Doesn't match.\n\nFrom this analysis, there's no row in the table where, for the year 2007 and category \"favorite movie actor,\" the winner or nominee is Rosie O'Donnell. The closest related entries are Rows 6 and 7, but they don't mention Rosie. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rosie O'Donnell was the winner/nominee for the 2007 favorite movie actor category. Checking each relevant row in the table:\n\n- **Row 6** (year 2005): Jim Carrey won, not Rosie.\n- **Row 7** (year 2007): Dakota Fanning was the actress winner.\n\nNo matching entry found for Rosie O'Donnell in 2007 as a movie actor nominee.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner / nominee (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\" So, breaking that down, they're talking about the year 1999, the category \"favorite movie,\" and the result being \"nominated.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row for 1999. Scanning through the rows, Row 2 is year 1999. Now, in that row, the category is favorite movie, film is The Rugrats Movie. Then there's winner/nominee(s) as N/A and result as won.\n\nWait a minute, so in Row 2, the result is \"won.\" But the claim says it was nominated. That doesn't match. So that would mean the claim is false because the actual result for that row is a win, not a nomination.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not missing anything else. The column we're interested in is the result column. So for Row 2, the result is \"won,\" which directly contradicts the claim of being nominated. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",
