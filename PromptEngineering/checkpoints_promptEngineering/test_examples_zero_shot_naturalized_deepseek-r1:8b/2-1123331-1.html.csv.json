    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"hydraulics , drive by damon hill , have a grid number bigger than 1\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main points: \"hydraulics\" and \"drive by damon hill\", both of which need to have a grid number bigger than 1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a driver's performance in a race. The columns relevant here are \"time / retired\" and \"grid\". The claim seems to be about specific drivers related to these categories.\n\nThe term \"hydraulics\" appears as a reason for retirement in some rows, specifically rows 21 and 22. Row 21 is Damon Hill with grid number 7, and row 22 is Ricardo Rosset with grid number 18. So, we need to check if both \"hydraulics\" (as a time / retired column) and \"drive by damon hill\" relate to grid numbers over 1.\n\nStarting with \"hydraulics\", since it's in rows 21 and 22, but the claim refers to \"hydraulics , drive by damon hill\". So we're focusing on Damon Hill's row (row 21). His grid is 7, which is bigger than 1. Now, does \"hydraulics\" relate here? The time / retired for Damon Hill in row 21 is hydraulics. But the claim says both \"hydraulics\" and \"drive by damon hill\". So perhaps it's about two separate entries: one where the retirement reason is hydraulics and another related to Damon Hill.\n\nWait, no, the claim seems to be making a statement that connects both hydraulics and Damon Hill. Maybe the idea is that hydraulics (as a time / retired entry) has a grid number over 1, but I think the main focus is on Damon Hill's grid number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that there are multiple instances where either \"hydraulics\" or \"drive by damon hill\" have grid numbers greater than 1. Looking at the table:\n\n- Hydraulics: appears in rows 21 and 22. Both have grid numbers 7 and 18, which are >1.\n- Damon Hill's row is row 21 with grid 7.\n\nSo, both of these conditions (hydraulics having grid>1 and drive by damon hill having grid>1) are true because:\n\n1. Hydraulics in row 21: grid 7>1\n2. Drive by Damon Hill (row 21): grid 7>1\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\nBut wait, I need to check each part carefully. The claim is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as either:\n\n- For each occurrence of \"hydraulics\" in the time / retired column, their grid numbers are >1, and for each occurrence of \"drive by damon hill\", their grid numbers are >1.\n\nAlternatively, it might mean that the combination of hydraulics and Damon Hill's drive both have grid numbers over 1. Either way, looking at the table:\n\n- Hydraulics occurs in two rows: 21 (Damon Hill) and 22 (Ricardo Rosset). Both grids are >1.\n- Drive by Damon Hill is specifically row 21 with grid 7>1.\n\nSo both parts of the claim hold true. Therefore, the overall claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
