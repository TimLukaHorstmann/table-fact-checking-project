    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's talking about movies released before 2009 and their lifetime India distributor shares being zero. So, I need to check if all movies with a release year before 2009 have a lifetime share of zero in their row.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are ten rows, each representing a different movie with various details like rank, movie name, year, studio, and lifetime India distributors share. The columns relevant here are \"year\" and \"lifetime india distributors share\".\n\nThe claim is specifically about movies where the release year is earlier than 2009. So, I should look for movies released before 2009 and check their distributor share.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Year 2013 \u2013 after 2009.\nRow 2: Year 2012 \u2013 after 2009.\nRow 3: Year 2009 \u2013 exactly 2009, so not earlier than 2009.\nRow 4: 2013 \u2013 same as Row 1.\nRow 5: 2012 \u2013 same as Row 2.\nRow 6: 2011 \u2013 after 2009.\nRow 7: 2010 \u2013 same.\nRow 8: 2012 \u2013 same.\nRow 9: 2012 \u2013 same.\nRow 10: 2011 \u2013 same.\n\nWait, so actually, in the table provided, all movies listed are released from 2009 onwards. There's no movie with a release year before 2009. Therefore, there are no rows where the year is earlier than 2009. \n\nBut the claim states that for movies earlier than 2009, their lifetime share should be zero. Since there are no such movies in the table, does this mean the statement is vacuously true? Or do I need to consider all possible movies released before 2009?\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is saying that any movie released before 2009 has a lifetime India share of zero. But since there's no data on any such movies, maybe it's implying that if there were any, their share would be zero.\n\nBut in logic terms, a universal statement like \"All A are B\" can be true if there are no As, because there's no counterexample. So, if there are no movies before 2009 with shares, the claim could be considered TRUE because none exist that disprove it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The table doesn't have any data points for movies before 2009, so perhaps the statement is trivially true because there's nothing to contradict it.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The claim is about movies with a release year earlier than 2009 having a lifetime share of zero. Since there are no such movies in the table, does that make the claim TRUE? Or is it FALSE because we don't know what their shares were?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. If the statement is \"For all movies released before 2009, their lifetime India share is zero,\" and if there are no such movies, then it's a vacuous truth because there are no counterexamples.\n\nBut another perspective: maybe the claim is saying that in the table provided, any movie with a release year earlier than 2009 has a share of zero. Since none exist, technically, all of them (zero) have shares of zero, so the statement holds.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be TRUE because there are no movies before 2009 in the table, and thus their shares must be zero as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking if any movies released before 2009 exist in the table. Since none do, it's considered vacuously true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"no lifetime india distributors share be given earlier than 2009\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that none of the movies in the table had their distributor shares (lifetime India distribution) recorded before the year 2009. So, my task is to check each movie's year and see if any of them are before 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows, each representing a different movie with various attributes like rank, movie name, year, studio, and distributor share. The key here is to focus on the \"year\" column for each row because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Movie - Chennai Express, Year - 2013. That's after 2009, so doesn't apply.\nRow 2: Ek Tha Tiger, Year - 2012. Also after 2009.\nRow 3: 3 Idiots, Year - 2009. This is exactly the cutoff year mentioned in the claim. So, if the claim says \"earlier than 2009,\" does 2009 count as earlier? That's a bit tricky because \"earlier\" usually means before, not including the same year. But I'll note it for now.\nRow 4: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Year - 2013. After 2009.\nRow 5: Dabangg 2, Year - 2012. Also after.\nRow 6: Bodyguard, Year - 2011. This is before 2009. So this one definitely violates the claim because it's given earlier than 2009.\nRow 7: Dabangg, Year - 2010. Before 2009 as well.\nRow 8: Rowdy Rathore, Year - 2012. After.\nRow 9: Agneepath, Year - 2012. After.\nRow 10: Ready, Year - 2011. Also before 2009.\n\nWait, so looking at rows 3, 6, and 10, the years are in 2009 or earlier. Specifically, rows 6 and 10 have years before 2009 (2011), while row 3 is exactly 2009. The claim says \"no lifetime...share be given earlier than 2009.\" If \"earlier\" means strictly before, then row 3's year of 2009 would not violate the claim. But if \"earlier\" includes 2009 as well, then rows 6 and 10 are problematic.\n\nBut wait, let me check the exact wording of the claim again: \"no lifetime india distributors share be given earlier than 2009.\" So \"earlier than\" might mean before 2009, not including 2009. If that's the case, only rows with years less than 2009 would violate it.\n\nSo rows 6 and 10 are in 2011, which is indeed earlier than 2009, so their data should be considered relevant. However, row 3 is in 2009, which is not earlier than 2009, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"no...share be given earlier than 2009.\" So if any share was given before 2009 (i.e., in years less than 2009), then the claim would be false. Since rows 6 and 10 have shares from 2011, which is before 2009, that means their data should be checked.\n\nSo to verify this claim, I need to look at all movies where the year is before 2009 because those are the ones that might have given a share earlier than 2009. Therefore, rows 6 and 10 (both in 2011) should be considered relevant.\n\nWait, but hold on: row 3 is in 2009, which is not earlier than 2009, so it's fine. But if the claim is that no shares were given before 2009, then any movie with a year less than 2009 would have violated this, making the claim false.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows where year < 2009: rows 6 and 10, which have lifetime India distributor shares of 79.49 and 64.58 respectively.\n\nTherefore, since these exist, the claim is false because those movies had their share given earlier than 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that no lifetime India distributors share was given before 2009. By examining the table, we find that movies released in 2011 (Bodyguard and Ready) had shares recorded before 2009. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributors share\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"agneepath be release first in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that \"agnhepath\" was released first in 2010. So, I need to check two things: whether the movie \"agneepath\" was indeed released in 2010 and if it was the first one in that year or the highest-ranked among all the movies listed.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a different movie with details like rank, release year, studio, and lifetime India distributor share. I'm particularly interested in two columns here: \"movie\" and \"year.\" \n\nI'll start by locating the row for \"agneepath.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n1. chennai express - 2013\n2. ek taiger - 2012\n3. 3 idsots - 2009\n4. yeh jawaani hai deewani - 2013\n5. dabangg 2 - 2012\n6. bodyguard - 2011\n7. dabangg - 2010\n8. rowdy rathore - 2012\n9. agneepath - 2012\n10. ready - 2011\n\nWait, the ninth row is \"agneepath\" with a year of 2012. So according to this, the movie was released in 2012, not 2010 as the claim states. That already suggests that part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nBut I should also check if it's the first one released in 2010 or any other year. Looking again, there are movies like \"dabangg\" (row 7) with a release year of 2010. So maybe \"agneepath\" wasn't even released in 2010. That would make the claim incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if \"agneepath\" was indeed released first in 2010 or any other context that might support the claim. Since the table shows it was released in 2012, and there's another movie (\"dabangg\") released earlier in 2010, the claim is definitely false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the ones where \"movie\" is \"agneepath\" (row 9) and \"year\" is 2012. Therefore, the claim that it was released first in 2010 is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because \"agneepath\" was released in 2012, not 2010.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"movie\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the year 2009 and a movie called \"ek tha tiger.\" I should look for this information in the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each with details about different movies, including their rank, release year, studio, and lifetime India distributor share.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one that matches both the movie name and the year 2009. Let me scan the 'movie' column:\n\n- Row 1: Chennai Express (2013)\n- Row 2: Ek Tha Tiger (2012)\n- Row 3: 3 Idiots (2009)\n- Row 4: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013)\n- Row 5: Dabangg 2 (2012)\n- Row 6: Bodyguard (2011)\n- Row 7: Dabangg (2010)\n- Row 8: Rowdy Rathore (2012)\n- Row 9: Agneepath (2012)\n- Row 10: Ready (2011)\n\nFrom this, the only movie that matches both the name \"Ek Tha Tiger\" and the year 2009 is... Wait, actually, Ek Tha Tiger was released in 2012, not 2009. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at Row 3: movie is 3 Idiots (year 2009). The claim mentions \"ek tha tiger\" which is different from \"3 Idiots.\" So the claim is about Ek Tha Tiger being released in 2009, but according to the table, it was actually released in 2012. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 2: Ek Tha Tiger (2012)\nRow 3: 3 Idiots (2009)\n\nSo Ek Tha Tiger's release year is 2012, not 2009. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, to identify which cells are relevant. The claim mentions \"Ek Tha Tiger\" and the year 2009. So I need to find where Ek Tha Tiger is in the table and its release year.\n\nLooking at Row 2: it has movie \"ek tha tiger,\" year 2012. Therefore, the cell with row_index 2 (since rows start from 0 or 1? Wait, the first row is rank 1, which is probably row index starting at 0 or 1. Let me check:\n\nThe instruction says to return a list of objects each with \"row_index\" and \"column_name.\" The example given uses row_index: 0, so I think it's zero-based. So Row 2 in the table is actually row_index 1.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. If rank starts at 1 for Row 1, then row_index would start at 0 for Row 1, meaning that:\n\nRow 1: row_index 0\nRow 2: row_index 1\n...\nSo Ek Tha Tiger is in Row 2 (rank=2), which is row_index=1.\n\nThe columns relevant are 'year' and 'movie.' So the relevant cells would be for Ek Tha Tiger's release year, which is 2012. Therefore, column 'year' at row_index 1.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release.\" So they're asserting that Ek Tha Tiger was released in 2009. But according to the table, it was released in 2012. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- For movie: \"ek tha tiger\" at row_index=1.\n- For year: 2012.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about release year being 2009, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be where Ek Tha Tiger is listed, which is Row 2 (row_index=1) and column 'year' in that row.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also check if there's another movie named Ek Tha Tiger released in 2009. From the table, I don't see any other movie with that name, so it's definitely in Row 2.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n{\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"year\"}\n\nBecause that's where the release year is stated as 2012, which contradicts the claim of 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Ek Tha Tiger\" was released in 2009. However, according to the table, \"Ek Tha Tiger\" was actually released in 2012. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}",
