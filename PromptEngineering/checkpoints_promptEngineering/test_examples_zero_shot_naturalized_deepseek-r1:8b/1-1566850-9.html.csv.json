    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction about the pictorial in the 11-98 issue. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states that \"the name of the pictorial in the 11 - 98 issue be girl of the acc.\" So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that in row 11-98 (which corresponds to date: 11 - 98), the pictorials column has \"girl of the acc.\"\n\nNow, I should look at each relevant row starting from row 1 up to row 11. The user provided rows 1 through 9 and part of row 10, but no row 11. Wait, let me check again. The table given goes up to Row 9: date: 11 - 98. So actually, the last full row provided is row 9, which corresponds to date: 11 - 98. Therefore, I should consider that as the relevant row for the claim.\n\nLooking at row 9 (date: 11 - 98), the columns are:\n- cover model: julia schultz\n- centerfold model: tiffany taylor\n- interview subject: mike tyson\n- 20 questions: drew pinsky\n- pictorials: girls of the acc\n\nSo, in row 9, the pictorial is listed as \"girls of the acc.\" The claim refers to \"girl of the acc,\" which is singular. There's a discrepancy here\u2014the correct term in the table is plural, while the claim uses singular.\n\nNow, I need to check if the claim exactly matches the data. Since the claim says \"girl\" instead of \"girls,\" it doesn't align perfectly with what's in the table. However, perhaps there was a typo or miscommunication. Maybe the intended name is \"Girls of the ACC,\" so \"Girl of the acc\" might be incorrect.\n\nBut based on strict comparison, the name in the table is \"girls of the acc.\" The claim uses \"girl,\" which is singular and doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false because it doesn't correctly reflect the actual pictorial name as listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the singular form while the table has the plural. Thus, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"pictorials\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 centerfold in the 9 - 98 issue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says there should be exactly one centerfold in the 9-98 issue of the magazine. So, I need to check the specific row that corresponds to date: 9 - 98 and see how many centerfolds are listed there.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: date: 2 - 98\nRow 2: date: 3 - 98\n...\nRow 7: date: 9 - 98\n\nSo, the relevant row is Row 7. Now, within Row 7, I need to check the centerfold model.\n\nLooking at Row 7's data:\n- cover model: lisa rinna\n- centerfold model: vanessa gleason\n- interview subject: daniel patrick moynihan\n- 20 questions: kevin williamson\n- pictorials: lisa rinna\n\nThe centerfold model is listed as Vanessa Gleason. That's one centerfold.\n\nSo, there's exactly one centerfold in the 9 - 98 issue. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to map this out, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The key column here is \"centerfold model\" in Row 7. So, row_index is 6 because rows start from 0. Wait, no, wait: the first row is Row 1, but in JSON it's row_index as an integer starting at 0. So, Row 1 corresponds to row_index 0, Row 2 is row_index 1, and so on. Therefore, Row 7 is actually row_index 6.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is in row_index 6, column_name \"centerfold model\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"centerfold model\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table seems to be from an issue of a magazine, maybe \"Playboy\" given the context like cover models and centerfold models. The claim is specifically that \"matt drudge was interviewed in the 8 - 98 issue.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table provided. Each row corresponds to a specific date in 1998, from 2-98 up to 11-98, so each row represents an issue of the magazine. The rows are numbered from Row 1 to Row 9.\n\nLooking for Matt Drudge's interview, I should check each row's \"interview subject\" column because that's where the person being interviewed is listed. \n\nStarting with Row 1: interview subject is Conan O'Brien. Not Matt.\nRow 2: Kevin Kline. Nope.\nRow 3: Joe Eszterhas. No.\nRow 4: Scott Adams. Not him.\nRow 5: Jerry Springer. Still no.\nRow 6: Here's the key one. Row 6, date is 8-98. The interview subject is Matt Drudge. That matches exactly what the claim says. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might have him, but from a quick glance, only Row 6 has Matt Drudge as the interview subject. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by Row 6's data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Matt Drudge is listed as the interview subject in the 8-98 issue of the magazine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"interview subject\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"john peterman be ask 20 question in the issue where the centerfold be marliece andrada.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions two specific things: \n1. John Peterman was asked to do 20 Questions.\n2. In that same issue (row), the centerfold model is Marliece Andrada.\n\nSo I need to look through each row of the table to find if there's a row where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, cover model, centerfold model, interview subject, 20 questions, and pictorials. \n\nI'll go row by row:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Cover Model: Daphne Deckers\n  - Centerfold Model: Julia Schultz\n  - Interview Subject: Conan O'Brien\n  - 20 Questions: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nNo match here.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Date: 3 - 98\n  - Cover Model: Marliece Andrada\n  - Centerfold Model: Marliece Andrada\n  - Interview Subject: Kevin Kline\n  - 20 Questions: John Peterman\n  - Pictorials: Jaime Pressly, Erika Eleniak\n\nHere, the centerfold model is Marliece Andrada and the 20 Questions are answered by John Peterman. So both conditions of the claim are met in this row.\n\nSince Row 2 satisfies both parts of the claim, it seems TRUE.\n\nNow, to map which cells are relevant:\n- The row index is 1 (since counting starts at 0, but in JSON it's probably 1-based).\nWait, actually, looking back, in the table, Row 1 corresponds to index 0 if we start from 0. But the user might expect row indices starting at 1. I need to clarify.\n\nIn the example provided, the relevant cells are given with row_index as integers, but it's unclear if they're 0-based or 1-based. However, looking at Row 2 in the table (which is the second row), its index would be 1 if starting from 0, or 2 if starting from 1.\n\nWait no, in the table, each row is labeled as date: x - 98. So Row 1 is the first one, corresponding to index 0, but perhaps the user expects row indices to start at 1. But in the example given, the relevant cells are for row_index 0 and 1, which would correspond to the first two rows.\n\nBut in the claim, it's about Marliece Andrada being the centerfold, which is in Row 2 (second row), so row_index should be 1 if we start counting from 0. Or perhaps it's considered as index 2 if starting from 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user wants the JSON to have \"row_index\" as an integer, which is likely 0-based or 1-based. But in the table, each row starts with \"date: x - 98\", so Row 1 would be index 0, Row 2 index 1, etc.\n\nWait no, looking at the first example, they have:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo row indices are 0-based. Therefore, in Row 2 of the table (which is the second entry), the index would be 1.\n\nTherefore, for Row 2:\n\n- The relevant cells are the ones under '20 questions' and 'centerfold model'.\n\nSo the column names are \"20 questions\" and \"centerfold model\".\n\nThus, the relevant_cells should include both of these from row_index 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified in Row 2 where John Peterman answered 20 Questions and Marliece Andrada was the centerfold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"20 questions\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"centerfold model\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"jaime pressly erika eleniak be feature in the pictorial in the issue where john peterman be ask 20 question.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Feature in the pictorial**: So, both Jaime Pressly and Erika Eleniak should be listed under the 'pictorials' column.\n2. **Issue where John Peterman is asked 20 questions**: This means that there must be a row where the '20 questions' column has John Peterman.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to find if both conditions are met.\n\nStarting with Row 1: \n- Date: 2 - 98\n- Cover model: Daphne Deckers\n- Centerfold model: Julia Schultz\n- Interview subject: Conan O'Brien\n- 20 Questions: Paul Thomas Anderson\n- Pictorials: Juli Ashton and Doria of Playboy TV's Night Calls\n\nNo mention of Jaime Pressly or Erika Eleniak here, and John Peterman isn't in the '20 Questions' column.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: 3 - 98\n- Cover model: Marliece Andrada\n- Centerfold model: Marliece Andrada\n- Interview subject: Kevin Kline\n- 20 Questions: John Peterman (found here)\n- Pictorials: Jaime Pressly and Erika Eleniak\n\nHere, in Row 2, both 'Jaime Pressly' and 'Erika Eleniak' are under the 'pictorials' column.

The claim is about the name of the pictorial in the 11-98 issue being Lisa Rinna. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's a set of rows with various details related to an issue labeled \"11 - 98.\" Each row has several columns: date, cover model, centerfold model, interview subject, 20 questions, and pictorials.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the pictorial in that particular issue.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"1 centerfold be place before the 9 - 98 issue.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"1 centerfold\" likely refers to a specific model featured in the centerfold section of a magazine issue. \"Before the 9 - 98 issue\" means this centerfold appeared in an earlier issue than issue number 9 from August 1998.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific date and issue number, with various fields like cover model, centerfold model, interview subject, etc. The key columns here are \"date\" and \"centerfold model.\"\n\nI need to check if any centerfold models appear before issue 9-98. So, I should look at all the rows except row 8 (since it's 10-98) but focusing on dates before 9-98, which would be from 2-98 up to 8-98.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: date is 2-98. The centerfold model is Julia Schultz.\nRow 2: 3-98, centerfold is Marliece Andrada.\nRow 3: 4-98, centerfold is Holly Joan Hart.\nRow 4: 5-98, centerfold is Deanna Brooks.\nRow 5: 7-98, centerfold is Lisa Dergan.\nRow 6: 8-98, centerfold is Angela Little.\n\nEach of these rows is before the 9-98 issue. So, each centerfold in these issues would logically be placed before the 9-98 issue. Therefore, there are multiple instances where a centerfold was placed before the 9-98 issue.\n\nThe claim says \"1 centerfold be place,\" which might imply just one, but from the table, there are several. However, even if it's more than one, as long as at least one exists before the 9-98 issue, the claim is true.\n\nI should check if any of these are relevant to support the claim.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table provided. Each row represents a specific issue, probably from 2-98 to 11-98 since the date column goes up to 11-98. Within each row, there are several columns: cover model, centerfold model, interview subject, 20 questions (which I assume is an interviewer), and pictorials.\n\nThe claim mentions Tori Spelling being interviewed in the 8 - 98 issue. So, I need to check if there's a row with \"date: 8 - 98\" where Tori Spelling appears as the interview subject.\n\nLet me look at Row 6: date is 8 - 98. The columns are:\n- cover model: Julie Brown\n- centerfold model: Angela Little\n- interview subject: Matt Drudge\n- 20 questions: Bruce Willis\n- pictorials: Downtown Julie Brown, The Women of Iceland\n\nI don't see Tori Spelling listed as the interview subject here. Now, I should check if she appears anywhere else in the table related to that date.\n\nLooking at Row 6 again, none of the other columns have Tori Spelling's name except maybe pictorials, but \"downtown Julie Brown\" and \"The Women of Iceland\" don't mention Tori. So, Tori isn't the interview subject on this row.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if she appears in any other role for that date? Let me see: cover model is Julie Brown, centerfold is Angela Little, so no. The pictorials are with Julie and the Women of Iceland. No mention of Tori here either.\n\nIs there another row where Tori Spelling could be the interview subject? Let's check others:\n\nRow 9: date 11-98 has Mike Tyson as the interview subject, not Tori.\n\nWait, looking back at Row 6 again, maybe I missed something. The claim says \"Tori Spelling BE interviewed,\" so perhaps it's in the 20 Questions section. Let me see: for Row 6, 20 Questions is Bruce Willis. Not Tori.\n\nSo, none of the columns in Row 6 have Tori Spelling as the interview subject.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"linda brava be ask 20 question in the issue where the centerfold be laura cover.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break this down into parts. The claim has two main points:\n1. Linda Brava was asked to answer 20 questions.\n2. This happened in an issue where the centerfold model is Laura Cover.\n\nSo, I need to check both conditions against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific issue (date: x - 98) with various details like cover model, centerfold model, interview subject, and so on.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows have \"linda brava\" as the cover model or any other relevant role. From the table:\n\n- Row 3: cover model is Linda Brava.\n- Row 4: cover model is Geri Halliwell.\n- Row 8: centerfold model is Laura Cover.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for rows where Linda Brava is involved in answering 20 questions and where the centerfold is Laura Cover. So, first, let's find all relevant rows that match these criteria.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3:\n- cover model: Linda Brava\n- centerfold model: Holly Joan Hart\n- interview subject: Joe Eszterhas\n- 20 questions: Keith Olbermann\n- pictorials: Linda Brava, Jody Watley\n\nSo, in Row 3, the centerfold isn't Laura Cover. Therefore, if the claim is about an issue where the centerfold is Laura Cover, this row doesn't match.\n\nRow 8:\n- cover model: Cindy Crawford\n- centerfold model: Laura Cover\n- interview subject: Geraldo Rivera\n- 20 questions: Tori Spelling\n\nHere, the centerfold is indeed Laura Cover. But who was the person asked to answer 20 questions? It's Tori Spelling. The claim says Linda Brava was asked, so this doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a row where both conditions are met: Linda Brava answering 20 questions and the centerfold being Laura Cover.\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\nRow 3: Linda Brava is cover model; centerfold is Holly Joan Hart. 20 Questions: Keith Olbermann, not Linda Brava.\n\nIs there any other row where the centerfold is Laura Cover? Let me check:\n\nRows:\n1. Row 2: centerfold Marliece Andrada\n2. Row 3: centerfold Holly Joan Hart\n3. Row 4: centerfold Deanna Brooks\n4. Row 5: centerfold Lisa Dergan\n5. Row 6: centerfold Angela Little\n6. Row 7: centerfold Vanessa Gleason\n7. Row 8: centerfold Laura Cover\n8. Row 9: centerfold Tiffany Taylor\n\nSo, only Row 8 has Laura Cover as the centerfold model.\n\nNow, in Row 8, who is answering the 20 questions? It's Tori Spelling. So Linda Brava isn't there.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again: \"linda brava be ask 20 question in the issue where the centerfold be laura cover.\"\n\nSo, the issue (row) must have Laura Cover as the centerfold, and Linda Brava must be answering 20 questions.\n\nLooking for such a row:\n\nIn Row 8, centerfold is Laura Cover, but 20 Questions are answered by Tori Spelling. Therefore, Linda Brava isn't there.\n\nIs there any other row where the centerfold is Laura Cover? Let me check again; no, only Row 8 has Laura Cover as centerfold.\n\nSo, in that case, the claim is saying that in the issue where the centerfold is Laura Cover, Linda Brava was asked to answer 20 questions. But from the table, in Row 8, it's Tori Spelling who answered. Therefore, the claim is false because Linda Brava isn't present there.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if Linda Brava appears anywhere else as someone answering 20 questions or in any other relevant role that might make the claim true elsewhere.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: Linda Brava is the cover model and appears in pictorials but not as an interviewer subject. The 20 Questions are answered by Keith Olbermann, so no.\n\nRow 1: Centerfold Julia Schultz; 20 Qs: Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nRow 2: Centerfold Marliece Andrada; 20 Qs: John Peterman.\n\nRow 3: As above.\n\nRow 4: Cover model Geri Halliwell; 20 Qs: Ben Stiller.\n\nRow 5: 20 Qs: Craig Kilborn.\n\nRow 6: 20 Qs: Bruce Willis.\n\nRow 7: 20 Qs: Kevin Williamson.\n\nRow 8: 20 Qs: Tori Spelling.\n\nRow 9: 20 Qs: Drew Pinsky.\n\nSo, Linda Brava is never listed as the person answering 20 questions. She is only mentioned in Row 3 and 8 as cover model or pictorial.\n\nThus, the claim's first condition isn't met because Linda Brava wasn't asked 20 questions in any of the rows where the centerfold was Laura Cover (only Row 8).\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"centerfold model\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"20 questions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination.\n\nThe claim states: \"julie brown be ask 20 question in the issue where the cover model be cindy crawford.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components. It mentions two specific elements:\n\n1. Julie Brown is asked 20 questions.\n2. The issue (row) has Cindy Crawford as the cover model.\n\nI need to find if there's a row in the table where the cover model is Cindy Crawford and see if Julie Brown appears in the \"20 Questions\" column for that same row.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Cover model is Daphne Deckers. Not Cindy Crawford.\nRow 2: Cover model is Marliece Andrada. No.\nRow 3: Linda Brava. No.\nRow 4: Geri Halliwell. No.\nRow 5: Karen McDougal. No.\nRow 6: Julie Brown's cover model is her own, but the cover model here is Cindy Crawford? Wait, no, row 10 has Cindy Crawford as cover model.\n\nWait, I need to check each row carefully:\n\nRow 8: Date: 10-98. Cover model is Cindy Crawford. In this same row, who is the \"20 Questions\" person? It's Tori Spelling. So Julie Brown isn't there.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me list out all rows with their cover models and 20 Questions:\n\nRow 1: Cover - Daphne Deckers, 20Q - Paul Thomas Anderson\nRow 2: Cover - Marliece Andrada, 20Q - John Peterman\nRow 3: Cover - Linda Brava, 20Q - Keith Olbermann\nRow 4: Cover - Geri Halliwell, 20Q - Ben Stiller\nRow 5: Cover - Karen McDougal, 20Q - Craig Kilborn\nRow 6: Cover - Julie Brown, 20Q - Bruce Willis\nRow 7: Cover - Lisa Rinna, 20Q - Kevin Williamson\nRow 8: Cover - Cindy Crawford, 20Q - Tori Spelling\nRow 9: Cover - Julia Schultz, 20Q - Drew Pinsky\n\nSo, in row 6, the cover model is Julie Brown. But the claim says the issue where cover model is Cindy Crawford. So I need to find a row where cover model is Cindy Crawford and see if Julie Brown is in 20 Questions.\n\nLooking at all rows, only row 8 has Cindy Crawford as cover model. In that row, the 20 Questions person is Tori Spelling, not Julie Brown. Therefore, there's no row where both conditions are met: cover model is Cindy Crawford AND Julie Brown is the 20 Questions subject.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"20 questions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"jaime pressly erika eleniak feature in the pictorial in the issue where ben stiller ask 20 question.\" So, I need to check if both Jaime Pressly and Erika Eleniak appear together in a pictorial section of an issue where Ben Stiller conducted a 20 Questions interview.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different date in 1998. Each row includes information about the cover model, centerfold model, interview subject, the person asking 20 questions (20_questions), and the pictorials featured.\n\nLet me go through each row to see if there's an instance where both Jaime Pressly and Erika Eleniak are listed as pictorials in the same row where Ben Stiller is the one asking 20 Questions.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It mentions \"pictorials: juli ashton and doria of playboy tv 's night calls.\" Neither Jaime nor Erika are here, and the 20_questions person is Paul Thomas Anderson, not Ben Stiller.\n\nRow 2: Here, the cover model and centerfold model are both Marliece Andrada. The pictorials listed are Jaime Pressly and Erika Eleniak. Wait, that's exactly who we're looking for! But let's check who the 20_questions person is here. It says John Peterman, not Ben Stiller.\n\nSo, in Row 2, while both Jaime and Erika are present as pictorials, Ben Stiller isn't the one asking the questions. Therefore, this row doesn't fully support the claim because the condition about Ben Stiller's involvement isn't met.\n\nMoving on to other rows:\n\nRow 3: Pictorials are Linda Brava and Jody Watley. Neither Jaime nor Erika here. 20_questions is Keith Olbermann, not Ben Stiller.\n\nRow 4: Pictorials are Geri Halliwell and Elizabeth Green. No match for Jaime or Erika. 20_questions is Ben Stiller! Oh, that's interesting. Here, the person asking 20 questions is Ben Stiller, but the pictorials don't include either Jaime or Erika.\n\nRow 5: Pictorials are Karen McDougal and The Newton Girls. No match. 20_questions is Craig Kilborn.\n\nRow 6: Pictorials are Julie Brown and The Women of Iceland. No match. 20_questions is Bruce Willis.\n\nRow 7: Pictorials are Lisa Rinna alone. No match. 20_questions is Kevin Williamson.\n\nRow 8: Pictorials are Cindy Crawford alone. No match. 20_questions is Tori Spelling.\n\nRow 9: Pictorials are Girls of the ACC. No match for Jaime or Erika. 20_questions is Drew Pinsky.\n\nSo, from this analysis, in none of the rows do both Jaime Pressly and Erika Eleniak appear as pictorials alongside Ben Stiller asking 20 questions. Each of them appears with different people when their names are present.\n\nIn Row 2, they're together but not with Ben Stiller. In Row 4, Ben Stiller is there, but without Jaime or Erika.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by any row in the table. Both conditions (their presence in pictorials and Ben Stiller asking 20 questions) don't occur in the same row. So, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because neither Jaime Pressly nor Erika Eleniak appear with Ben Stiller during a 20 Questions segment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"pictorials\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"20_questions\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
