    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota's leadership.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about a term start date and who was leading at that time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2 corresponds to Kostaq Kota (1st time). His term started on September 5, 1928, which matches the date in the claim. So this row is definitely relevant because it has both the name, term start date, and political party.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect the claim. The claim mentions \"the earliest term start,\" so I need to ensure no one else started earlier. Looking at other rows:\n\nRow 1 seems to be about prime ministers from 1928-1939 but doesn't provide specific details on term starts.\n\nRows 3 and 4 are about other leaders who took office after September 1928, so their term starts (March 6, 1930, and October 22, 1935) are later than September 5, 1928.\n\nRow 5 is Kostaq Kota's second term, starting in November 1936, which is also later.\n\nTherefore, the earliest term start under Kostaq Kota was indeed on September 5, 1928. The table fully supports this claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check for the earliest term start by Kostaq Kota, which is on September 5, 1928.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term_start\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the oldest prime minister , 1872 - 1963\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the oldest prime minister who lived from 1872 to 1963. So, I need to check if in the table provided, there is a row for Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri and whether his term as prime minister aligns with this claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: This seems to be the header row, listing various attributes like name, born-died, term start, etc. So it's not a data row but just labels.\n\nRows 2-5 are data rows about specific prime ministers during the time period 1928-1939.\n\nNow, focusing on Row 4: The name is Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time). His born-died is 1872 - 1963. His term was from October 22, 1935, to November 9, 1936. So he served as a prime minister during that period.\n\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived from 1872 to 1963 and was the oldest prime minister. From the table, his birth and death years are indeed 1872-1963, which matches the claim's first part.\n\nNow, about being the oldest prime minister: The term \"oldest\" could be interpreted in a couple of ways. It might mean he had the longest lifespan among the listed prime ministers or that he served the earliest or latest terms. Alternatively, it could refer to him holding the position at the oldest age, which isn't directly indicated here.\n\nLooking at the other rows:\n\nRow 2: Kostaq Kota (1st time) was born in 1889 and died in 1949, serving from September 5, 1928, to March 5, 1930. So he lived until 1949, which is later than Mehdi's death in 1963? Wait, no\u2014Mehdi died in 1963, so he actually lived longer than Kostaq.\n\nWait, let me check: Mehdi was born in 1872 and died in 1963. That's a lifespan of about 91 years. Kostaq was born in 1889 and died in 1949, which is 60 years old. So Mehdi was indeed older than Kostaq when he passed away.\n\nSimilarly, Pandeli Evangjeli (Row 3) was born in 1859 and died in 1939, so he lived until 1939. That's a lifespan of about 80 years, which is less than Mehdi's 91 years. So Mehdi was older than him too.\n\nKostaq Kota again in Row 5, same as before, but this time he served later. His death year isn't mentioned here, but since the table ends at Row 5, we can assume that Kostaq died in 1949, which is earlier than Mehdi's 1963.\n\nSo, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was indeed the oldest person to have served as a prime minister during that period. He lived longer than the others mentioned in the table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the oldest prime minister , 1872 - 1963.\" So it's saying he lived from 1872-1963 and was the oldest PM. From the table, his birth and death years are correct. Also, among the other listed PMs, he had the longest lifespan.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there were any other prime ministers not listed in the table who might have a longer lifespan. But since the table only lists these five, and Mehdi's lifespan is 91 years, which is the longest here, it seems accurate.\n\nSo putting this together: The claim checks out based on the information given in Row 4 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's birth and death years match the claim, and among the listed prime ministers, he was the oldest. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are five rows, each representing a Prime Minister with various details. The relevant columns for the claim seem to be \"political party.\" So, my main focus should be on this column across all rows.\n\nStarting with Row 2: The political party is listed as \"non - party.\" Wait, that seems a bit odd because usually political parties are named. Maybe it's \"non-party,\" meaning they don't belong to any party. That would align with the claim. So, no party affiliation here.\n\nRow 3 also lists \"non - party.\" Same situation as Row 2. No party association, which supports the claim.\n\nLooking at Row 4: It says \"non - party\" again. Consistently, this Prime Minister doesn't have a political party attached. That's in line with the statement.\n\nNow, Row 5 is about Kostaq Kota for the second time. The political party here is also \"non - party.\" So far, every single Prime Minister listed doesn't belong to any political party.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any rows that might have a different entry. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 1: This seems to be the header or an overall category for the prime ministers from 1928-1939, so it's not a specific Prime Minister and thus doesn't list political party information.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5 are individual Prime Ministers with their details.\n\nSo each of these four rows shows \"non - party\" in the political party column. That means all listed Prime Ministers don't have any political parties associated with them.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"all prime minister on the list have no political party\" is TRUE because every relevant cell in the table under \"political party\" for each Prime Minister does not have a party affiliation.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}]}",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"kostaq kota's term start on 9 november 1936, after mehdi bej frash\u00ebri's term end.\"\n\nFirst, I'll locate each person mentioned in the claim within the table.\n\nKostaq Kota is mentioned in rows 2 and 5. In row 2, his first term started on September 5, 1928, and ended on March 5, 1930. Then, in row 5, he has a second term starting on November 9, 1936, ending on April 8, 1939.\n\nMehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is mentioned in row 4. His term started on October 22, 1935, and ended on November 9, 1936.\n\nNow, the claim says that Kostaq Kota's term start on November 9, 1936, came after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term end. So I need to check when each of these events happened relative to each other.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's term ended on November 9, 1936.\n- Kostaq Kota's next term started on the same day, November 9, 1936.\n\nSo, if someone starts their term on the exact day another ends, does that mean it's \"after\"? I think in terms of sequence, the start would follow immediately after the end. So yes, it is correct to say that Kostaq Kota started his term after Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri ended theirs.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.

The claim states: \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri be both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Kostaq Kota was a 1st time Prime Minister of Albania.\n2. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was also a 1st time Prime Minister of Albania.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different prime ministers from 1928 to 1939. Let's analyze each relevant individual mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with Kostaq Kota: \n- Row 2 mentions him as the 1st time Prime Minister. His term was from September 5, 1928, to March 5, 1930.\n- He is also mentioned again in Row 5 as the 2nd time Prime Minister, serving until April 8, 1939.\n\nSo, Kostaq Kota served twice as Prime Minister of Albania, first in 1928 and then again later. Therefore, he was indeed a 1st time Prime Minister during the specified period.\n\nNow, looking at Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri:\n- Row 4 mentions him as the 1st time Prime Minister, with his term starting on October 22, 1935, and ending in November 1936. This makes sense as he's listed as a 1st time prime minister.\n\nThe claim states that both were 1st time Prime Ministers. Since Kostaq Kota served twice, his first term was indeed in 1928-1930. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is clearly noted as the 1st time in 1935-1936. Therefore, both individuals had their first terms during the specified period.\n\nI need to check if there's any information that contradicts this or if perhaps they were both 1st time Prime Ministers at different times within the given timeframe. The table shows each of their terms clearly, and both are marked as \"non-party,\" which doesn't affect their status as Prime Ministers.\n\nSo, based on the table data provided, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out correctly based on the table data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the second oldest prime minister after pandeli evangjeli.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify who Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri and Pandeli Evangjeli are from the table. Looking at Row 4, Mehdi's term is from 22 October 1935 to 9 November 1936, and he was a non-party prime minister. In Row 3, Pandeli Evangjeli served from 6 March 1930 to 16 October 1935, also as a non-party PM.\n\nWait, but the claim is about their order of age when they were prime ministers. So I need to see who was older between Mehdi and Pandeli at that time. The table gives their birth and death years. Pandeli was born in 1859 and died in 1939. Mehdi was born in 1872 and died in 1963.\n\nSo when both were serving as prime ministers, let's check their ages. Pandeli Evangjeli was born in 1859, so by 1935 (when Mehdi started his term), Pandeli would be 76 years old. Mehdi was born in 1872, so in 1935 he would be 63. That makes Pandeli older than Mehdi during their overlapping terms.\n\nWait, but the claim says Mehdi is the second oldest after Pandeli. So if Pandeli is the oldest and Mehdi is the next, that fits the claim. However, I should check who else was a prime minister around them to make sure there's no one older. From the table, Rows 2 and 5 are Kostaq Kota. The first term of Kostaq started in 1928, which is before both Pandeli and Mehdi. He was born in 1889, so by 1930 he would have been 41. That's younger than both Pandeli and Mehdi.\n\nSo the oldest prime minister at that time would be Pandeli, followed by Mehdi. Therefore, Mehdi being the second oldest after Pandeli is correct. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri was the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli Evangjeli. From the table, both served as non-party prime ministers during different terms between 1930 and 1939. \n\n- **Pandeli Evangjeli** (born 1859) was older than **Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri** (born 1872). \n- **Kostaq Kota** (born 1889) was younger than both, so he doesn't affect their order.\n\nThus, Mehdi is indeed the second oldest after Pandeli. The claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row has details like name, birth and death years, term start and end dates, and political party. The claim mentions the \"first\" prime minister starting their term in 1927, but I need to check the table for relevant information.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different prime minister and their terms.

It seems like the person is trying to say that Albania has been seen as having a prime minister who comes from a political party.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different prime minister during the time frame 1928-1939. Each row includes details like name, term start and end, political party, etc.\n\nSo, I need to check if any of these prime ministers listed in the table are associated with a political party. If even one is from a party, then the claim might be TRUE because it says \"come from a political party.\" But wait, let me look at each row.\n\nRow 2: Name is Kostaq Kota (1st time), political party is non-party.\nRow 3: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), non-party.\nRow 4: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri, non-party.\nRow 5: Kostaq Kota (2nd time), non-party.\n\nSo all the prime ministers listed in the table are from the \"non - party\" political group. That means none of them came from a traditional political party as defined by organized parties with specific names. Therefore, the claim that Albania has seen a prime minister who comes from a political party might be FALSE because all listed here are non-partisans.\n\nWait, but maybe the term \"political party\" is interpreted differently. If \"non - party\" is considered as not belonging to any party, then they don't come from a political party. So the claim would be incorrect because none of them were from a party.\n\nAlternatively, if \"non-party\" implies they are independents, perhaps the original claim's wording might still hold if it's about being part of a political group, but in this case, they're explicitly stated as non-parties.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since all relevant entries in the table indicate that the prime ministers were non-partisans, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the only 1st time minister of albania be pandeli evangjeli.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to be saying that Pandeli Evangjeli was the first person who held a ministerial position in Albania and that there's no one else who served as the first minister before him.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several individuals with details like their names, birth and death years, term start and end dates, and political party. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"name,\" \"born - died,\" \"term start,\" and \"term end.\"\n\nNow, I need to check each row to see if any other person served as a minister before Pandeli Evangjeli. \n\nRow 1: This seems like a header row, so it's probably not relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 2: The name is Kostaq Kota (1st time). His term started on September 5, 1928, and ended in March 1930. So he was a minister before Pandeli Evangjeli, who started his term on March 6, 1930. That means Kostaq Kota was the first minister, not Pandeli.\n\nRow 3: This is Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time). His term started in 1930 and ended in 1935. But since Kostaq Kota was already a minister earlier, this doesn't support the claim that he's the only 1st time minister.\n\nRows 4 and 5 are about other individuals who served after Pandeli Evangjeli. None of them were ministers before him except Kostaq Kota in Row 2.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is false because Kostaq Kota was the first minister, not Pandeli Evangjeli.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we check each row for individuals who served as ministers of Albania. Kostaq Kota (Row 2) served before Pandeli Evangjeli, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
