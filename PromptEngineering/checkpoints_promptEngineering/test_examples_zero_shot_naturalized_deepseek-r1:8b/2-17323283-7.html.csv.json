    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that the opponent for game 75 is the Minnesota North Stars. Let me check the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should find the row corresponding to game 75. Looking at the table, each row starts with \"game: x\". So I'll go through each row until I find where game is 75.\n\nRow 13 has game: 75. So that's the relevant row for game 75.\n\nNow, in that row, the columns are game, march, opponent, score, and record. The important one here is the \"opponent\" column. Let me check what it says.\n\nIn Row 13, the opponent is listed as Minnesota North Stars. Wait, no\u2014it actually says \"minnesota north stars\". So the case might differ, but I think the exact name matters. The claim mentions \"Minnesota North Star\"\u2014is that the same?\n\nWait, in the table, it's written as \"minnesota north stars\" (lowercase 's'). The claim uses \"Minnesota North Star\" with a capital S. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or difference in naming. But I think they are referring to the same team, just different casing.\n\nSo, the opponent for game 75 is indeed the Minnesota North Stars as per the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nWait, but in Row 13, it's \"opponent: minnesota north stars\". The claim says \"the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north star\". Wait, does that mean the singular form? Or is it a typo?\n\nLooking back, I think \"North Stars\" is plural. So maybe the claim has a typo, using \"star\" instead of \"stars\". But regardless, the team name in the table matches what's in the claim, just with different casing.\n\nSo, even though there might be minor differences in casing or pluralization, the main point is that the opponent is the Minnesota North Stars. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"after march 2 the minnesota north star be not the opponent until game 75.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. March 2 is a date in the table, and the game numbers go up from there. The key here is checking when the Minnesota North Stars are listed as opponents after March 2 and whether they appear again before game 75.\n\nLooking at the table rows, I see that the opponent column has entries like \"minnesota north stars.\" I'll need to check all rows where the opponent is Minnesota North Stars and see if any of them come after March 2 and before game 75.\n\nLet me go row by row. Row 1: Game 63, March 1. Opponent is California Golden Seals. Not relevant. Row 2: Game 64, March 2. Opponent is Buffalo Sabres. After March 2, but opponent isn't Minnesota North Stars. So game 64 is after March 2, but the opponent is not MN North Stars.\n\nThen I need to check each row starting from March 3 onwards until game 75. Let's see:\n\nRow 3: Game 65, March 5. Opponent is Vancouver Canucks. Not MN North Stars.\nRow 4: Game 66, March 8. Opponent is Chicago Black Hawks.\nRow 5: Game 67, March 11. Opponent is Detroit Red Wings.\nRow 6: Game 68, March 12. Opponent is California Golden Seals.\nRow 7: Game 69, March 15. Opponent is Chicago Black Hawks.\nRow 8: Game 70, March 16. Opponent is Detroit Red Wings.\nRow 9: Game 71, March 18. Opponent is Philadelphia Flyers.\nRow 10: Game 72, March 19. Opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs.\nRow 11: Game 73, March 23. Opponent is Boston Bruins.\nRow 12: Game 74, March 25. Opponent is Montreal Canadiens.\nRow 13: Game 75, March 26. Opponent is Minnesota North Stars.\n\nWait a minute, game 75 is the first time after March 2 that the opponent is MN North Stars. But the claim says they are \"not the opponent until game 75.\" So does that mean that before game 75, after March 2, they weren't opponents?\n\nLooking back, I need to check if there's any row between March 3 and March 26 (before game 75) where the opponent is MN North Stars. From my initial scan above, none of the games from 64 onwards up to 74 have MN North Stars as the opponent. So the first time they are opponents after March 2 is indeed game 75.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true because there's no mention of MN North Stars being opponents between March 2 and game 75.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"the opponent for game 75 be the minnesota north stars with a record of 48 - 15 - 13.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts. The first part is about the opponent for game 75, and the second part is about the team's record being 48-15-13.\n\nStarting with the opponent: I need to find out who the opponent was in game 75. Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific game. So, I should look for the row where the \"game\" number is 75.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: game 63\nRow 2: game 64\n...\nContinuing until I find game 75. Let's see, row 13 is game 75. So, row_index 13 and column_name \"opponent\".\n\nIn row 13, the opponent is listed as \"minnesota north stars.\" That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the record: The claim says the record is 48-15-13. Looking at row 13, the score is 5 - 0, but then in the record column, it's 48 - 15 - 12. Wait, that doesn't match the claim which states 48-15-13.\n\nHmm, so there might be an inconsistency here. Let me double-check. The record for row 13 is indeed 48 - 15 - 12. So the claim says 48-15-13, but according to the table, it's 48-15-12.\n\nSo that means the record part of the claim doesn't match the table. Therefore, the entire claim is not fully supported because both the opponent and the record need to be correct for the claim to be TRUE.\n\nWait, no, actually the opponent part matches, but the record does not. So since one part is wrong, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut I should verify if perhaps I misread something. Let me check row 13 again. Game:75, march:26, opponent: minnesota north stars, score:5-0, record:48-15-12. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the opponent is correct, but the record is incorrect in the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because one of the conditions isn't met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for game 75, the opponent was the Minnesota North Stars with a record of 48-15-13. \n\nChecking the table:\n- Game 75 (row 13) has the opponent as \"minnesota north stars.\" This part is correct.\n- However, the record listed in row 13 is 48-15-12, not 48-15-13. This part is incorrect.\n\nSince one of the conditions doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the lowest game number of the game after march 2 with the detroit red wing as the opponent be 76.0.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what's being asked. The key elements are:\n1. Game numbers.\n2. After March 2nd.\n3. Opponent is Detroit Red Wings.\n4. Lowest game number among those games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, march (which I assume is the game number in the season), opponent, score, and record. \n\nI think \"march\" refers to the sequence of games in the season. So, for example, March 1 would be game 63, March 2 would be game 64, and so on. The claim mentions \"after March 2,\" which probably means starting from game number 65 onwards.\n\nNext, I need to filter the table to find rows where the opponent is the Detroit Red Wings. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is California Golden Seals.\n- Row 2: Buffalo Sabres.\n- Row 3: Vancouver Canucks.\n- Row 4: Chicago Black Hawks.\n- Row 5: Detroit Red Wings (first occurrence).\n- Row 6: California Golden Seals.\n- Row 7: Chicago Black Hawks.\n- Row 8: Detroit Red Wings (second occurrence).\n- Row 9: Philadelphia Flyers.\n- Row 10: Toronto Maple Leafs.\n- Row 11: Boston Bruins.\n- Row 12: Montreal Canadiens.\n- Row 13: Minnesota North Stars.\n- Row 14: Detroit Red Wings (third occurrence).\n\nSo, the relevant rows are 5, 8, and 14 where the opponent is Detroit Red Wings.\n\nNow, focusing on these three games. The \"march\" number corresponds to the game sequence. So, for after March 2 (game 64), we look at games starting from 65 onwards. Therefore, all three of these rows are relevant because they occur after March 2.\n\nNext, I need to find the lowest game number among these three. The game numbers are:\n- Row 5: Game 67.\n- Row 8: Game 70.\n- Row 14: Game 76.\n\nThe lowest game number here is 67 (Row 5). However, the claim states that the lowest game number is 76.0. This doesn't match because 67 is lower than 76.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the \"march\" as the season's progression. Alternatively, perhaps \"after March 2\" refers to after a certain point in the schedule, meaning games occurring later in the season have higher game numbers. So the claim might be asking for the highest game number among those that occur after March 2 with Detroit Red Wings as the opponent.\n\nIn that case, looking at the three relevant rows:\n- Row 5: Game 67.\n- Row 8: Game 70.\n- Row 14: Game 76.\n\nThe highest (most recent) game number is 76. So perhaps the claim is referring to this as the lowest in terms of being the last occurrence? But that doesn't make sense because 76 is higher, not lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"lowest\" refers to the minimum value, which would be 67. Since the claim says 76.0, it's incorrect because 67 is the actual lowest among those games after March 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the lowest game number with Detroit Red Wings as opponents after March 2 is 67, not 76.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the lowest game number is 76.0 when in fact it's 67 based on the table provided.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. Identify rows where the opponent is Detroit Red Wings and occurred after March 2 (game numbers 65 onwards).\n2. These rows are 5, 8, and 14 with game numbers 67, 70, and 76.\n3. The lowest game number among these is 67, not 76.\n4. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** \"FALSE\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
