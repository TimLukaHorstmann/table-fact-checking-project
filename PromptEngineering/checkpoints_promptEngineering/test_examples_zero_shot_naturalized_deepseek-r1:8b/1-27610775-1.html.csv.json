This seems to be the correct one.\n  \nNext, I check the US viewers for this episode. The data shows us viewers are 7.1 million.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this is the highest number among all episodes listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about two episode titles and their viewership is true or false. The claim states: \"the episode title radio head have 1 million viewer more than the episode title there go the bride.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be verified. The claim is comparing the number of viewers for two episodes. Each episode has a title, and we're looking at the 'us viewers (millions)' column. So, my goal is to find out if \"Radio Heads\" has 1 million more viewers than \"There Goes the Bride.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should locate both episodes:\n\n1. **Episode Title: Radio Heads**\n   - I'll search for this title in the 'title' column.\n   - Scanning through the rows, I find Row 13: series: 34, season: 13, title: radio heads.\n\n2. **Episode Title: There Goes the Bride**\n   - Similarly, I look for \"There Goes the Bride.\"\n   - This is found in Row 12: series: 33, season: 12, title: there goes the bride.\n\nNext, I need to extract the 'us viewers (millions)' data from both rows. \n\n- For \"Radio Heads\" (Row 13), the viewers are listed as 3.7 million.\n- For \"There Goes the Bride\" (Row 12), the viewers are 2.7 million.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between these two numbers:\n3.7 (Radio Heads) - 2.7 (There Goes the Bride) = 1.0 million.\n\nSo, Radio Heads has exactly 1 million more viewers than There Goes the Bride. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the number of viewers matches the statement provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we locate both episodes in the table and compare their viewer numbers:\n\n- **Radio Heads**: Row 13, 3.7 million viewers\n- **There Goes the Bride**: Row 12, 2.7 million viewers\n\nThe difference is 1.0 million viewers, supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"rich correll directs 6 episodes of 'that's so raven' and dennis rinsler writes 2 episodes of 'that's so raven'.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to see which ones are relevant. Each row has details about a specific episode, including the director and writer.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the episodes directed by Rich Correll. Going through the table:\n\n- Row 2: Directed by Rich Correll.\n- Row 4: Directed by Sean McNamara.\n- Row 5: Directed by Rich Correll.\n- Row 6: Directed by Rich Correll.\n- Row 13: Directed by Rich Correll.\n- Row 14: Directed by Debbie Allen.\n- Row 15: Directed by John Tracy.\n- Row 17: Directed by Sean McNamara.\n- Row 18: Directed by Debbie Allen.\n- Row 19: Directed by Rich Correll.\n- Row 34: Directed by Rich Correll.\n\nWait, but the table only goes up to row 20. So, actually, from row 2 (series 23), series 25, series 26, series 27, series 39? Hmm, no, wait. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1-10, then 11-20. Each row corresponds to a different episode.\n\nLooking for \"Rich Correll\" as the director:\n\n- Row 2: series 23\n- Row 5: series 26\n- Row 6: series 27\n- Row 13: series 34\n- Row 19: series 40\n\nWait, that's five episodes. The claim says six episodes. Did I miss one?\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 2: yes.\n\nRow 5: yes.\n\nRow 6: yes.\n\nRow 13: yes.\n\nRow 19: yes.\n\nIs there another? Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 1: not.\n- Row 2: yes, Rich Correll directs series 23.\n- Row 3: no.\n- Row 4: Sean McNamara.\n- Row 5: Rich Correll, series 26.\n- Row 6: Rich Correll, series 27.\n- Row 7: no.\n- Row 8: John Tracy.\n- Row 9: no.\n- Row 10: no.\n- Row 11: no.\n- Row 12: Debbie Allen.\n- Row 13: Rich Correll, series 34.\n- Row 14: Debbie Allen.\n- Row 15: John Tracy.\n- Row 16: Sarah Jane Hameed and others.\n- Row 17: Sean McNamara.\n- Row 18: Debbie Allen.\n- Row 19: Rich Correll, series 40.\n- Row 20: no.\n\nSo that's five episodes directed by Rich Correll. The claim says six, so maybe the count is off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again:\n\nSeries 23 (row 2), 26 (row5),27(row6),34(row13),40(row19). That's five. So the claim may be incorrect on this point.\n\nNow for Dennis Rinsler as writer. I need to look at each episode's writer and see if he wrote two episodes of 'That's So Raven'.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 2: Writer is Dennis Rinsler? Let me check the column named \"Writer\" or perhaps \"Written by.\" Wait, the table shows columns like Series, Episode Number (I think), Director, and sometimes more info. Let me parse each row.\n\nWait, looking at the structure of the table provided:\n\nEach row starts with \"series: X\", then \"episode number: XX\", then \"director: Name\", and sometimes additional details in parentheses. So for example, Row 2 is series 23, episode 1 (I think), director Rich Correll.\n\nSo, to find Dennis Rinsler as a writer, I need to check the \"Writer\" or \"Written by\" column. But looking at the table, it seems that each row includes information after the colon, but not all rows have detailed info. For example:\n\nRow 2: \"That's So Raven episode 1 (Director: Rich Correll, Writer: Dennis Rinsler)\" \u2013 so yes, Row 2 has Dennis Rinsler as writer.\n\nSimilarly, checking other rows for Dennis Rinsler as a writer:\n\n- Row 4: No mention of Dennis Rinsler.\n- Row5: No.\n- Row6: No.\n- Row7: No.\n- Row8: John Tracy is director and writer? Not sure, but no Dennis.\n- Row9: No.\n- Row10: No.\n- Row11: No.\n- Row12: Debbie Allen as writer.\n- Row13: Rich Correll directs; writer isn't specified beyond the main ones?\nWait, row 13 says \"Written by Beth Schiff & Geoff Tarson\" \u2013 no Dennis.\n\nRow14: Debbie Allen writes it.\n\nRow15: John Tracy writes it?\n\nWait, I'm not sure if each row only lists one writer. Let me check:\n\nLooking at Row2: yes, Dennis Rinsler is the writer.\n\nIs there another episode where he wrote? Let's see:\n\nRow17: Written by Edward C. Evans & Michael Feldman \u2013 no Dennis.\n\nRow19: Writer is Beth Schiff & Geoff Tarson \u2013 no.\n\nRow20: No.\n\nSo only one episode (Row2) has Dennis Rinsler as the writer. The claim says he wrote two episodes, so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: Rich Correll directed five episodes, not six, and Dennis Rinsler wrote only one episode, not two. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Writer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

My task is to check if this is accurate by looking at the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different episode, with details like series number, season, title, director, and other information. I need to find the specific episodes mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with \"blue in the face.\" I'll search for that title in the table.

Scanning again:\n\n- Row 17: title is \"the dating shame.\"\n- The director here is also Sean Mcnamara, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSo both episodes are directed by Sean Mcnamara as stated. Now, I need to make sure there's no conflicting information elsewhere that might disprove this. Looking through all rows:\n\n- For \"blue in the face\" (Row 9), director is Sean Mcnamara.\n- For \"the dating shame\" (Row 17), director is Sean Mcnamara.\n\nNo other entries for these titles, so it seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.

So Row 18 is series 38, season 17; Row 19 is series 39, season 18. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 14: title \"a goat 's tale\"\n\nRow 39: series 40, season 19, title \"the road to audition\"\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, checking their US viewers:\n\nFor Row 14 (series 35-14), US viewers are 4.3 million.\n\nLooking at Row 39 (series 40-19), the original air date is August 6, 2004.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim states: \"the episode title radio head have 1 million viewers less than the episode title there go the bride.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of the claim relate to information in the table. The claim mentions two specific episode titles: \"radio head\" and \"there goes the bride.\" So, my task is to locate these episodes in the table and compare their viewer numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different episode with details like series number, season, title, director, writer, original air date, production code, and US viewers in millions. \n\nI need to find the rows for both \"radio head\" and \"there goes the bride.\" Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 13: series:34, season:13, title: radio heads...\nWait, it says \"radio heads,\" which is slightly different from \"radio head.\" The claim uses \"radio head,\" so maybe that's a typo. But in the table, it's spelled as \"radio heads.\" So perhaps they are referring to two different episodes. I should check both possibilities.\n\n- Row 33: series:33, season:12, title: there goes the bride...\nYes, that's the episode titled \"there goes the bride.\"\n\nNow, I need to find the viewers for each of these episodes.\n\nFor \"radio heads\" (Row13): us viewers (millions) is 3.7.\nFor \"there goes the bride\" (Row33): us viewers (millions) is 2.7.\n\nThe claim says that \"radio head\" has 1 million fewer viewers than \"there goes the bride.\" So, subtracting the two: 3.7 - 2.7 equals exactly 1.0 million. That matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I noticed earlier that the title in Row13 is actually \"radio heads,\" not \"radio head.\" Maybe it's a different episode? Or perhaps it's a typo in the table or the claim. But given the data, Row13 has 3.7 viewers and Row33 has 2.7, so 3.7 is indeed 1 million more than 2.7. \n\nWait, wait. The claim says \"radio head\" has 1 million less than \"there goes the bride.\" So if \"radio head\" is referring to a different episode, perhaps it's another one with a similar title but lower viewers? Or maybe I misread.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nLooking for any other episodes titled \"radio head.\" Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Row 39: title: the road to audition\n- Row 13: radio heads\n- No others. So, perhaps in the claim, it's a typo, and they meant \"radio heads,\" which would be Row13 with 3.7 viewers.\n\nSo comparing 3.7 (radio heads) to 2.7 (there goes the bride), the difference is indeed 1.0 million. Therefore, the claim is correct: radio head has 1 million less than there goes the bride.\n\nBut wait, the claim uses \"radio head\" singular, while the table says \"radio heads.\" Maybe that's a discrepancy. If it's supposed to be singular, perhaps there's another episode with the same title? Or maybe the claim made an error in the title spelling. But based on what's given, I have to work with the data.\n\nSo, considering that the titles might vary slightly (like plural vs singular), but in the table, \"radio heads\" is the exact title for Row13, and it has 3.7 viewers. The other episode, \"there goes the bride,\" has 2.7 viewers. So, 3.7 - 2.7 = 1 million.

The claim says: \"rich correll directs 6 episodes of 'That's So Raven' and dennis rinsler writes 1 episode of 'That's So Raven'.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows are relevant. Looking at the series numbers, 'That's So Raven' is probably from a specific series number. Let me check the titles; wait, actually in the table, each row has the series number and title. For example, Row 1: series 22, title \"Out of Control\", etc. Wait, no, the titles don't necessarily indicate 'That's So Raven'\u2014that might be a running gag or something. Wait, looking back at the instruction, perhaps 'That's So Raven' is another show. Or maybe it's an episode title? Hmm.\n\nWait, in the claim, they refer to \"That's So Raven\" as the series. But in the table, I don't see any row with that exact title. Let me check each row's title:\n\nRow 1: Out of Control\nRow 2: Don't Have a Cow\nRow 3: Run, Raven, Run\nRow 4: Clothes Minded\nRow 5: Four's a Crowd\nRow 6: Hearts and Minds\nRow 7: Close Encounters of the Nerd Kind\nRow 8: That's So Not Raven\nRow 9: Blue in the Face\nRow 10: Spa Day Afternoon\nRow 11: Leave It to Diva\nRow 12: There Goes the Bride\nRow 13: Radio Heads\nRow 14: A Goat's Tale\nRow 15: He's Got the Power\nRow 16: Skunk'd\nRow 17: The Dating Shame\nRow 18: The Road to Audition\nRow 19: The Lying Game\nRow 20: Numb and Number\n\nSo none of the titles directly say \"That's So Raven.\" But in Row 8, the title is \"That's So Not Raven,\" which is similar but different. Maybe that's a clue. Alternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a specific series number for 'That's So Raven.' Let me check if any row has series 40 or so.\n\nWait, looking at the table, each row increments the series number by 1 starting from 22 up to 41 in Row 20. So, 'That's So Raven' might be an incorrect assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is misstated and refers to a different show. But given the context, it's more likely that the claim is about 'That's So Raven.'\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the directors and writers in the table.\n\nThe claim says: Rich Correll directs 6 episodes, and Dennis Rinsler writes 1 episode of \"That's So Raven.\" So, first, I need to find all rows where the director is Rich Correll and the series is \"That's So Raven,\" then check if there are at least 6 such episodes. Similarly for Dennis Rinsler as a writer.\n\nBut since none of the titles say \"That's So Raven,\" maybe it's a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about 'That's So Raven' being another name or maybe a different show entirely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The table lists directors and writers for each episode. For each row, the columns are:\n\n- series\n- director\n- writer(s)\n- title\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to check if Rich Correll directed at least 6 episodes of \"That's So Raven\" and Dennis Rinsler wrote at least 1 episode.\n\nBut in the table, none of the series numbers or titles say \"That's So Raven.\" Therefore, perhaps the series number is 40? Let me check Row 19: series 40, title \"The Lying Game.\"\n\nWait, no. Or maybe it's a different approach. Maybe the claim refers to a specific number of episodes that Rich Correll directed across different series numbers, not just one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes multiple directors and writers for each episode, so I need to compile all the directors and see how many times Rich Correll appears, then do the same for Dennis Rinsler as a writer.\n\nBut the claim is about \"That's So Raven,\" which isn't explicitly mentioned in any title. Therefore, it's unclear whether such a series exists in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The instruction says to check each condition against the table. So for Rich Correll directing 6 episodes of \"That's So Raven,\" I need to find all rows where the director is Rich Correll and the title or series is \"That's So Raven.\" But since neither the titles nor the series numbers match, perhaps this part of the claim isn't supported.\n\nSimilarly, for Dennis Rinsler writing 1 episode of \"That's So Raven,\" again, no such row exists in the table. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no data supporting it within the provided table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Rich Correll directing 6 episodes and Dennis Rinsler writing 1 episode of \"That's So Raven.\" However, the table does not contain any rows with that series number or title. There are multiple directors and writers across various series numbers but no direct evidence supporting the specific claim about \"That's So Raven.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"writer\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion. The claim is: \"sean mcnamara direct both episode blue in the face and skunk'd.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find all episodes directed by Sean McNamara. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Directed by Gerren Keith \u2013 not Sean.\nRow 2: Directed by Rich Correll \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Directed by Rich Correll again.\nRow 4: Directed by Sean McNamara \u2013 yes, that's \"clothes minded.\" So row index 4, directed by Sean.\nRow 5: Rich Correll again.\nRow 6: Rich Correll.\nRow 7: John Tracy \u2013 nope.\nRow 8: Sean McNamara \u2013 another episode, which is \"that 's so not raven\" at row 8.\nRow 9: Sean McNamara \u2013 \"blue in the face,\" so that's at row 9.\nRow 10: Carl Lauten.\nRow 11: Donna Pescow.\nRow 12: Erma Elzy-Jones.\nRow 13: Rich Correll.\nRow 14: Debbie Allen.\nRow 15: John Tracy.\nRow 16: Christopher B. Pearman.\nRow 17: Sean McNamara \u2013 \"the dating shame\" at row 17.\nRow 18: Debbie Allen.\nRow 19: Rich Correll.\nRow 20: Rondell Sheridan.\nRow 21: Not sure if this is part of the table, but looking back, wait, the table ends at row 20? Wait no, actually, it's up to row 41. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided rows from 1 to 20 (since there are 20 entries). Wait, no, in the initial data, I see rows 1 through 20 and beyond. Wait, no, looking back, the table has 20 rows because it goes up to series:41 as row 20? Let me recount.\n\nWait, actually, each row corresponds to a series number. So for example:\n\nRow 1: Series 1\n...\nRow 20: Series 20.\n\nSo in the table provided, Sean McNamara directs several episodes:\n\n- At row 4: clothes-minded (series 4)\n- Row 8: that's so not raven (series 8)\n- Row 9: blue in the face (series 9)\n- Row 17: the dating shame (series 17)\n\nSo he directed at least four episodes. Now, the claim is that Sean McNamara directed both \"blue in the face\" and \"skunk'd.\"\n\nLooking for \"blue in the face,\" which is series 9, directed by Sean at row 9.\n\nNow, looking for \"skunk'd.\" I need to check each episode's title to see if any are named \"skunk'd.\" Let me scan through the table:\n\nRow 1: clothes-minded\n...\nWait, actually, in the table provided, let me look for \"skunk'd.\"\n\nLooking at row 16: skunk'd. Yes, that's series 37, directed by Christopher B. Pearman.\n\nSo \"skunk'd\" is directed by someone else, not Sean McNamara.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while Sean directed \"blue in the face,\" he did not direct \"skunk'd.\" So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\nFor \"blue in the face\": series 9, which is row index 8 (since rows start at 0? Wait, no. Wait, let me check the table again. The first row is series 1, so series numbers are from 1 to 41, and rows go from 1 to 20. So for example, series 4 is row 3, because it's after 1,2,3.\n\nWait, no, in the table provided, each entry seems to be a separate line, starting from series 1 as the first entry. So for example:\n\nRow 1: series 1\nRow 2: series 2\n...\nTherefore, \"blue in the face\" is at series 9, which would be row 8 (since it's the 8th entry). Wait no, let me count:\n\nWait, actually, the table starts with row 1 as series 1. So each row corresponds to one entry. Therefore, for example, series 4 is in row 3: Series 1,2,3,4 correspond to rows 0,1,2,3? Or are they all starting at 1? Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe user listed the table as:\n\nRow 1: series 1\n...\nSo each row is a separate entry. Therefore, for \"blue in the face,\" which is series 9, it's in row 8 (since rows go from 1 to 20). Wait, but the count might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the first row is index 0 or 1? Let me clarify:\n\nIn programming, often lists are zero-indexed. But the user's example has a JSON with row_index as integers, presumably starting at 0. So for the table provided, each line is a row, starting from row 0 (series 1) up to row 19 (series 20).\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nEach entry in the table is a separate row. The first entry is series 1, so it's row index 0.\n\nTherefore, \"blue in the face\" is at series 9, which is the 8th entry after series 1, so that would be row index 8 (since 1+7=8). Wait no: if series 1 is row 0, then series 2 is row 1, ..., series 9 is row 8.\n\nSimilarly, \"skunk'd\" is at series 37, which would be row 36. But since the table only goes up to series 41 as the last entry, let's check:\n\nWait no, in the provided table, there are 20 rows, so that would correspond to series 1 through 20? Or perhaps it's a longer list.\n\nWait, looking at the initial data, after \"series: 41\", but then only up to row 20. So each row is an entry, and the series numbers go beyond 20.\n\nTherefore, \"blue in the face\" is at series 9, which would be row 8 (since 1-9 correspond to rows 0-8). Similarly, \"skunk'd\" is at series 37, so that's row 36. So I need to find those cells.\n\nBut wait, the table provided only goes up to row 20, which corresponds to series 41. Wait, no, each row corresponds to a specific entry, regardless of the series number.\n\nSo for \"blue in the face,\" it's at series 9, so looking through the table:\n\nLooking for the title \"blue in the face\" in the table. From the data provided:\n\nRow 8: Series 9, title is \"blue in the face.\"\n\nYes, so row index 8 corresponds to series 9.\n\nSimilarly, \"skunk'd\" is at series 37, which would be somewhere around row 36, but let me check the exact count.\n\nWait, each row increments by 1 for each series. So if series starts at 1, then row 0: series 1, row 1: series 2,... up to series 20 being row 19.\n\nBut in the provided data, it's not just 20 rows; it goes beyond.\n\nWait no, I think I miscounted. Let me look again:\n\nThe user wrote a list that starts with \"series 1\", then \"series 2\", up to \"series 41\" as the last entry, but only provided 20 entries? That can't be. Wait, perhaps it's a transcription error.\n\nWait no, looking back at the original problem statement: the user wrote \"You are tasked... The data is below.\"\n\nThen listed:\n\nseries 1\nseries 2\n...\nup to series 41\n\nBut then in the table provided, each entry corresponds to a series number. So for example, the first line is series 1, the second is series 2, ..., up to series 41.\n\nSo \"blue in the face\" is at series 9, which would be row index 8 (since starting from 0). Similarly, \"skunk'd\" is at series 37, so row index 36.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows are:\n\n- For \"blue in the face\": series 9, row 8\n- For \"skunk'd\": series 37, row 36\n\nBut wait, does the table provided by the user have that many entries? Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the initial data:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nseries 1\nseries 2\n...\nup to series 41\n\nSo each line is a separate entry, starting from series 1 and going up. So \"skunk'd\" would be in one of these lines. For example:\n\nLooking for the exact line with \"skunk'd\":\n\nIn the data provided by the user:\n\nseries 37: skunk'd (directed by Christopher B. Pearman)\n\nTherefore, series 37 is row index 36.\n\nThus, the cells are:\n\n- Row 8: \"blue in the face\" directed by Sean McNamara\n- Row 36: \"skunk'd\" directed by someone else\n\nSo in the JSON, these would be two separate entries.\n\nBut since the task is to identify the relevant cells for both titles, I need to specify their row indices.\n\nTherefore, the relevant rows are:\n\nFor \"blue in the face\": row index 8\nFor \"skunk'd\": row index 36\n\nHence, these are the two cells that need to be highlighted as incorrect in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires identifying whether Sean McNamara directed both \"blue in the face\" and \"skunk'd.\" After analyzing the data:\n\n- **Blue in the Face**: Directed by Sean McNamara. Found at row 8.\n- **Skunk'd**: Directed by Christopher B. Pearman. Found at row 36.\n\nSince Sean did not direct \"skunk'd,\" the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"task\": \"Identify if Sean McNamara directed both specified episodes.\",\n    \"data\": [\n      {\n        \"series_number\": 9,\n        \"title\": \"blue in the face\",\n        \"director\": \"Sean McNamara\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"series_number\": 37,\n        \"title\": \"skunk'd\",\n        \"director\": \"Christopher B.

The claim states: \"episode a goat 's tale and the road to audition both have the same number of US viewers at 4.6 million.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find these specific episodes. \n\nStarting with \"a goat's tale,\" I search for that title in the 'title' column.

It's in Row 39: series 39, season 18. The viewers for this episode are listed as 4.3 million according to the table. Hmm, that doesn't match the claim of 4.6 million.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. In Row 15, it's \"a goat 's tale\" with 4.3 viewers. Then in Row 39, \"the road to audition\" also has 4.3 viewers.

Let me look carefully:\n\nRow 17: series 37, season 16, title \"skunk'd\" has 5.0 viewers.\nRow 35 is series 35, season 14, title \"a goat's tale,\" viewers 4.3 million (original air date july 23, 2004).\nRow 39: series 39, season 18, title \"the road to audition,\" viewers 4.3 million.\n\nSo both episodes have 4.3 million viewers, not 4.6.
