    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the event in which tony mendoza be the opponent last for 2:41.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions Tony Mendoza as the opponent and that he was involved in an event where the fight lasted until 2:41. So I'm looking for a row where the opponent is Tony Mendoza and the time is 2:41.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 14 rows. Each row has details like 'res', 'record', 'opponent', 'method', 'event', 'round', 'time', and 'location'. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if any match the criteria.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cyrille Diabat\u00e9, time is 2:24. Not matching.\nRow 2: Opponent is Travis Browne, time is 2:29. No.\nRow 3: Opponent is Valentijn Overeem, time 2:08. Nope.\nRow 4: Gian Villante, time 2:49. Doesn't fit.\nRow 5: Bobby Lashley, 5:00. Not matching.\nRow 6: Jon Alexander, 1:13. No.\nRow 7: Eric Garcia, 1:02. Doesn't match.\nRow 8: Steve Sayegh, 2:28. Close but not 2:41.\nRow 9: Shane Ott, time is 1:09. Nope.\nRow 10: John Marsh, time 2:32. Not 2:41.\nRow 11: Tony Mendoza! Let's check the details here. The opponent is Tony Mendoza, and the time is 2:41. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo Row 11 has res as win, record 4-0, opponent Tony Mendoza, method TKO (punches), event WFC: rumble in the rockies, round 1, time 2:41, location Loveland, Colorado, United States. This perfectly aligns with the claim.\n\nI think that's the only row where both the opponent is Tony Mendoza and the time is 2:41. So the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the time for the event in which tony mendoza be the opponent be 2:49\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about an event where Tony Mendoza was the opponent, and the time of that event was 2:49.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a row where the res (result) is either win or loss, but more importantly, the opponent is Tony Mendoza. Then check if the time column for that row is 2:49.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cyrille Diabat\u00e9. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 2: Opponent is Travis Browne. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 3: Opponent is Valentijn Overeem. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 4: Opponent is Gian Villante. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 5: Opponent is Bobby Lashley. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 6: Opponent is Jon Alexander. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 7: Opponent is Eric Garcia. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 8: Opponent is Steve Sayegh. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 9: Opponent is Shane Ott. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 10: Opponent is John Marsh. Not Tony Mendoza.\nRow 11: Opponent is Tony Mendoza. Yes, this is the row we're interested in.\n\nSo, Row 11 has res: win, record: 4-0, opponent: Tony Mendoza, method: tko (punches), event: wfc : rumble in the rockies, round: 1, time: 2:41, location: Loveland, Colorado, United States.\n\nThe time here is 2:41, not 2:49. So the claim says 2:49, but it's actually 2:41. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
