    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"hayate usui be only 1 time defeat in round 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"hayate usui,\" which seems like a name, and specifies that they have only one defeat in round 3. So, my task is to find out if Hayate Usui has exactly one loss recorded specifically in round 3 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a fight event with various attributes: res (result), record (win-loss-draw), opponent's name, method of victory/loss, event type, round number, and time. \n\nI need to search for any row where \"res\" is \"loss,\" the opponent's name is \"hayate usui,\" and the \"round\" is 3. If there's only one such row, then the claim is TRUE; if there are zero or more than one, it would be FALSE.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check these conditions:\n\nRow 1: res=loss, opponent=issei tamura, round=2. Doesn't match.\nRow 2: res=loss, opponent=hiroshi nakamura, round=3. Not Hayate Usui.\nRow 3: res=win, so no loss here.\nRow 4: win as well.\nRow 5: win.\nRow 6: loss, but opponent is shintaro ishiwatari, not Usui, and round=2.\nRow 7: win.\nRow 8: win.\nRow 9: draw.\nRow 10: win.\nRow 11: win.\nRow 12: loss, but opponent is akitoshi tamura, round=2.\nRow 13: win.\nRow 14: loss, opponent=takeshi inoue, round=2.\nRow 15: win.\nRow 16: win.\nRow 17: loss, opponent=keisuke yamada, round=2.\nRow 18: loss, but opponent=takashi inoue, round=2.\nRow 19: loss, opponent=hiroyuki takaya, round=2.\n\nWait, I just went through all rows and didn't find any row where \"res\" is \"loss,\" opponent is Hayate Usui, and round=3. So, does that mean there's no such defeat in round 3? Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because there are zero defeats in round 3 for Hayate Usui.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row. Let me double-check. The table has rows from 1 to 19. Looking again:\n\nRow indices go up to 19, so perhaps I didn't miss any. Each loss is either in round 2 or another round but not with the opponent being Hayate Usui and round 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Hayate Usui has only one defeat in round 3 isn't supported by the table because there are no such losses recorded.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"4 of usui 's fight end before the 5 - minute period be up\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"usui\". Looking at the table, I see that most opponents have names ending with \"-ura\", like Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, etc., which makes me think these are the ring names or perhaps the names of fighters. So maybe \"usui\" refers to a specific fighter, possibly one of these. Alternatively, it might be a typo or shorthand for another name, but given the table's structure, I should look for an opponent named \"usui\".\n\nWait, scanning through all 19 rows, I don't see any opponent with a name that includes \"usui\". The opponents listed are Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, Shinya Kumazawa, Sakae Kasuya, Daisuke Ishizawa, etc. None of these names have \"usui\" in them. So perhaps the claim is about a fighter named Usui, but that's not present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term refers to something else, like a weight class or division. For example, there are events listed as \"shooto\", \"tenkaichi fight\", etc., which might indicate different fighting styles or divisions. But I'm not sure how that relates to the claim about fights ending before 5 minutes.\n\nThe claim says that four of Usui's fights ended before the 5-minute period was up. So, I need to look for rows where \"usui\" is the fighter and see if their record has four losses or wins before the 5th minute.\n\nBut since \"usui\" isn't an opponent in any row, perhaps the claim is about a fighter who lost four times under 5 minutes. Let's check each row to see if there's a fighter named Usui.\n\nLooking again at all rows, I don't see any mention of Usui as an opponent or fighter. Therefore, it's possible that either:\n\n1. The claim is incorrect because there's no fighter named Usui in the table.\n2. Alternatively, maybe \"usui\" refers to something else, like a style or organization, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven that none of the opponents are named Usui, I think the claim can't be fully supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions a fighter named \"usui,\" who isn't present in any of the opponent rows. Since there's no relevant data about such a fighter, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's referring to three wins by someone named Usui, and each of those wins was decided by a majority decision.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that there are multiple rows where the result (res) is a win, and the method is either \"decision (unanimous)\" or \"decision (majority)\". The opponent names vary, so Usui isn't directly listed as an opponent. \n\nWait, maybe the claim is about Usui's wins, but in the table, the opponents are all different Japanese-sounding names like Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, etc. So perhaps the focus is on the fighter named Usui who has these three wins. However, I don't see any row where the res is a win and the name is Usui.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"usui\" refers to the method of decision, like a majority decision being referred to as \"usui\". That doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps it's a mishearing or typo. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about three wins by Usui where each was decided by majority.\n\nWait, but in the table, there are several wins with different methods. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Rows 3: win, method: decision (unanimous)\n- Row4: win, method: decision (majority)\n- Row5: win, method: decision (unanimous)\n- Row7: win, method: decision (unanimous)\n- Row8: win, method: decision (unanimous)\n- Row10: win, method: decision (majority)\n- Row11: win, method: decision (unanimous)\n- Row13: win, method: submission (armlock) \u2013 this isn't a decision\n- Row15: win, method: decision (majority)\n- Row16: win, method: decision (majority)\n\nSo from these rows, the wins with majority decisions are Rows4, 10, and 15. That's three wins where Usui may have won by majority decision.\n\nWait, but in the table, the res column is 'win' for these rows, so if those three wins were by majority decision, then the claim would be TRUE. But I need to check whether it's about Usui specifically or just any fighter named something else.\n\nBut looking at the table again, I don't see a row where the name is Usui. The opponents are all different names like Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, etc., and the res column shows wins and losses. So perhaps \"usui\" refers to the fighter, but since there's no such fighter in the table, maybe the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"usui\" refers to a type of decision method (like \"unanimous\" vs \"majority\"), then it's possible that three of their wins were by majority. But the term \"usui\" isn't clear here.\n\nWait, another approach: The claim says \"3 of usui's win be by majority decision.\" So perhaps it's about Usui having three wins, each via a majority decision. In the table, I can count how many times Usui has a 'win' with method as majority decision.\n\nLooking at the rows again:\n\nRow4: opponent Sakae Kasuya \u2013 win, majority\nRow10: opponent Manabu Inoue \u2013 win, majority\nRow15: opponent Seigi Fujioka \u2013 win, majority\n\nThat's three wins by majority. But wait, in Row15, the res is 'win' with method as 'decision (majority)'. So if Usui refers to a fighter who has these three wins, then it would be TRUE. However, I don't see any row where the opponent is Usui or the name of the fighter is Usui.\n\nWait, perhaps \"usui\" refers to something else, like the event type, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe \"usui\" is a typo and refers to \"the fighter's name\".\n\nBut without seeing a row where Usui is the fighter and has three wins by majority, I can't confirm. Alternatively, perhaps \"usui\" refers to something else, like a term in Japanese that translates differently.\n\nWait, another angle: The claim might be misheard or mistyped. Perhaps it's about three wins with a method of \"unanimous\", which is different from majority. Or maybe the fighter's last name is Usui.\n\nBut looking at the table, I don't see any row where the name ends with Usui. For example:\n\nRow0: Issei Tamura\nRow1: ?\nWait, the table starts from Row0 to Row16 perhaps? Wait, the table might have more rows beyond what's shown here, but based on the initial data given, I can only go up to Row16.\n\nWait, in any case, the key is that the claim refers to three wins by Usui via majority decisions. Since there are no rows where the fighter is Usui and res is win with method as majority, unless it's implied that \"usui\" refers to a type of decision (which isn't clear), then perhaps the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if the table only includes the opponents and not the fighters, then maybe Usui is another column, but it's not shown here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: It says the relevant cells should have \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So in this context, perhaps the claim refers to three rows where the result is a win and the method is majority decision.\n\nSo, regardless of the fighter's name, if there are three such rows, then it's TRUE. From the table:\n\nRow4: win, decision (majority)\nRow10: win, decision (majority)\nRow15: win, decision (majority)\n\nThat's three wins with majority decisions. Therefore, the relevant cells would be these three rows, columns \"res\" and \"method\". But the problem is that the claim specifically mentions Usui, which isn't in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the column for fighter's name is missing. If there's a column named something like \"fighter\", then if those three wins are by Usui, then it would be TRUE. Otherwise, it's false.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the columns aren't mentioned except that in the example, they have \"Revenue\" and \"Employees\". So perhaps in this table, the relevant columns are \"res\" and \"method\".\n\nBut the claim mentions \"usui's win\", so maybe it refers to a fighter named Usui. If such a fighter exists in any row with three wins via majority, then TRUE. Otherwise, FALSE.\n\nSince I don't see a row where the fighter is Usui, perhaps the answer is FALSE.\n\nWait, but without knowing if there's an Usui fighter, maybe the claim is based on method types. For example, if \"usui\" refers to a type of decision, like \"unanimous\", then it would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that three wins were by majority decisions, regardless of the fighter's name, which would make the answer TRUE based on the rows mentioned.\n\nBut given that the claim specifically says \"usui\", I think it refers to a specific fighter. Since there are no Usui fighters in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe claim is: \"the defeat by a ko do not occur in the same tournament as the drawn match.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that a defeat via KO does not happen in the same tournament where there was a draw. So I need to check if any rows have both a KO defeat and a draw.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, time.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any have a draw in the 'method' column or 'event'. \n\nRow 9: res is draw, event is pip - east vs west. So this is a draw match.\nLooking for KO defeats, I need to check if any other row has a method of KO.\n\nWait, looking through the methods, I don't see any rows with \"ko\" as the method. The methods listed are mostly decisions (unanimous, majority), submission, tko, etc., but not KO. So maybe that's a point.\n\nBut the claim is about defeats by KO and draws in the same tournament. If there are no KO defeats in the table, then it's impossible for both to occur together. But I need to check each row again.\n\nWait, let me look carefully:\n\nRow 14: res: loss, method: ko (punch). So this is a KO defeat.\nAnd Row 9: draw.\n\nSo Row 9 has a draw, and Row 14 has a KO defeat. Now, are these in the same tournament? Well, each row represents a fight, but the table doesn't specify tournaments. It's possible that these two fights occurred in different tournaments or the same one.\n\nWait, but the table is likely listing all the fighter's results over time. So it's possible that both a draw and a KO defeat happened in the same tournament if they are part of the same event. But I'm not sure because the 'event' column varies (e.g., shooto, pip - east vs west, etc.), so each event might be a different one.\n\nAlternatively, the claim is about whether any single tournament had both a draw and a KO defeat. Since the table doesn't specify tournaments, it's unclear. However, if Row 14 and Row 9 are in the same tournament, then the claim would be false because there was a draw (Row 9) and a KO (Row 14). \n\nBut I can't confirm that they are in the same tournament because the table doesn't provide that information. Therefore, perhaps there's no evidence to support that both events occurred together.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: if any row has both a draw and a KO defeat in the same column? No, each row is a single event.\n\nAlternatively, check if any row has both a draw and a KO defeat elsewhere, but since each row is one fight, they can't have both. So perhaps the claim is that within the table, there isn't any row where a KO defeat happened alongside a draw in the same tournament.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is to see if any single event had a draw and a KO, but each row is one fight, so they can't have both. Therefore, the claim might be true because no single fight has both, but the tournaments could have both in different fights.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me re-examine the table.\n\nLooking for rows where res is draw: only Row 9. Now, are there any other rows with KO defeats? Yes, Row 14: res: loss, method: ko (punch).\n\nIf these two rows occurred in the same tournament, then the claim would be false because a draw and a KO defeat did happen in that tournament.\n\nBut if they're in different tournaments, then the claim is true because in each tournament, only one type of result happened.\n\nSince the table doesn't specify which tournament each row belongs to, we can't confirm whether Row 9 and Row 14 are in the same tournament. Therefore, there's no clear evidence that both events occurred together in any tournament.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"the same tournament,\" so if they were indeed in the same tournament, the answer would be false. But without that info, we can't say for sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is making a general statement: in any case where there's a draw (e.g., Row 9), is there a KO defeat? If yes, then it's false. Otherwise, if no such cases exist in the table, then it's true.\n\nWait, looking at all rows:\n\nOnly Row 9 has a res of draw. Now, does any other row have both a draw and a KO? No, each row is one result.\n\nTherefore, within the given data, there are no cases where a tournament had both a draw and a KO defeat in the same event. Thus, the claim would be true because in none of the rows do we see both a draw and a KO together.\n\nWait, but Row 14 has a KO, and Row 9 has a draw, but if they were in the same tournament, then it's false. But without that info, maybe the answer is TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the table doesn't have any row with both a draw and a KO, so the claim holds.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where a draw (Row 9) and a KO defeat (Row 14) occur, which could indicate they're in the same tournament, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Usui defeating Daisuke Ishizawa.\n2. Usui defeating Manabu Inoue.\n\nThe claim says that the first victory is more convincing than the second. So, I need to check if both events happened and then compare their outcomes.\n\nLooking at the table, I should search for rows where \"usui\" is involved as the res (result) and see who he defeated each time. \n\nStarting with row 5: The result is a win against Daisuke Ishizawa. The method was a decision by unanimous vote in a shooto event.\n\nNow, looking for Usui defeating Manabu Inoue, I check the rest of the rows. In row 10, it says \"manabu inoue\" as the opponent, and the result is a win. The method here is a decision with a majority vote in the gcm - dog 5 event.\n\nWait, so Usui defeated both Daisuke and Manabu. But the claim is about how convincing each victory was. In row 5, it's a unanimous decision, while in row 10, it's a majority decision. A unanimous decision is more convincing than a majority because all judges agree versus just a simple majority.\n\nSo the claim says Usui defeated Daisuke more convincingly than Manabu.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst off, \"hayate usui\" seems like a name. Maybe it's a fighter or a person involved in some kind of combat sport. The phrase \"be never defeat\" suggests that this person should never be defeated or hasn't been defeated up to a certain point.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I see rows with various results, records, opponents, methods, events, rounds, and times. Each row seems to represent a fight or match. For example, Row 1 shows a loss against \"issei tamura\" via a decision in a shooto event, round 2 at 5:00. So each row is a fight outcome for someone.\n\nThe key here is to see if \"hayate usui\" has any losses in the table. If they have never lost, that would make the claim TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nWait, but I don't see \"hayate usui\" listed as an opponent or in any of these rows. So maybe \"hayate usui\" is not one of the fighters in this table. Alternatively, perhaps \"usui\" refers to someone else.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is issei tamura\nRow 2: Opponent is hiroshi nakamura\n...\nContinuing down, I don't see any opponent named \"hayate usui\" or anything similar. So maybe the person in question isn't listed here, which would mean they haven't lost any fights according to this data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"usui\" is someone else's last name, and \"hayate\" could be a first name. But without seeing \"usui\" as an opponent, I don't have evidence of a loss. So the claim that they are never defeated would hold true if they haven't lost any fights in the table.\n\nBut wait, the table only shows results for certain fighters. If \"hayate usui\" is not present here, it's possible that their wins or losses aren't recorded, which might mean the claim could be considered TRUE by default since there are no losses shown.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about whether they were never defeated in any of these matches, and since \"usui\" isn't an opponent, then yes, they haven't lost. So the answer would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could \"hayate usui\" be a fighter who has wins but no losses? Let me check the results again. Each row shows res as either win, loss, or draw. If \"usui\" is not an opponent, then their record isn't here. So in this context, without any loss recorded for them, the claim that they are never defeated is TRUE.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, there's no evidence of \"hayate usui\" losing any matches, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

In other words, every one of Usui's fights went beyond or exactly to the 5-minute mark.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find all rows where the fighter is named Usui.

But the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes all relevant information, and if none of Usui's fights end before 5 minutes, then the claim is true. Since there are no rows with Usui as the fighter, it implies that all such fights (if any) meet the condition, so the claim holds. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE because the data supports that Usui's fights didn't end before the 5-minute mark.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is considered true since none of Usui's listed fights ended before the 5-minute period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

On the other hand, a \"drawn match\" is where both fighters have the same record after the match, which in the table would be when res is 'draw' and the opponent's name doesn't change their record to match.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- I'll go through each row and note if there's a KO win or a draw.\n  \n  - Rows 13: Win via submission (armlock) \u2013 not KO.\n  - Row 14: Loss, method is KO punch \u2013 this is a defeat by KO.\n  - Row 9: Draw between East vs West in pip event.\n\nSo, the defeated by KO is at row 14, and the drawn match is at row 9. Now I need to check if these two events are in the same tournament.\n\nIn the table, each row has an 'event' column. The defeat by KO is in a shooto event (row 14), while the drawn match is also in a pip - east vs west event (row 9). Since these are different events within the same overall context of a tournament, but they don't necessarily share the same specific event name.\n\nHowever, I need to see if both events occurred in the same tournament. The key is whether the tournaments or events are linked. If both events are part of the same larger tournament, then yes. Otherwise, no. Since each row has an 'event' and 'method,' but no explicit 'tournament' column, it's unclear.\n\nAssuming that within the table, all events are part of the same overall tournament, then both the KO defeat (row 14) and the drawn match (row 9) would be in the same tournament. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"only 1 of usui 's win be by majority decision\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that among Usui's wins, only one of them was decided by a majority decision.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight outcome for someone named Usui. Wait, actually, the names in the opponent column are like \"isei tamura,\" \"hiroshi nakamura,\" etc., so I need to check if any of these opponents are Usui. Hmm, maybe I misread it. The claim mentions \"usui 's win,\" so perhaps Usui is the fighter in some of these rows.\n\nI'll go through each row and see who the opponent is because maybe Usui is the one winning. So:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is issei tamura. If this is Usui, then res is loss, so it's not a win. So irrelevant for wins.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is hiroshi nakamura. Res is loss again, so not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Opponent is shinya kumazawa. Result is win. So this might be Usui winning against Shinya Kumazawa.\n\nRow 4: Opponent is sakae kasuya. Result is win. Could be Usui winning here.\n\nRow 5: Opponent is daisuke ishizawa. Result is win. Another possible Usui win.\n\nRows 6-19 don't show any wins for Usui, but actually, looking again, I think each row represents a fighter's record. So perhaps the columns are res (result), record (win-loss-streak?), opponent, method, event, round, and time.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row is a fight where someone has a result, opponent, etc. The res column can be win, loss, or draw. If Usui is the fighter in some of these rows, then we need to check how many of her wins were by majority decision.\n\nBut looking at the opponents, none are \"usui,\" so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps \"Usui\" refers to a different column, like the method being \"decision (majority).\" Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The claim is about Usui's wins being by majority decision.\n\nWait, another approach: let me look for rows where the result is a win and the method is decision (majority). Then count how many such rows there are, and see if only one exists.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: res loss\nRow 2: res loss\nRow3: res win, method decision (unanimous)\nRow4: res win, method decision (majority) \u2192 this is a win by majority\nRow5: res win, method decision (unanimous)\nRow6: res loss\nRow7: res win, method decision (unanimous)\nRow8: res win, method decision (unanimous)\nRow9: res draw\nRow10: res win, method decision (majority) \u2192 another majority win\nRow11: res win, method decision (unanimous)\nRow12: res loss\nRow13: res win, submission\nRow14: res loss\nRow15: res win, method decision (majority) \u2192 third majority win\nRow16: res win, method decision (majority) \u2192 fourth majority win\nRow17: res loss\nRow18: res loss\nRow19: res loss\n\nWait, so Rows 4,10,15,16 have wins with methods as decision (majority). That's four rows where Usui won by majority decision. But the claim says only one of her wins is by majority decision. So that would make the claim FALSE because there are multiple such instances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting or misunderstanding who Usui is. If Usui is not the fighter in these rows but someone else, then perhaps the count is different. However, based on the opponents listed, it's unclear who Usui is unless her name appears as an opponent, which it doesn't. Therefore, the rows where the result is win and method is majority decision are 4.\n\nSo the claim that only one of Usui's wins was by majority decision is incorrect because there are four such instances. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"only 1 of usui 's win be by majority decision,\" we need to check how many times Usui won with a majority decision. By analyzing each row where the result is a win and the method is a majority decision, we find four instances (Rows 4, 10, 15, and 16). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"usui defeat daisuke ishizawa in the same manner he defeat manabu inoue\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. It seems like it's saying that Usui defeated Daisuke Ishizawa using the same method (like decision, knockout, etc.) as when he defeated Manabu Inoue.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where Usui fought both Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue. Let me scan through each row to identify these two opponents.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Opponent is Issei Tamura. No match here.\n\nRow 5 mentions \"daisuke ishizawa\" as the opponent, res: win, method: decision (unanimous). So that's Usui defeating Daisuke in a unanimous decision.\n\nNow, I need to find when Usui fought Manabu Inoue. Scanning further, Row 10 has \"manabu inoue\" as the opponent, res: win, method: decision (majority). So Manabu was defeated by Usui via a majority decision.\n\nSo now, comparing the two methods: Daisuke's match was a unanimous decision, and Manabu's was a majority decision. Since the methods differ (unanimous vs. majority), the manner in which Usui defeated them isn't the same.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the methods used are different.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check whether Usui defeated both Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue using the same method. From the table:\n\n- **Daisuke Ishizawa** was defeated by Usui in a **unanimous decision** (Row 5).\n- **Manabu Inoue** was defeated by Usui in a **majority decision** (Row 10).\n\nSince the methods differ, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
