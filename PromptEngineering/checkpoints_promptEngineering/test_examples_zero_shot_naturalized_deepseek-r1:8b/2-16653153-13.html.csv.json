    "claim": "box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game with a score of 103 - 101",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"box score be the type for all entry in the table include the game with a score of 103 - 101\". This seems to be saying that for every game listed in the table, there is a box score included, specifically mentioning a game where the score is 103-101.\n\nSo, my task is to check two things: \n1. Does each entry in the table have a box score?\n2. Is there at least one game with the score of 103 - 101 that has its box score mentioned?\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's structured with several rows, each containing information about a basketball game. Each row includes elements like date, home team, away team, score, venue, and box score. The term \"box score\" is included as a placeholder in some cells, but they are followed by \"-\". For example, in Row 1: \"box score: box score, report: -.\" So, it seems that the presence of a box score is indicated by having text instead of a dash.\n\nNow, let me check each row to see if they all have a box score. \n\nRow 1: Has \"box score: box score\". \nRows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8: They all also have \"box score: box score\" or similar. So yes, every entry has the term \"box score\" listed, meaning they include a box score.\n\nNext part of the claim is about whether a game with a score of 103-101 exists and if its box score is included. Looking at the scores:\n\nRow 1: Score is 103 - 101. So this is the specific game mentioned in the claim.\n\nIn Row 1, \"box score: box score\" is present, indicating that they include a box score for this game.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that all entries have a box score and specifically points out the 103-101 game, which does have its box score included. So, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify each cell related to the claim. Since the claim mentions two main things: \n1. All entries have a box score.\n2. The specific game with 103-101 has its box score included.\n\nFor point 1, every row in the table has \"box score\" as per the data given, so all cells under \"box score\" are relevant. \n\nBut wait, looking at the table, each row after the first few seems to have the same structure. So all rows (0-7) have a \"box score\" column.\n\nHowever, for the specific game with 103-101, only Row 1 has that exact score. So I should include that specific cell in relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, all eight rows have a box score cell, and specifically, Row 1's box score is relevant because it pertains to the 103-101 game mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"all entry in the table be labeled 'box score' even the game where the away team be sydney spirit.\" Hmm, that's a bit to unpack.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. There are 8 rows, each representing a different game. Each row has several pieces of information: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. The claim is about whether all entries in the table are labeled 'box score', specifically looking at the cell where the away team is Sydney Spirit.\n\nWait, no, actually, it's not about all cells being 'box score' but rather that every entry in the table has a 'box score' label, even for the game where the away team is Sydney Spirit. So, I need to check if each row's box score column has the value 'box score'.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 2: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 3: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 4: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 5: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 6: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 7: Box score is \"box score\".\nRow 8: Box score is \"box score\".\n\nSo, all rows have 'box score' in that column. Now, the claim also mentions specifically the game where the away team is Sydney Spirit. Let me check which row has Sydney Spirit as the away team.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Away team is Sydney Spirit.\n- Row 2: Away team is New Zealand Breakers.\n- Row 3: Away team is Gold Coast Blaze.\n- Row 4: Away team is Perth Wildcats.\n- Row 5: Away team is New Zealand Breakers.\n- Row 6: Away team is Townsville Crocodiles.\n- Row 7: Away team is Cairns Taipans.\n- Row 8: Away team is Wollongong Hawks.\n\nSo, only Row 1 has Sydney Spirit as the away team. Checking Row 1's box score: it's labeled 'box score'. Therefore, even in this specific game, the box score entry is present.\n\nTherefore, all entries in the table have a 'box score' label, including when the away team is Sydney Spirit. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by checking that every row has a \"box score\" and specifically for the game where the away team is Sydney Spirit (Row 1), the box score is present.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"box score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the melbourne tiger play their home game at state netball and hockey centre.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find where Melbourne Tigers are playing as the home team. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Townsville Crocodiles \u2013 not Melbourne Tigers.\nRow 2: Home team is Cairns Taipans \u2013 not Melbourne Tigers.\nRow 3: Home team is Wollongong Hawks \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: Home team is Adelaide 36ers \u2013 no.\nRow 5: Home team is Gold Coast Blaze \u2013 no.\nRow 6: Here, the home team is Melbourne Tigers. The score is 110 - 97 against Townsville Crocodiles. The venue is listed as state netball and hockey centre. That matches the claim's location.\nRows 7 and 8 don't have Melbourne Tigers.\n\nSo, in row 6, we see that Melbourne Tigers are playing at home, specifically at state netball and hockey centre. This directly supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells would be the row where this occurs, which is row 6, but looking back, the rows start from index 0? Wait, no. In the table provided, each row has a date, so I need to count them starting from 0.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: date: 22 october\nRow 2: date: 22 october\nRow 3: date: 24 october\nRow 4: date: 25 october\nRow 5: date: 25 october\nRow 6: date: 25 october\nRow 7: date: 25 october\nRow 8: date: 26 october\n\nSo row indices are 0 to 7. The relevant row is row 6 (since it's the seventh entry, but starting from 0). Wait no, in JSON example, they have row_index as an integer, so I need to figure out which index corresponds to each row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row starts with a date. So:\n\nRow 1: date: 22 october \u2192 index 0\nRow 2: 22 october \u2192 1\nRow 3:24 \u21922\nRow4:25\u21923\nRow5:25\u21924\nRow6:25\u21925\nRow7:25\u21926\nRow8:26\u21927\n\nWait, no. The first row is index 0 because JSON examples often start at 0. So the rows are:\n\n0: date:22\n1:22\n2:24\n3:25\n4:25\n5:25\n6:25\n7:26\n\nSo row 6 corresponds to the fifth data entry? Wait, maybe not. Let me list them with their indices:\n\n- Row 1 (index 0): date 22 october...\n- Row2 (1)\n- Row3(2)\n- Row4(3)\n- Row5(4)\n- Row6(5)\n- Row7(6)\n- Row8(7)\n\nSo in row 6, which is index 5, the home team is Melbourne Tigers at state netball and hockey centre. Therefore, relevant_cells should include this.\n\nThus, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are where row_index=5 (sixth row) with column_name \"venue\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in row 6 of the table, specifically the venue column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"gold coast blaze have their home game in the venue of gold coast convention centre.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n1. The team is Gold Coast Blaze.\n2. They are playing a home game.\n3. The venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\nI need to check if there's any row in the table that matches all three of these criteria. \n\nLooking at the table, I see each row has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, and report. My focus will be on the \"home team,\" \"venue,\" and whether it's a home game.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1:\n- Date: 22 October\n- Home team: Townsville Crocodiles\n- Venue: Townsville Entertainment Centre\nNot relevant because the home team isn't Gold Coast Blaze, and the venue is different.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: 22 October\n- Home team: Cairns Taipans\n- Venue: Cairns Convention Centre\nAgain, not matching both team and venue.\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: 24 October\n- Home team: Wollongong Hawks\n- Venue: Win Entertainment Centre\nStill not the Gold Coast Blaze or the specified venue.\n\nRow 4:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home team: Adelaide 36ers\n- Venue: Distinctive Homes Dome\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 5:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home team: Gold Coast Blaze\n- Venue: Gold Coast Convention Centre\nThis row seems to match all the criteria. The home team is Gold Coast Blaze, and the venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre on that date (25 October).\n\nWait, but I should check if this is a home game or an away game. Since the home team is listed as Gold Coast Blaze and the venue is their home court, this must be a home game.\n\nRow 6:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home team: Melbourne Tigers\n- Venue: State Netball and Hockey Centre\nNot relevant since the home team isn't Gold Coast Blaze.\n\nRow 7:\n- Date: 25 October\n- Home team: South Dragons\n- Venue: Hisense Arena\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 8:\n- Date: 26 October\n- Home team: Sydney Spirit\n- Venue: State Sports Centre\nNot related to Gold Coast Blaze.\n\nSo, the only relevant row is Row 5 where Gold Coast Blaze plays at Gold Coast Convention Centre on 25 October.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"the match on 24 october at venue state netball and hockey centre with score of 113 - 116 have melbourne tiger as home team.\" \n\nSo, the claim is making four specific points:\n1. The match occurred on October 24th.\n2. The venue was the State Netball and Hockey Centre.\n3. The score was 113 - 116.\n4. The home team was the Melbourne Tigers.\n\nNow, I'll need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of matches with various details. Let me go through each row to see if any match all four criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 1: Date is October 22nd, venue is Townsville Entertainment Centre. The score isn't 113-116, and the home team isn't Melbourne Tigers. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Also on October 22nd, so date doesn't match. Venue is Cairns Convention Centre, different from State Netball and Hockey Centre. Home team is Cairns Taipans, not Melbourne Tigers. Not a match.\n\nRow 3: Date here is October 24th. Let me check the details. The venue is Win Entertainment Centre, which is not the same as State Netball and Hockey Centre. So already this doesn't fit because of the venue. But just to be thorough, the score here is 98-96, and the home team is Wollongong Hawks. So no match.\n\nRow 4: October 25th date, so that's not October 24th. Venue is Distinctive Homes Dome, different from what's in the claim. Home team is Adelaide 36ers, which doesn't match. Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Also on October 25th. Venue is Gold Coast Convention Centre, not matching. Score is 113-116. Wait, that's interesting because the score in the claim is also 113-116. But home team here is Gold Coast Blaze, not Melbourne Tigers. So while the score matches, the teams don't.\n\nRow 6: October 25th again. Venue is State Netball and Hockey Centre, which matches one of the criteria in the claim. The score here is 110-97, so that doesn't match the 113-116 from the claim. Home team is Melbourne Tigers, which does fit. However, since the score doesn't match, this isn't a full match.\n\nRow 7: October 25th, venue Hisense Arena. Not matching. Home team South Dragons, not relevant.\n\nRow 8: October 26th. Venue State Sports Centre, so that's different from what's in the claim. Doesn't matter beyond that.\n\nSo, going through each row, none of them perfectly match all four criteria stated in the claim. The only time the venue and home team matched was in Row 6, but the score didn't align with the claim. Therefore, there isn't a match on October 24th at State Netball and Hockey Centre with the score 113-116 where Melbourne Tigers were the home team.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check Row 5 again. It's October 25th, venue Gold Coast Convention Centre, score 113-116, home team Gold Coast Blaze. So no match for the claim in that row either.\n\nSo, to summarize, none of the matches listed in the table have all four attributes as stated in the claim: correct date (24th), correct venue, correct score (113-116), and correct home team (Melbourne Tigers). Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we must verify each criterion against the provided table.\n\n1. **Date**: October 24th is required. Only Row 3 matches this date.\n2. **Venue**: State Netball and Hockey Centre is specified. Checking Row 3, the venue is Win Entertainment Centre, which doesn't match.\n3. **Score**: The claim's score is 113-116. None of the rows with the correct date have this exact score.\n4. **Home Team**: Melbourne Tigers must be the home team. No row matches all criteria: October 24th, State Netball and Hockey Centre, 113-116 score, and Melbourne Tigers as home.\n\nSince none of the rows meet all these conditions, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row seems to represent a different match. My task is to find out if there's a match on October 25 where Gold Coast Blaze is the home team with a score of 93-104 played at the Gold Coast Convention Centre.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: Date is October 22, so it's not October 25. Also, home team is Townsville Crocodiles, which doesn't match.\nRow 2: Same date as Row 1, different teams. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Date is October 24. Home team is Wollongong Hawks. No match for October 25 here.\nRow 4: Date is October 25. Home team is Adelaide 36ers. The away team is Perth Wildcats. Score is 93-104, but the home team isn't Gold Coast Blaze, so this might be a candidate, but let's check further.\nWait, in Row 4, the home team is Adelaide 36ers, not Gold Coast Blaze. So the home team doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: Date is October 25. Home team is Gold Coast Blaze. Score is 113-116 against New Zealand Breakers at Gold Coast Convention Centre. The score here is different (113-116 vs. claimed 93-104), but the venue matches.\nSo this row has the correct home team and venue, but the score doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: October 25, home team is Melbourne Tigers. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: October 25, home team is South Dragons. No match for Gold Coast Blaze.\n\nRow 8: Date is October 26. Not relevant.\n\nWait, so in Row 4, the score was 93-104, but the home team was Adelaide 36ers, not Gold Coast Blaze. In Row 5, the same date, October 25, Gold Coast Blaze scored 113-116 against New Zealand Breakers at the correct venue. So the claim mentions a game where Gold Coast Blaze is the home team with 93-104. But in reality, their score was 113-116.\n\nTherefore, the claim's score doesn't match any row for October 25 where Gold Coast Blaze was the home team. The only other match on that date with them as the home team has a different score. So the claim is incorrect because the score mentioned isn't present in the table for that specific game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on October 25, the Gold Coast Blaze were the home team with a score of 93-104 at the Gold Coast Convention Centre. However, checking the table:\n\n- Row 4: Adelaide 36ers scored 93-104 against Perth Wildcats.\n- Row 5: Gold Coast Blaze scored 113-116 against New Zealand Breakers.\n\nThus, no match on October 25 with the specified details exists for the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the match on 26 october have box score type of box score with south dragon as home team and score of 103 - 101.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down:\n\n1. **Date**: 26 October\n2. **Type of Box Score**: It should be a box score.\n3. **Home Team**: South Dragons\n4. **Score**: 103 - 101\n\nNow, I need to look through the table provided to see if there's a match that fits all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows are from Row 1 to Row 8.\n- Each row has several columns: date, home team, score, away team, venue, box score, report.\n\nI'll go through each row related to October 26. From the table, I can see that only Row 8 has a date of 26 October.\n\nRow 8 details:\n- Date: 26 october\n- Home Team: sydney spirit\n- Score: 99 - 86\n- Away Team: wollongong hawks\n- Venue: state sports centre\n\nComparing this to the claim, the home team is sydney spirit, not south dragons. The score is 99-86, which doesn't match 103-101.\n\nWait, but I should also check if there's another row with 26 October. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: 22 Oct\nRow 2: 22 Oct\nRow 3: 24 Oct\nRow 4: 25 Oct\nRow 5: 25 Oct\nRow 6: 25 Oct\nRow 7: 25 Oct\nRow 8: 26 Oct\n\nOnly Row 8 is on the 26th. So, no other matches on that date.\n\nNow, looking at the home team in Row 8: sydney spirit vs wollongong hawks. The score was 99-86, which is different from what's claimed (103-101). Also, the home team isn't south dragons; it's sydney spirit.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread something. Let me check each column in Row 8 to make sure:\n\n- date: 26 october \u2714\ufe0f\n- home team: sydney spirit \u274c (not south dragons)\n- score: 99 - 86 \u274c (not 103 - 101)\n\nSo none of the details in Row 8 match the claim. Therefore, there's no match on 26 October with south dragons as the home team and a score of 103-101.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if any other rows have south dragons as the home team. Let me scan through each row:\n\nLooking at the 'home team' column across all rows:\n\nRow 1: townsville crocodiles\nRow 2: cairns taipans\nRow 3: wollongong hawks\nRow 4: adelaide 36ers\nRow 5: gold coast blaze\nRow 6: melbourne tigers\nRow 7: south dragons\nRow 8: sydney spirit\n\nOnly Row 7 has south dragons as the home team, but that's on October 25. The claim is about October 26, so that doesn't apply either.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a match on 26 October with specific details that don't align with any entry in the table. Since no such match exists, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"When the gold coast be the away team, the score be 101 - 92.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific things: the home team is not involved here; instead, the focus is on when the Gold Coast is the away team and their score is 101-92.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to scan each row to see if any match both conditions:\n\n1. The home team should be someone else (not Gold Coast).\n2. The away team should be Gold Coast.\n3. The score for the Gold Coast as away team is 101-92.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Date 22 Oct. Home team: Townsville Crocodiles, Away team: Sydney Spirit. So, not relevant because the away team isn't Gold Coast.\n\nRow 2: Home: Cairns Taipans, Away: New Zealand Breakers. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Home: Wollongong Hawks, Away: Gold Coast Blaze. Here, the away team is Gold Coast, but I need to check the score. The score is 98-96, which doesn't match 101-92. So this row has one condition met but not both.\n\nRow 4: Home: Adelaide 36ers, Away: Perth Wildcats. Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Home: Gold Coast Blaze, Away: New Zealand Breakers. Now, the home team is Gold Coast, so the away team isn't; wait, no\u2014Gold Coast is listed as home here, so this can't be it because we need Gold Coast as away. Wait, actually, in Row 5, Gold Coast is the home team and their score is 113-116 against New Zealand Breakers. So this doesn't fit because the claim says Gold Coast is the away team.\n\nRow 6: Home: Melbourne Tigers, Away: Townsville Crocodiles. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Home: South Dragons, Away: Cairns Taipans. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Home: Sydney Spirit, Away: Wollongong Hawks. Not relevant.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed Row 5 again. Let me check Row 5 again. It says home team is Gold Coast Blaze, away team New Zealand Breakers, score 113-116. So in this case, Gold Coast is the home team, not away. The claim requires Gold Coast to be the away team.\n\nNow, I need to find a row where the home team isn't Gold Coast and the away team is Gold Coast with a score of 101-92.\n\nLooking back, in Row 3: Home: Wollongong Hawks vs Gold Coast Blaze (away). Score was 98-96, which doesn't match.\n\nIs there any other row? Let's check each row again:\n\nRow 1: Sydney Spirit as away. No.\nRow 2: New Zealand Breakers as away. No.\nRow 3: Gold Coast as away but score not matching.\nRow 4: Perth Wildcats as away. No.\nRow 5: Gold Coast as home, not away.\nRow 6: Townsville Crocodiles as away. No.\nRow 7: Cairns Taipans as away. No.\nRow 8: Wollongong Hawks as away. No.\n\nSo, none of the rows match both conditions: away team is Gold Coast and score is 101-92. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misreading Row 3? Let me check again. Row 3: Date 24 Oct, home team Wollongong Hawks, away team Gold Coast Blaze. Score is 98 -96. So score doesn't match. Therefore, no matching row.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
