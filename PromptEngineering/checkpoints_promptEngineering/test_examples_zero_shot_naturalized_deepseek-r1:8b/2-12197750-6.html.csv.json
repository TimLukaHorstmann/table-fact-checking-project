    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"only 4 of the schools in Manawatu go up to Year 13.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table is showing. Each row represents a school with various attributes like name, years (the age range), gender, area, authority, decile, and roll. The \"years\" column indicates how many years each school offers students. For example, most schools have Years 1-8, which means they go up to Year 8. However, some have different ranges.\n\nThe key here is to identify which schools offer up to Year 13 because that's what the claim is about\u2014schools that \"go up to Year 13.\" So I need to look for schools where the \"years\" range includes Year 13 or beyond.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Years 1-8 (max Year 8)\n- Row 2: Same as above\n- Row 3: Same\n- Row 4: Years 9-13. This school goes up to Year 13.\n- Row 5: 1-8\n- Row 6: Same\n- Row 7: Same\n- Row 8: Same\n- Row 9: 1-8\n- Row 10: Same\n- Row 11: Same\n- Row 12: Same\n- Row 13: Same\n- Row 14: 1-8\n- Row 15: 1-8\n- Row 16: Same\n- Row 17: Same\n- Row 18: 1-8\n- Row 19: Same\n- Row 20: Years 9-13. Another school that goes up to Year 13.\n- Row 21: 1-13. This one goes all the way to Year 13.\n- Row 22: 1-13 as well.\n- Row 23: 1-8\n- Row 24: Same\n\nSo, from this, I can see that Rows 4, 20, 21, and 22 have \"years\" ranges that include 9-13 or 1-13. That's four schools.\n\nThe claim says \"only 4 of the school in Manawatu go up to Year 13.\" So, if there are exactly four such schools, the claim would be true. However, I need to ensure that all these schools are indeed located in Manawatu. The \"area\" column might give me clues about their location.\n\nLooking at the areas:\n\n- Row 4: dannevirke\n- Row 20: pahiatua\n- Row 21: dannevirke\n- Row 22: dannevirke\n\nWait, I'm not sure if these areas correspond directly to Manawatu. I might need more context about the regions, but based on my knowledge, schools in dannevirke and pahiatua are typically within the Manawatu region.\n\nSo, assuming all four schools listed (Rows 4,20,21,22) are indeed in Manawatu, then the claim is correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"years\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"years\"}, {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"years\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and understanding how to verify it.\n\nThe claim states: \"At 476, the highest roll belongs to dannevirke high school.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this means. The key points are:\n1. There's a value of 476 in the table.\n2. This value corresponds to the \"roll\" attribute for a school named \"dannevirke high school\".\n3. This roll is the highest among all the schools listed.\n\nTo verify this, I need to check the following:\n\n- Find the row where the name is \"dannevirke high school\".\n- Look at its \"roll\" value.\n- Compare it with the \"roll\" values of other schools to see if 476 is indeed the highest.\n\nLooking at the table provided, let me go through each row step by step.\n\nRow 1: akitio school, roll=7\nRow 2: alfredton school, roll=44\nRow 3: balance school, roll=28\nRow 4: dannevirke high school, roll=476\nRow 5: dannevirke south school, roll=347\nRow 6: eketahuna school, roll=91\nRow 7: hillcrest school, roll=46\nRow 8: huia range school, roll=246\nRow 9: kumeroa - hopelands school, roll=63\nRow 10: makuri school, roll=7\nRow 11: mangamaire country school, roll=29\nRow 12: mangatainoka school, roll=63\nRow 13: norsewood and districts school, roll=113\nRow 14: pahiatua school, roll=259\nRow 15: papatawa school, roll=13\nRow 16: pongaroa school, roll=59\nRow 17: ruahine school, roll=176\nRow 18: st anthony 's school, roll=141\nRow 19: st joseph 's school, roll=103\nRow 20: tararua college, roll=330\nRow 21: tkkm o tamaki nui a rua, roll=73\nRow 22: totara college of accelerated learning, roll=47\nRow 23: weber school, roll=64\nRow 24: woodville school, roll=143\n\nNow, focusing on the \"roll\" values:\n\n- dannevirke high school has a roll of 476.\n- tararua college has a higher roll with 330.\n- Other schools have rolls lower than 476.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any school with a roll higher than 476? \n\nLooking through the list again, tararua college is at 330, which is less than 476. The next highest is st anthony's at 141 and pahiatua at 259. So no, none of them exceed 476.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"at 476, the highest roll belongs to dannevirke high school\" seems to be TRUE because there isn't any other school with a higher roll in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on verifying if \"dannevirke high school\" has the highest roll of 476. By checking all rows, it's confirmed that 476 is the highest roll.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"roll\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me check. Row 20 is tararua college, which is \"state,\" not \"state integrated.\" Similarly, other schools like Hillcrest, Weber, etc., are \"state\" but not integrated.\n\nSo, only rows 18, 19, and 22 have \"state integrated\" authority.

So my task is to check each row of the table to see if any other schools besides \"Norsewood and districts school\" are listed under the Norsewood area.\n\nFirst, I should look for rows where the 'area' column is \"norsewood\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"both school that cover year 1 to 13 be located in the dannevirke area.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's saying that any schools covering Years 1 to 13 should be in Dannevrike. So, I need to check all the schools in the table that have years from 1-13 and see if they're all located in Dannevrike.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: name, years, gender, area, authority, decile, roll. The key columns here are \"years\" and \"area.\" So I need to look for schools where Years is between 1-8 or 9-13 because that's the range mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: akitio school, Years 1-8, area: dannevirke. This one is within Dannevrike and covers Year 1-8, so it's relevant but only up to 8th year. The claim mentions up to 13, so maybe this isn't directly covered, but the claim says \"cover year 1 to 13.\" Wait, actually, no, because this school doesn't go up to 13, so perhaps it's not directly in scope.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about schools that cover Year 1-13. So I'm looking for schools that have Years 1-13 and are in Dannevrike. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 4: dannevirke high school, Years 9-13, area: dannevirke. This one covers up to 13 and is in Dannevrike. So this fits.\n\nRow 21: tkkm o tamaki nui a rua, Years 1-13, area: dannevirke. This also fits both criteria.\n\nNow, are there any other schools that cover Year 1-13? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rows, I don't see any others beyond Rows 4 and 21 that have Years 1-13. So the two schools in Dannevrike covering up to 13 are dannevirke high school (Row 4) and tkkm o tamaki nui a rua (Row 21).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there aren't any other schools outside of Dannevrike that also cover Year 1-13. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 20: tararua college, Years 9-13, area: pahiatua. Not in Dannevrike.\n- Row 22: totara college, Years 1-13, area: dannevirke. Wait, this is Row 22: yes, it's in Dannevrike and covers 1-13.\n\nWait, I might have missed that earlier. Let me recount:\n\nRow 4: Yes (Dannevirke, 9-13)\nRow 21: Yes (Dannevirke, 1-13)\nRow 22: Yes (Dannevirke, 1-13)\n\nSo that's three schools in Dannevrike covering Year 1-13.\n\nWait, but the claim is about both schools that cover Year 1-13 being located in Dannevrike. So I need to check if all such schools are indeed there. \n\nLooking for any school outside Dannevrike that covers Year 1-13:\n\nI don't see any other rows with Years 1-13 and a different area. So, yes, all the relevant schools (Rows 4, 21, 22) are in Dannevrike.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because both (all) such schools are located in Dannevrike.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"only 4 of the school in manawatu go up to year 8.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. Looking at the table, each row has a 'name' which is the school's name, 'years' indicating the range of grades they offer, and 'area' which might denote the location or region. The claim mentions \"manawatu,\" so I need to find schools in that area.\n\nI'll go through each row and check if the 'area' is manawatu because the claim refers to schools within manawatu. Wait, but looking at the table, the areas listed are dannevirke, eketahuna, pahiatua, woodville, makuri, mangamaire, mangatainoka, norsewood, pongaroa, dannevirke again, ruahine, pahiatua again, tararua college has area pahiatua, and then there's also a school named manawatu? Wait, no, in the table provided, I don't see any row with 'area' as manawatu. The closest might be 'pahiatua,' but that's different.\n\nWait, maybe the term is \"manawatu\" rather than \"Manawatu.\" Let me check each row's area column again:\n\n- Row 1: dannevirke\n- Row 2: eketahuna\n- Row 3: pahiatua\n- Row 4: dannevirke\n- Row 5: dannevirke\n- Row 6: eketahuna\n- Row 7: pahiatua\n- Row 8: dannevirke\n- Row 9: woodville\n- Row 10: makuri\n- Row 11: mangamaire\n- Row 12: mangatainoka\n- Row 13: norsewood\n- Row 14: pahiatua\n- Row 15: woodville\n- Row 16: pongaroa\n- Row 17: dannevirke\n- Row 18: pahiatua\n- Row 19: dannevirke\n- Row 20: pahiatua\n- Row 21: dannevirke\n- Row 22: dannevirke\n- Row 23: weber\n- Row 24: woodville\n\nNone of these areas are \"manawatu.\" So, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there are no schools listed in manawatu area. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the last row (Row 21) has a name \"tkkm o tamaki nui a rua\" with area dannevirke. There's also Row 22: totara college of accelerated learning in dannevirke. But no manawatu.\n\nWait, perhaps 'manawatu' is another area not listed here? Or maybe the claim refers to something else. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant 'dannevirke,' but that's different from manawatu. So if there are no schools in manawatu in the table, then the claim is false because it says only 4 schools go up to year 8 in manawatu.\n\nWait, but let me check the 'years' column as well. The claim is about going up to year 8, so I need to find how many schools have their 'years' ending at or including year 8.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: years 1-6 (so goes up to year 6)\n- Row 2: 1-6\n- Row 3: 1-7\n- Row 4: 1-6\n- Row 5: 1-6\n- Row 6: 1-6\n- Row 7: 1-8? Wait, no, let's check the exact years.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, for Row 7, the 'years' column says \"1-8\". Let me confirm:\n\nRow 7: Weber school has years 1-8. So that's one school that goes up to year 8.\n\nSimilarly, checking others:\n\nRow 14: Woodville school: years 1-8? Wait, looking at Row 24, Woodville school is 1-8 as well.\n\nWait no, in the table, for Row 24, the name is woodville school with years 1-8. So that's another one.\n\nSo, Weber and Woodville are two schools that go up to year 8.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows:\n\nRow 0: dannevirke, years 1-6\nRow 1: eketahuna, 1-6\nRow 2: pahiatua, 1-7\nRow 3: dannevirke, 1-6\nRow 4: dannevirke, 1-6\nRow 5: dannevirke, 1-6\nRow 6: eketahuna, 1-6\nRow 7: pahiatua, 1-8 (Wait no, Row 7 is Weber school with years 1-8)\nRow 8: dannevirke, 1-6\nRow 9: woodville, 1-8? Wait, let's check Row 15: Woodville has years 1-8 as well.\n\nWait, in the table:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: 1-6\nRow 1: 1-6\nRow 2: 1-7\nRow 3: 1-6\nRow 4: 1-6\nRow 5: 1-6\nRow 6: 1-6\nRow 7: Weber, 1-8 (so that's one)\nRow 8: dannevirke, 1-6\nRow 9: woodville, 1-8 (another)\nRow 10: makuri, 1-6\nRow 11: mangamaire, 1-13\nRow 12: mangatainoka, 1-13\nRow 13: norsewood, 1-7\nRow 14: pahiatua, 1-8? Wait no, Row 14 is Weber school in area weber, years 1-8.\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the schools and their 'years':\n\nI think it's better to create a list:\n\n1. dannevirke: 1-6\n2. eketahuna: 1-6\n3. pahiatua: 1-7\n4. dannevirke: 1-6\n5. dannevirke: 1-6\n6. dannevirke: 1-6\n7. Weber school: 1-8 (Row 23)\n8. woodville school: 1-8 (Row 24)\n9. totara college of accelerated learning: 1-13 (Row 22)\n10. We need to check if any others go up to year 8.\n\nWait, also in Row 7, Weber school is area weber with years 1-8. So that's two schools going up to year 8: Weber and Woodville.\n\nWait no, wait: Row 24 is woodville school, which has years 1-8? Let me check the table again:\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nRow 24:\n{\n  \"name\": \"woodville school\",\n  \"years\": \"1-8\",\n  \"area\": \"woodville\",\n  ...\n}\n\nYes, so Woodville goes up to year 8.\n\nSimilarly, Weber school (Row 23) also goes up to year 8.\n\nAre there any others? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all rows, I think only Weber and Woodville have years ending at 8. So that's two schools.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 4 of the school in manawatu go up to year 8.\" But if the area is manawatu, how many schools are there?\n\nFirst, we need to identify which rows are in manawatu:\n\nLooking back at the table, I think only Row 24: woodville school is in woodville, but maybe others? Wait no, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, actually, in the data provided earlier, it's a list of schools with their details. The 'area' column may be the region they're in.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nIt seems each row has \"name\", \"years\", and \"area\".\n\nSo to find how many schools are in manawatu, we need to see which rows have area as manawatu.\n\nBut looking through all the rows provided earlier, I don't see any with area manawatu. Wait no, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe Row 7 is Weber school in area weber, etc.\n\nWait, in any case, the initial task was: You are tasked to find how many schools go up to year 8, regardless of the area. But the claim says \"the school in manawatu\" so maybe it's about the number of schools in manawitu (spelled differently) that go up to year 8.\n\nBut perhaps I need to confirm: The user wrote \"the school in manawitu\". Maybe it's a typo for manawatu, which is a region in New Zealand.\n\nSo assuming that, we need to find how many schools in manawatu go up to year 8.\n\nLooking at the data provided, let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: dannevirke area? If yes, does it go up to year 6.\nRow 1: eketahuna, goes up to 6.\nRow 2: pahiatua, goes up to 7.\nRow 3: dannevirke again, 6.\nRow 4: dannevirke, same.\nRow 5: dannevirke, same.\nRow 6: eketahuna, same.\nRow 7: Weber school in weber area, goes up to 8.\nRow 8: dannevirke, 6.\nRow 9: woodville in woodville, goes up to 8.\nRow 10: makuri, 6.\nRow 11: mangamaire, 13.\nRow 12: mangatinaoka, 13.\nRow 13: norsewood, 7.\nRow 14: pahiatua, 7.\nRow 15: Weber school again? Wait no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The user mentioned a table, but in the text above, it's not clear. Maybe each row is a separate school. So to clarify, let me list all schools with their areas and whether they go up to year 8:\n\nLooking at each row (assuming each row is a different school):\n\n1. dannevirke: area dannevirke, years 1-6.\n2. eketahuna: eketahuna, 1-6.\n3. pahiatua: pahiatua, 1-7.\n4. dannevirke: same as above.\n5. dannevirke: same.\n6. dannevirke: same.\n7. Weber school: weber area, 1-8.\n8. woodville school: woodville area, 1-8.\n9. makuri area: makuri, 1-6.\n10. mangamaire: mangamaire, 1-13.\n11. mangatinaoka: same as above, 1-13.\n12. norsewood: norsewood area, 1-7.\n13. pahiatua: same as above, 1-7.\n\nSo in total, how many schools go up to year 8? Weber and Woodville do. So that's two schools.\n\nBut the claim is about \"the school in manawitu\" plural, implying more than one. But from the data, there are none in manawitu (assuming) going up to year 8 because their areas don't match.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting or misunderstanding the area. Let me see: if any of these schools are in manawitu, which may be a specific area, and how many go up to 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"manawitu\" is a typo for \"manawatu\", and perhaps woodville is part of manawatu.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently: the user says \"the school in manawitu\", which may be a translation error or a specific area.\n\nAssuming that there are multiple schools in manawitu that go up to year 8, but from my analysis, Weber and Woodville do. But if they're not in manawitu, then none.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant \"the school in manawitu\" as one particular school, but it's unclear.\n\nIn any case, based on the data provided, there are two schools (Weber and Woodville) that go up to year 8. If all of them are in manawitu, then maybe two; if only some are, perhaps fewer.\n\nBut without more precise information about which areas correspond to manawitu or manawatu, it's hard to say. However, the key point is that Weber and Woodville are the only ones in their respective areas that go up to year 8.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, the schools that go up to Year 8 are Weber School and Woodville School. If these schools are located within the Manawitu area, then both would qualify. Therefore, the number of schools in Manawitu (or Manawatu) that go up to Year 8 is two.\n\n**Answer:** There are two schools, Weber and Woodville, that go up to Year 8 and are located in Manawitu.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"At 576, the highest roll belongs to dannevirke high school.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. The claim mentions a specific number, 576, which seems to be a roll count. It also specifies that this is the highest roll and that it belongs to dannevirke high school.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if any have a roll number of 576 and whether they are named \"dannevirke high school.\"\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: akitio school, roll is 7. Not 576.\n- Row 2: alfredton school, roll 44. Not 576.\n- Row 3: ballance school, roll 28. No.\n- Row 4: dannevirke high school, roll 476. Hmm, that's a high number but not 576.\n- Row 5: dannevirke south school, roll 347. No.\n- Row 6: eketahuna school, roll 91. Not matching.\n- Row 7: hillcrest school, 46. No.\n- Row 8: huia range school, 246. No.\n- Row 9: kumeroa - hopelands school, 63. No.\n- Row 10: makuri school, 7. No.\n- Row 11: mangamaire country school, 29. No.\n- Row 12: mangatainoka school, 63. No.\n- Row 13: norsewood and districts school, 113. No.\n- Row 14: pahiatua school, 259. Close, but not 576.\n- Row 15: papatawa school, 13. No.\n- Row 16: pongaroa school, 59. No.\n- Row 17: ruahine school, 176. No.\n- Row 18: st anthony 's school, 141. Not 576.\n- Row 19: st joseph 's school, 103. No.\n- Row 20: tararua college, 330. Close to 576 but not quite.\n- Row 21: tkkm o tamaki nui a rua, 73. No.\n- Row 22: totara college of accelerated learning, 47. No.\n- Row 23: weber school, 64. No.\n- Row 24: woodville school, 143. No.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rows have a roll number of exactly 576. The highest I see is dannevirke high school at 476 (Row 4), which is less than 576. Also, there's no entry for dannevirke high school with a roll of 576. So, the claim doesn't hold true because there's no row in the table that matches both the name and the roll number specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"roll\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"st anthony 's be the only state integrate school\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: it says that \"st anthony 's school is the only state integrated school.\" I notice a couple of things here. The name is written as \"st anthony 's,\" which might be a typo or variation on \"St Anthony's.\" Also, the term used is \"state integrate\" instead of \"state integrated.\" So maybe it's a typo in the claim itself.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check for schools that have \"state integrated\" as their authority. In the table, each row has several fields: name, years, gender, area, authority, decile, and roll. The authority column seems relevant here because it indicates whether a school is state, state integrated, or perhaps another type.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones have \"state integrated\" in the authority column.\n\nRow 18: name: st anthony 's school, area: pahiatua, authority: state integrated. So this one is a state integrated school.\n\nRow 19: name: st joseph 's school, area: dannevirke, authority: state integrated. Another state integrated school.\n\nOther rows have authority as \"state\" but not \"state integrated.\" For example, Row 4 is \"dannevirke high school,\" authority: state. So there are multiple schools with \"state integrated\" authority.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"st anthony 's be the only state integrate school\" is incorrect because there's another state integrated school at least (Row 19). Also, the term should probably be \"integrated\" rather than \"integrate,\" which might indicate a typo in the claim. Additionally, using \"be\" instead of \"is\" grammatically doesn't make sense here.\n\nSo, to confirm, I need to check if there's only one school with authority: state integrated. Since there are at least two (Rows 18 and 19), the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"authority\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"authority\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"both school that cover year 1 to 13 be located in the pahiatua area.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked here. The claim is about two schools that cover Years 1 to 13 and are both located in the Pahiatua area.\n\nSo, I need to look through each row of the table and check for schools that have their name as covering Year 1 to 13, and also have their area listed as Pahiatua.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 20: tararua college. Years: 9 - 13. So this is a high school but only covers 9-13, not 1-13.\n\nRows 21 and 22: \nRow 21: TKKM o Tamaki Nui A Rua. Years: 1 - 13. Area: dannevirke.\nRow 22: Totara College of Accelerated Learning. Years: 1 - 13. Area: dannevirke.\n\nSo both these schools cover Year 1 to 13, but their areas are dannevirke, not pahiatua.\n\nLooking for other rows where area is Pahiatua:\n\nRow 14: pahiatua school. Years: 1-8. So that's only up to 8, not 13.\n\nRow 18 and 19:\nRow 18: St Anthony's school. Area: pahiatua, but years are 1-8.\nRow 19: St Joseph's school. Area: dannevirke, so no.\n\nRow 20: tararua college is in Pahiatua area but only covers 9-13.\n\nWait, let me check again. Are there any schools that cover Year 1 to 13 and are located in Pahiatua?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 21 and 22 are the only ones covering 1-13, but their areas are dannevirke.\n\nSo, no school in the table covers Years 1-13 and is located in Pahiatua.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"5 school be locate in the norsewood area\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says there are 5 schools located in the Norsewood area. So I'll need to check the table for all schools whose 'area' is \"norsewood\".\n\nLooking at each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: akitio school \u2013 area is dannevirke.\nRow 2: alfredton school \u2013 eketahuna.\nRow 3: ballance school \u2013 pahiatua.\nRow 4: dannevirke high school \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 5: dannevirke south school \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 6: eketahuna school \u2013 eketahuna.\nRow 7: hillcrest school \u2013 pahiatua.\nRow 8: huia range school \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 9: kumeroa - hopelands school \u2013 woodville.\nRow 10: makuri school \u2013 makuri.\nRow 11: mangamaire country school \u2013 mangamaire.\nRow 12: mangatainoka school \u2013 mangatainoka.\nRow 13: norsewood and districts school \u2013 norsewood. So this is one.\nRow 14: pahiatua school \u2013 pahiatua.\nRow 15: papatawa school \u2013 woodville.\nRow 16: pongaroa school \u2013 pongaroa.\nRow 17: ruahine school \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 18: st anthony 's school \u2013 pahiatua.\nRow 19: st joseph 's school \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 20: tararua college \u2013 pahiatua.\nRow 21: tkkm o tamaki nui a rua \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 22: totara college of accelerated learning \u2013 dannevirke.\nRow 23: weber school \u2013 weber.\nRow 24: woodville school \u2013 woodville.\n\nFrom this, only Row 13 is in the Norsewood area. So that's one school. Now I need to check if there are five schools listed as being in norsewood. But looking through all rows again, I don't see any others besides Row 13. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, let me go through each row carefully again:\n\nRow 1-12: none have area 'norsewood'.\nRow 13: yes.\nRows 14-24: also only Row 13 has norsewood as the area. So that's one school.\n\nBut the claim says five schools are located in norsewood. Since I only found one, does that make the claim false?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Is there another row where area is 'norsewood'? Maybe I missed it.\n\nLooking at Row 13: norsewood and districts school \u2013 yes, that's in norsewood.\n\nIs there any other? Hmm, no, the rest all have different areas like dannevirke, pahiatua, woodville, etc. So only one school is in norsewood.\n\nSo the claim says five schools are located in norsewood, but according to the table, it's just one. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misread any of the areas. For example, Row 13: area is 'norsewood and districts school' \u2013 yes, so that's correct. Any others? No, I don't think so. So only one school in norsewood.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
