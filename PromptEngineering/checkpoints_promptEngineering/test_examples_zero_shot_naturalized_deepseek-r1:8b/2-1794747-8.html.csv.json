    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for best actress in a musical category in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant information from the table to check if this statement holds true.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- **Row 4**: year 2013, award ceremony is Laurence Olivier Award, category is Best Actress in a Musical, nominee is Imelda Staunton, and the result is \"won.\"\n\nThis directly matches the claim. The award was indeed won by Imelda Staunton in the category of Best Actress in a Musical during 2013.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells or rows that might affect this conclusion. For example, checking if there's another row for the same year and category with different results or nominees. However, upon reviewing all the rows:\n\n- Rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7: All are associated with 2013 Laurence Olivier Awards except Row 1, which is from 2012.\n\nLooking at other rows for Best Actress in a Musical:\nOnly Row 4 matches, so no conflicts or additional information.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. There are seven rows, each representing a different year (2012 and 2013) and various award ceremony details. Each row has columns for year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result.\n\nThe claim mentions \"imelda staunton\" as the nominee in 2012. So I should look at all entries from 2012 first because that's the specific year mentioned. In the table, only Row 1 is from 2012. Let me check Row 1: year is 2012, award ceremony is evening standard award, category is best musical, nominee is best musical, and result is won.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 1, the nominee is listed as \"best musical,\" not \"imelda staunton.\" So that seems different. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking at Rows 2-7, they are all from 2013 except for Row 1 which is 2012. So the only 2012 row is Row 1. The nominees in 2013 include Michael Ball and Imelda Staunton for different categories, but that's 2013, not 2012.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again: In Row 4 of 2013, the category is best actress in a musical, nominee is imelda staunton, result won. But that's for 2013, so the claim is about 2012.\n\nSo in 2012, the only row is Row 1 where the nominees are \"best musical,\" and the result was won. So there's no entry in 2012 where Imelda Staunton is a nominee.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012\" is false because she wasn't nominated in 2012 according to this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Imelda Staunton was a nominee in 2012. Checking the table, Row 1 for 2012 lists nominees as \"best musical,\" not her. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
