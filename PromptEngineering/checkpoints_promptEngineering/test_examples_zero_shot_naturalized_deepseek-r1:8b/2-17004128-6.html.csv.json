    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"tie no 8 be with the away team , wrexham\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"tie no 8\" and specifies that the away team in that tie was Wrexham. So my task is to find the row corresponding to tie number 8 and check which team was listed as the away team there.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. I need to scan through each row to locate tie number 8.\n\nGoing through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Tie no 1\nRow 2: Tie no 2\nRow 3: Tie no replay (this isn't a numbered tie)\nRow 4: Tie no 3\nRow 5: Tie no 4\nRow 6: Tie no 5\nRow 7: Tie no 6\nRow 8: Tie no 7\nRow 9: Tie no 8\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right. The rows are numbered from 1 to 9, but the tie numbers don't go up sequentially beyond a certain point because some have \"replay\" or other numbering. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 1: tie no: 1\n- Row 2: tie no: 2\n- Row 3: tie no: replay\n- Row 4: tie no: 3\n- Row 5: tie no: 4\n- Row 6: tie no: 5\n- Row 7: tie no: 6\n- Row 8: tie no: 7\n- Row 9: tie no: 8\n\nSo, yes, row 9 is tie no 8. Now, in that row, the home team is Birmingham City, and the away team is Wrexham. That matches the claim because it says tie no 8 was with the away team Wrexham.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Chelsea be the away team when they play Leicester City\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: It says that Chelsea is the away team in a match against Leicester City. So, I need to check if there are any matches where Chelsea is listed as the away team when playing Leicester City.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. Each row has several columns: tie_no (which seems like the match number), home_team, score, away_team, and attendance date. \n\nI'll go through each row to find instances where either Chelsea is the home or away team against Leicester City.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Home team is Chesterfield, away is Nottingham Forest. No mention of Chelsea or Leicester here.\nRow 2: Leicester vs Chelsea. Here, Leicester is the home team and Chelsea is the away team. So this seems relevant because it matches the claim where Chelsea is the away team playing Leicester City.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other rows that might also have Chelsea as the away team against Leicester. Let's continue checking all rows.\n\nRow 3: Home team is Chelsea, away is Leicester. Here, Chelsea is home and Leicester is away, which doesn't fit the claim.\nRow 4: Derby County vs Coventry City; no relevant teams.\nRow5: Manchester City vs Middlesbrough; no.\nRow6: Bradford City vs Sheffield Wednesday; no.\nRow7: Wimbledon vs Queens Park Rangers; no.\nRow8: Leeds United vs Portsmouth; no.\nRow9: Birmingham City vs Wrexham; no.\n\nSo the only row where Chelsea is away against Leicester is Row2. But wait, the claim says \"when they play,\" so it's about a match where Chelsea is away. So in that specific match, yes, Chelsea was the away team against Leicester.\n\nBut I need to make sure if there are multiple such instances or just one. In this table, only Row2 fits the condition. However, does the claim specify a particular game? It doesn't, so as long as at least one instance exists where Chelsea is the away team against Leicester, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nTherefore, I need to identify all relevant cells in the table that support this. The relevant columns would be 'home_team' and 'away_team'. So for Row2, both home and away teams are important because Chelsea is the away in that match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2 where Chelsea is listed as the away team against Leicester City.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home_team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away_team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the given claim about a football match is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the home team be leeds united and the away team be portsmouth.\" So, we're looking for a match where Leeds United is the home team and Portsmouth is the away team.\n\nNow, let's examine the table provided. Each row in the table represents a different match with various details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance date. My goal is to scan through each row to see if any match the conditions specified in the claim.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Home team is Chesterfield, away team is Nottingham Forest. Neither matches Leeds United or Portsmouth.\n2. **Row 2**: Home team is Leicester City, away team is Chelsea. Again, not matching.\n3. **Row 3**: This one says \"tie no: replay,\" which might indicate a rearranged match. The home team here is Chelsea, and the away team is Leicester City. Still not the ones we're looking for.\n4. **Row 4**: Home team Derby County, away team Coventry City. Not relevant.\n5. **Row 5**: Manchester City vs. Middlesbrough. No match.\n6. **Row 6**: Bradford City vs. Sheffield Wednesday. Nope.\n7. **Row 7**: Wimbledon vs. Queens Park Rangers. Doesn't fit.\n8. **Row 8**: Here, the home team is Leeds United and the away team is Portsmouth. This matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nWait a second, I should double-check to make sure I didn't skip any rows or misread the data. Scanning back through the rows, row 8 does indeed have Leeds United as the home team and Portsmouth as the away team with an attendance date of 15 February 1997.\n\nSo, this match fully supports the claim. There's no ambiguity here; all conditions are met in one of the table's rows.\n</think>\n\nThe match on **Row 8** has Leeds United as the home team and Portsmouth as the away team, which matches the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the table is true or false. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim is: \"chesterfield be the home team and nottingham forest be the away team in position tie number 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It looks like a list of matches with details such as tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance date. Each row seems to represent a different match.\n\nThe claim refers to \"tie number 1,\" so I need to find which row corresponds to that. Looking at the table, Row 1 has \"tie no: 1.\" So that's where tie number 1 is recorded.\n\nIn Row 1, the columns are:\n- tie no: 1\n- home team: chesterfield\n- score: 1 - 0\n- away team: nottingham forest\n- attendance: 15 february 1997\n\nNow, let's break down the claim. It says two things:\n\n1. Chesterfield is the home team.\n2. Nottingham Forest is the away team.\n\nLooking at Row 1, the home team is indeed chesterfield and the away team is nottingham forest. So both parts of the claim are supported by the data in this row.\n\nI should also check if there's any other relevant information that might affect this conclusion. For example, the score is 1-0, but the claim doesn't mention the score, only the teams' positions. The attendance date seems unrelated to the team positions.\n\nTherefore, since both conditions of the claim are met in Row 1, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI also need to list the relevant cells. Each cell corresponds to a part of the data that supports the claim. So, for tie number 1, the home team is under \"home team\" and the away team is under \"away team.\" So, row_index is 0 because rows are zero-indexed in programming, but wait, looking back at the example provided, in their JSON example, the first row was row_index 0. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \"row_index\" is an integer. In the table, Row 1 is tie no: 1, which would be index 0 if we start counting from 0. But looking at the JSON example, in their sample, the relevant cells are row 0 and 1. So yes, each row is numbered starting from 0.\n\nSo, in this case, since Row 1 corresponds to tie number 1, it's actually row_index 0. Wait no, that can't be right. Because in the table, Row 1 is tie no:1. If we're considering rows as starting at index 0, then Row 1 would correspond to row_index 0? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- The table has 9 rows listed from Row 1 to Row 9.\n- In JSON, the rows are probably zero-indexed, so Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc., up to Row 9 being index 8.\n\nBut in the claim, it refers to \"tie number 1,\" which is in Row 1. So if we're using row_index as per programming conventions (starting at 0), then tie no:1 is in row 0.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people count rows starting at 1, but in JSON, it's typically zero-indexed. However, the user didn't specify whether to use 1-based or 0-based indexing for row_index. But looking back at their example:\n\nIn their sample, the first relevant cell was {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}, and the second was 1. So it seems they are using zero-based indexing.\n\nTherefore, Row 1 in the table is row_index 0.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- tie no: 1 is in Row 1, which is row_index 0.\n- home team: chesterfield is in column \"home team\" of that row (row_index 0).\n- away team: nottingham forest is in column \"away team\" of that row.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 0,\n  \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 0,\n  \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n}\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are met by these two columns in row 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be TRUE as both conditions are satisfied in Row 1 (index 0) of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The key elements are:\n- Home team: Leicester City\n- Away team: Chelsea\n- Date: February 16, 1997\n\nI'll start by looking through the table to find any matches that fit these criteria. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 1: tie no: 1, home team: Chesterfield, away team: Nottingham Forest, attendance on February 15. Doesn't match since home team is Chesterfield and date is 15th.\n\nRow 2: tie no: 2, home team: Leicester City vs Chelsea, attendance on February 16.

It seems like it's saying that Portsmouth isn't listed as an away team in any match where Leeds United is the home team. So my goal is to look through the table and see if there's any instance where Portsmouth is the away team when Leeds United is playing at home.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table one by one, focusing on the 'home team' and 'away team' columns. The claim specifically mentions Leeds United as the home team, so I'll pay attention to rows where the home team is Leeds United.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Home team: Chesterfield\nRow 2: Home team: Leicester City\nRow 3: Home team: Chelsea (replay)\nRow 4: Home team: Derby County\nRow 5: Home team: Manchester City\nRow 6: Home team: Bradford City\nRow 7: Home team: Wimbledon\nRow 8: Home team: Leeds United, away team: Portsmouth. So here, when Leeds United is the home team, the away team is Portsmouth.\nRow 9: Home team: Birmingham City\n\nSo in row 8, the home team is Leeds United and the away team is Portsmouth.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Nottingham Forest was an away team in a match where there was no tie number 1. So, I need to find any occurrence where Nottingham Forest is listed as the away team and check if any of those matches have a \"tie no\" value of 1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with various details like home team, score, away team, and attendance date. The \"tie no:\" column seems to indicate the order in which ties occurred or perhaps some kind of identifier for each tie.\n\nI'll go through each row to see where Nottingham Forest is the away team:\n\n- Row 1: away team is Nottingham Forest. The tie number here is 1.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: Nottingham Forest isn't listed as the away team in any of these.\n\nSo, from this, it looks like there's at least one instance where Nottingham Forest was the away team with a tie number of 1 (Row 1). That would mean the claim is saying that they were an away team without a tie number 1, but actually, they had a tie number 1 in their match.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"tie number\". If \"tie no:\" refers to the tie number, then in Row 1, it's 1. So, if the claim says \"without a tie number 1,\" that would mean a situation where there was no tie number assigned as 1 for their away game. But since they do have tie number 1, this makes the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"tie number\" is referring to a replay or a rescheduled match. For example, in Row 3, it says \"tie no: replay.\" So perhaps \"tie no:\" can indicate whether it's a replay. But in that case, the term \"without a tie number 1\" would mean they didn't have a replay tie number of 1. However, since Row 1 clearly has Nottingham Forest as away with tie no: 1, regardless of what that number signifies, the claim is false because there exists at least one match where they were away and had a tie number (even if it's a regular tie or a replay).\n\nWait, but the claim says \"without a tie number 1.\" So maybe it's saying that in all their away games without a tie number 1. But since Row 1 shows they have a tie no: 1 as an away team, then that specific instance contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Nottingham Forest was indeed the away team with a tie number of 1.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]}",

The claim is: \"8 be the tie number with an away team of chelsea\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two things: that the tie number is 8 and that the away team in this match was Chelsea.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several rows, each representing a different tie (or match). Each row has the following columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance date. \n\nI need to find if there's a tie where the number is 8 and the away team is Chelsea.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Tie No: 1, Home Team: Chesterfield, Away Team: Nottingham Forest. Not matching.\n\nRow 2: Tie No: 2, Home Team: Leicester City, Away Team: Chelsea. Here, the tie number is 2, not 8, and Chelsea is the away team. So this doesn't match the claim because the tie number isn't 8.\n\nRow 3: Tie No: Replay, Home Team: Chelsea, Away Team: Leicester City. This is a replay of tie 2, so it's a different tie, but the tie number here is 'replay', not 8. Also, Chelsea is now the home team, which doesn't fit since the claim says away team is Chelsea.\n\nRow 4: Tie No:3, Home Team: Derby County, Away Team: Coventry City.

So this doesn't match either.\n\nSo, after going through all the rows, I don't see any row where both conditions are met: tie number is 8 and away team is Chelsea. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a row or misread something. Let's list out the ties again:\n\n- Tie1: Home Chesterfield vs Nottingham Forest\n- Tie2: Leicester City vs Chelsea (Away Team is Chelsea)\n- Tie3: Replay of Tie2, Chelsea vs Leicester (Chelsea is home here)\n- Tie4: Derby County vs Coventry City\n- Tie5: Manchester City vs Middlesbrough\n- Tie6: Bradford City vs Sheffield Wednesday\n- Tie7: Wimbledon vs Queens Park Rangers\n- Tie8: Leeds United vs Portsmouth\n- Tie9: Birmingham City vs Wrexham\n\nYes, in none of these does the tie number reach 8 with Chelsea as the away team. The only time Chelsea is an away team is in Tie2. Tie numbers go up to 9, but there's no tie numbered 8 where Chelsea is the away team.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there isn't a tie with number 8 and Chelsea as the away team.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether the claim \"8 be the tie number with an away team of chelsea\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if there exists a match in the table where the tie number is 8 and the away team is Chelsea.\n\n1. **Identify relevant columns**: The relevant columns are 'tie no' (to check for the number 8) and 'away team' (to check for Chelsea).\n2. **Check each row**:\n   - Rows 1 through 9 were examined, and none have a tie number of 8 with Chelsea as the away team.\n\nSince there is no match that satisfies both conditions in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "chelsea be the away team with the home team of coventry city",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"chelsea be the away team with the home team of coventry city.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what this claim is saying. It's stating that Chelsea is listed as the away team in a match where Coventry City is the home team. So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where Chelsea is the away team and Coventry City is the home team.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several pieces of information: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. My focus here is on the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if any match the criteria.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Chesterfield, away team is Nottingham Forest. So Coventry City isn't involved here.\nRow 2: Home team is Leicester City, away team is Chelsea. Wait, that's Chelsea as the away team, but the home team isn't Coventry City, it's Leicester City. So this doesn't match the claim.\nRow 3: It says \"tie no: replay\", so maybe a replay or rescheduled game? Home team is Chelsea, away team is Leicester City. Again, not Coventry City as home.\nRow 4: Tie no: 3, home team is Derby County, away team is Coventry City. Here, the away team is Coventry City, but the home team isn't Chelsea; it's Derby County. So this doesn't fit the claim either.\nRow 5: Home team is Manchester City, away team is Middlesbrough. Not relevant.\nRow 6: Home team is Bradford City, away team is Sheffield Wednesday. No.\nRow 7: Wimbledon vs Queens Park Rangers. Not involved.\nRow 8: Leeds United vs Portsmouth. Doesn't apply.\nRow 9: Birmingham City vs Wrexham. Not related.\n\nSo after checking all the rows, I don't see any instance where Chelsea is listed as the away team and Coventry City is the home team together. The claim seems to suggest that such a pairing exists, but from the table, it doesn't look like that's the case. \n\nWait, let me double-check in case I missed something. Did I look at all rows correctly? Row 4 had Coventry as away against Derby as home. Row 2 had Chelsea as away against Leicester as home. No other matches with Coventry as home except row 4, and in that case, the away team was Coventry, not Chelsea.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is incorrect because there's no match where Chelsea is the away team against Coventry City at home.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chelsea is the away team when Coventry City is the home team. After examining each row in the table, no such pairing exists. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the tie number with an home team of wrexham be 8",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the tie number with an home team of wrexham be 8\". So, they're saying that in the table, there's a tie where Wrexham is the home team, and the tie number for that game is 8. My task is to check each row to see if any match this condition.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, attendance, and date. So, I need to focus on the \"tie no\" column and the \"home team\" column for each row.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: tie no is 1, home team is Chesterfield. Not Wrexham, so skip.\nRow 2: tie no is 2, home team is Leicester City. Again, not Wrexham.\nRow 3: tie no is replay, home team is Chelsea. No match.\nRow 4: tie no is 3, home team is Derby County. Still not Wrexham.\nRow 5: tie no is 4, home team is Manchester City. Not our target.\nRow 6: tie no is 5, home team is Bradford City. No.\nRow 7: tie no is 6, home team is Wimbledon. Nope.\nRow 8: tie no is 7, home team is Leeds United. Still not Wrexham.\nRow 9: tie no is 8, home team is Birmingham City. Wait, but the claim is about Wrexham being the home team with tie number 8.\n\nWait a minute. I think I might have misread Row 9. Let me check again. The home team in Row 9 is Birmingham City, not Wrexham. So that's not it either.\n\nSo after going through all nine rows, none of them have Wrexham as the home team with tie number 8. Therefore, the claim must be false because there's no such entry in the table.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for verification. Since the claim is about tie number 8 and Wrexham being the home team, I should look at all rows where the home team is Wrexham to see if any of them have tie number 8. But since none do, perhaps only the row where tie no is 8 and home team is Wrexham would be relevant, but in this case, such a row doesn't exist. Alternatively, maybe I should check all rows where home team is Wrexham to see if any tie number is 8.\n\nWait, the table provided doesn't have any row with Wrexham as the home team. Let me double-check that. The home teams listed are Chesterfield, Leicester City, Chelsea, Derby County, Manchester City, Bradford City, Wimbledon, Leeds United, and Birmingham City. There's no entry for Wrexham as a home team in this table.\n\nSo, since there's no row with Wrexham as the home team at all, checking tie number 8 is unnecessary because it doesn't exist. Therefore, the relevant cells would be the ones where home team is Wrexham to confirm if their tie number is 8. But since none of them have that, perhaps it's not necessary, but I think according to instructions, we should list all rows that could potentially support or disprove the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the specific row where home team is Wrexham and tie no is 8 would be relevant, but since such a row doesn't exist, there are no relevant cells. However, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says that for Wrexham as the home team, their tie number is 8. Since in this table, Wrexham isn't listed as a home team at all, so the answer should be false.\n\nIn terms of relevant cells, since there are no rows with Wrexham as the home team, perhaps none are relevant, but maybe we need to include any row where home team is Wrexham. Since they don't exist, the list might be empty. But according to the example given in the problem statement, when a cell is relevant, it's included. So if there are no such cells, then the answer is false, and perhaps the relevant_cells array would have zero entries.\n\nWait, but I think the user expects that if any of the rows match the condition, those rows' columns are considered relevant. Since none do, maybe we don't include any. But to be thorough, perhaps list all rows where home team is Wrexham, which in this case are none, so no cells are relevant.\n\nBut let me think again: The claim is that there's a tie with tie number 8 and Wrexham as the home team. So we need to check if any row has home team Wrexham and tie no 8. Since such a row doesn't exist, the answer is false.\n\nSo, in terms of relevant cells, perhaps all rows where home team is Wrexham are relevant because they could have the correct tie number. But since there's no such row, maybe we can include them anyway. However, in this case, since none of the rows have Wrexham as the home team, even if I look at all of them, perhaps none are relevant.\n\nWait, but looking back, the claim is about a specific tie number (8) and a specific home team (Wrexham). So any row where the home team is Wrexham would be relevant because they might have tie number 8. Since in this table, such rows don't exist, perhaps no cells are relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider all rows where home team is Wrexham and tie no could be anything, but since none exist, it's not applicable. So maybe the relevant_cells list would include the columns for each row that has Wrexham as home team, but in this table, there are none, so the list is empty.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to return a JSON object with \"relevant_cells\" being a list of objects with row_index and column_name. If there are no relevant cells because Wrexham isn't even present as a home team, then perhaps the answer is false, and the relevant_cells array would be empty.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement's example, they included all relevant columns that could potentially support the claim. So if the claim is about tie number 8 for Wrexham, but there are no such rows, then none of the cells are relevant, hence the answer is false with an empty relevant_cells list.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the user expects to look at all rows where home team is Wrexham and check their tie number. Since there are none, maybe no relevant cells exist, so the answer is false.\n\nAlternatively, in some interpretations, if Wrexham isn't present as a home team, then tie number 8 doesn't apply, making the claim automatically false without needing to look at any specific cell. Therefore, perhaps only the row where home team is Wrexham and tie no is 8 would be relevant, but since such a row doesn't exist, maybe no cells are relevant.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is that there's no such tie with tie number 8 and Wrexham as home team in the table, so the claim is false. The relevant_cells list might be empty because none of the rows have Wrexham as a home team to check.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine whether there exists a tie with a specific number (8) for a particular home team (Wrexham). After reviewing the provided data, it's evident that Wrexham isn't listed as a home team in any of the rows. Therefore, there's no tie number 8 associated with Wrexham.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false because Wrexham does not appear as a home team in any tie within the provided data.\n\n**Relevant Cells:** Since there are no ties for Wrexham, no specific cells are relevant. The list of relevant cells is empty.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"false\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
