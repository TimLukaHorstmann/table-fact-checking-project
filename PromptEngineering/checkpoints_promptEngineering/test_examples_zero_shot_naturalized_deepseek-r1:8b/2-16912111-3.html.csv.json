    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Blue Bombers' 2008 season is true or false by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"During the 2008 season, the Blue Bombers play at home versus the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1 after facing the Montreal Alouettes on the road on October 26.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to check against the table.\n\n1. **Date**: The home game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats is supposed to be on November 1.\n2. **Opponent**: The opponent in that home game is the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n3. **Road Game**: Before that, on October 26, they faced the Montreal Alouettes on the road.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, score, result, attendance, and record. I need to find if there's a game where:\n\n- The opponent is Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n- The date is November 1 (or close to it, considering possible typos).\n- And before that, on October 26, they played the Montreal Alouettes away.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 18**: Week: 18, Date: Oct 26, Opponent: Montreal Alouettes. Result is a win, attendance 20202. So this matches the road game against Montreal Alouettes on October 26.\n\nNext, looking for a home game against Hamilton Tiger-Cats after that. The next relevant week would be Week 19, which is Row 19: Week: 19, Date: Nov 1, Opponent: Hamilton Tiger - Cats. That seems to fit the claim. \n\nWait, but in the table, some rows are missing data (like Row 9 with all dashes). So, I need to ensure that there's a game on November 1. The table shows Week 19 as Nov 1, so yes, that should be the home game.\n\nHowever, let me check if any other games against Hamilton Tiger-Cats happened around that time. For example, Row 13 is Week 13, Sept 19, vs Hamilton. So before October 26. Then, Row 18 is Oct 26, Montreal. Then, the next game against Hamilton would be in November.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to have two parts: a road game on Oct 26 and a home game on Nov 1 against Hamilton Tiger-Cats.\n\nWait, but in the table, after Week 18 (Oct 26), Week 19 is Nov 1. So the sequence is:\n\n- Week 18: Oct 26 vs Montreal away\n- Week 19: Nov 1 vs Hamilton home\n\nYes, that matches the claim's description.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For the game on Oct 26: Row 18, columns: date, opponent, result (but maybe just date and opponent).\n- For the game on Nov 1: Row 19, columns: date, opponent, result.\n\nBut looking at the instructions, each relevant cell needs to have row index and column name. So for Row 18, the columns are 'date' and 'opponent'. Similarly, for Row 19, same columns.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has several columns: week, date, opponent, score, result, attendance, record. The claim refers to specific games, so we need to verify that those two games exist as described.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Oct 26 vs Montreal Alouettes (road): Row index is 18, column_name 'date' and 'opponent'.\n- For Nov 1 vs Hamilton Tiger-Cats (home): Row index 19, columns 'date' and 'opponent'.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because these two games are present in the table. The attendance for Row 19 seems to match as well, but since the claim doesn't mention attendance, just the opponent and dates, that's sufficient.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the blue bomber defeat the edmonton eskimos 30 - 23 at home a week prior to lose to the eskimo by a score of 36 - 22 on the road.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is that the Blue Bombers defeated the Edmonton Eskimos 30-23 at home. The second part is that a week later, they lost to the Eskimos 36-22 on the road.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the game. I need to find two specific games: one where the Blue Bombers won against the Edmonton Eskimos at home with a score of 30-23, and another where they lost to them on the road with a 36-22 score.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's opponent, score, location, and result. \n\nRow 1: Opponent is Toronto Argonauts, loss.\nRow 2: Montreal Alouettes, loss.\nRow 3: BC Lions, loss.\nRow 4: BC Lions, loss.\nRow 5: Calgary Stampeders, win.\nRow 6: Toronto Argonauts, loss.\nRow 7: Montreal Alouettes, loss.\nRow 8: Hamilton Tiger-Cats, win.\nRow 9: No data.\nRow 10: Saskatchewan Roughriders, loss.\nRow 11: Saskatchewan Roughriders, loss.\nRow 12: Toronto Argonauts, win.\nRow 13: Hamilton Tiger-Cats, win.\nRow 14: Edmonton Eskimos, win.\nRow 15: Edmonton Eskimos, loss.\nRow 16: Toronto Argonauts, win.\nRow 17: Calgary Stampeders, loss.\nRow 18: Montreal Alouettes, win.\nRow 19: Hamilton Tiger-Cats, win.\n\nLooking for the Edmonton Eskimos games:\n\nRow 14: Week 14, date Sept 26. Opponent is Edmonton Eskimos. Score 30-23. Result: win. Location? The table doesn't specify home or away, but typically, if not specified, it's assumed to be home. So this is a potential match for the first part of the claim.\n\nThen, looking for a loss against them on the road with a score of 36-22. The next occurrence would likely be the following week (week 15), but in row 15: Opponent is Edmonton Eskimos, score 36-22, result: loss. However, the date is Oct 4, which is two weeks after Sept 26. The claim says \"a week prior,\" so from the win to the loss should be a week later.\n\nWait, if the first game was Week 14 (Sept 26), then the next week would be Week 15 (Oct 3 or 4). But in the table, row 15 is Oct 4. So that's exactly one week after Sept 26. However, looking at the scores: the claim says they lost on the road to Eskimos with a score of 36-22. In row 15, the opponent is Edmonton Eskimos and the result is a loss, but what about location? The table doesn't specify home or away for that game. It just says attendance: 40453. Without explicit info, maybe it's assumed to be away because they're on the road.\n\nWait, no, the claim mentions \"at home\" in the first part and \"on the road\" in the second. So in row 14, if it's at home (as per the claim), then row 15 needs to be an away game. But the table doesn't specify location for row 15. That could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for any occurrence where they lost on the road to Eskimos with that score. Let me check if there's another game against Eskimos.\n\nRow 14: Win at home (assuming), 30-23.\nRow 15: Loss, 36-22, but location unknown.\nOther Eskimo games are in row 10 and 11, which are earlier weeks.\n\nWait, perhaps the loss is in a later week. Let me see: Row 17 is Calgary Stampeders, loss; row 18 is Montreal Alouettes, win; no more Eskimos after that except row 14 and 15.\n\nSo, if row 14 is home win against Eskimos on Sept 26, then row 15 would be the following week (Oct 4), but location not specified. If it's considered away, then that could fit. However, the claim says \"on the road,\" implying that the second game was away.\n\nBut without explicit info in the table, I can't be certain. Alternatively, maybe the loss is a different game, perhaps row 15 isn't the one because location isn't specified, but perhaps another week where they lost to Eskimos on the road with that score.\n\nWait, looking back: The only other Eskimos game after row 14 is row 15, so if it's considered away, then yes. So the two relevant cells would be row 14 (opponent Edmonton, home win) and row 15 (opponent Edmonton, loss, location unknown but likely away).\n\nBut since the claim specifies \"on the road\" for the second part, I think we can assume that in week 15, it was an away game. So the two relevant cells are row 14 (Edmonton, home win) and row 15 (Edmonton, away loss). Therefore, the answer would be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to verify both games:\n\n1. **Win at Home vs Edmonton Eskimos**: Found in Week 14 (row_index: 13), with a score of 30-23. The opponent is Edmonton Eskimos, and since it's assumed to be home unless stated otherwise.\n2. **Loss on Road vs Edmonton Eskimos**: Found in Week 15 (row_index: 14), with a score of 36-22. Although the location isn't explicitly mentioned, it's inferred to be away based on the claim.\n\nSince both conditions are met, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is about attendance numbers for two specific games in 2008. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully:\n\n1. \"30110 fans attended the Blue Bombers game against the Calgary Stampeders on October 18, 2008.\"\n2. \"Only 20202 fans attended the Blue Bombers game against the Montreal Alouettes on October 26, 2008.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized by row with details like week, date, opponent, score, result, attendance, and record. Each row represents a different game, so I should look for the games mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: Calgary Stampeders on October 18, 2008. I'll scan through each row to find this specific game.\n\n- Row 1: June 27 vs Toronto Argonauts\n- Row 2: July 4 vs Montreal Alouettes\n- Row 3: July 11 vs BC Lions\n- Row 4: July 18 vs BC Lions\n- Row 5: July 24 vs Calgary Stampeders (Score: 32-28, Win)\n- Row 6: Aug 1 vs Toronto Argonauts\n- Row 7: Aug 8 vs Montreal Alouettes\n- Row 8: Aug 14 vs Hamilton Tiger-Cats (Score: 37-24, Win)\n- Row 9: No data; possibly the game on Nov 1?\n- Row 10: Aug 31 vs Saskatchewan Roughriders\n- Row 11: Sept 7 vs Saskatchewan Roughriders\n- Row 12: Sept 12 vs Toronto Argonauts\n- Row 13: Sept 19 vs Hamilton Tiger-Cats\n- Row 14: Sept 26 vs Edmonton Eskimos\n- Row 15: Oct 4 vs Edmonton Eskimos (Score: 36-22, Loss)\n- Row 16: Oct 10 vs Toronto Argonauts (Score: 25-16, Win)\n- Row 17: Oct 18 vs Calgary Stampeders (Score: 37-16, Loss) \u2013 This matches the date and opponent for the first part of the claim.\n\nSo, in Row 17, attendance is listed as 30110. That's correct for the first part.\n\nNext, checking the second part: Montreal Alouettes on October 26, 2008.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- After Oct 4 (Row 15), the next relevant date would be Oct 10 (Row 16) and then Oct 18 (Row 17). Then Row 18 is Oct 26 vs Montreal Alouettes.\n\nSo, in Row 18: opponent is Montreal Alouettes, date is Oct 26. The score was a win with attendance 20202. That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, but I notice that the claim says \"only 20202 fans attended,\" while according to the table, on Oct 26, attendance was 20202. So both parts of the claim seem correct based on the table data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each game's attendance against the table. Both attendances match the given numbers in the table for their respective games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"the blue bomber defeat the toronto argonauts on oct 10, but lose to the calgary stampeders the follow week by a score of 37 - 16.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts. \n\n1. The Blue Bombers defeat the Toronto Argonauts on October 10.\n2. The following week (which would be October 17), they lose to the Calgary Stampeders with a score of 37-16.\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table provided.\n\nStarting with the first part: the Blue Bombers defeating the Toronto Argonauts on October 10. Looking at the table, the rows go from week 1 to week 19, and the dates range up to November 1. I should look for a game where the opponent is the Toronto Argonauts (abbreviated as TOR) around October 10.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Week 16: Date is Oct 10, Opponent is Toronto Argonauts. The score is 25 - 16 and result is win. So this matches the first part of the claim. Therefore, relevant cells would be row 16 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or not). Wait, in the table provided, Row 1 is week 1, so row_index starts at 0? Or does it start at 1? The user hasn't specified, but looking at their example, they have \"row_index\": 0. So I think rows are 0-based.\n\nWait no, in the table given, each row starts with \"week: X\", and the first row is week 1, so if row indices start at 0, then row 15 would be week 16? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: week 1\nRow 2: week 2\n...\nRow 16: week 16\n\nSo each row's \"week\" is one more than the previous. So if the claim refers to Oct 10 as week X, I need to see which row that corresponds to.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map weeks and dates:\n\nThe table has dates from June 27 (week 1) up to Nov 1 (week 19). Each week increments by 1. So week 16 is Oct 10 because:\n\nWeeks: 1-2: June 27-July 4\n3-4: July 11-18\n5-6: July 24-Aug 1\n7-8: Aug 8-15\n9: Aug 14 (no game)\n10-11: Aug 31-Sep 7\n12-13: Sep 12-19\n14-15: Sep 26-Oct 4\n16-17: Oct 10-17\n18-19: Oct 26-Nov1\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at Row 16: week 16, date: oct 10, opponent: toronto argonauts, score:25-16, result: win.\n\nSo yes, week 16 is Oct 10. So Blue Bombers won against TOR on Oct 10. That's the first part of the claim.\n\nNow the second part: the following week (Oct 17) they lose to Calgary Stampeders with a score of 37-16.\n\nLooking for games in week 17 (since week 16 is Oct 10, next week is week 17).\n\nCheck week 17 in the table:\n\nRow 17: week 17, date: oct 18, opponent: calgary stampeders, score: 37 -16, result: loss.\n\nWait, but the claim says they lost the following week, which would be Oct 17. However, in the table, the game against Calgary Stampeders is on Oct 18 (week 17). So it's actually the next week after Oct 10, which is correct. But the date in the table is Oct 18, not Oct 17.\n\nWait, so if Oct 10 is week 16, then the following week is week 17: Oct 17-24? Or does each week span a single week? Because in the table, week 16 is Oct 10, and week 17 would be Oct 11-17, but the game is on Oct 18. Hmm, maybe the weeks are Monday to Sunday.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the games are on specific dates, regardless of the week number. So if the claim says \"the following week\" after Oct 10, which would be Oct 17 or Oct 18? \n\nIn any case, the claim specifies that they lost to Calgary Stampeders the following week (so the week after Oct 10), and the score is 37-16.\n\nLooking at the table, week 17: opponent is Calgary Stampeders, date Oct 18, score 37-16, result loss. So this matches the second part of the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to \"the follow week\" after Oct 10 as Oct 17, but in reality, the game is on Oct 18, which is technically not the same week. However, depending on how weeks are structured, sometimes a week can span from Monday to Sunday. So if Oct 10 is a Friday, then the next Monday would be Oct 13, making the following Tuesday (Oct 14) as the start of the next week.\n\nBut regardless of that, the game in question is indeed week 17, which is the week after week 16. So the claim's second part is correct.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Week 16 (Oct 10): Blue Bombers beat TOR 25-16.\n- Week 17 (Oct 18): They lose to CAL 37-16.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. Now, identifying the relevant cells.\n\nFor the first part: row_index is 15? Wait, let's count rows:\n\nLooking at the table, each row starts with \"week: X\", so:\n\nRow 1: week 1\nRow 2: week 2\n...\nRow 16: week 16\n\nSo if the first relevant game is week 16 (Oct 10), that's Row 16. But in the example given by the user, the first row was considered row_index 0.\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nIn the example provided, the JSON had \"row_index\": 0 and \"column_name\": \"Revenue\", etc. So probably, the rows are zero-indexed.\n\nSo for week 1: row_index 0\nweek 2: row_index 1\n...\nweek 16: row_index 15\n\nSimilarly, week 17 is row 16.\n\nWait no, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nThe table as provided has each row starting with \"week: X\", so Row 1 is week 1, Row 2 is week 2, up to Row 19 being week 19. So in the JSON example, they had {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"Revenue\"}, implying that row_index starts at 0 for the first row.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Week 16: corresponds to row_index 15 (since row 1 is 0, row 2 is 1,..., week 16 is row 15)\n- Week 17: corresponds to row_index 16\n\nSo for the first part of the claim, the relevant cells are row 15 and column \"Opponent\" or maybe \"Result\"? Wait, no. The claim refers to defeating TOR on Oct 10, so we need columns that show the opponent and the result.\n\nLooking at the table's structure, each row has columns like:\n\n- week: X\n- date: Y\n- opponent: Z\n- score: A-B\n- result: Win/Lose\n\nSo to confirm the game, I need to check both the opponent and the date. Alternatively, perhaps just the date is enough, but since there might be multiple games against TOR, it's better to include both opponent and date.\n\nBut in the example given by the user, they only listed \"Revenue\" as a column, which isn't relevant here. So for our case, we need to identify which columns are relevant: opponent, date, score, result.\n\nWait, but the JSON requires each relevant cell to specify row_index and column_name. Since each row has multiple columns, perhaps each piece of information is in its own column.\n\nSo, for the first part:\n\n- Opponent is TOR (so need to check that column)\n- Date is Oct 10 (check date column)\n- Score is 25-16 (check score column)\n- Result is Win (check result column)\n\nSimilarly, for the second part:\n\n- Opponent is CAL\n- Date is Oct 18 (or perhaps the following week's date, but in the table it's Oct 18)\n- Score is 37-16\n- Result is Lose\n\nBut the claim mentions \"the follow week\", so we might need to check that the opponent and date correspond.\n\nWait, but since each row has a unique combination of opponent and date, perhaps just checking the date after Oct 10 suffices. Alternatively, it's better to check both opponent and date for accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find which row corresponds to each game by their date. Since each week may have multiple games, but in this case, it's two separate games.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst Game:\n- Opponent: TOR\n- Date: Oct 10\nRow_index:15 (week 16)\n\nSecond Game:\n- Opponent: CAL\n- Date: Oct 18\nRow_index:16 (week 17)\n\nThus, the relevant columns are \"Opponent\", \"Date\", \"Score\", and \"Result\" for each part.\n\nTherefore, to represent that these games occurred as per the claim, we need to list each of these columns.\n\nBut wait, in the JSON example, they only listed one cell. So perhaps each piece of information (opponent, date, etc.) is considered a separate relevant cell? That might be the case, given that each data point could be in its own column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire row can be considered a single relevant cell, but I think it's more likely that each specific data point is a cell.\n\nSo for the first game (defeating TOR on Oct 10):\n\n- Opponent: TOR\n- Date: Oct 10\n- Score: 25-16\n- Result: Win\n\nEach of these would be separate relevant cells. Similarly, for the second game:\n\n- Opponent: CAL\n- Date: Oct 18\n- Score:37-16\n- Result: Lose\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just specifying the opponent and date is sufficient to confirm the claim. Because if on Oct 10 they played TOR and won, and then on the following week (Oct 17 or 18) they lost to CAL, then the claim holds.\n\nSo for brevity, perhaps we can list the opponent and date for each game.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to include all relevant columns that support the claim. So if someone needs to verify the claim, having all these data points would help.\n\nBut given the structure of the example provided by the user, which had only one cell, I think they might be expecting a single relevant cell per part of the claim.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nFor defeating TOR on Oct 10: opponent=TOR, date=Oct 10\n\nFor losing to CAL the following week: opponent=CAL, date=Oct 18\n\nBut since each row has multiple columns, we need to map which columns correspond. So in the JSON, for each game, list the relevant columns.\n\nTherefore, perhaps each part of the claim corresponds to two relevant cells: one for the opponent and one for the date.\n\nAlternatively, considering that \"the following week\" might require checking the week number, but since week 16 is Oct 10, the next week would be week 17, which is Oct 18.\n\nThus:\n\nFirst Game:\n- Opponent: TOR\n- Date: Oct 10\n- Week:16\n\nSecond Game:\n- Opponent: CAL\n- Date: Oct 18\n- Week:17\n\nBut I'm not sure if the JSON example expects only certain columns. Alternatively, perhaps just opponent and date.\n\nIn any case, to be thorough, let's list each relevant column for both games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from two specific weeks:\n\n1. **Week 16 (Oct 10):** The team defeated their opponent TOR with a score of 25-16, resulting in a win.\n2. **Week 17 (Oct 18):** The team lost to their opponent CAL with a score of 37-16.\n\nEach of these games is documented in separate rows within the dataset. \n\nTo confirm these details, the relevant columns are:\n\n### Week 16 (Oct 10):\n- Opponent: TOR\n- Date: Oct 10\n- Score: 25-16\n- Result: Win\n\n### Week 17 (Oct 18):\n- Opponent: CAL\n- Date: Oct 18\n- Score: 37-16\n- Result: Lose\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant data points are as detailed above.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"opponent\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"value\": \"TOR\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"value\": \"CAL\" }\n  ],\n  \"date\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"value\": \"Oct 10\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"value\": \"Oct 18\" }\n  ],\n  \"score\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"value\": \"25-16\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"value\": \"37-16\" }\n  ],\n  \"result\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"value\": \"Win\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"value\": \"Lose\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Additionally, 24,595 fans attended another Blue Bomber game at home against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1, 2008.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find matches for these numbers and details.\n\nStarting with the first part: attendance of 20,202 at a game against the Montreal Alouettes. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 2: Attendance is 20,202 on July 4 against the Montreal Alouettes.\n- Row 18: Attendance is 20,202 on October 26 against the Montreal Alouettes.\n\nWait, that's two different games with the same attendance. So both row 2 and row 18 have attendance of 20,202 for games against the Montreal Alouettes. But the claim specifies a specific date\u2014October 26, 2008, which matches row 18.\n\nNext, the second part: 24,595 fans attending a game at home against Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1, 2008.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"During the 2008 season, the Blue Bomber play at home versus the Hamilton Tiger - Cat on Nov 1 after facing the Montreal Alouettes on the road on Oct 18.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify the key elements in the claim. It mentions three main things:\n1. The Blue Bombers played against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at home on November 1.\n2. Before that game, they faced the Montreal Alouettes on the road on October 18.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week of games with details like date, opponent, score, result, attendance, and record. The team in question is not explicitly stated, but given the opponents mentioned (Toronto Argonauts, Montreal Alouettes, etc.), it's likely referring to the Blue Bombers since they are one of the teams commonly referred to as \"Blue Bomber.\"\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a game where the Blue Bombers played at home against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1. Also, confirm that before this home game, they had a road game against the Montreal Alouettes on October 18.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Week 12: Sept 12 vs Toronto Argonauts (home) \u2013 No.\n- Week 13: Sept 19 vs Hamilton Tiger-Cats \u2013 Yes, but it's a week in September, not November.\n- Week 14: Sept 26 vs Edmonton Eskimos \u2013 Home, but still September.\n- Week 15: Oct 4 vs Edmonton Eskimos \u2013 Home, but different opponent and earlier than October 18.\n- Week 16: Oct 10 vs Toronto Argonauts \u2013 Home, but again not matching November date.\n- Week 17: Oct 18 vs Calgary Stampeders \u2013 Road game, so this would be the Montreal Alouettes? Wait, no, the opponent is Calgary. So that's a loss on the road against Calgary, not against Montreal.\n\nWait, in week 17, the Blue Bombers played Calgary Stampeders on October 18, which was a loss. The claim says they faced Montreal Alouettes on Oct 18 on the road. So there's a discrepancy here. In the table, on Oct 18, they were playing Calgary Stampeders away.\n\nThen week 18: Oct 26 vs Montreal Alouettes \u2013 Home game. So the Blue Bombers played at home against Montreal Alouettes on Oct 26, not Nov 1. That doesn't match the claim.\n\nLooking for a game where the opponent is Hamilton Tiger-Cats and date is Nov 1. The last row in the table is week 19: Nov 1 vs Hamilton Tiger-Cats \u2013 Yes, that's a home game. So according to the table, on Nov 1, they played at home against Hamilton Tiger-Cats, which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nBut wait, the claim says this happened after facing Montreal Alouettes on the road on Oct 18. However, in week 17 (Oct 18), they played Calgary Stampeders away, not Montreal Alouettes. So that part doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because while there is a home game against Hamilton Tiger-Cats on Nov 1 (week 19), the Blue Bombers did not face the Montreal Alouettes on Oct 18; instead, they played Calgary Stampeders. Thus, the sequence described in the claim doesn't align with the table data.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the Blue Bombers' game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1 occurred after a road game against the Calgary Stampeders, not the Montreal Alouettes.

The claim states: \"the blue bomber defeat the edmonton eskimos 30 - 24 at home a week prior to lose to the eskimo by a score of 36 - 22 on the road.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. \n\n1. The Blue Bombers defeated the Edmonton Eskimos 30-24 at home.\n2. A week after this game, they lost to the Eskimos 36-22 on the road.\n\nI need to verify both parts by checking the table.\n\nStarting with part one: Looking for a game where the opponent is the Edmonton Eskimos (Edmonton Eskimos), the score is 30-24, and it's a win. \n\nLooking through the rows, I'll check each week:\n\nRow 14: Week 14, opponent Edmonton Eskimos, score 30-23, result win. Hmm, that's close but not exactly 30-24.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another row. Let me go back. No, in the table provided, only Row 14 has Edmonton Eskimos as the opponent, with a score of 30-23. There's no game where the Blue Bombers scored 30 and won by 6 points (30-24). So perhaps there is no such game in the table.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the rows. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 14: opponent Edmonton Eskimos, score 30-23, result win. That's a close game, but not exactly 30-24.\n\nIs there any other row where the Blue Bombers play Edmonton and have a 30-24 win? From the table, it seems only Row 14 is relevant for Edmonton games, and that's a 30-23 win. So maybe the claim has an error here.\n\nMoving on to part two: A week after defeating Edmonton 30-24 at home, they lost to Edmonton on the road 36-22.\n\nBut since there's no game where Blue Bombers won Edmonton 30-24 at home in the table, this second part can't be verified either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The first part is a week before losing, so perhaps the loss happened a week after a different game? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial win was at home against Edmonton with 30-24, but in the table, the only Edmonton game is Row 14: 30-23 win at home. So no exact match for 30-24.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't align exactly with the table provided. The first part isn't accurately represented, and the second part can't be verified without the initial correct game.\n\nSo, putting it together, the claim is not fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Blue Bombers defeated the Edmonton Eskimos 30-24 at home a week before losing to them 36-22 on the road. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n1. **Part 1**: There's no game where the Blue Bombers won against the Edmonton Eskimos with a score of 30-24 at home.\n2. **Part 2**: Since there's no accurate Part 1, the second part cannot be verified.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"the blue bomber defeat the toronto argonauts on oct 18, but lose to the calgary stampeders the follow week by a score of 37 - 16.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. The Blue Bombers defeated the Toronto Argonauts on October 18.\n2. In the following week (which would be after October 18), they lost to the Calgary Stampeders with a score of 37-16.\n\nI need to check these points against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The columns relevant here are:\n\n- Week\n- Date\n- Opponent\n- Score (which includes both teams' scores)\n- Result (win/loss)\n- Attendance and record, but those might not be necessary for this claim.\n\nI'll start by looking for the Blue Bombers in the table. Wait, actually, the opponents listed are various teams: Toronto Argonauts, Montreal Alouettes, BC Lions, Calgary Stampeders, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Edmonton Eskimos, Saskatchewan Roughriders. I don't see \"Blue Bombers\" as an opponent or team name here. Hmm, maybe the Blue Bombers are a team that isn't listed directly in opponents but is referred to in the table as something else? Or perhaps I misread the table.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, each row has an 'opponent' column. There's no mention of \"Blue Bombers\" there. That's confusing because the claim mentions them defeating the Toronto Argonauts. So maybe I need to check if \"Blue Bombers\" are another name for one of these teams or perhaps a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Blue Bombers are the home team in some games, but their opponents are listed as others. Let me see the relevant rows around October 18.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 16: week 16, date Oct 10, opponent Toronto Argonauts, score 25-16, result win.\nRow 17: week 17, date Oct 18, opponent Calgary Stampeders, score 37-16, result loss.\n\nSo in row 17, the Blue Bombers played against Calgary Stampeders on Oct 18 and lost 37-16. Now, does this match the first part of the claim?\n\nThe claim says they defeated Toronto Argonauts on Oct 18. But according to the table, on Oct 18, they played Calgary, not Toronto. So that part is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if there's a game where Blue Bombers (if they are another team) played Toronto on Oct 18. Looking at the table, row 17 is Oct 18 vs Calgary. There's no other row with Oct 18 against Toronto. So that part of the claim seems false.\n\nThen, the second part says they lost to Calgary the following week by 37-16. Wait, but in the table, they played Calgary on Oct 18 (row 17), so that would be the same week, not the following week. The next game after Oct 18 is row 18: Oct 26 vs Montreal Alouettes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting weeks. Let me see the structure:\n\nRow 16: Oct 10\nRow 17: Oct 18\nRow 18: Oct 26\n\nSo if the claim says they lost to Calgary on Oct 18 and then lost again the following week (which would be Oct 25, but that's not a row in the table), but wait, the next game after Oct 18 is Oct 26. So perhaps the claim is saying that in the following week after defeating Toronto on Oct 18, they lose to Calgary the same week? That doesn't make sense because the games are weekly.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. The claim says: \"defeat the toronto argonauts on oct 18, but lose to the calgary stampeders the follow week by a score of 37 -16.\"\n\nSo first, Blue Bombers beat Toronto Argos on Oct 18. Then, in the following week (so weeks after Oct 18), they lost to Calgary with that score.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- There's no game where Blue Bombers played Toronto on Oct 18. The only Oct 18 game is against Calgary, which Blue Bombers lost.\n- Therefore, the first part of the claim is incorrect because they didn't defeat Toronto on Oct 18; they played Calgary that day.\n\nSo both parts of the claim don't align with the table. Wait, but I'm confused because the opponents are specific: the claim says \"defeat the toronto argonauts\" and then \"lose to the calgary stampeders,\" but in reality, on Oct 18, they played Calgary, not Toronto.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Blue Bombers refer to another team that I haven't identified. But looking at the opponents, none are named Blue Bombers; perhaps it's a misprint or I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Blue Bombers\" is an alias for one of the listed teams. For example, sometimes teams have multiple names or aliases. Let me think: in CFL, there are several teams with unique names. The opponents listed are:\n\n- Toronto Argonauts\n- Montreal Alouettes\n- BC Lions\n- Calgary Stampeders\n- Hamilton Tiger-Cats\n- Edmonton Eskimos\n- Saskatchewan Roughriders\n\nNone of these are Blue Bombers. So perhaps the claim is referring to a different team, but since it's not in the table as an opponent, maybe I should consider that the relevant cells don't exist because the opponents are different.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"the blue bomber defeat...\" so if the table doesn't include them as opponents, then the claim can't be supported. Therefore, the answer would be false.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check: perhaps I misread row 16 and 17.\n\nRow 16: Oct 10 vs Toronto Argonauts, won.\nRow 17: Oct 18 vs Calgary Stampeders, lost.\n\nSo the claim says they defeated Toronto on Oct 18 (which is incorrect) and then lost to Calgary in the following week. But according to the table, they played Calgary on Oct 18, not the following week. The next game after Oct 18 is Oct 26 against Montreal.\n\nTherefore, the second part of the claim is also incorrect because the loss to Calgary happened on Oct 18, not the following week.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are wrong. Therefore, the overall answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's first part incorrectly states that the Blue Bombers defeated the Toronto Argonauts on October 18, when in reality they played against the Calgary Stampeders that day and lost. The second part also misrepresents the timeline, as the loss to Calgary occurred on October 18, not a following week. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine if a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table lists games with various details, and the claim specifies two specific game attendances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It says that on October 18, 2008, when the Blue Bombers played against the Calgary Stampeders, 30,110 fans attended. Then, on October 26, 2008, when they played the Montreal Alouettes, only 20,102 fans attended.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the relevant rows and columns for each part of the claim. The key columns here are \"week,\" \"date,\" \"opponent,\" \"score,\" \"result,\" \"attendance,\" and \"record.\" The relevant information we're looking for is the attendance numbers for specific dates and opponents.\n\nStarting with the first part: October 18, 2008, against Calgary Stampeders. Scanning through the table, row 17 has a week of 17, date Oct 18, opponent Calgary Stampeders, score 37-16, result loss, attendance 30,110, and record 6-10. So that's the first data point correct.\n\nNow for the second part: October 26, 2008, against Montreal Alouettes. Looking at row 18, week 18, date Oct 26, opponent Montreal Alouettes, score 24-23, result win, attendance 20,202, record 7-10.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"20102 fans attended the Blue Bombers game against the Montreal Alouettes on October 26, 2008. Also, 24,595 fans attended a Blue Bombers home game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1, 2008.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check if there are any rows that match these specifics.\n\nStarting with the first part: attendance of 20,102 at a game against Montreal Alouettes on October 26. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 18 has date Oct 26, opponent Montreal Alouettes, and attendance 20,202. The score is a win for the Blue Bombers. So, while the numbers are close (20,102 vs 20,202), they aren't exact matches. But maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Blue Bombers game at the Montreal Alouettes,\" which might mean that it was a away game for Blue Bombers against Montreal Alouettes. In Row 18, opponent is Montreal Alouettes, but the result is a win, so that aligns with the claim's score being a win.\n\nHowever, attendance in Row 18 is 20,202, not 20,102 as stated in the claim. That\u2019s a discrepancy. So unless there was a mistake in the table, this part seems off.\n\nNext, checking for the second part: 24,595 fans attending a Blue Bombers home game against Hamilton Tiger-Cats on November 1. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 19 has date Nov 1, opponent Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The attendance here is 24,595, which matches the claim. The result was a win, so that aligns as well.\n\nSo the second part of the claim seems to be accurate based on Row 19.\n\nNow, for the first part, since there's no exact match with both the date and opponent as per the table, it might seem like the claim is FALSE because attendance doesn't match. However, I should consider if maybe there was a typo in the attendance number or if perhaps the Blue Bombers had another game against Montreal Alouettes on that date.\n\nLooking back at Row 18, the opponent is indeed Montreal Alouettes on Oct 26 with an attendance of 20,202. There's no other row for Oct 26, so it seems only one game happened that day. Therefore, the claim's first part doesn't match exactly, leading me to think the overall claim might be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, the user instruction mentions checking each condition. The claim has two parts: the attendance numbers and the specific games. Since the first attendance number doesn't match, but the second does, it's a mixed result. However, since one part is incorrect, the entire claim isn't fully supported. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
