    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"takaichi hirayama finish the event in 1.25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. The name mentioned is Takaichi Hirayama. Looking through the table, I remember there are a few rows that mention this name. \n\nStarting from row 15: res: win, record: 10 - 2, opponent: takaichi hirayama, method: submission (armbar), event: pancrase - shining 5, round: 1, time: 1:25, location: tokyo , japan.\n\nSo, this row is about Takaichi Hirayama. The important part here is the \"time\" column, which says 1:25. Now, the claim says he finished in 1.25 minutes. Hmm, does that match?\n\nWait, but in mixed martial arts (mma), events are typically won by submission, knockout, or decision. Sometimes fighters win in rounds with specific times. The time is recorded as \"1:25\", which I think means one minute and twenty-five seconds, not 1.25 minutes. Because 1.25 minutes would be 75 seconds, but here it's 1 minute 25 seconds, so that's 85 seconds.\n\nBut the claim says 1.25, which is probably being interpreted as 1 minute and 25 seconds (since sometimes people use .25 to denote a quarter of a minute). However, in the table, it's written as \"1:25\", so maybe it's in minutes:seconds format, making it 85 seconds.\n\nWait, but 1.25 minutes is actually 75 seconds, which is different from 1:25, which is 85 seconds. So there's a discrepancy here. That means the time in the table doesn't exactly match what's claimed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a specific round time or something else. But looking at row 15, the event is pancrase - shining 5, round 1, time 1:25. So it's in the first round, finished in 1 minute and 25 seconds.\n\nThe claim says \"takaichi hirayama finish the event in 1.25\". If we interpret 1.25 as 1 minute and 25 seconds (since .25 of a minute is 15 seconds), but actually, 0.25 minutes would be 15 seconds, so 1.25 minutes would be 1 minute and 15 seconds. Wait, that's not matching the table either.\n\nWait no, maybe it's better to think in decimal terms: 1.25 minutes is 75 seconds, which is 1 minute and 15 seconds. But the table says 1:25, which is 85 seconds. So they don't match exactly.\n\nSo the time in the table for Takaichi Hirayama is 1:25 (85 seconds), but the claim says 1.25 minutes (75 seconds). Therefore, the times are different. Thus, the claim isn't fully supported by the data.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the time format. In some cases, people might use \"1.25\" to mean minutes and fractions, so 1 minute plus a quarter of a minute is 1:15, which is 75 seconds. But in the table, it's written as 1:25, which is longer.\n\nSo, either way, whether the claim uses 1.25 for 75 seconds or 85 seconds, neither matches exactly. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the event duration refers to something else, like the total time of the event he participated in, not the time taken to finish. But looking at the table, \"time\" likely refers to when he finished the fight, so submission or knockout time.\n\nSo, based on that analysis, the claim is incorrect because the time doesn't match exactly.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Takaichi Hirayama finished an event in 1.25 minutes. Checking row 15 in the table, his fight ended at 1:25, which is 85 seconds or approximately 1.42 minutes. This does not align with the claim of 1.25 minutes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "gabriel veiga lose in the third round",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"gabriel veiga lose in the third round\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Gabriel Veiga's entries in the table. The table has 26 rows, each with details about a fighter's fight record. I'll go through each row one by one until I find Gabriel Veiga.\n\nLooking at Row 16: res: win, record: 9 - 2, opponent: gabriel veiga... Wait, that seems to be the row where Gabriel Veiga is listed as an opponent. So maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check if there's a row where Gabriel Veiga is the fighter.\n\nHmm, actually, each row represents the fighter's own record and their fight outcomes. So, for example, Row 16 says res: win, record: 9 - 2, opponent: gabriel veiga. That means Gabriel Veiga was the opponent in that fight, not the fighter. I need to find a row where \"gabriel veiga\" is listed as the fighter.\n\nContinuing down, I see Row 17: res: win, record: 8 - 2, opponent: danilo cherman... Not him. Row 18: res: win, record:7-2, opponent: mauricio souza... Still not. Then Row 19: res: win, record:6-2, opponent: thiago minu... No. Row 20: res: win, record:5-2, opponent:johil de oliveira... Not it.\n\nRow 21: res:win, record:4-2, opponent:mateus trindade... Nope. Row22: res:win, record:3-2, opponent:diogo oliveira... No. Row23: loss, but opponent is jorge britto... Not Veiga. Row24: win against felipe arinelli... Opponent is arinelli, not Veiga.\n\nRow25: res:win, opponent:joao paulo... No. Row26: loss, opponent:adriano abu... No, that's another fighter.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each row has \"res\" as either win or loss, then the record, then the opponent. So for example, in Row16, res is win, meaning the fighter in that row won against gabriel veiga. Therefore, gabriel veiga lost in that fight.\n\nSo the claim is about gabriel veiga losing in the third round. I need to check if any of his fights resulted in a loss in the third round.\n\nWait, looking at the table, I see Row16: res:win, opponent:gabriel veiga, so Veiga lost there. But does that mean he lost in the third round? Let me check the \"row_index\" for that row. Wait, no, the row represents the fighter's own fight. So if in RowX, the opponent is gabriel veiga and res:win, then Veiga lost.\n\nBut where is Veiga's own fight as a fighter? It seems he isn't listed as a fighter in any other rows except perhaps Row16 as an opponent. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for \"gabriel veiga\" as the res: So I need to find a row where the first field is \"gabriel veiga\". Let's see:\n\nRow16: opponent:gabriel veiga, so someone else fought Veiga and won.\n\nRow17 onwards: the opponents are other fighters. Wait, perhaps Veiga isn't fighting in these rows but only as an opponent. So maybe the claim is incorrect because Veiga didn't lose any fights; he was defeated by others, but his own res is win except for one row where he lost.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this better.\n\nEach row represents a fight that a fighter had. For example, Row16: someone fought and the opponent was gabriel veiga. So if the res is win, then the main fighter won against Veiga. Therefore, Veiga lost in that fight.\n\nNow, the claim is about \"gabriel veiga lose in the third round.\" So I need to see if any of Veiga's fights ended with him losing in round 3.\n\nWait, but where does Veiga have a loss? Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking for res:loss. Only Row26 has res:loss, and the opponent is adriano abu. So that's another fighter who defeated someone else.\n\nSo perhaps Veiga never lost a fight; he only lost once as an opponent in Row16. But wait, in Row16, if res is win, then the fighter won against Veiga, so Veiga lost there.\n\nBut to check if he lost in round 3, I need to see the time of the loss. However, the table doesn't specify the rounds for the opponents; it only lists the opponent's name and maybe a time in some cases, but not in all.\n\nWait, Row16 has res:win, so Veiga lost there. But what was the round number? The table might not specify that. Let me see:\n\nLooking at Row16, the columns are res, record, opponent, fight details like event, etc., but I don't see a column for the round number.\n\nWait, the claim is about losing in the third round. So to verify this, we need to check if Veiga's loss occurred in round 3.\n\nBut in the table, each row doesn't specify the round in which the fight took place. It only mentions the time of knockout or submission in some cases, but not the round number.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be based on the assumption that losing in the third round refers to a specific fight where Veiga was defeated in the third round. However, since the table doesn't specify the round for any of Veiga's losses, we can't confirm whether it was in round three or not.\n\nWait, but I'm getting more confused. Let me try again.\n\nThe task is: Verify if \"gabriel veiga lost a fight in the third round.\"\n\nIn the table:\n\n- For each row, res indicates whether the fighter won (win) or lost (loss).\n- The opponent is who they fought against.\n- Some rows have additional details like time of knockout or submission.\n\nLooking for any instance where \"gabriel veiga\" was an opponent and the res was loss. But in all cases, when someone fought Veiga, their res was win, meaning Veiga lost.\n\nBut to know if it was in round three, we'd need to see the fight details.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way. For example, Row16: res is win, opponent gabriel veiga, time of knockout is 3:20.\n\nSo that might imply that the fight went to round 3, as the knockout happened at 3:20, which might mean it was in round three.\n\nBut without explicit information about the rounds, we can't be certain. However, sometimes in sports, if a fight goes past the first two rounds and ends in the third, the time is often given as something like 3:XX.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Row16's knockout at 3:20 suggests it was indeed in round three.\n\nTherefore, Veiga lost in round three of his fight against whoever was in Row16.\n\nSo the claim is correct because he did lose a fight in the third round.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying whether Gabriel Veiga lost a fight in the third round. Upon analyzing the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where \"gabriel veiga\" is listed as the opponent (indicating he was defeated) and check if the fight resulted in a loss.\n\n2. **Check for Round Information**: Determine if any of Veiga's losses occurred in the third round by examining the time or round details provided in the table cells.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the data, Gabriel Veiga lost at least one fight (as seen in Row 16), and the knockout occurred at 3:20, suggesting it took place in the third round.\n\n**Answer**: Yes, Gabriel Veiga lost a fight in the third round.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"adriano abu win in the 3rd round at the first juiz de fora fight, due to a decision (split)\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. Adriano Abu is the fighter in question. He supposedly won his fight in the 3rd round at the first Juiz de Fora event. The method of victory was a split decision.\n\nLooking through each row of the table to find relevant information about Adriano Abu. I'll start from row 26, which mentions \"opponent: adriano abu\" and the result is a loss with a record of 0 - 1. So that's the loss against Adriano Abou.\n\nContinuing through the rows, I see several wins for different opponents but none specifically mentioning Adriano Abu as a winner until row 24: \"res: win, record: 2 - 1, opponent: felipe arinelli\". Wait, that's him winning, but not against Adriano Abou.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the earlier rows. Row 20 is about Johil de Oliveira defeating someone else. Then row 21, 22, etc., are other fighters' wins and losses. \n\nRow 26 shows Adriano Abu losing his fight, so that's a loss for him. The claim says he won a fight in the first Juiz de Fora event, but according to the table, there is no row where Adriano Abou is winning any fight. Instead, he loses in row 26.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check each row again carefully. \n\nLooking at row 25: res: win, record: 1 - 1, opponent: joao paulo. So that's a different fighter named Adriano Abou (if it's the same person) winning against Joao Paulo in a decision. But then in row 26, he loses to Adriano Abu.\n\nWait, maybe there are two fighters named Adriano Abou? That might be confusing. Or perhaps it's a typo in the table. For example, row 26 says \"opponent: adriano abu\", so that would mean he fought against himself? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a different person.\n\nWait, looking back at row 25: opponent is joao paulo, and res is win, record 1-1. Then in row 26, opponent is adriano abu, result loss, 0-1. So perhaps Adriano Abou lost to himself? That's impossible. Maybe there's a mistake in the table entries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's two different fighters with similar names. But that would complicate things.\n\nBut regardless, the claim is about Adriano Abou winning in the first Juiz de Fora fight via split decision. Looking through all rows, I see row 26 where he lost to someone named Adriano Abu (if it's the same person) but there's no row where he won a fight.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check each row again. \n\nRow 24: res: win, record: 2 -1, opponent: felipe arinelli. So he won against Felipe Arinelli in round 2 via Tko (cut). But that's not the same as Adriano Abou.\n\nThen row 25: res: win, record:1-1, opponent: joao paulo. Again, a different opponent.\n\nRow 26: loss to Adriano Abu, so he lost that fight. So in the table, there is no instance where Adriano Abou wins against anyone. He only has losses except for rows 25 and 24, which are against other opponents.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because according to the table, Adriano Abou lost his fight, not won one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Adriano Abu won in the first Juiz de Fora fight, but the table shows he lost. No relevant win is found for him.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, the opponent in question isn't fighting in Sao Paulo at 1:25 as stated.\n\nSince the claim specifies \"opponent takaichi hirayama that last 1:25 in sao paulo , brazil\", and checking the table shows no such match, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So here, Britto lost, not a win, so not relevant.\n\nRow 24: res: win, opponent: felipe arinelli, method: tko (cut)... Wait, no, this is another fighter's row. The opponent is Felipe Arinelli, and the result is a win with tko. But that doesn't involve Britto winning.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it.

No mention of Britto.\n\nRows 1-26 are all about different fighters and their results against others.

Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 21: res: win, record: 4 - 2, opponent: mateus trindade...\n\nWait, so here in row 21, the result is a win for someone against Mateus Trindade. The record shows a 4-2 win, which might be confusing because usually, if someone wins, their own record goes up, but their opponent's record would go down.\n\nThe claim says that \"mateus trindade lose with a score of 4 - 2.\" So I need to check if Mateus Trindade has a loss where his record is 4-2. \n\nLooking at the table, in row 21, the fighter won against Mateus Trindade with a 4-2 record. That would mean Mateus's record after that fight was 4 wins and 2 losses? Or maybe it's his own record?\n\nWait, actually, the way the records are presented is a bit unclear. For example, row 21: res: win, record: 4 - 2. Is this the fighter's own record before or after the fight?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to assume that each \"record\" refers to the fighter in that row. So if someone has a 4-2 record and they won against Mateus Trindade, then Mateus Trindade would have lost that fight.\n\nSo, looking for a row where Mateus Trindade is the opponent, with a loss, and his own record at that point is 4-2. But in row 21, the fighter has a 4-2 record and won against Mateus. So does that mean Mateus's record after that fight is 3-3? Or maybe it's just a cumulative score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says \"mateus trindade lose with a score of 4 - 2.\" So I need to find a row where Mateus Trindade lost the fight and his record after that loss was 4-2.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 21: The fighter (not Mateus) has a win against Mateus, with their own record at 4-2. But does that mean Mateus's record is now 3-3? Or maybe it's not about the same fighter.\n\nWait, perhaps the table lists the fighter on each row, and for each fight, we can track whether they lost or won, and their records before and after.\n\nBut the way the data is structured isn't entirely clear. It seems like each row represents a fight where the fighter in that row fought someone else (the opponent), resulting in a win or loss, and their record after that fight.\n\nSo, for Mateus Trindade, I need to find all rows where he's the opponent, and check if any of those resulted in him losing with a 4-2 score.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- In row 21: The fighter (not Mateus) fought Mateus Trindade and won. Their record became 4-2 after that fight.\n\nBut does this mean that Mateus's own record is now 3-3, since he lost? Or is the 4-2 referring to his own record?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"record\" in each row refers to the fighter's own record after the fight. So if Mateus Trindade lost a fight, and his record became 4-2, then that would fit the claim.\n\nWait, but looking at all rows, I don't see any where Mateus Trindade has a loss with a score of 4-2. He seems to have several wins in lower-numbered rows (rows 18-20) and then row 21 is his first fight as an opponent where the fighter won against him.\n\nSo perhaps after that, in row 21, Mateus's record would be updated. But since there's no row indicating a loss for him with a 4-2 score, the claim might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the table is structured. Each row could represent a fight, and each fighter has their own record that gets updated. So if Mateus Trindade lost in row x, his record would show the loss.\n\nBut looking through all rows:\n\n- The only time Mateus appears as an opponent is in row 21, where he lost. But there's no indication of his own record being 4-2 after a loss elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"mateus trindade lose with a score of 4 - 2.\" So perhaps in that fight, the score is Mateus Trindade's 4 wins vs opponent's 2 wins? No, that doesn't make sense because it's a loss.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the score refers to the fighter who won having a record of 4-2. But that would mean the other fighter (Mateus) has 3-3 or similar.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe claim is about Mateus Trindade losing with a score of 4-2. So I need to find if there's any row where he lost and his record after that fight was 4 wins and 2 losses.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nIn row 21, the fighter (not Mateus) fought Mateus and won. The result is a win for the fighter, and their record became 4-2. So does this mean Mateus's record is now 3-3? Or did he have 4 wins before that fight?\n\nWait, if in row 21, the fighter had 3 wins before fighting Mateus, then after winning against Mateus, their record becomes 4-2. That would mean Mateus's record is now 3-3 because he lost once.\n\nBut I don't see any other rows where Mateus lost with a 4-2 score. So the claim might be incorrect unless there's another fight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table shows cumulative records, and in some row, Mateus has a loss with 4 wins and 2 losses.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\n- Rows 18-20: Mateus is fighting and winning, so his record would be increasing from 3-0 to 4-1 after row 19, then 5-1 in row 20.\n\n- In row 21, he's losing as an opponent, but there's no indication of his record becoming 4-2. Instead, the fighter's record becomes 4-2.\n\nSo unless there's another row where Mateus loses and his record is updated to 4-2, the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is incorrect because there's no evidence in the table that Mateus Trindade lost a fight with a score of 4 wins and 2 losses.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"mateus trindade lose with a score of 4 - 2\" is not supported by the provided data. After analyzing each row, there is no instance where Mateus Trindade loses a fight and his record becomes 4-2. The only reference to a 4-2 record in row 21 pertains to the fighter who won against him, not Mateus. Therefore, based on the information given, the claim does not hold true.\n\n**Answer:** There is no evidence in the provided data that Mateus Trindade lost with a score of  4 - 2.",

So, according to this row, Mateus Trindade's fight resulted in a win with a record of 4-2.\n\nNow, the claim states that he lost 4-2 in round 1. That directly contradicts what's shown here. In Row 21, his result is a win, not a loss. Also, looking at his opponent, it was mateus trindade fighting someone else\u2014probably as the opponent rather than the fighter.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows where Mateus Trindade might have lost. Scanning through, I don't see another row for him. The closest is Row 21, which is a win. There's no row indicating he lost with a record of 4-2 in round 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't align with the data provided in the table. It looks like the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"record\"}]}",
