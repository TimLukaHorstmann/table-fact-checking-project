    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the game at the griffith stadium be october 9 , 1960\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a game that took place at Griffith Stadium on October 9, 1960. So I need to find this specific entry in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Week 1, September 24, Pittsburgh Steelers... Not Griffith Stadium.\n- Row 2: Week 2, September 30... Cotton Bowl. No.\n- Row 3: Week 3, October 9, Washington Redskins. Game site is Griffith Stadium.\n\nYes, that's the one. So row index 3 (since it starts at 0? Wait, no, in the table, Row 1 is week 1. So Row 3 corresponds to week 3.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies October 9, which matches row 3's date. And the opponent is Washington Redskins, but the claim doesn't specify the opponent, so that part isn't needed for verification.\n\nSo, I need to check if the game site in row 3 is Griffith Stadium and the date is October 9, 1960. Both are true.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are at row_index 3 (since it's the third row after zero indexing) but wait, let me count:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\nRow 3: index 2\n\nWait no, the rows are numbered from 1 to 13. So Row 1 is index 0? No, in the JSON example, row indices start at 0 as per their instructions. Wait, the first row is week:1, which would be row_index 0.\n\nSo row 3 (week 3) is actually index 2.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify:\n\nThe table has 13 rows listed from Row 1 to Row 13. So in terms of indexes, they start at 0 as per JSON structure.\n\nRow 1: week 1 \u2192 row_index 0\nRow 2: week 2 \u2192 row_index 1\n...\nRow 3: week 3 \u2192 row_index 2\n\nSo the game in question is at Row 3 (index 2). Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 2\n- column_name: game site\n\nAdditionally, the date needs to be checked. The claim says October 9, 1960. Looking at row 3's date: October 9, 1960.\n\nSo both conditions are met: game site and date.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if there is a game on October 9, 1960 at Griffith Stadium. \n\n- **Row 2 (index 1)** has the opponent Philadelphia Eagles but not relevant here.\n- **Row 3 (index 2)** matches both the date and location.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE with the relevant cells from Row 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the date of the week 3 game be october 9 , 1960.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate which row corresponds to week 3 in the table. Looking at the rows, each starts with a week number. Row 1 is week 1, so row 3 must be week 3.\n\nNext, I need to check the date for that specific game. In row 3, under the 'date' column, it says \"october 9 , 1960.\" The claim matches this exactly, so the date part of the claim is correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the week 3 game's date being October 9, 1960 is accurate based on the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"October 9, 1960 be the date after week 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it says that October 9, 1960 was the date after week 3. So, I need to find out if there's a game on that date in week 3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a week from 1 to 13. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance.\n\nI'll focus on week 3 first. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Week 1: September 24\n- Week 2: September 30\n- Week 3: October 9\n\nYes, row 3 is for week 3 with a date of October 9, 1960.\n\nNow, checking if that's after week 3. Since each subsequent week increases by one, and the dates are in order (week 1 is earliest), it makes sense that week 3 would be later than week 2 and earlier than week 4. So October 9 being the date for week 3 fits correctly.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information or errors in the table data. The claim seems to align perfectly with the table's week 3 entry.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table where week 3 corresponds to October 9, 1960. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
