    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"1990 - 01 - 28 be the kickoff date for the round of r4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions a specific date: January 28, 1990, and attributes it to being the kickoff date for Round 4 (r4). So I need to check if in the table, any row has r4 as the round and kick off on that exact date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match. The columns relevant here are \"round\", \"kick off\", \"opponents\", etc., but mainly \"round\" and \"kick off\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Round r3, kick off on Jan 6, 1990.\nRow 2: Round r3 replay, kick off on Jan 9, 1990.\nRow 3: Round r4, kick off on Jan 28, 1990. Opponents are Norwich City, home/away: a (away).\nRow 4: Round r4 replay, kick off on Jan 31, 1990.\nSo Row 3 is the one that matches r4 and has the exact date of 1990-01-28.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Row 3 indeed lists Jan 28, 1990 as the kickoff date for Round r4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the result of round r6 replay with h / a of h be 1 - 0\". So, we're looking for a match in round r6 replay where the home/away status is 'h' (home) and the result is 1-0.\n\nNow, I'll examine the table to find all relevant rows. The table has 8 rows, each corresponding to a different round or replay.\n\nLooking at row 7: it's for round r6 replay with kick off on March 14, 1990. The opponents are Queens Park Rangers, and the h/a is 'h' (home). The result is 1-0. This matches exactly what the claim states. So, this row fully supports the claim.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant rows that might affect the outcome, but from a quick scan, it seems only row 7 fits the criteria. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by row 7 of the table, which matches all conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the relevant cells in the table. The claim states: \"the 1990 - 01 - 28 kick off date have a round value of r4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that matches the kick-off date specified in the claim, which is 1990-01-28.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 1: 06 Jan 1990\n- Row 2: 09 Jan 1990\n- Row 3: 28 Jan 1990 (kick off: 1990 - 01 - 28)\n- Rows 4,5,6,7,8 are later dates.\n\nSo, the relevant row is Row 3. Now, I need to check what the 'round' value is for this row. From the table, Row 3 has \"r4\" as the round value. \n\nThe claim says the kick-off date of 1990-01-28 has a round value of r4. Since Row 3 indeed has r4, this supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"1990 - 01 - 29 be the kickoff date for the round value of r4.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The claim is about a specific date and the corresponding round (r4) in some competition. Looking at the table, I see that each row represents a match with details like round number, kick-off date, opponents, home or away status, result, attendance, and report.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where the round is r4 and the kick-off date is 1990-01-29. So, let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Round r3, kick off 1990-01-06 vs Swansea City (away). Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Round r3 replay, kick off 1990-01-09 vs Swansea City (home). Not r4 and date doesn't match.\n\nRow 3: Round r4, kick off 1990-01-28 vs Norwich City (away). The round is r4, but the date is 28th. The claim says 29th, so this isn't it.\n\nRow 4: Round r4 replay, kick off 1990-01-31 vs Norwich City (home). This is a replay of r4, so maybe they had two matches for r4? The first was on the 28th, and the replay on the 31st. But the claim refers to the \"round value of r4,\" which I think means the original round, not the replay.\n\nRow 5 onwards: Round r5 and beyond, so irrelevant.\n\nWait, but in some competitions, especially cup tournaments like the FA Cup, each round can have a replay if the initial match ended in a draw. So for r4, maybe the first match was on January 28th, and then the replay on the 31st. However, the claim is specifically about the kick-off date of round r4, not the replay.\n\nSo looking at row 3: it's r4 with a kick-off on 1990-01-28. The next day, the replay would be on 31st. So the main r4 match was on the 28th. Therefore, the claim says the kick-off date is January 29th for r4, which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is suggesting that r4's kick-off date should have been the 29th, but in reality, it was the 28th. So if the claim states it was on the 29th, that would be false because it was actually on the 28th.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again:\n\nRow 3: r4, kick off 1990-01-28\n\nRow 4: r4 replay, kick off 1990-01-31\n\nSo yes, the main r4 match was on January 28th, not the 29th. Therefore, the claim is incorrect; it should have been on the 28th, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the round r4 had a kick-off date of 1990-01-29. However, according to the table, the original r4 match took place on January 28th. The replay was on the 31st, but it's not considered the main round. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the instructions provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: It says, \"the kick off date be 1990 - 01 - 28 for the round value of r4 and result 8 - 0.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table. Let's break it down into three parts:\n\n1. **Kick Off Date**: Does any row with Round r4 have a kick off date of 1990-01-28?\n2. **Round Value**: Is the round value r4 in that specific row?\n3. **Result**: Is the result 8 - 0 for that particular match?\n\nStarting with the first part, I'll look through each row to find where Round r4 occurs.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Round r3, so not r4.\nRow 2: Round r3 replay, still not r4.\nRow 3: Round r4, kick off date is 1990-01-28. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, check if the result in that row is 8 - 0. Row 3's result is listed as 0 - 0. That doesn't match the claimed 8 - 0.\n\nSo, even though the kick off date and round value are correct, the result doesn't align with the claim. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other row that might have r4 with a different result. But looking through the table:\n\n- Row 3: Round r4, KO date correct, but result 0-0.\n- Row 4: Round r4 replay, KO date is later, so it's for the replay.\n\nNo other rows match Round r4. So, only Row 3 matches the first two parts but not the third.\n\nSince the result part isn't met, the claim as a whole is FALSE. Even though some cells are correct, the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although the kick off date and round value for r4 match in Row 3, the result does not match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"kick off\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
