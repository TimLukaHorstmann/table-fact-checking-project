    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, and series status.\n\nThe claim mentions April 14 specifically. So I need to find the row where the date is April 14.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: April 8\n- Row 2: April 10\n- Row 3: April 12\n- Row 4: April 14\n\nOkay, so Row 4 is the one for April 14. Now I check the opponent column in this row.\n\nRow 4's opponent is listed as \"new jersey devils\". That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
