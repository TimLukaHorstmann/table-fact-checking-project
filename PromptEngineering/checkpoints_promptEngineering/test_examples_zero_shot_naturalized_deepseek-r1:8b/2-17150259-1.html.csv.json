    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the friendly competition on 26 May 1999 took place at Lugo, Emilia-Romagna.\" \n\nI'll need to find in the table if there's a match that occurred on 26 May 1999 in a friendly competition at Lugo in Emilia-Romagna. Let me look through each row of the table.\n\nLooking at Row 10: goal:17, date:26 May 1999, venue:Lugo, Emilia-Romagna, result:1-4, competition:friendly, scored:1. This matches all the criteria mentioned in the claim. The date is 26 May 1999, the venue is Lugo in Emilia-Romagna, the competition is friendly, and there's a score. \n\nI should check if any other rows might also fit, but since the claim specifies the exact date (26 May 1999), only Row 10 matches this criteria. Therefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cell is Row 10 with the column \"goal\" as it directly mentions the match details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"lugo , emilia - romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 may 1999 and the result be 2 - 4.\"\n\nBreaking this down, I need to check four main aspects:\n1. The venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna.\"\n2. The competition is a friendly match.\n3. The date is May 26, 1999.\n4. The result is 2-4.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table and look for these criteria.\n\nStarting from Row 1 to Row 18, since the claim mentions 1999, I should focus on that year. Let's see:\n\nRow 10: venue is \"lugo , emilia - romagna\", date May 26, 1999, competition is friendly, result is 1-4.\n\nWait, the result here is 1-4, but the claim states 2-4. So this row doesn't match the result part.\n\nRow 17 and Row 18 are in 2002, so not relevant. \n\nLooking further, I don't see any other rows that mention \"lugo , emilia - romagna\" besides Row 10. Since the date is May 26, 1999, it's only Row 10.\n\nHowever, the result doesn't match. The claim says 2-4, but the table shows 1-4. Therefore, the claim has an incorrect result.\n\nSo, since all four conditions aren't met (venue, competition type, date, and result), the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not match the given table's data for the specified criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
