    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe claim states: \"the type code of sl 500 , sl 550 be cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m273 )\". So I need to check if both SL 500 and SL 550 have their type/code as \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 (m273)\" in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several details: model(s), years, type/code, power rpm, torque rpm. The relevant column for this claim is the \"type / code\" column since that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nFirst, I'll check Row 1. It lists SL 350, so that's not one of the models in question (SL 500 or 550), so probably irrelevant unless there's a mistake, but it seems unlikely. So I can skip this row unless it's needed for comparison.\n\nRow 2: Model is SL 500 and SL 550. The type/code here is \"cubic centimetres (cuin) v8 (m273)\". That matches exactly what the claim is stating. So that part checks out for both models mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 3: This is about SL 55 AMG, which isn't relevant since the claim doesn't mention it.\n\nRow 4: SL 600 is here, so not related to the claim.\n\nRow 5: SL 65 AMG, again not part of the claim.\n\nSo based on this, both SL 500 and SL 550 have the type/code as specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that all relevant cells are identified. The claim mentions two models (SL 500 and SL 550), so their respective rows should be checked. Each of these models is found in Row 2, under the type/code column.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Row 2 for both models. Thus, I'll list each as separate entries in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"type / code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nThe claim says: \"2006 - 2008 have a type / code of cubic centimetre (cuin) v8 ( m272 )\". So, they're stating that for models in the years 2006 to 2008, the type or code is CUIR V8 M272. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different models with their details. The columns are: model, years, type/code, power rpm, and torque rpm.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the rows from 2006-2008 since the claim mentions those years. From the table:\n\nRow 1: Model SL 350, Years 2006 - 2008, Type/Code CUIR V6 M272, Power 6000, Torque 2400-5000.\n\nRow 2: Models SL 500 and SL 550, Years 2006-2008, Type/Code CUIR V8 M273, Power 6000, Torque 2800-4800.\n\nRow 3: Model SL 55 AMG, Years 2006-2008, Type/Code CUIR V8 Supercharged M113, Power 6100, Torque 2600-4000.\n\nRow 4: Model SL 600, Years 2006-2008, Type/Code CUIR V12 Biturbo M275, Power 5000, Torque 1900-3500.\n\nRow 5: Model SL 65 AMG, Years 2004-, Type/Code CUIR V12 Biturbo AMG M275, Power 4800-5100, Torque 2000-4000.\n\nNow, the claim is about 2006-2008 having a type/code of CUIR V8 M272. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: It's a V6, so doesn't match.\n- Row 2: Type/Code is V8 M273, not M272.\n- Row 3: Type/Code is V8 Supercharged M113, again not M272.\n- Row 4 and 5 are beyond the years mentioned or different models.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"2006 - 2008\". So I should check if any model in those years has CUIR V8 M272. From the table, none of the rows from 2006-2008 have that code. The closest is Row 2, which is M273, and Row 3 is a supercharged V8 but with M113.\n\nSo, the claim's assertion about 2006-2008 having CUIR V8 M272 isn't supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check: Maybe I missed something? The first row has years 2006-2008, but it's a V6, so no. Row 2 is also 2006-2008, but it's M273. So yes, no models in those years have M272 for that type/code.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"type / code\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"type / code\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
