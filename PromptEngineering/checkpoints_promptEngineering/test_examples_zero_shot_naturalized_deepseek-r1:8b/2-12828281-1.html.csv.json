    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the game played on December 6, 1964 was during week 13\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a different game with details like week number, date, opponent, result, and attendance. My goal is to find the specific game that was played on December 6, 1964.\n\nLooking through the rows one by one:\n\n- Row 1: September 13\n- Row 2: September 19\n- Row 3: September 27\n- Row 4: October 3\n- Row 5: October 10\n- Row 6: October 16\n- Row 7: October 25\n- Row 8: November 1\n- Row 9: November 8\n- Row 10: November 15\n- Row 11: November 22\n- Row 12: November 29\n- Row 13: December 6, 1964\n\nSo, the game on December 6 is in row 13. Now, I need to check what week number that corresponds to.\n\nLooking at each row's week number:\n\n- Week 1: September 13\n- Week 2: September 19\n- Week 3: September 27\n- Week 4: October 3\n- Week 5: October 10\n- Week 6: October 16\n- Week 7: October 25\n- Week 8: November 1\n- Week 9: November 8\n- Week 10: November 15\n- Week 11: November 22\n- Week 12: November 29\n- Week 13: December 6\n\nYes, row 13 is indeed week 13. Therefore, the game on December 6, 1964 was during week 13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the game on December 6, 1964 is listed in week 13 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. They're referring to a specific game that happened on December 6, 1964, and stating that it occurred after Week 13.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row corresponding to December 6, 1964. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: September 13, 1964\n- Row 2: September 19, 1964\n- Row 3: September 27, 1964\n- Row 4: October 3, 1964\n- Row 5: October 10, 1964\n- Row 6: October 16, 1964\n- Row 7: October 25, 1964\n- Row 8: November 1, 1964\n- Row 9: November 8, 1964\n- Row 10: November 15, 1964\n- Row 11: November 22, 1964\n- Row 12: November 29, 1964\n- Row 13: December 6, 1964\n\nSo, the game on December 6 is in row 13. Now, I need to check what week that corresponds to. The table's first column is \"week,\" and for row 13, it's labeled as week 13.\n\nThe claim is stating that this game was after Week 13. But if it's exactly Week 13, does that mean it's after Week 13? I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. Typically, when we say an event occurs after a certain week, it means it happens later in time than that week. So, if a game is on Week 13, would it be considered as being \"after\" Week 13?\n\nWait, perhaps the wording is tricky. If something happens on Week 13, does it occur during that week or at the end of it? I think games are usually played within a specific week. So, a game occurring on December 6, which is Week 13, might be considered as happening after earlier weeks but not necessarily \"after\" Week 13 in terms of timing beyond that week.\n\nBut to clarify, the claim says \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13.\" So, if the game is in Week 13, then it's not technically after Week 13 because Week 13 is when it happens. It might be more accurate to say it's happening during Week 13, not after.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement that the game is after Week 13 would be FALSE because the game is actually occurring on Week 13, not later than that week.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that a game played on December 6, 1964, occurred after Week 13. By examining the table, we find that this game is indeed listed under Week 13. Therefore, it does not happen after Week 13 but rather during that week.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The cell in row 13 (December 6, 1964) corresponding to \"week\" and \"result,\" as they directly relate to the claim's assertion about the game occurring after Week 13.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says, \"the game played on December 2, 1963 was Week 15.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has rows from week 1 to week 14, with dates ranging from September 13, 1964, to December 6, 1964. Wait a minute, the claim is about a game on December 2, 1963, which is a year before the first date in the table. That immediately makes me think something's off because all the games listed are in 1964. So, there's no way a game happened in 1963 as per this table.\n\nNow, looking at the claim again: it mentions December 2, 1963, but the table only goes up to December 6, 1964. There's no row for 1963. Therefore, the information needed to verify the claim isn't present in the table. The relevant cells would be anything related to week 15 or December 1963, but since those aren't in the table, I can't confirm it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is about a game that happened before any of the games listed in the table. Since the table doesn't have data for 1963, there's no way to support the claim. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
