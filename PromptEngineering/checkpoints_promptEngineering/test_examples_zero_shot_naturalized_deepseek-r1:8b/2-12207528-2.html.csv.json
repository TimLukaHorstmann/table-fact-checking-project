    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play mariner 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to be saying that the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Mariners on April 4th, and the game lasted until the 10th inning (4th time). That part about \"time\" might refer to the number of innings played, like a four-inning game.\n\nNow, I need to check the table provided. The table has multiple rows, each representing a different date with details like opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. My task is to find out if there's a row where the opponent is the Mariners on April 4th with a score of 3-2 in 10 innings.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: Date is April 4, Opponent is Mariners. The score is 3 - 2 (10), which indicates it was a 10-inning game. The loss is attributed to Lamp, and the attendance is 43,200. So all these details match what the claim is stating.\n\nTherefore, this specific row in the table supports the claim exactly. There are no other rows that fit better because other Mariners games are on different dates (like April 23 and 24), and the score and innings don't align with the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 1 where the opponent is Mariners on April 4 with a score of 3-2 in 10 innings.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"toronto blue jay\" refers to a baseball team, likely the Toronto Blue Jays. They're playing against \"royal,\" which I think could be the Kansas City Royals because that's a common opponent in Major League Baseball (MLB). The score mentioned is 3-2 in 10 innings, which might indicate the final score of the game.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, score, loss information, attendance, and record. My goal is to find if there's any row that matches all the criteria from the claim: Blue Jays vs Royals with the given score in the specified innings.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Mariners, not Royals.\nRow 2: Opponent is Mariners again.\nRow 3: Opponent is Angels.\nRow 4: Opponent is Angels.\nRow 5: Opponent is Angels.\nRow 6: Opponent is Athletics.\nRow 7: Opponent is Athletics.\nRow 8: Opponent is Rangers.\nRow 9: Rangers again.\nRow 10: Rangers.\nRow 11: Orioles.\nRow 12: Orioles.\nRow 13: Orioles.\nRow 14: Angeles? Wait, the opponent might be Angels here. Let me check the data.\n\nWait, in Row 14, the opponent is listed as \"angels.\" So that's another game against the Angels.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 15: Opponent is Angels again.\nRow 16: Opponent is Angels.\nRow 17: Mariners once more.\nRow 18: Mariners again.\nRow 19: Athletics.\nRow 20: Athletics.\nRow 21: Royals!\nOkay, Row 21 has opponent as \"royals.\" So that's the Kansas City Royals. Let me check the score and innings.\n\nIn Row 21, the score is 1-0, loss: gubicza (0 - 2), attendance: 16435, record: 12 - 9. The innings are not mentioned here, but in the claim, it's specified as \"3 time,\" which might refer to 10 innings or something else.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, I realize that each row has a 'score' column with the format like \"3 - 2 (10)\". So in Row 1, score is 3-2 in 10 innings. Similarly, other rows have their scores followed by the number of innings. For example, Row 6: score is 4-3, loss: lamp (0-2), attendance:9868, record:3-3.\n\nSo in the claim, \"play royal 3 time\" might be referring to a game where they played the Royals with a specific score and inning count. But let's see if any row matches Blue Jays vs Royals with a score of 3-2 in 10 innings.\n\nWait, looking through all rows again:\n\nOnly Row 21 is against Royals with a score of 1-0. There's no mention of a game where the Blue Jays played the Royals with a score of 3-2 or any specific innings mentioned beyond the loss column.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking for opponent = \"royal\" (though in the table it's spelled as \"royals\"). So only Row 21 fits that. The score is 1-0, not 3-2. Also, the innings aren't specified beyond the loss column.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread something. Let me check if any other rows have opponent as Royals with a different score.\n\nNo, in the table provided, only Row 21 has \"royals\" as the opponent. The score is 1-0, which doesn't match 3-2. So does that mean there's no game where Blue Jays played Royals with a 3-2 score?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. \"Play royal 3 time\" could refer to playing in a specific time or inning count, not necessarily the score. But the table doesn't specify the innings for each game except for the loss column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the score is mentioned as 3-2 (10), but I need to see if any row has both Blue Jays vs Royals with that exact score and innings.\n\nLooking back at Row 1: Opponent is Mariners, score 3-2 in 10. Not Royals.\n\nRow 21: Score 1-0, opponent Royals, no innings mentioned beyond the loss column.\n\nSo it seems like there's no game where Blue Jays played Royals with a score of 3-2 in 10 innings as specified in the claim.\n\nWait, but I need to check all rows again. Let me list out each row:\n\nRow 1: Mariners\nRow 2: Mariners\nRow 3: Angels\nRow 4: Angels\nRow 5: Angels\nRow 6: Athletics\nRow 7: Athletics\nRow 8: Rangers\nRow 9: Rangers\nRow 10: Rangers\nRow 11: Orioles\nRow 12: Orioles\nRow 13: Orioles\nRow 14: Angels\nRow 15: Angels\nRow 16: Angels\nRow 17: Mariners\nRow 18: Mariners\nRow 19: Athletics\nRow 20: Athletics\nRow 21: Royals\nRow 22: Postponed due to rain\nRow 23: Postponed due to rain\nRow 24: Postponed due to wind\n\nSo only Row 21 is against Royals. The score there is 1-0, not 3-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"toronto blue jay play royal 3 time\" doesn't match any row in the table because Blue Jays didn't play the Royals with that specific score and inning count mentioned.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. The claim could be referring to a game where they played the Royals with a certain outcome, not necessarily the exact score. But since the table only has one game against Royals, which doesn't match the score or innings, it's still incorrect.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the answer should be FALSE because there's no evidence in the table supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any relevant data in the provided table. The Blue Jays did play the Royals, but not with a score of 3-2 in 10 innings as specified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two teams: Toronto Blue Jay and Royal. Wait, actually, looking again, it says \"play royal,\" so the opponent here is the Royals, right? So the claim is that the Blue Jays played against the Royals on April 30th.\n\nNow, I need to check the table for any entries related to April 30. The table has rows from Row 1 (April 4) up to Row 24 (April 30). So let's look at Row 24 specifically because it's April 30.\n\nRow 24: date is April 30, opponent is Rangers, score is postponed due to wind rescheduled for May 1. Loss and attendance are also postponed. The record is also postponed.\n\nSo on April 30th, the Blue Jays were supposed to play the Royals but the game was postponed because of wind. Therefore, they didn't actually play that day.\n\nThe claim states that they played on April 30. Since the game was canceled, this isn't accurate. So the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's another relevant row where Blue Jays played Royals on April 30. Let me go through each row again.\n\nLooking at all rows from 1 to 24:\n\nRow 21: April 27 vs Royals\nRow 22: April 28 vs Royals\nRow 23: April 29 vs Royals, but it's postponed\nRow 24: April 30 vs Rangers, postponed\n\nI don't see any row where Blue Jays play Royals on April 30. All the games involving Royals are either on earlier dates or on April 29 and 30, which were either against different opponents or postponed.\n\nSo yes, the claim is false because there's no game between Blue Jays and Royals on April 30th in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The rows are listed from Row 1 to Row 24. \n\nRow 22 is April 28. Opponent is Royals, score is 6 - 0. So, the game was against Royals, not Athletics.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that on April 9th, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Angels. So I need to check if such a game exists in the provided table and whether it matches these details.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific date with corresponding opponent, score, loss info, attendance, and record. I'll go through each row to see if April 9th is present and who the opposing team was on that day.\n\nStarting from Row 1: April 4 against Mariners... It goes up to Row 24, which is April 30, but many of these have postponements due to weather or rain, so I need to be careful with those. \n\nI'm looking for a row where the date is April 9th. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: April 4\n- Row 2: April 5\n- Row 3: April 6\n- Row 4: April 7\n- Row 5: April 8\n- Row 6: April 9\n\nWait, here we go. Row 6 is April 9th. The opponent listed there is Athletics (look at the 'opponent' column). So on April 9th, the Blue Jays played against the Athletics, not the Angels.\n\nNow, checking the claim again: it says they played the Angels on April 9th. But according to Row 6, the opponent was the Athletics. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the opponent wasn't the Angels but the Athletics on that date.\n\nI should also check if there's another row for April 9 where the opponent might be the Angels, but from the table provided, it seems only Row 6 corresponds to April 9 and the opponent was Athletics.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the last few rows have postponed games, but since the claim is about a specific date (April 9), those don't apply. So my conclusion is that the Blue Jays didn't play the Angels on April 9th; they played the Athletics instead.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Toronto Blue Jays played the Angels on April 9 is FALSE because the table shows they played the Athletics on that date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play mariner 5 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down each part of the claim and see if it aligns with the information in the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three teams: Toronto Blue Jay, Mariners, and another team referred to as \"mariner.\" Wait, that might be a typo. The Mariners are one team, so perhaps it's meant to say something else, like \"Royals\" or another team. But for now, I'll proceed with the given words.\n\nThe phrase \"play mariner 5 time\" is a bit unclear. It could mean they played against the Mariners five times, but more likely, it's about the number of games or specific details related to their games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game on a specific date between two teams, with various statistics like score, loss, attendance, and record. My goal is to find if there are any games where the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Mariners, specifically five times, and whether that's supported by the data.\n\nFirst, I'll check for any rows where the opponent is the Mariners and the team playing is the Blue Jays. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Mariners\n- Row 2: Opponent is Mariners\n- Row 17: Opponent is Mariners\n- Row 18: Opponent is Mariners\n\nWait, I see that only rows 1, 2, and then again in 17 and 18 have the Mariners as opponents. Let me list all the games involving the Mariners:\n\nRow 1: Mariners vs. (presumably) Blue Jays? Wait, no\u2014looking at the table, each row lists the opponent, but not the home team. So I need to figure out which team is playing whom.\n\nWait, perhaps the table only lists the opponent, and doesn't specify if it's the home or away game for the Blue Jays. Alternatively, maybe the Blue Jays are one of the teams involved in those games where the opponent is Mariners.\n\nBut looking at the opponents listed:\n\nRow 1: Mariners (opponent)\nRow 2: Mariners\nRow 3: Angels\n...\nSo on row 1 and 2, it's the Mariners as the opponent. So if these are Blue Jays vs. Mariners, that would be relevant.\n\nNow, I need to check whether there are five games where the Blue Jays played the Mariners.\n\nLooking at the table, how many times do the Mariners play against someone? Let me list all rows where the opponent is Mariners:\n\nRow 1: Mariners\nRow 2: Mariners\nRow 17: Mariners\nRow 18: Mariners\n\nWait, that's four games. So maybe the claim is incorrect because it says five times.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing some rows. Let me check each row again.\n\nRows with opponent as Mariners:\n\n- Row1: April4 vs Mariners\n- Row2: April5 vs Mariners\n- Row17: April23 vs Mariners\n- Row18: April24 vs Mariners\n\nThat's four games. So if the claim says they played five times, that would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, I need to confirm whether in each of these rows, the team playing is the Blue Jays. Because the table doesn't specify which team is the home or away; it just lists the opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps the Blue Jays are not involved in all those games. Maybe the opponents are other teams like the Angels, Royals, etc., so I need to identify which team is actually playing against whom.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: It says the task is to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim is \"toronto blue jay play mariner 5 time.\" So it's about whether the Blue Jays played the Mariners five times.\n\nTherefore, I need to find all rows where the opponent is Mariners and the home team is Blue Jays or vice versa.\n\nBut since the table only lists the opponent, perhaps we can assume that if the opponent is Mariners, then the other team (Blue Jays) are playing against them. So in that case, rows 1,2,17,18 would be Blue Jays vs. Mariners games.\n\nThat's four games, so the claim of five is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing some rows where the Blue Jays play the Mariners but under different opponent designations. Let me check all rows again:\n\nLooking through each row, if the opponent is Mariners, then that's a game between the other team and Mariners. If the other team is Blue Jays, then it counts towards their matchup.\n\nBut since I don't know which team is playing whom in each row (unless it's specified), perhaps the table doesn't provide enough information. Wait, no\u2014the opponents are listed, but not necessarily implying who is home or away.\n\nWait, no, the opponent column likely refers to the team they're playing against. So if a row has \"Mariners\" as the opponent, then that game is between the Blue Jays and Mariners.\n\nTherefore, rows 1 (Apr4),2(Apr5),17(Apr23),18(Apr24) are four games where Blue Jays played Mariners.\n\nSo the claim says they played five times. Therefore, it's FALSE because there are only four games in the table.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check if any of these rows have a score of 5 or mention time, but the claim is about the number of games, so that's covered.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Mariners five times. Checking the table, there are only four games where the opponent is the Mariners (rows 1,2,17,18).

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It seems to be about a game involving the Toronto Blue Jays playing against the Royals with a score of 4- something. The exact phrase is a bit unclear, but it's likely trying to assert that there was a game where the Blue Jays scored four runs, possibly winning or contributing to a win.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any match this description.

Not relevant.\nRow 21: Royals, score 1-0. Here we go! The opponent is Royals with a score of 1-0. Wait, the claim mentions \"play royal 4 time,\" which implies a game where Blue Jays scored four runs against Royals. This row shows a score of 1-0 in favor of the Blue Jays? Or is it 1-0 meaning Blue Jays won 1-0?\n\nWait, looking at Row 21: score is listed as \"1 - 0\", with opponent Royals. So the Blue Jays scored 1 run, and Royals 0. That's a different score than what the claim suggests.\n\nContinuing through the rows:\nRow 22: Royals, score 6-0. Doesn't fit.\nRow 23: Postponed due to rain, rescheduled for July. Not relevant.\nRow 24: Postponed again, so no game played on April 30.\n\nI see that none of the Rows show the Blue Jays playing the Royals with a score of 4 runs. The only relevant row is Row 21 where they play the Royals but with a score of 1-0. Since the claim mentions \"play royal 4 time,\" which likely refers to a game where the Blue Jays scored four runs, there's no match in the table that supports this.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other rows have the Royals as opponents with a score close to 4. Looking through, Row 22 has Royals again but a higher score of 6-0.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into three parts:\n1. The home team: Toronto Blue Jays.\n2. The away team: Athletics.\n3. The date: April 29.\n\nNext, I'll look through each row of the table to find any matches on April 29 where both teams are mentioned as opponents.\n\nI start by scanning the rows:\n\n- Rows 1 to 20 don't mention April 29 at all.\n- Row 23 has a game scheduled for April 29 against Royals, but it's postponed due to rain and rescheduled for July 23. So, no actual game was played on April 29.\n\nI don't see any row where the opponent is both Toronto Blue Jays and Athletics on April 29. All matches on that date involve different opponents (Royals) or are postponed. Therefore, there's no evidence of a game between the Blue Jays and Athletics on April 29 as described.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"toronto blue jay play angel on april 29\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two teams: Toronto Blue Jay and Angel. Wait, actually, the claim says \"Angel,\" but looking at the table, I see that the opponents are often referred to as \"Angels\" with an 's'\u2014like in Row 4, it's the Angels, so maybe the correct term is \"Angels.\" So perhaps there was a typo in the claim. That might be important.\n\nNext, the date mentioned is April 29. I need to check if on that date, the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Angels. Let me look through each row of the table to see if any match this date and opponent combination.\n\nLooking at Row 23: date is April 29, opponent is Royals, so that's not it. The next rows after that don't have April 29 either, except for Row 24 which is April 30, also against Rangers, but rescheduled due to wind.\n\nWait a minute, so in the table, there's no game on April 29 where the Blue Jays played the Angels. In fact, the only Blue Jays games are against Mariners, Angels, Athletics, Rangers, and Orioles. So let me check specifically for Blue Jays:\n\nRow 17: Opponent is Mariners\nRow 18: Opponent is Mariners\nRow 23: Opponent is Royals\nSo no Blue Jays games on April 29.\n\nWait, actually, the table doesn't even have a row for April 29 where the Blue Jays are playing. The closest is Row 24 on April 30 against Rangers, but that's rescheduled. So there's no game on April 29 with the Angels.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"play angel,\" so I need to check if they played the Angels on that date. From the table:\n\nLooking for opponent: Angels and date: April 29. Let me scan through each row again.\n\nRow 1-22: Most have dates in early April, but none on April 29 against Angels.\nRows 23-24: April 29 is Royals and April 30 is Rangers, both rescheduled.\n\nSo there's no game on April 29 where the Blue Jays played the Angels. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me double-check. The opponent for Row 23 is Royals, not Angels, so no. So yes, the claim doesn't match any entry in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Toronto Blue Jays played the Angels on April 29. Checking the table, there are no games on that date involving either team. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
