    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen\" is true based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions two institutions: Dartmouth College and the University of T\u00fcbingen. Looking at the table, Dartmouth College is in Row 1, and the University of T\u00fcbingen is in Row 5. So their row indices are 0 and 4 respectively (since rows start from 0).\n\nNext, I need to check how they rank in each of the world rankings provided: WUR, ARWU, QS. The claim doesn't specify which ranking to consider, so I must evaluate all three to see if Dartmouth is consistently higher than T\u00fcbingen across all three metrics.\n\nLooking at Dartmouth College (Row 1):\n- WUR rank in 2013: 126th\n- ARWU rank: 151 - 200th\n- QS rank: 113th\n\nAnd the University of T\u00fcbingen (Row 5):\n- WUR rank: 201 - 225th\n- ARWU rank: 151 - 200th\n- QS rank: 144th\n\nComparing each ranking:\n1. In WUR, Dartmouth is 126th and T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. Since 126 < 201, Dartmouth ranks higher here.\n2. In ARWU, both are in the same range (151-200), so they tie here.\n3. In QS, Dartmouth is 113th while T\u00fcbingen is 144th, so Dartmouth ranks higher.\n\nSince the claim doesn't specify which ranking to use, but in WUR and QS, Dartmouth is higher, I need to consider if the claim is making a general statement or if it's referring to all rankings. If the claim is about overall ranking without specifying the metric, then since there are multiple metrics where Dartmouth ranks higher, it might still be considered TRUE.\n\nHowever, if the claim specifically refers to one of the rankings, like QS or WUR, and not others, I should look only at those. But since all three are checked, and in two of them Dartmouth is higher, it's somewhat ambiguous. The safest approach is that if even in some metrics Dartmouth is higher, the claim might still be considered TRUE.\n\nTherefore, based on the rankings provided, the statement holds true for some rankings but not others. Since the claim doesn't specify a particular ranking, I need to see if there's an overall consensus or if it's comparing across all three. If considering all, then since in QS and WUR Dartmouth is higher, and only ARWU they tie, it could still be considered as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Dartmouth College ranks higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen based on the given table. Upon analyzing each ranking:\n\n- **World University Rankings (WUR):** Dartmouth at 126th vs. T\u00fcbingen at 201-225th \u2192 Dartmouth higher.\n- **Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU):** Both in 151-200th range \u2192 Tie.\n- **QS World University Rankings:** Dartmouth at 113th vs. T\u00fcbingen at 144th \u2192 Dartmouth higher.\n\nSince the claim doesn't specify a particular ranking, but in two out of three rankings Dartmouth is higher, it's considered TRUE based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"University of Western Australia does better overall than Durham University despite its late date of establishment.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Does better overall**: This implies that the University of Western Australia (UWA) has a higher ranking than Durham University (Durham).\n2. **Despite its late date of establishment**: Here, the claim is pointing out that UWA was established later than Durham but still performs better.\n\nSo I need to compare their rankings in the table. Let's look at the table structure. Each row represents a university with details like members, country, year established, and three ranking metrics from different sources: WUR (World University Rankings), ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), and QS (QS World University Rankings).\n\nLooking at Row 1 for UWA:\n- Members: university of western australia\n- Year established: 1911\n\nRow 2 for Durham:\n- Members: durham university\n- Year established: 1832\n\nSo, the claim mentions that UWA was established later but does better. Let's check their rankings in each category.\n\n**WUR (World University Rankings) 2013:**\n- UWA is ranked 168th.\n- Durham is ranked 80th.\n\nHere, Durham is higher than UWA. So this metric contradicts the claim because UWA isn't doing better here.\n\n**ARWU 2013:**\n- UWA is ranked 91st.\n- Durham is ranked 201-300th.\n\nIn this ranking, UWA is higher (91st) compared to Durham's 201-300 range. So this metric supports the claim that UWA does better than Durham.\n\n**QS 2013:**\n- UWA is ranked 134th.\n- Durham is ranked 90th.\n\nAgain, in QS rankings, Durham is higher than UWA (90th vs. 134th). This contradicts the claim as well.\n\nSo, the claim's assertion that UWA does better overall than Durham despite a later establishment relies on specific rankings. However, only the ARWU ranking supports this. The WUR and QS rankings show Durham performing better. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported across all relevant metrics; it's partially true depending on the ranking system used.\n\nBut wait, the instructions say to check if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table. Since not all rankings agree with the claim, but the ARWU does, which is one of the columns, maybe I should consider whether at least one metric supports the claim while others don't. However, the wording \"do better overall\" suggests a comprehensive comparison, possibly considering multiple metrics or an average. But without knowing how these rankings are aggregated, it's tricky.\n\nGiven that two out of three ranking systems show Durham higher and one shows UWA higher, it's ambiguous whether UWA is considered to be doing better overall. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by all relevant data points, making it FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we compare the University of Western Australia (UWA) and Durham University using their 2013 rankings in three different metrics: WUR, ARWU, and QS.\n\n- **WUR**: UWA is ranked 168th vs. Durham's 80th. Durham higher.\n- **ARWU**: UWA is ranked 91st vs. Durham's 201-300th. UWA higher.\n- **QS**: UWA is ranked 134th vs. Durham's 90th. Durham higher.\n\nSince not all rankings agree, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying and then cross-reference it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"overall, durham university have the best rank, ie, 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\" \n\nBreaking this down, the key points are:\n- The subject is Durham University.\n- It claims to have the best rank.\n- Specifically, it's referring to the \"world rank by - wur\" category from 2013, and the rank given is 80th.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row in the table corresponds to Durham University. Scanning through the rows:\n1. Row 1: Dartmouth College (USA)\n2. Row 2: Durham University (UK) \u2013 this matches.\n3. Row 3: Queens University (Canada)\n4. Row 4: University of Otago (New Zealand)\n5. Row 5: University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany)\n6. Row 6: University of Western Australia (Australia)\n\nSo, Durham University is in Row 2.\n\nNext, I need to look at the \"world rank by - wur\" column for Row 2. The table structure is a bit naturalized, but each row has several attributes separated by colons. For Row 2, it's:\n- members: durham university\n- country: uk\n- year established: 1832\n- world rank by the - wur , 2013: 80th\n\nSo the \"world rank by - wur\" for Durham University in 2013 is indeed 80th. \n\nNow, the claim says that this is the best rank, meaning it's higher (better) than other universities. Since no other universities are mentioned in the claim, I need to check if this rank is indeed the highest among all listed.\n\nLooking at the \"world rank by - wur\" for each row:\n- Row 1: Dartmouth College \u2013 not provided.\n- Row 2: Durham University \u2013 80th\n- Row 3: Queens University \u2013 Not provided.\n- Row 4: University of Otago \u2013 226-250th\n- Row 5: University of T\u00fcbingen \u2013 201-225th\n- Row 6: University of Western Australia \u2013 168th\n\nWait, the table shows:\n- Dartmouth's \"world rank by - wur\" isn't filled; same for others. But for the specific rows provided:\nDurham is 80th, which is better (higher) than Queens (not given), Otago (226-250), T\u00fcbingen (201-225), and Western Australia (168th). Since no other university in the table has a higher rank than 80th in this category, Durham's 80th place is indeed the best among those listed. \n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are other universities not listed in the table that might have a better rank, but since the claim doesn't specify any external information, I can only rely on what's provided. Therefore, within the data given, Durham University does have the highest rank in the \"world rank by - wur\" category for 2013.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that overall, Durham University has the best rank (80th) in that specific category. Since there's no higher rank among the listed universities in that column, the claim holds true based on the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because, according to the table, Durham University ranks 80th in the \"world rank by - wur\" category for 2013, which is the highest among all universities listed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which universities are being compared here. The claim mentions \"queen university of canada\" and \"dartmouth college.\" Looking at the table, Row 1 is Dartmouth College, and Row 3 is Queens University. So it's comparing Queens to Dartmouth across three categories: WUR (world rank by the - wur), ARWU, and QS.\n\nWait, the claim says that Queens have not done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories. So I need to check each of these three rankings for both universities.\n\nLooking at Dartmouth College's row:\n- WUR 2013: 126th\n- ARWU 2013: 151-200th\n- QS 2013: 113th\n\nQueens University's row:\n- WUR 2013: 226-250th\n- ARWU 2013: 201-300th\n- QS 2013: 189th\n\nSo, for each category, I need to see if Queens is not doing as well (i.e., having a lower or worse ranking) than Dartmouth.\n\nStarting with WUR:\nDartmouth is 126th. Queens is 226-250th. So Queens is ranked lower here, which means they did not do as well. That's one category where the claim holds true.\n\nNext, ARWU:\nDartmouth is 151-200th, and Queens is 201-300th. Again, Queens is ranked lower (worse) than Dartmouth. So that's another category supporting the claim.\n\nLastly, QS:\nDartmouth is 113th, Queens is 189th. Queens is again ranked lower here as well.\n\nSince in all three categories\u2014WUR, ARWU, and QS\u2014Queens has a worse ranking compared to Dartmouth, the statement \"queen university of canada have not do as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category\" is TRUE. \n\nI should make sure I didn't misinterpret any part of the claim. The user wrote it as \"have not do as well,\" which probably means they didn't perform as well or did worse than Dartmouth in all three areas. My analysis shows that's correct for all three categories.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: each comparison is between Queens and Dartmouth across the three ranking columns. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 3 (Queens University) and columns WUR, ARWU, QS.\n- Row 1 (Dartmouth College) and columns WUR, ARWU, QS.\n\nI need to list all these as the relevant_cells in the JSON. Also, ensure that row indices start from 0. So Row 1 is Dartmouth at index 0? Wait, no\u2014the rows are numbered starting from 0 as per the example. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, the table has six rows. The first row (Row 1) is Dartmouth, which would be row_index 0 in the JSON, and Queens is Row 3, so row_index 2.\n\nSo relevant cells would include Dartmouth's WUR, ARWU, QS, and Queens' same columns.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should have all these cells listed as relevant for comparison.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Queens University has lower rankings than Dartmouth College in all three categories: WUR, ARWU, and QS. The relevant cells are Dartmouth's row (row index 0) and Queens' row (row index 2), each comparing their respective ranking columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"give how it have have a great headstart , university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. I think it's trying to say that the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany does not perform as well as other universities overall.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with various attributes like country, year established, and their world rankings from three sources: WUR (World University Rankings), ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), and QS (QS World University Rankings) for the year 2013.\n\nSo, to verify the claim, I need to check how each of these universities is ranked. The relevant columns seem to be \"world rank by the - wur,\" \"world rank by arwu,\" and \"world rank by qs.\" Each university has a ranking in each category.\n\nThe claim is about the University of T\u00fcbingen not doing as well as other universities, so I should focus on its rankings compared to others. But wait, the table only provides data for six specific universities: Dartmouth College, Durham University, Queens University, University of Otago, University of T\u00fcbingen, and University of Western Australia.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions \"the other university,\" which implies that there are multiple universities being compared. However, the table only has these six. Maybe I'm supposed to compare T\u00fcbingen's rankings across the three categories against an average or median of the others?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is implying that T\u00fcbingen does not have as high a ranking as all the other listed universities. Let me check each of T\u00fcbingen's rankings.\n\nFrom the table:\n- WUR 2013: 201-225th\n- ARWU 2013: 151-200th\n- QS 2013: 144th\n\nNow, let's look at how the other universities are ranked in these categories.\n\nDartmouth College (USA):\n- WUR: 126th\n- ARWU: 151-200th\n- QS: 113th\n\nDurham University (UK):\n- WUR: 80th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 90th\n\nQueens University (Canada):\n- WUR: 226-250th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 189th\n\nUniversity of Otago (New Zealand):\n- WUR: 226-250th\n- ARWU: 201-300th\n- QS: 155th\n\nUniversity of Western Australia (Australia):\n- WUR: 168th\n- ARWU: 91st\n- QS: 134th\n\nNow, comparing T\u00fcbingen's rankings to the others:\n\nIn WUR, T\u00fcbingen is 201-225, while Dartmouth is 126, Durham 80, Queens 226-250, Otago 226-250, Western Australia 168. So in WUR, T\u00fcbingen is ranked lower than several others.\n\nIn ARWU, T\u00fcbingen is 151-200, same as Dartmouth, and higher than Queens, Otago, and Western Australia (which are 201-300). \n\nIn QS, T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Let's see the other universities: Dartmouth at 113, Durham at 90, Queens at 189, Otago at 155, Western Australia at 134. So in QS, T\u00fcbingen is lower than several others.\n\nSo overall, across all three rankings, T\u00fcbingen does not have the highest rankings compared to the other universities listed. Therefore, it's plausible that the claim is stating that T\u00fcbingen doesn't perform as well as \"the other university,\" meaning the other five in this case.\n\nWait, but the table only has these six. So if we consider all of them, T\u00fcbingen's rankings are generally lower than many others. However, the claim mentions \"have not do as well as the other university\" which might imply that T\u00fcbingen is not performing as well as one particular other university.\n\nBut looking at each ranking:\n\n- In WUR: T\u00fcbingen (201-225) vs others like Dartmouth (126), Durham (80), Queens (226-250), Otago (226-250), Western Australia (168). So T\u00fcbingen is lower than most except Queens and Otago, who are also 226-250.\n\nIn ARWU: T\u00fcbingen (151-200) vs others like Dartmouth same, Durham 201-300, Queens and Otago also 201-300, Western Australia 91. So again, T\u00fcbingen is lower than Western Australia but same as Dartmouth.\n\nIn QS: T\u00fcbingen at 144 vs Dartmouth (113), Durham (90), Queens (189), Otago (155), Western Australia (134). So T\u00fcbingen is higher than Queens and Otago but lower than the others.\n\nSo, depending on how we look at it, in some rankings T\u00fcbingen does better than others. But overall, across all three, perhaps the claim is that T\u00fcbingen doesn't perform as well as other universities, which seems to be the case because its rankings are not top among the six.\n\nBut the original instruction says to check each condition against the table. The claim mentions \"university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall.\"\n\nSo perhaps we need to see if T\u00fcbingen's overall performance (across all three rankings) is worse than an average or median of the others.\n\nCalculating an average rank might be tricky because ranks are ordinal and can't be simply averaged. Alternatively, looking at whether T\u00fcbingen is consistently ranked lower across all three metrics compared to other universities.\n\nLooking at each metric:\n\n- WUR: T\u00fcbingen 201-225 (lower than several)\n- ARWU: 151-200 (same as Dartmouth, but higher than others except Western Australia which is 91)\n- QS: 144 (higher than Queens and Otago, lower than the rest)\n\nSo overall, in some rankings T\u00fcbingen is not doing as well as other universities. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have not do as well as the other university , overall.\" The use of \"the other university\" is a bit ambiguous. It could mean compared to each individual university or compared to all collectively.\n\nIf it's compared individually, then in some metrics T\u00fcbingen does better than others but worse in others. However, if we consider that across all three rankings, T\u00fcbingen doesn't have the highest rank, which is 80th (Durham) in WUR, 91st (Western Australia) in ARWU, and 90th (Durham again) in QS.\n\nSo overall, across all three, T\u00fcbingen isn't performing as well as some other universities. Therefore, it's reasonable to say that the claim is correct.\n\nThus, based on this analysis, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, has not performed as well as \"the other university\" overall is supported by the data provided. Across the three main rankings (WUR, ARWU, QS), the University of T\u00fcbingen's performance is generally lower than several other universities listed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the statement holds true.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true based on the analysis of the university's rankings across different metrics.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the University of Western Australia (UWA) is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"university of western australia do better in all ranking than durham university despite its late date of establishment.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being claimed here. It\u2019s comparing UWA and Durham University across different rankings and also considering their dates of establishment.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with details like members (name), country, year established, and various world rankings from three sources: THE (Times Higher Education) - wur, ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities), and QS (Quacquarelli Symonds). The years are for 2013.\n\nSo the claim is making two parts:\n\n1. UWA does better in all rankings than Durham University.\n2. Despite UWA being established later than Durham, it still outperforms in all rankings.\n\nI need to check each ranking category to see how UWA and Durham compare. Let's go through each column one by one.\n\nStarting with world rank by THE - wur (the wur is probably a typo for THE). For 2013:\n\n- UWA: 168th\n- Durham University: 80th\n\nSo in the THE ranking, Durham is ranked higher than UWA (80 vs 168). That's worse for UWA.\n\nNext, ARWU ranking:\n\n- UWA: 91st\n- Durham: 201-300th\n\nHere, UWA is ranked much higher than Durham. So UWA does better in ARWU.\n\nLastly, QS ranking:\n\n- UWA: 134th\n- Durham: 90th\n\nAgain, UWA is lower than Durham (134 vs 90). So UWA doesn't do as well here either.\n\nSo for the rankings:\n\n- THE: UWA worse than Durham.\n- ARWU: UWA better than Durham.\n- QS: UWA worse than Durham.\n\nThe claim states that UWA does better in all rankings, but from this analysis, it's only better in one of three. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false because there are rankings where UWA doesn't do better.\n\nAs for the second part of the claim, it mentions that despite its late establishment, UWA still outperforms. But since the date isn't relevant to ranking performance, and the claim's first part is false, the overall statement remains false.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. The claim refers to both universities' rankings in THE, ARWU, and QS. So for each of these columns, we need the row indices for UWA and Durham.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- UWA is row 6.\n- Durham University is row 2.\n\nFor each ranking column:\n\n1. world rank by THE - wur: UWA's value is 168th (row 6), Durham's is 80th (row 2).\n2. world rank by ARWU: UWA is 91st (row 6), Durham is 201-300th (row 2).\n3. world rank by QS: UWA is 134th (row 6), Durham is 90th (row 2).\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nFor UWA:\n- row_index: 6, column_name: \"world rank by the - wur\"\n- row_index: 6, column_name: \"world rank by arwu\"\n- row_index: 6, column_name: \"world rank by qs\"\n\nFor Durham:\n- row_index: 2, column_name: \"world rank by the - wur\"\n- row_index: 2, column_name: \"world rank by arwu\"\n- row_index: 2, column_name: \"world rank by qs\"\n\nThese are all the cells that compare the rankings between UWA and Durham as mentioned in the claim. Since not all of UWA's rankings are better than Durham's, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "dartmouth college have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"dartmouth college have never rank higher than the university of t\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that Dartmouth College has never achieved a higher ranking than the University of T\u00fcbingen at any point in time. So, I need to look for their rankings across different years or perhaps compare their current ranks. Wait, looking at the table again, it seems like the data is from 2013 because each row mentions \"world rank by...\" followed by a year (2013) and specific rankings. So the data provided is about their rankings in 2013.\n\nWait, no, actually, each cell under \"year established\" gives the year when the university was established, not the ranking year. The rankings are all for 2013. So the table provides each university's establishment year and their world rankings from three different ranking systems (WUR, ARWU, QS) in 2013.\n\nSo, to check the claim, I need to look at Dartmouth College's 2013 rankings and compare them to University of T\u00fcbingen's 2013 rankings. If Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen in any ranking system for that year, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Dartmouth College (USA) has WUR rank 126th, ARWU 151-200th, QS 113th.\n- Row 5: University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany) has WUR rank 201-225th, ARWU 151-200th, QS 144th.\n\nNow, comparing each ranking:\n\n1. **World University Rankings (WUR):**\n   - Dartmouth: 126th\n   - T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n   So, in WUR, Dartmouth is ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen because 126 < 201.\n\n2. **Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU):**\n   - Both are in the same range: Dartmouth 151-200, T\u00fcbingen also 151-200. However, without exact positions within that range, it's unclear who is higher. ARWU doesn't provide exact ranks beyond the bracket.\n\n3. **QS World University Rankings:**\n   - Dartmouth: 113th\n   - T\u00fcbingen: 144th\n   So, in QS, Dartmouth is ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen because 113 < 144.\n\nFrom this, we can see that in two of the three ranking systems, Dartmouth ranks higher. In ARWU, they are in the same bracket but their exact positions aren't specified beyond the range, so it's unclear if one is higher than the other. However, since the claim is about \"never rank higher,\" even in one ranking system where Dartmouth does rank higher, the claim would be false because there exists at least one ranking where Dartmouth is higher.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The claim says Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. So if in any of the rankings Dartmouth was higher, then the claim is FALSE. Since in WUR and QS Dartmouth is higher, the claim is indeed FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need to find the cells that contain these rankings for both universities. For Dartmouth, they are in row 1 under each ranking. For T\u00fcbingen, they're in row 5 under each ranking.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Dartmouth's WUR rank (row 1, column: world rank by the - wur)\n- Dartmouth's QS rank (row 1, column: world rank by qs)\n- T\u00fcbingen's WUR rank (row 5, column: world rank by the - wur)\n- T\u00fcbingen's QS rank (row 5, column: world rank by qs)\n\nWait, but the claim is about Dartmouth never ranking higher than T\u00fcbingen. So maybe I only need to compare each relevant ranking. Alternatively, perhaps all four cells are relevant because they directly show the rankings in each category that affect the claim.\n\nBut looking back at the instructions, I need to list all the relevant cells that check the conditions of the claim. Since the claim is about Dartmouth's ranking relative to T\u00fcbingen across different systems, the relevant cells would be the WUR and QS rankings because those are the ones where Dartmouth ranks higher. ARWU might not matter if both are in the same range.\n\nWait, no, all three ranking systems should be considered because the claim is about their overall ranking. So even if in one system Dartmouth is lower, but in others higher, the claim is still false because they have ranked higher in some.\n\nSo the relevant cells would include all three rankings for both universities: WUR and QS for comparison, since those are the ones where Dartmouth ranks higher, and ARWU as well. But since the ARWU ranking is in a range, perhaps it's less definitive. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we need to check each relevant cell that could affect the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the WUR and QS are needed because those are the ones where Dartmouth is higher, making the claim false. But I think all three should be considered as they represent different ranking systems.\n\nWait, perhaps the ARWU isn't necessary for comparison since both are in the same range, so it's not clear who is higher. So maybe only WUR and QS need to be checked because there, Dartmouth is definitively higher.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should list all relevant cells that verify the claim. Since the claim is about \"have never rank higher than,\" any instance where they are higher in any ranking system would make the claim false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would include:\n\n- For Dartmouth: row 1, columns world rank by the - wur, world rank by arwu, world rank by qs.\n- For T\u00fcbingen: row 5, same columns.\n\nBut perhaps more specifically, since we're checking if Dartmouth has ever been higher than T\u00fcbingen, we need to compare each of their rankings in each system. So for each ranking type, the relevant cells are both universities' rankings in that type.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would include:\n\n- row 1 (Dartmouth), columns: world rank by the - wur, world rank by arwu, world rank by qs.\n- row 5 (T\u00fcbingen), same columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only specific columns where Dartmouth's rank is higher than T\u00fcbingen. But since I'm not sure which one is higher without looking at each cell, all three need to be checked.\n\nWait, but for the purposes of this task, perhaps it's enough to note that in WUR and QS, Dartmouth is higher, so those cells show that they have ranked higher, making the claim false. Therefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row 1, columns: world rank by the - wur (126), world rank by qs (113)\n- row 5, columns: world rank by the - wur (201-225), world rank by qs (144)\n\nSo these are the specific cells where Dartmouth's rankings are higher than T\u00fcbingen in WUR and QS. Since the claim says \"have never ranked higher,\" but here Dartmouth did rank higher in some systems, making the claim false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the ones I've listed above.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen is false because in the World University Rankings (WUR) and QS rankings, Dartmouth is placed above T\u00fcbingen. Specifically:\n\n- In WUR: Dartmouth is ranked 126th, while T\u00fcbingen is between 201st and 225th.\n- In QS: Dartmouth is ranked 113th, whereas T\u00fcbingen is 144th.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Dartmouth's WUR rank (row 1, column: world rank by the - wur)\n2. Dartmouth's QS rank (row 1, column: world rank by qs)\n3. T\u00fcbingen's WUR rank (row 5, column: world rank by the - wur)\n4. T\u00fcbingen's QS rank (row 5, column: world rank by qs)\n\nThese cells demonstrate that Dartmouth has indeed ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen in two of the three ranking systems evaluated.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is false because in both the World University Rankings and QS rankings, Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Dartmouth's WUR rank: row 1, column: world rank by the - wur\n- Dartmouth's QS rank: row 1, column: world rank by qs\n- T\u00fcbingen's WUR rank: row 5, column: world rank by the - wur\n- T\u00fcbingen's QS rank: row 5, column: world rank by qs\n\nFinal Answer:  \n\\boxed{\\text{The claim is false as Dartmouth has ranked higher in some rankings.}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a university is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"queen university of canada have done better than dartmouth college in all 3 categories.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows are relevant here. There's Dartmouth College in row 1 and Queen University in row 3. So I need to compare these two.\n\nNext, I look at the three ranking columns mentioned: world rank by the - wur, world rank by arwu, and world rank by qs. These seem to be different ranking systems used in 2013.\n\nStarting with Dartmouth College (row 1), their rankings are:\n- wur: 126th\n- arwu: 151st\u2013200th\n- qs: 113th\n\nNow, Queen University (row 3) has:\n- wur: 226\u2013250th\n- arwu: 201\u2013300th\n- qs: 189th\n\nI need to compare each category. \n\nFor the wur ranking, Dartmouth is 126th and Queen is 226\u2013250. Since 126 is better than any number in 226\u2013250, Dartmouth does better here.\n\nLooking at arwu, Dartmouth is 151\u2013200, which is better than Queen's 201\u2013300. So Dartmouth is better again.\n\nLastly, qs ranks Dartmouth at 113th and Queen at 189th. Again, 113 is better than 189, so Dartmouth does better here too.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"Queen University of Canada have done better than Dartmouth College in all 3 categories.\" But based on my comparison, Dartmouth is doing better in each category, not Queen. So the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Queen University has outperformed Dartmouth College across all three ranking systems. However, by comparing the wur, arwu, and qs rankings for both universities, it's clear that Dartmouth consistently ranks higher than Queen in all categories. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "durham university have the second - best rank , ie , 80th , in the world rank by - wur 2013 category",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a university's ranking is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The table has several rows with details about different universities, and each row includes their rankings in three categories: world rank by wur, arwu, and qs for 2013.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"durham university have the second - best rank , ie , 80th , in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim carefully. The user is claiming that Durham University has the second-best rank of 80th in the world rank by wur for 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with their respective rankings. So, my task is to find the relevant data cells from the table that correspond to the claim.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the University**: The claim mentions \"durham university.\" So, I need to look at Row 2 because the first row is Dartmouth College, second is Durham University.\n\n2. **Check the Ranking Category**: The claim refers to \"world rank by - wur 2013.\" From the table's column names, it seems that each university has entries for world rank by the - wur, arwu, and qs in 2013. So, I need to find the cell where row=2 (Durham) and column is \"world rank by the - wur\" for 2013.\n\nWait a second, looking at the table structure, each row has multiple columns: members, country, year established, world rank by the - wur, arwu, qs. So, in the naturalized format, each row's data is under these columns.\n\nIn Row 2, the data is:\n\n- members: durham university\n- country: uk\n- year established: 1832\n- world rank by the - wur: 80th\n- world rank by arwu: 201 - 300th\n- world rank by qs: 90th\n\nSo, the cell for \"world rank by the - wur\" in Row 2 is indeed 80th. The claim states that this ranking is the second-best with the value of 80th.\n\nWait, but what does \"second - best rank\" mean? It could be interpreted as being in the second position when ordered from best to worst. So, if someone claims they are second, that would mean their rank is 80th, which might be higher than others but not first. However, without knowing all the rankings, it's tricky.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the claim correctly states the specific ranking category and value. The claim says Durham has the second-best wur rank of 80th. But in the table, for Row 2, \"world rank by the - wur\" is exactly 80th. So, if the column is 80th, then regardless of being first or second best, the data cell matches.\n\nWait, but the term \"second-best\" implies that someone else has a better (higher) ranking. For example, if another university is ranked higher in this category, like 1st place, then Durham would be second. But unless we know all the rankings across universities, it's hard to say whether 80th is actually the second position.\n\nHowever, the claim is specifically about Durham having a specific rank (80th) in a specific category (\"world rank by - wur\"). So, if the table shows that Durham has 80th in that category, then the statement is factually correct regarding that cell. The part about being \"second-best\" might be a subjective interpretation, but since the claim directly references the exact ranking number, it's accurate.\n\nSo, checking the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 2 (Durham University)\n- Column: world rank by the - wur\n- Value: 80th\n\nTherefore, the statement is TRUE because the data in the relevant cell matches the claim. The other columns don't need to be checked unless they affect the veracity of the specific claim made.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that \"world rank by - wur\" is correctly interpreted. The hyphen and spaces might indicate something else, but from the table's structure, it seems like the column name is \"world rank by the - wur\". So, it's consistent with the claim referring to \"world rank by - wur 2013 category.\"\n\nSo, yes, the relevant cell confirms that Durham University has an 80th ranking in this category. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim that \"university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have rank the worst in every single ranking\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that the University of T\u00fcbingen, located in Germany, has the worst rankings in all possible rankings listed in the table. So, for the claim to be true, every single ranking (WUR, ARWU, QS) should have the University of T\u00fcbingen ranked lower than other universities.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different university with their respective rankings across the three metrics: WUR, ARWU, and QS. The rows are from 0 to 5, and each has these four columns after \"members\": country, year established, and then the rankings for each metric in 2013.\n\nSince the claim is about the University of T\u00fcbingen (row 5), I need to check their rankings in WUR, ARWU, and QS. Let's extract that information from the table.\n\nFor row 5:\n- Members: University of T\u00fcbingen\n- Country: Germany\n- Year established: 1477\n- World Rank by the - wur (I assume this is World University Rankings): 2013: 201-225th\n- World rank by arwu: 2013: 151-200th\n- World rank by qs: 2013: 144th\n\nSo, looking at each ranking:\n1. WUR: 201-225th\n2. ARWU: 151-200th\n3. QS: 144th (which is the highest among these three)\n\nNow, the claim says they have the worst rank in every single ranking. \"Worst\" implies that they are ranked lower than all other universities in each category. So for WUR, being 201-225th, which is a low rank but not necessarily the worst if some universities are ranked lower. Similarly, ARWU is 151-200th and QS is 144th.\n\nI need to check how these rankings compare to other universities in the table. Let's look at the other rows:\n\nRow 0: Dartmouth College (USA) - WUR:126th, ARWU:151-200th, QS:113th\nRow1: Durham University (UK) - WUR:80th, ARWU:201-300th, QS:90th\nRow2: Queens University (Canada) - WUR:226-250th, ARWU:201-300th, QS:189th\nRow3: University of Otago (New Zealand) - WUR:226-250th, ARWU:201-300th, QS:155th\nRow4: University of Western Australia (Australia) - WUR:168th, ARWU:91st, QS:134th\n\nNow, comparing the University of T\u00fcbingen's rankings to others:\n\nIn WUR: 201-225. Let's see if any other university has a worse rank in WUR. Looking at the table:\n- Dartmouth:126 (better than T\u00fcbingen)\n- Durham:80 (much better)\n- Queens:226-250 (same as T\u00fcbingen)\n- Otago:226-250\n- Western Australia:168 (better)\n\nSo, in WUR, both Queens and Otago have rankings that are 226-250, same as T\u00fcbingen. So in WUR, T\u00fcbingen is not the worst because others also share that rank.\n\nIn ARWU:151-200. Let's see:\n- Dartmouth:151-200 (same as T\u00fcbingen)\n- Durham:201-300 (worse than T\u00fcbingen)\n- Queens:201-300\n- Otago:201-300\n- Western Australia:91 (much better)\n\nSo, in ARWU, Dartmouth and T\u00fcbingen are in the same bracket. So again, not the worst.\n\nIn QS:144th. Let's check:\n- Dartmouth:113 (better)\n- Durham:90 (much better)\n- Queens:189 (worse than T\u00fcbingen)\n- Otago:155\n- Western Australia:134\n\nSo in QS, T\u00fcbingen is 144, which is worse than several others like Queens (189) and Otago (155). But wait, no, 144 is lower than those. So in QS, their rank is better than some but not the worst.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. If QS ranks go from best to worst, with lower numbers being better. So T\u00fcbingen at 144 is better (higher ranked) than Queens at 189 and Otago at 155. So in QS, their rank is actually better than those two.\n\nBut let's see if any other university has a worse QS rank than T\u00fcbingen. Looking through the table:\n\n- Dartmouth:113\n- Durham:90\n- Queens:189\n- Otago:155\n- Western Australia:134\n\nSo T\u00fcbingen at 144 is better (higher) than Queens and Otago, but worse than Dartmouth, Durham, and Western Australia. So in QS, they're not the worst because some have lower ranks.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- WUR: Not the worst as others share their rank.\n- ARWU: Shares same bracket with Dartmouth, so not the worst.\n- QS: Not the worst as some are ranked lower.\n\nTherefore, T\u00fcbingen doesn't have the worst rank in every single ranking. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen's rankings in WUR, ARWU, and QS are 201-225th, 151-200th, and 144th respectively. Comparing these to other universities' rankings, T\u00fcbingen does not have the worst rank in every category. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
