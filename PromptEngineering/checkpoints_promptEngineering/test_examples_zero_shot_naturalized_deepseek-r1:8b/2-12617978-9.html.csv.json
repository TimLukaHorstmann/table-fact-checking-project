    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two companies: \"beach break live\" and \"cone timentrate design.\" The claim also specifies that Peter Jones is investing in these companies and that the money requested is more than 35,000.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to an episode with details about entrepreneurs, their company or product name, money requested, and the dragons involved. My task is to find cells in this table that are relevant to the claim.\n\nStarting with \"beach break live,\" I'll search through the rows. Row 1 has this company, and the money requested is 50,000. The investing dragon is Peter Jones. So, this row seems directly related because it matches both the company name and the investor mentioned in the claim. \n\nNext, checking for \"cone timentrate design.\" I go through each row but don't find this exact company name anywhere in the table. Maybe it's a typo or a different name? For example, Row 5 mentions \"concentrate design\" with Peter Jones as the investing dragon, but that's not exactly the same as \"cone timentrate design.\" So, there's no row that directly matches both the company and the investor mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince one part of the claim is supported (beach break live) and the other isn't found (cone timentrate design), I need to see if the claim is fully accurate. The claim says both companies are invested in by Peter Jones with a request over 35,000. But since \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is referring to two separate investments? So, for \"beach break live,\" it's correct with Peter Jones and over 35k. For \"cone timentrate design,\" there's no data in the table matching this exactly. Therefore, only one part of the claim is accurate.\n\nBut the claim says both companies are invested in by Peter Jones with more than 35,000. Since \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present and the other company meets the criteria, it's not entirely true because not all parts hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to check if any investment by Peter Jones exceeds 35k, regardless of the company name. Looking at Row 1 again, Peter Jones invested 50k for beach break live. But the claim mentions \"cone timentrate design,\" which isn't in the table. So even though there's a high amount, it's not tied to that specific company.\n\nTherefore, the claim has inaccuracies because one of the two companies listed isn't present and doesn't receive investment as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes two companies: \"beach break live\" and \"cone timentrate design.\" The table confirms Peter Jones invested in \"beach break live\" with 50,000, meeting the criteria. However, \"cone timentrate design\" isn't found in the table, so the claim is partially accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"reestore request 50000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions \"reestore,\" which seems like it's related to an entrepreneur's company name. The money requested is 50,000, and the investors involved are Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a row where these three elements match: company name \"Reestore,\" money requested is 50,000, and investors are Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Company is Beach Break Live, money is 50k, but investors are Peter Jones. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Goldgenie/Midas Touch, 60k, investors James Caan. No.\n\nRow 3: Youdoodoll, 35k, Deborah Meaden only. Not Theo Paphitis and amount isn't 50k.\n\nRow 4: Gaming Alerts, 200k, investors Theo and Peter. Money is too high.\n\nRow 5: Concentrate Design, 100k, Peter Jones. No.\n\nRow 6: Reestore, 50k, investors Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis.

I need to scan through each row to see if \"game alert\" is mentioned along with \u00a3200,000.\n\nI'll start from Row 1: It mentions \"beach break live,\" but no mention of a game alert or the specific amount. Rows 2 through 6 also don't show either of these terms. \n\nRow 4 says \"gaming alerts\" and asks for \u00a3200,000. Wait, that's exactly what I'm looking for. The company is called \"gaming alerts,\" which seems to align with \"game alert.\" The amount requested is 200000, which matches the claim.\n\nSo, this row (Row 4) has both elements of the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"reestore request 70000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis\".\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two people: Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. It also refers to a company named ReStore and a money amount of 70,000.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where both Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis are listed as investing dragons. Also, I need to check if any row for ReStore has a request of 70,000.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Money requested is 50,000 by Celia Norowzian & Ian Forshew. Investing dragons include Peter Jones.\nRow 2: 60,000 by Laban Roomes. Dragons are James Caan.\nRow 3: 35,000 by Sarah Lu. Dragons: Deborah Meaden.\nRow 4: 200,000 by Emmie Matthews & Ed Stevens. Dragons: Theo Paphitis.\nRow 5: 100,000 by Mark Champkins. Dragon: Peter Jones.\nRow 6: ReStore is mentioned here with a request of 50,000. The investing dragons are Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis.\nRow 7: Cush'n 'shade, 100,000. Dragons: Deborah Meaden & Peter Jones.\nRow 8: Hungryhousecouk, 100,000.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"in episode 7, 145000 be the highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\" \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which parts of the claim relate to specific columns in the table. Looking at the claim, it mentions \"episode 7,\" so I should look for rows where the episode is episode 7. The columns relevant here are likely \"money requested\" and \"entrepreneur(s).\" So I'll need to identify all entries in row 11 (since that's the only episode 7) related to these.\n\nNext, I check the table details. In row 12, which is labeled as episode 7, the entrepreneurs are jerry mantalvanos & paul merker, and the company or product name is jpm eco logistics. The money requested here is 100000. Wait, but the claim mentions 145000 as the amount. That doesn't match because in row 12, it's 100000. \n\nWait a minute, I think I might have miscounted the rows. Let me check again: the first row is episode 1, so the 11th row is episode 7 (since counting starts at 0 or 1? Wait no, looking back, rows are numbered from 1 to 14. So row 12 is actually the 12th entry, which would be the second entry for episode 7 because there's another entry after it. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that in the provided data, episodes go up as follows:\n- Episode 1: rows 1 & 2\n- Episode 2: rows 3 & 4\n- Episode 3: row 5\n- Episode 4: rows 6 &7\n- Episode 5: row8\n- Episode6: rows9&10\n- Episode7: rows11&12\n- Episode8: row13\n- Episode9: row14\n\nSo for episode7, there are two rows: row11 and row12. Row11 is episode7, first aired... with entrepreneurs sammy french, money 100000. Then row12 is another episode7 entry, with jerry mantalvanos & paul merker, money 100000 as well. Wait, but the claim says 145000, which I don't see in any of these.\n\nWait no, looking back at row6: that's episode4, with max mcmurdo and reestore, money50000. Row7 is another episode4 entry, with jamie jenkinson and cush'n 'shade, money100000. So the 145000 must be elsewhere.\n\nLooking through all rows, I see that the highest money requested is in row13: 150000 for peter moule's Electroexpo & Chocbox. But that's not related to episode7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"in episode7,\" so only looking at episode7 entries. In those, both have 100000. So the claim mentions 145000, which isn't present in any of the episode7 rows. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no entry in episode7 with a money request of 145000 by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\n\nAdditionally, checking for relevant cells: I need to see which columns are used. The key points are \"episode,\" \"money requested,\" and \"entrepreneur(s).\" So the relevant cells would be row12 (since that's where the entrepreneurs mentioned are), looking at money requested and perhaps entrepreneur(s). But since the money isn't 145000, it doesn't support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because in episode7, the highest amount of money requested by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker is 100000, not 145000.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Episode and Entrepreneurs:**\n   - The claim refers to \"episode7\" and specifies entrepreneurs Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker.\n   \n2. **Locate the Corresponding Row in the Table:**\n   - Scanning through the table, row12 corresponds to episode7 with entrepreneurs jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\n\n3. **Check the Money Requested:**\n   - In row12, the money requested is 100000, not 145000.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the claimed amount (145000) doesn't match the actual data in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n   \n5. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - The relevant columns are \"money requested\" and \"entrepreneur(s)\" for row12.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"episode_number\": 7,\n    \"money_requested\": 100000,\n    \"entrepreneurs\": [\"jerry mantalvanos\", \"paul merker\"],\n    \"columns_used\": [\"money requested\", \"entrepreneur(s)\"]\n  }\n}\n```",
