    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), bremen have a higher enrollment than culver community.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's comparing two schools: Bremen and Culver Community in terms of their enrollment numbers within the IHSAA Northern State Conference.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different school with various attributes like location, mascot, enrollment, etc. The key columns here are \"school (ihsaa id)\", \"location\", \"mascot\", \"enrollment\", and others. \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find the relevant rows for Bremen and Culver Community. \n\nStarting with Bremen: Scanning through the table, row 1 has the school name \"bremen\" as the ihsaa id. So Bremen is in row 1.\n\nNext, looking for Culver Community: Row 2 has the ihsaa id as \"culver community\". That's Culver Community in row 2.\n\nNow, I need to compare their enrollments. The enrollment column is where the numbers are. \n\nFrom the table:\n- Bremen (row 1) has an enrollment of 505.\n- Culver Community (row 2) has an enrollment of 306.\n\nThe claim states that Bremen's enrollment is higher than Culver's. Since 505 is greater than 306, this seems to be true based on the numbers provided in the table.\n\nSo, I should check if there are any other relevant cells beyond these two. The columns involved here are \"enrollment\" for both schools, so rows 1 and 2 are the only ones needed.\n\nI don't see any other columns that would affect this comparison. The rest of the information like location or year joined isn't necessary for determining enrollment numbers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), bremen join 12 years after culver community.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two schools: Bremen and Culver Community. The statement is about their joining the Northern State Conference (IHSAA) with a specific time difference of 12 years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find information related to both schools. Each row represents a different school with various attributes like ihsaa id, location, mascot, enrollment, class, county, and year joined.\n\nLet's start by identifying where Bremen is in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: school (ihsaa id): bremen. So Bremen is at row index 0.\n\nNext, finding Culver Community. Looking for the same ihsaa id as Culver Community:\n\n- Row 2: school (ihsaa id): culver community. So Culver is in row 1.\n\nNow, I need to check when each of them joined the conference. The claim states that Bremen joined 12 years after Culver.\n\nSo, from the table, let's extract their year joined:\n\n- Bremen: Row 1 has year joined: 1989.\n- Culver Community: Row 2 has year joined: 1977.\n\nCalculating the difference between their joining years: 1989 - 1977 = 12 years. \n\nThat matches exactly what the claim says: Bremen joined 12 years after Culver.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that both schools are part of the Northern State Conference (IHSAA). From the table data, each school's ihsaa class is mentioned. For example, Bremen is in AA, and Culver is in A. However, the exact conference name isn't explicitly stated in the columns provided, only classes like AA or A. But since both are under IHSAA, it's reasonable to assume they're part of the Northern State Conference as per the claim.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because Bremen joined exactly 12 years after Culver Community, and both are part of the IHSAA (Northern State Conference).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Bremen be in a different IHSAA class than Culver Community.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The northern state conference is mentioned as IHSAA, which probably stands for Interscholastic High School Activities Association. So this is likely a sports conference or organization that organizes competitions and such for schools.\n\nNow, the claim is about two specific schools: Bremen and Culver Community. It's saying that in this northern state conference, these two schools are in different IHSAA classes. So I need to check their respective classifications in the conference.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a school with various attributes: ihsaa id, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and year joined. \n\nSo first, I should find where Bremen and Culver Community are in this table. \n\nRow 1 is Bremen: School (ihsaa id): bremen, etc., so that's Bremen.\n\nRow 2 is Culver Community: School (ihsaa id): culver community, etc., so that's Culver.\n\nNext, I need to look at their ihsaa class. For Bremen, the ihsaa class is 'aa'. For Culver, it's 'a'.\n\nWait, but in high school sports, usually classes go from A to AAAA or something like that. So 'a' and 'aa' are different classifications.\n\nTherefore, Bremen is in a higher class than Culver. So they are indeed in different IHSAA classes within the northern state conference.\n\nSo the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, as for relevant cells: I need to identify which rows and columns in the table support this. \n\nEach school has an 'ihsaa class' column. For Bremen, it's row 1, column ihsaa class. For Culver, it's row 2, same column. So those are the two relevant cells.\n\nSo in the JSON response, I should list both of these as relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Laville have a lower enrollment than Jimtown.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The northern state conference is mentioned as an IHSAA group. Looking at the table provided, each row represents a school with details like location, mascot, enrollment, and other identifiers.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n1. Laville vs Jimtown.\n2. Enrollment comparison (Laville < Jimtown).\n\nSo, I need to find the rows for Laville and Jimtown to check their enrollments.\n\nLooking through the table row by row:\n\nRow 6: school (ihsaa id): laville, location: lakeville, mascot: lancers, enrollment: 413, ihsaa class: a, county: 71 st joseph, year joined: 1966.\nRow 4: school (ihsaa id): jimtown, location: elkhart, mascot: jimmies, enrollment: 642, ihsaa class: aaa, county: 20 elkhart, year joined: 1966.\n\nFrom this, Laville's enrollment is 413 and Jimtown's is 642. So, Laville has a lower enrollment than Jimtown.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"northern state conference (IHSAA)\". I need to check if both schools are part of this conference. Looking at each school's details:\n\nFor Laville (Row 6): The county is 71 st joseph along with laporte. There's a mention of 46 laporte and 71 st joseph, but it's unclear which conference they belong to. However, the claim refers to northern state conference, so I should check if either school is part of that.\n\nLooking at Jimtown (Row 4): The county is 20 elkhart. This might be part of a different conference. Without explicit info about the conferences in the table, it's tricky, but the key here is whether their enrollments support the claim regardless of the conference, or if the conference affiliation is a factor.\n\nWait, the claim specifically mentions \"northern state conference (IHSAA)\". So, I should check if both schools are part of that conference. If one isn't, does that affect the validity?\n\nLooking at the table, each school's row includes details like location, mascot, etc., but not explicitly their conference affiliation. However, given the term \"northern state conference,\" it's possible that the enrollment comparison within this conference is what matters.\n\nBut without explicit info in the table about which conference each school belongs to, I might need to infer based on the data given or perhaps the claim only cares about the enrollment numbers regardless of conference.\n\nWait, maybe the northern state conference is part of IHSAA. So, if both schools are in that conference, then Laville's lower enrollment compared to Jimtown makes the claim true. If one isn't in that conference, maybe the comparison doesn't apply.\n\nBut looking at the table, it's unclear which conference each school is part of beyond their county names. For example:\n\n- Bremen: county 50 marshall\n- Culver Community: county 50 marshall\n- Glenn: county 71 st joseph\n- Jimtown: county 20 elkhart\n- Knox Community: county 75 starke\n- Laville: county 71 st joseph\n- New Prairie: county 46 laporte and 71 st joseph\n- Triton: county 50 marshall\n\nI don't see a specific mention of the northern state conference in the table. So, perhaps the claim is relying on the enrollment numbers without considering conference affiliation. Therefore, regardless of which conference they're in, Laville's enrollment (413) is less than Jimtown's (642), making the statement true.\n\nSo, I think the relevant cells are the row indices for Laville and Jimtown to check their enrollments.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Laville has a lower enrollment than Jimtown within the northern state conference. From the table, Laville's enrollment is 413, while Jimtown's is 642.

The northern state conference is mentioned as IHSAA, which probably stands for the Indiana High School Athletic Association. So, we're looking at schools in this conference.\n\nNext, the claim compares two schools: Laville and Triton. It says Laville has a higher enrollment than Triton. Enrollment numbers are important here because they determine if the claim is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the rows for both Laville and Triton. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Bremen\nRow 2: Culver Community\nRow 3: Glenn\nRow 4: Jimtown\nRow 5: Knox Community\nRow 6: Laville - This is relevant because it's one of the schools in question.\nRow 7: New Prairie\nRow 8: Triton - This is the other school mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo, Laville is row 6 and Triton is row 8. Now, I need to check their enrollment numbers.\n\nFor Laville (row 6): The enrollment is listed as 413.\nFor Triton (row 8): The enrollment is listed as 333.\n\nComparing these two numbers: 413 vs. 333.

Let me look again:\n\n- Laville: 413\n- Triton: 333\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the claim is stating that Laville has a higher enrollment than Triton, which is true based on the table.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this claim. The relevant columns for each school would be \"enrollment\" because that's what the comparison is about.\n\nSo, for Laville, it's row 6 and column \"enrollment.\" For Triton, it's row 8 and column \"enrollment.\"\n\nPutting this together, I can see that Laville's enrollment is higher than Triton's, so the claim is TRUE.

The claim says: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Bremen joined 5 years before Culver Community.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of this claim and see how it matches the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the conferences mentioned. The term \"northern state conference\" isn't directly in the table, but it's specified as the IHSAA conference. So, I need to check if both Bremen and Culver Community are part of the IHSAA conference, which they seem to be based on their IHSAA IDs.\n\nNext, looking at when each school joined. The claim states that Bremen joined 5 years before Culver Community. \n\nLooking at Row 1 for Bremen: year joined is 1989.\nLooking at Row 2 for Culver Community: year joined is 1977.\n\nCalculating the difference between these two years: 1989 minus 1977 equals 12 years. So, Bremen didn't join 5 years before Culver; it was actually 12 years later.\n\nWait, but maybe I got the subtraction wrong. Let me double-check that. If Bremen joined in 1989 and Culver in 1977, then Culver is earlier by 12 years, not Bremen being earlier. So, the claim's statement is reversed. It says Bremen joined before Culver, which isn't correct because Culver was already there in 1977.\n\nSo, the claim is false because the joining year for Bremen (1989) is after Culver's 1977, making it a 12-year difference, not 5 years ahead.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check are both schools' row indices and their \"year joined\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bremen joined 5 years before Culver Community in the IHSAA.

Laville's enrollment (413) is higher than Culver Community's (306).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
