Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating two things: that Ken Snelling is a fullback and that he was picked in round 7 with pick number 58.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the player is Ken Snelling and his position is fullback. Then, check if his pick number and round match the claim.\n\nStarting by scanning through each row's 'player' column:\n\nRow 5: player is Ken Snelling, position is fullback. That matches both aspects of the claim.\nLooking at his pick number, it's 58 in round 7. So both conditions are met.\n\nI don't see any other entries for Ken Snelling, so this seems to be the only relevant row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about George Zellick is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"George Zellick has a position of end and a school/club team of Oregon State.\" So, I'm looking for two pieces of information in the table: his position and his school or club team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a pick in a draft round. Each row has columns like Round, Pick, Player, Position, School/Club Team. I'll need to scan through each row to see if George Zellick is listed there with the specified position and team.\n\nLet me go through the rows one by one. Row 1: The player's name isn't George Zellick. Row 2: Also not him. Row 3: Not him either. Continuing like this, I'm checking each row until I find his entry.\n\nWait, I should check all 30 rows to be thorough. Maybe he's near the end? Let me see... Hmm, row 23: round 24, pick 228, player is George Zellick. His position is end, and school/club team is Oregon State. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are in row 23. The columns we need to check are Position and School/Club Team for that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the table directly. George Zellick's position is listed as end and his school/club team is Oregon State in row 23.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"School / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about George Zellick is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"george zellick have a position of center and a school / club of oregon state.\" So, two things are being claimed here. One is the player's position, which should be center, and the other is their school or club team, which should be Oregon State.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find any mention of George Zellick. Since the table lists players with various details like round, pick, position, and school/club team, I can scan each row's player name for \"george zellick.\"\n\nLooking at Row 22: It says round: 24, pick: 228, player: george zellick, position: guard, school / club team: oregon state. Hmm, that seems relevant because it mentions George Zellick.\n\nWait, the claim says his position is center, but in this row, his position is listed as guard. That's a discrepancy. So, according to the table, George Zellick's position is guard, not center. Therefore, the first part of the claim about his position being center might be incorrect.\n\nNext, checking the school/club team: The claim says Oregon State. In Row 22, it does list \"oregon state\" as the school/club team. So that part checks out.\n\nSo, even though one part (position) is incorrect, the other part is correct. But the instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. Since position is wrong and school/club is correct, the overall claim isn't entirely true because it gets at least one fact wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check all rows just to be sure. Scanning through, only Row 22 mentions George Zellick. So yes, his position is guard, not center.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the position stated in the claim doesn't match what's in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
