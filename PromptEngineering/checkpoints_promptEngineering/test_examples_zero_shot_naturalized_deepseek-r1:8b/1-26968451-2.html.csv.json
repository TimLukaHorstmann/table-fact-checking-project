    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"michael lembeck direct series number 39 , fly solo.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things: Michael Lembeck directed a specific series (number 39) titled \"Fly Solo.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different episode with details like Series Number, Season, Title, Directed By, Written By, and Original Airdate.\n\nI need to find in the table if there's an entry where:\n1. The Series Number is 39.\n2. The Directed By field is Michael Lembeck.\n3. The Title is \"Fly Solo.\"\n\nSo I'll go through each row one by one until I find series number 39. \n\nLooking at Row 13: series: 39, season: 13, title: flying solo. Hmm, the title here is \"flying solo,\" which is similar but not exactly \"fly solo.\" Are these titles considered the same? Maybe, maybe not. The claim says \"Fly Solo,\" and the table has \"flying solo.\" Depending on whether that's a typo or not, it might matter.\n\nWait, let me check if the title in Row 13 is indeed \"flying solo\" without a space between 'fly' and 'solo.' If the claim uses \"Fly Solo\" with a space, does that match? Probably not. Alternatively, maybe it's just a minor difference in spacing or wording, but they're essentially the same meaning.\n\nNext, check who directed it. Row 13 says directed by :: michael lembeck. So Michael Lembeck is indeed the director for series number 39. \n\nSo even though the title has \"flying solo\" without a space, and considering that sometimes titles might have slight variations in spacing or wording but are essentially the same, I think it's reasonable to consider them equivalent.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by Row 13. The series number matches, Michael Lembeck directed it, and the title is \"flying solo,\" which likely corresponds to \"Fly Solo\" in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Michael Lembeck directed series number 39 titled \"Fly Solo.\" Checking the table:\n\n- Series 39 is found in Row 13.\n- The director is listed as Michael Lembeck.\n- The title is \"flying solo,\" which is likely intended to be \"Fly Solo.\"\n\nAll conditions of the claim are met, so the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. Each row represents a different series with various details: series number, season, title, director, writers, and original airdate. The claim specifically mentions \"series number 39\" and that it was written by Michael Lembeck.\n\nTo verify this, I need to locate the relevant row in the table where series number is 39 and check if Michael Lembeck is listed as a writer for that particular episode.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 13: Series 39, season 13. The title is \"flying solo\". The director is Michael Lembeck, but the writers are listed as Leslie Rieder.\n  \nSo, according to this row, series number 39 was directed by Michael Lembeck but written by Leslie Rieder. There's no mention of Michael Lembeck being a writer for that episode.\n\nSince the claim states that Michael Lembeck wrote the episode, and the table shows he was only the director, not a writer, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
