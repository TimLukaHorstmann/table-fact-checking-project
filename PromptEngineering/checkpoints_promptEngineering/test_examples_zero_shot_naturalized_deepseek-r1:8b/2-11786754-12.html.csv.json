    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard.\" Hmm, I need to understand what exactly this means. It seems like the claim is talking about an average (probably yards per attempt or something similar) where the player has more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards in a game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with various stats: receptions (rec), yards, average, and touchdowns ('s). I think \"average\" here refers to the yards per reception (YPR) or maybe yards per attempt, but since the data given includes yards and receptions, it's likely YPR.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that there exists a player whose YPR is 5.3, and this player has more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards in their stats.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row to see if any player matches these criteria.\n\nRow 1: Player Rob Turner\n- rec:16, yards:171, avg:10.6, TDs:4\nYPR would be 171/16 \u224810.6875, which is higher than 5.3.\nBut does this player have more than 0 TDs? Yes, they have 4 TDs and over 135 yards. So this could be a relevant cell.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"average that have more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yard.\" So maybe it's not necessarily about YPR, but just an average of some sort. Or perhaps it's about the player's overall yards per game? Let me clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about a player who has both an average (maybe their YPR) equal to exactly 5.3 and also meets the other conditions. But looking at the table, none of the players have an avg column value of exactly 5.3.\n\nWait, let me check each row:\n\nRow1: avg=10.6\nRow2: avg=10.6\nRow3: avg=10.3\nRow4: avg=5.3\nRow5: avg=6.0\nRow6: avg=19.3\n\nOh, wait! Row4 has an average of 5.3. So that's a potential candidate.\n\nNow, check if this player (Robert Quiroga) has more than 0 touchdowns and more than 135 yards.\n\nIn row4:\n- rec=3, yards=16, avg=5.3, TDs=2\n\nWait, he has 2 TDs which is more than 0, but his yards are only 16, which is less than 135. So he doesn't meet both conditions. Therefore, even though his average is 5.3, he doesn't have over 135 yards. So he doesn't satisfy the claim.\n\nSo the next step: look for any player whose avg is exactly 5.3 and has more than 0 TDs and more than 135 yards.\n\nLooking again, only Row4 has avg=5.3. But as I saw, his yards are 16, which is less than 135. So he doesn't meet all conditions.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is saying that 5.3 is the average for players who have more than 0 TDs and more than 135 yards. So perhaps among those players (with >0 TDs and >135 yards), what's their average? Let me see.\n\nSo first, identify which players meet both conditions: more than 0 TDs and more than 135 yards.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow1: TD=4 (>0) and yards=171 (>135): Yes\nRow2: TD=0 (not >0)\nRow3: TD=1 (>0), yards=135 (exactly 135, so not >135)\nRow4: TD=2 (>0), yards=16 (<135)\nRow5: TD=0\nRow6: TD=3 (>0), yards=58 (<135)\n\nSo only Row1 meets both conditions.\n\nNow, what's the average for Row1? His avg is 10.6. So among players who have more than 0 TDs and more than 135 yards, their average is 10.6, not 5.3.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"5.3 be the average...\" is false because the actual average of such players is 10.6, not 5.3.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant.\n\nThe relevant cells would be:\n\n- The player in row1 (Rob Turner) since he's the only one meeting both conditions, so we check his avg column.\n- Additionally, perhaps the player in row4, because he has the average of 5.3 but doesn't meet the yard condition, making him a false candidate.\n\nWait, but does the claim require that the average is 5.3 among all players with those stats, or just that a single player has that average? From the phrasing: \"5.3 be the average that have more than 0 touchdown and more than 135 yard.\" It's unclear, but I think it refers to any player who satisfies both conditions having an average of 5.3.\n\nBut in reality, only Row4 has the avg of 5.3, but he doesn't meet the yard condition. So maybe the relevant cells are:\n\n- All players with more than 0 TDs and >135 yards (only Row1)\n   - So their avg is 10.6\n- The player with avg=5.3 (Row4) because it's part of the data that could be considered\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include both row1 and row4 to check if any support the claim.\n\nSo in conclusion, the answer is FALSE because no player meets all three criteria: having an average of 5.3, more than 0 TDs, and more than 135 yards.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"avg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
