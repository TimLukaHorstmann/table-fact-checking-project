    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the date list for the item that be undergo overhaul , restoration or repair be 1956.\" So, they're talking about an item undergoing some kind of maintenance work and its associated date being 1956.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a row (Row 8) where the number & name is \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\". All the columns for this row have that same text: description, livery, owner(s), and date. The date here is also mentioned as \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if the date associated with this item undergoing repair is 1956. But looking at Row 8, the date isn't specified numerically; it's just stated as part of the status. In other rows, like Row 3 and others, there are specific dates like 1919, 1920, etc., but in Row 8, the date is \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs.\"\n\nThis means that while the item is indeed undergoing some maintenance, the exact date isn't provided numerically in any cell. The only mention of a date for this particular item is the status itself, not a numerical year.\n\nTherefore, there's no explicit date (like 1956) linked to this item in the table cells. So, the claim that the date list for undergoing repairs is 1956 doesn't have support from the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim isn't supported by specific data in the table since the relevant row doesn't provide a numerical date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
