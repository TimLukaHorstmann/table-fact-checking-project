The claim is: \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute have the highest enrollment with 1895.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. Each row has a name, location, enrollment, and two rankings. The relevant part for this claim is the enrollment numbers. So, I need to find out if any school has a higher enrollment than John F Ross.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: 1533\n- Row 2: 998\n- Row 3: 1459\n- Row 4: 649\n- Row 5: 616\n- Row 6: 1314\n- Row 7: 1895 (John F Ross)\n- Row 8: 795\n- Row 9: 1574\n- Row 10: 680\n- Row 11: 996\n\nI see that John F Ross has 1895 enrollment. Now, I need to check if any other school has a higher number than this. Looking at all the enrollments:\n\n- The highest is 1895 for John F Ross.\n- Next is Row 6 with 1314, which is less than 1895.\n- Row 3: 1459 is also less than 1895.\n- Row 9: 1574 is still less.\n- All others are lower.\n\nSo no other school has a higher enrollment. Therefore, the claim that John F Ross has the highest enrollment with 1895 is true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant column is \"enrollment\" for each row. The rows related are Row 7 because that's where John F Ross is listed with enrollment 1895.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the enrollment numbers of all schools. John F Ross has the highest at 1895, no other school surpasses this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about various schools, including their names, locations, enrollment numbers, and some rankings. The claim is: \"2 of the list school be locate in the orangeville area.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that two of the listed schools are located in Orangeville. So, my task is to check each row of the table and see which ones have their location as Orangeville.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 11 rows (from Row 1 to Row 11). Each row has a \"location\" field. I need to go through each row's location and count how many times Orangeville appears.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute \u2013 location is Guelph. Not Orangeville.\nRow 2: Centre Dufferin District High School \u2013 Shelburne. No.\nRow 3: Centre Wellington District High School \u2013 Fergus.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"erin district high school have the lowest enrollment with 616.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and find the relevant information. Let's see, the table has multiple rows, each representing a different school. Each row includes details like name, location, enrollment, and two rankings.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"erin district high school\" having the lowest enrollment of 616. So, my first step is to locate Erin District High School in the table. Looking at Row 5, the name is indeed \"erin district high school,\" with an enrollment of 616. That matches the number given in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is the smallest enrollment among all the schools listed. To do that, I'll list out all the enrollments:\n\nRow 1: 1533\nRow 2: 998\nRow 3: 1459\nRow 4: 649\nRow 5: 616\nRow 6: 1314\nRow 7: 1895\nRow 8: 795\nRow 9: 1574\nRow 10: 680\nRow 11: 996\n\nNext, I'll arrange these numbers in order to find the smallest one. Let me list them out:\n\n680 (Row 10)\n616 (Row 5)\n649 (Row 4)\n695? Wait, no, Row 4 is 649, then 616, then 618? No, wait, let's correct that.\n\nWait, actually, the enrollments are:\n\n1533, 998, 1459, 649, 616, 1314, 1895, 795, 1574, 680, 996.\n\nSo starting from the lowest: 680 is Row 10, then 616 (Row 5), followed by 649 (Row 4), then 795 (Row 8), 998 (Row 2), 996 (Row 11), etc. Wait, but I might have missed some numbers in between.\n\nWait, no, let me arrange them numerically:\n\n680, 616, 649, 795, 998, 996, 1314, 1533, 1459, 1574, 1895.\n\nSo the smallest enrollment is 680 from Row 10. That's Wellington Heights Secondary School in Mount Forest with 680 students. \n\nTherefore, Erin District High School has an enrollment of 616, which is higher than 680 but lower than some others like 795 and 998. So it doesn't have the lowest enrollment.\n\nWait a second, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRow 1: 1533\nRow 2: 998\nRow 3: 1459\nRow 4: 649\nRow 5: 616\nRow 6: 1314\nRow 7: 1895\nRow 8: 795\nRow 9: 1574\nRow 10: 680\nRow 11: 996\n\nSo the enrollments are:\n\n1533, 998, 1459, 649, 616, 1314, 1895, 795, 1574, 680, 996.\n\nNow, let's order them from smallest to largest:\n\n680 (Row 10), 616 (Row 5), 649 (Row 4), 795 (Row 8), 998 (Row 2), 996 (Row 11), 1314 (Row 6), 1459 (Row 3), 1533 (Row 1), 1574 (Row 9), 1895 (Row 7).\n\nSo the smallest is indeed Row 10 with 680, followed by Row 5 at 616. Therefore, Erin District High School does not have the lowest enrollment; instead, Wellington Heights Secondary School has the lowest with 680.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"erin district high school have the lowest enrollment with 616\" is FALSE because there's another school with a lower enrollment.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Erin District High School does not have the lowest enrollment; Wellington Heights Secondary School has the smallest enrollment of 680.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is that \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute have the highest enrollment with 1533.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions a specific institution: john f ross collegiate vocational institute. Looking at the table, this corresponds to row 7 because the name in row 7 is exactly \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute.\"\n\nNext, enrollment numbers are what we're comparing here. In each row, the enrollment number is listed under the \"enrollment\" column. So I need to look at the \"enrollment\" value for row 7.\n\nLooking at row 7: name: john f ross collegiate vocational institute, location: guelph, enrollment: 1895. So their enrollment is 1895 students.\n\nNow, I should check if this is the highest among all the institutions listed in the table. To do that, I'll need to compare the \"enrollment\" column across all rows.\n\nLet me list out all the enrollments:\n\n- Row 1: 1533\n- Row 2: 998\n- Row 3: 1459\n- Row 4: 649\n- Row 5: 616\n- Row 6: 1314\n- Row 7: 1895\n- Row 8: 795\n- Row 9: 1574\n- Row 10: 680\n- Row 11: 996\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest enrollment is indeed row 7 with 1895. No other row has a higher number than that.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1533,\" which is actually the enrollment for row 1 (centennial collegiate vocational institute). So perhaps there's a confusion here. The claim might be incorrect because it attributes the highest enrollment to a different institution (row 7) rather than the one stated in the claim (row 1).\n\nBut wait, no. The claim specifically mentions \"john f ross...\" having 1533. However, according to the table, john f ross has 1895, which is higher than 1533. So the claim's number doesn't match the actual enrollment for that institution.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because:\n\n1. It refers to john f ross with an enrollment of 1533, but in reality, their enrollment is 1895.\n2. Even if we check all enrollments, 1895 is higher than 1533, so no institution has a higher enrollment than 1895.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute have the highest enrollment with 1533.\" So they're saying john f ross has 1533 as their enrollment and that's the highest.\n\nBut in row 1, centennial has 1533, and row 7 has 1895. Therefore, john f ross doesn't even have 1533; they have 1895, which is higher than 1533. So the claim is false because:\n\n- The enrollment number stated in the claim (1533) doesn't match the actual enrollment of john f ross.\n- The actual highest enrollment is 1895, not 1533.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. Also, the relevant cells are row 7's enrollment and possibly row 1's enrollment to show that 1533 isn't the highest.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyze the data in the table. The claim states that \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute\" has the highest enrollment with 1533 students.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows and Columns:**\n   - The relevant row is row 7 (john f ross collegiate vocational institute).\n   - The relevant column is \"enrollment.\"\n\n2. **Check Enrollment Numbers:**\n   - Row 7's enrollment is 1895.\n   - Comparing this with all enrollments, 1895 is the highest.\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim Accuracy:**\n   - The claim incorrectly states that john f ross has an enrollment of 1533 and that this is the highest.\n   - Actual data shows a higher enrollment (1895) and a different institution (row 1) having 1533 students.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the stated enrollment number and the highest enrollment do not align correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the lowest rank shown in either the 1 year or 5 year ranking be 16.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is about. It's talking about the rankings of these institutions. Specifically, each row has a 1-year ranking and a 5-year ranking. The claim mentions that the lowest rank (either in the 1-year or 5-year) should be 16.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 11 rows with various details. Each row has fields like name, location, enrollment, 1-year ranking, and 5-year ranking. I need to focus on these two ranking columns for each row: 1-year and 5-year.\n\nSo, my plan is to go through each row, check both the 1-year and 5-year rankings, identify the lower of the two ranks for each row, and see if any of them have a rank as low as 16. If at least one row meets this condition, then the claim would be TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The 1-year ranking is 63, and the 5-year ranking is 22. The lower of these two is 22, which is higher than 16.\n\nRow 2: 1-year rank 265, 5-year 281. Lower is 265, still above 16.\n\nRow 3: 330 and 246. Lower is 246, way above 16.\n\nRow 4: 717 and 688. Lower is 688, which is higher than 16.\n\nRow 5: 197 and 148. The lower here is 148, still above 16.\n\nRow 6: 1-year rank 16, 5-year rank 30. Here, the lower is 16. So this row meets the condition because it has a 1-year ranking of 16, which is exactly what the claim states as the lowest possible.\n\nRow 7: 181 and 165. Lower is 165, above 16.\n\nRow 8: 126 and 343. Lower is 126, still higher than 16.\n\nRow 9: 181 and 194. Lower is 181, which is higher than 16.\n\nRow 10: 371 and 426. Lower is 371, above 16.\n\nRow 11: 478 and 343. Lower is 343, which is higher than 16.\n\nSo, only Row 6 has a rank of 16 in the 1-year ranking column. Therefore, since at least one row meets the condition where the lowest rank between the two rankings is 16, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to structure this properly, I need to note which cells are relevant. Each relevant cell corresponds to a row and the specific ranking column that has the value. In Row 6, both rankings are given: 1-year is 16 and 5-year is 30. But since we're concerned with the lowest rank, only the 1-year ranking of 16 is directly related. However, the claim mentions \"the lowest rank show in either,\" so it's about checking if there exists a row where at least one of the rankings (1-year or 5-year) is 16 and that is indeed the lower of the two.\n\nTherefore, I should include both columns for Row 6 because both rankings are present. The 1-year ranking is 16, which meets the condition, but the 5-year ranking is higher, so it doesn't affect the lower value. But since the claim refers to \"the lowest rank shown in either,\" we need to consider that the 1-year ranking is 16, and that's why the row is relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: The claim is about whether there exists a row where either the 1-year or the 5-year ranking is 16, and it's the lowest of the two. So in Row 6, the 1-year ranking is 16, which is lower than the 5-year ranking of 30. Therefore, this row satisfies the condition because the 1-year ranking is 16, making the lowest rank 16.\n\nSo the relevant cells are both columns in Row 6: \"1 - year ranking of 727\" and \"5 - year ranking of 693.\" But since only the 1-year ranking is 16, that's what matters. However, to be thorough, I should include both because both rankings exist for each row.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since we're checking if either of them is 16 and it's the lowest, so the 1-year rank being 16 is sufficient. But in terms of which cells are relevant, both columns are needed to verify that the 1-year is 16 and the 5-year is higher. So perhaps only the 1-year column is necessary because we need a row where either ranking is 16 and it's the lowest.\n\nWait, no, to confirm that the 1-year rank is indeed 16, you need to check both columns. So in this case, both are relevant for Row 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the 1-year column is needed because it's the one that meets the condition. But I think in terms of verifying whether \"either\" can be 16 and is the lowest, we might need to confirm both. But actually, since the 5-year is higher, it doesn't matter; the 1-year is the relevant one here.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps include both columns for Row 6 because the claim refers to checking either column. So in this case, including both would be appropriate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 6 where the 1-year ranking is 16, which is the lowest rank in that row. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1 - year ranking of 727\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"5 - year ranking of 693\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

My task is to check how many of these schools have their location listed as \"Guelph.\" \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Name - Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute, Location - Guelph.

So four schools, not five.\n\nBut the claim says \"5 of the list school be locate in the guelph area.\" So it's claiming five. But according to the table, only four are located there. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount or miss any rows. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 1: Guelph (location) - count 1\nRow 2: Shelburne - no\nRow 3: Fergus - no\nRow 4: Guelph - count 2\nRow 5: Erin - no\nRow 6: Guelph - count 3\nRow 7: Guelph - count 4\nRow 8: Palmerston - no\nRow 9: Orangeville - no\nRow 10: Mount Forest - no\nRow 11: Orangeville - no\n\nYes, that's four schools in Guelph. So the claim is saying five, which is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five schools are located in the Guelph area. By examining each row, only four schools have their location as \"Guelph.\" Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 of the list school be locate in the erin area\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that there are two schools listed in the table that are located in the Erin area. So my task is to check each row of the table and see which ones have their 'location' column as \"Erin.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see it has 11 rows. Each row contains information about a school, including its name, location, enrollment, and two rankings. The columns involved in this check are the 'name' and 'location.' Specifically, for each row, I need to look at the 'location' field.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: location is \"Guelph\" \u2013 not Erin.\n2. Row 1: location is \"Shelburne\" \u2013 nope.\n3. Row 2: Fergus \u2013 no.\n4. Row 3: Guelph again \u2013 no.\n5. Row 4: Palmerston \u2013 nope.\n6. Row 5: Orangeville \u2013 not Erin.\n7. Row 6: Mount Forest \u2013 no.\n8. Row 7: Orangeville \u2013 still no.\n9. Row 8: Orangeville \u2013 no.\n10. Row 9: Well, row 10 is about \"Westside Secondary School\" in Orangeville \u2013 again, not Erin.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any rows. The table has rows from 0 to 10. So after checking all of them, only one school is located in the Erin area. Wait, no, looking back, I might have misread some rows. Let's check again more carefully:\n\nLooking at Row 5: name is \"Erin District High School,\" location is \"Erin.\" That's one.\n\nAre there any others? Let me scan through each row's 'location' field again.\n\nRow 0: Guelph\n1: Shelburne\n2: Fergus\n3: Guelph\n4: Palmerston\n5: Erin \u2013 yes, that's one.\n6: Guelph\n7: Palmerston\n8: Orangeville\n9: Mount Forest\n10: Orangeville\n\nSo only Row 5 is in Erin. Therefore, there's only one school from the list located in Erin. The claim says \"2 of the list school be locate in the erin area.\" Since there's only one, the claim is false.\n\nWait a minute, did I miss any? Let me double-check each row's location:\n\nRow 5: Erin \u2013 correct.\nAny others? No, all other locations are Guelph, Shelburne, Fergus, Palmerston, Orangeville, Mount Forest. None else is Erin.\n\nSo the claim is false because only one school is in Erin, not two.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"location\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"erin district high school have the lowest enrollment with 649\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It claims that Erin District High School has the lowest enrollment number, specifically 649 students.\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to find Erin District High School and then check its enrollment number. The table has rows numbered from 0 to 10 (since there are 11 rows). I should go one by one.\n\nRow 1: Name is Centennial Collegiate Vocational Institute, location Guelph. Enrollment is 1533.\nRow 2: Centre Dufferin District High School, Shelburne, enrollment 998.\nRow 3: Centre Wellington District High School, Fergus, enrollment 1459.\nRow 4: College Heights Secondary School, Guelph, enrollment 649.\nWait, here's a row where the name is College Heights Secondary School with enrollment 649. But the claim is about Erin District High School.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 5: Erin District High School, Erin, enrollment 616. So that's the one we're interested in. Its enrollment is 616.\nRow 6: Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute, Guelph, 1314.\nRow 7: John F Ross Collegiate Vocational Institute, Guelph, 1895.\nRow 8: Norwell District Secondary School, Palmerston, 795.\nRow 9: Orangeville District Secondary School, Orangeville, 1574.\nRow 10: Wellington Heights Secondary School, Mount Forest, 680.\nRow 11: Westside Secondary School, Orangeville, 996.\n\nSo, Erin District High School has an enrollment of 616. Now, I need to see if this is the lowest. Let me list all enrollments:\n\n1533, 998, 1459, 649, 616, 1314, 1895, 795, 1574, 680, 996.\n\nLooking for the smallest number here. The numbers go from 616, 649, etc., but I need to check if any are lower than 649.\n\nWait, in row 10, Wellington Heights has 680. So 616 is less than 649 and 680. Is there a smaller one? Let's see:\n\nRow 8: Norwell District Secondary School with 795.\nRow 4: College Heights Secondary School at 649.\nSo the lowest so far is 616 in Erin District High School.\n\nWait, but row 10 has 680 which is higher than 649. So the enrollments go down to 616. But let's confirm:\n\nIs there any row with enrollment less than 649? Looking through all the numbers:\n\n1533 (high), 998 (high), 1459 (high), 649, then 616, which is lower. So 616 is lower than 649.\n\nTherefore, Erin District High School has 616, and no other school in the table has lower enrollment than that? Wait, let me check all numbers again:\n\n1533, 998, 1459, 649, 616, 1314, 1895, 795, 1574, 680, 996.\n\nSo, the enrollments are:\n\n- College Heights: 649\n- Erin District: 616 (lower than 649)\n- Wellington Heights: 680\n\nSo yes, 616 is lower. But wait, row 10 is Wellington Heights with 680, which is higher than 649 and 616. So the lowest is indeed 616 by Erin.\n\nBut the claim says \"have the lowest enrollment with 649\". Wait, that's confusing. The claim seems to say two things: that Erin has the lowest enrollment (with 649), but in reality, Erin's enrollment is 616, not 649.\n\nWait a second, looking back at the table, I see row 4 is College Heights Secondary School with 649. So the claim is incorrect because it attributes the 649 enrollment to Erin District High School, which actually has 616. Therefore, the claim is false because Erin's enrollment isn't 649; it's lower than that.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"erin district high school have the lowest enrollment with 649\". So they're claiming two things: Erin has the lowest (which would be correct if they are the smallest) and that their enrollment is 649. But in reality, Erin has 616, which is lower than some others but not necessarily the absolute lowest? Wait, no, looking at all enrollments:\n\nThe table shows enrollments as follows:\n\n- College Heights: 649\n- Erin District: 616\n- Wellington Heights: 680\n\nSo 616 is the smallest. So Erin has the lowest enrollment with 616, not 649. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says Erin has 649 students, which is actually another school.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about Erin District High School having the lowest enrollment with 649 students is true, we need to check the actual enrollment numbers from the table. \n\n1. **Identify Erin District High School's row**: It appears in row 5 with an enrollment of 616.\n2. **Compare with other enrollments**: The lowest enrollment across all schools in the table is 616, held by Erin District High School.\n3. **Analyze the claim**: The claim incorrectly states that Erin's enrollment is 649. The actual number is lower.\n\nSince the claim misrepresents Erin's enrollment, it is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the lowest rank shown in either the 1 year or 5 year ranking be 30.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this means. So, looking at the table, there are several columns related to rankings. Each row represents a different school with details like name, location, enrollment, 1-year ranking (which seems to be a number out of 727), and 5-year ranking (also out of 693). \n\nThe claim is about finding the lowest rank in either the 1-year or 5-year rankings being 30. So I need to check all the 1-year and 5-year rankings in the table and see if any of them is exactly 30.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: name is \"centennial collegiate vocational institute\". The 1-year ranking is 63, and the 5-year ranking is 22. Neither of these is 30.\n\nRow 2: \"centre dufferin district high school\" has a 1-year ranking of 265 and 5-year ranking of 281. Still no 30s here.\n\nRow 3: \"centre wellington district high school\" with 1-year rank 330 and 5-year rank 246. No 30s.\n\nRow 4: \"college heights secondary school\". 1-year is 717, 5-year is 688. Nope.\n\nRow 5: \"erin district high school\" has 1-year ranking of 197 and 5-year of 148. Not 30.\n\nRow 6: \"guelph collegiate vocational institute\". Here, the 1-year ranking is 16 and 5-year is 30. Oh, wait! The 5-year ranking here is exactly 30. So that's one instance where either the 1 or 5-year ranking is 30.\n\nContinuing to check other rows in case there are more instances of 30.\n\nRow 7: \"john f ross collegiate vocational institute\" has 1-year rank 181 and 5-year 165. Not 30.\n\nRow 8: \"norwell district secondary school\". 1-year is 126, 5-year is 343. No 30s here.\n\nRow 9: \"orangeville district secondary school\" with 1-year rank 181 and 5-year 194. Still no.\n\nRow 10: \"wellington heights secondary school\" has 1-year rank 371 and 5-year 426. Nope.\n\nRow 11: \"westside secondary school\". 1-year is 478, 5-year is 343. Not relevant.\n\nSo in the entire table, only Row 6 has a 5-year ranking of exactly 30. That means there's at least one instance where either the 1-year or 5-year rank is 30. Therefore, the claim holds true because it's stating that the lowest rank (in this case, the 5-year rank) in either category is 30.\n\nWait a second\u2014does \"lowest rank\" imply that 30 is indeed the lowest? Or does it just say that there exists a rank of 30? The wording says \"the lowest rank show in either the 1 year or 5 year ranking be 30.\" So it's about whether any row has either 1-year or 5-year rank equal to 30, regardless of being the absolute lowest.\n\nIn Row 6, the 5-year rank is 30. So yes, that satisfies the condition. There might be other lower ranks (like in 5-year rankings, the lowest would be around 426?), but the claim isn't about the absolute lowest; it's just saying that in either ranking, there exists a row where that specific rank (30) appears.\n\nSo I think the claim is true because at least one school has either a 1 or 5-year rank of 30. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"5 - year ranking of 693\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
