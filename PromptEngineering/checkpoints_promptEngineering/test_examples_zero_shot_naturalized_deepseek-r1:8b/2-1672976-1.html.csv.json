For Virginia Tech (Row 14), their wins are 3.\n\nTo check how many more games Maryland has won, I subtract Virginia Tech's wins from Maryland's: 10 - 3 = 7.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be over 15 institution that play in the big ten challenge\" is true or false based on the given table. First, let me understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions \"over 15 institutions playing in the Big Ten Challenge.\" The term \"Big Ten Challenge\" isn't explicitly defined here, but I think it's a competition among a group of universities. In the context of college sports, this might refer to a specific conference or tournament. Since most of the rows in the table have institutions from various conferences like ACC, SEC, Big 10, etc., I need to see if there are more than 15 institutions listed that participate in this challenge.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with details about their performance. The last row is labeled \"overall\" and seems to summarize all the data. It has total wins:82, losses:61, home wins:46, etc., but it doesn't specify which challenge or tournament these totals are from.\n\nSince the claim refers to the Big Ten Challenge, I need to find if the institutions that play in this challenge are more than 15. Each institution's row includes details about their performance, including home and away wins/losses, but again, without context on what each category means, it's tricky. However, given that there are 16 rows in total (from Row1 to Row16), including the \"overall\" row, I need to count how many institutions play in the Big Ten Challenge.\n\nWait, the table lists various universities like Boston College, Clemson Tigers, Duke Blue Devils, Florida State Seminoles, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Maryland Terrapins, Miami Hurricanes, North Carolina Tar Heels, NC State Wolfpack, Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Pitt Panthers, Syracuse Orange, Virginia Cavaliers, Virginia Tech Hokies, Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and then the overall row.\n\nSo, excluding the \"overall\" row, there are 15 institutions listed. Now, the claim is about over 15, which would mean at least 16. But in the table, it seems only 15 institutions are listed before the summary. Therefore, if the Big Ten Challenge includes all these 15 plus maybe more not listed here, but since the table doesn't show more than 15 non-overall rows, it's unlikely there are over 15.\n\nWait, actually, let me count again. From Row1 to Row16: Rows 1-15 are individual institutions, and Row16 is overall. So 15 institutions before the summary. The claim says \"over 15,\" meaning 16 or more. If only 15 play in the Big Ten Challenge, then it's not over 15, so the claim would be false.\n\nBut I need to check if any of these 15 are part of the Big Ten Challenge. Since the table doesn't specify which challenge each row is referring to, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe \"Big Ten Challenge\" refers to a specific set of games or tournaments, and the claim is about how many institutions participate in that particular challenge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of participants is being referred to as over 15, but based on the data given, only 15 are listed before the overall row. Therefore, unless there's more than 15, which isn't shown here, the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"there be over 15 institution that play in the big ten challenge\" is true or false, we analyze the table provided.\n\nThe table lists 15 institutions (from Row1 to Row15) along with their respective performance data. The last row (Row16) provides an overall summary of these statistics but doesn't specify which challenge they refer to. \n\nSince only 15 institutions are explicitly listed before the \"overall\" row, it's not possible for there to be over 15 institutions participating in the Big Ten Challenge based on the information given.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 2 institution who have color in their name in the big ten challenge\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that there are two institutions whose names include a color and they are part of the Big Ten Challenge. So, my task is to check the table for any such institutions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with various statistics like wins, losses, home wins, etc., but the key here is their names. I need to see if any of the institution names contain a color.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Boston College Eagles - The word \"Eagles\" doesn't include a color per se; it's more of an animal than a color.\nRow 2: Clemson Tigers - \"Tigers\" is an animal, not a color.\nRow 3: Duke Blue Devils - \"Blue\" is a color! So this one counts. That's one institution so far.\nRow 4: Florida State Seminoles - \"Seminoles\" is related to a type of grass but isn't a color.\nRow 5: Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets - \"Yellow\" is definitely a color. That's the second institution.\nRow 6: Maryland Terrapins - \"Terrapins\" is an animal, not a color.\nRow 7: Miami Hurricanes - \"Hurricanes\" is a natural phenomenon but not necessarily a color.\nRow 8: North Carolina Tar Heels - \"Tar\" could be considered a color (like tar black), so this might count. But wait, the claim specifies two institutions, and we've already found Duke Blue Devils and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, which are clearly colored names.\nRow 9: NC State Wolfpack - \"Wolfpack\" is an animal term.\nRow 10-12: Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Pitt Panthers, Syracuse Orange - None of these have colors in their names; they're more about animals or religious terms.\nRow 13: Virginia Cavaliers - \"Cavaliers\" is related to cavalry, not a color.\nRow 14: Virginia Tech Hokies - \"Hokies\" is a term for a specific breed of dog, I believe.\nRow 15: Wake Forest Demon Deacons - \"Demon\" isn't a color; it's more of a title.\nRow 16: Overall stats - Not relevant to individual institution names.\n\nSo from the list above, Duke Blue Devils and Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets have colors in their names. That makes two institutions. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking back at the table structure, each row has columns like institution, wins, loss, etc. So for each of these two institutions (Row 3 and Row 5), the column we care about is \"institution\". So their row indices are 3 and 5.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"institution\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"institution\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 3 team in the big ten challenge that do not have any win.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"three teams\" in the \"Big Ten Challenge\" that don't have any wins. Looking at the table, it's structured with multiple rows, each representing a different institution and their performance in various categories like home wins, away wins, neutral wins, etc.\n\nI need to check if there are three teams where all win columns (home, away, neutral) are zero. That would mean they have no wins at all in any category.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Boston College Eagles. Wins total is 6. So even if their home, away, or neutral wins were zero, since overall they have 6, the claim wouldn't apply here. But wait, the total includes all categories, so maybe their home wins are 3 and away 3, but I need to see if any of them don't have any in each category.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about not having any wins at all, so any win across home, away, or neutral would disqualify the team from being counted. So for a team to qualify, all their wins in home, away, and neutral must be zero.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Wins=6, which are broken down into home (3), away (3). So they have wins, so no.\nRow 2: Clemson Tigers, wins=9. They have all categories.\nRow 3: Duke Blue Devils, wins=12. All categories.\nRow 4: Florida State Seminoles, wins=6. They have some wins.\nRow 5: Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, wins=4. Some wins.\nRow 6: Maryland Terrapins, wins=10. Some wins.\nRow 7: Miami Hurricanes, wins=2. So they have some wins.\nRow 8: North Carolina Tar Heels, wins=7. They have some.\nRow 9: NC State Wolfpack, wins=5. Some wins.\nRow 10: Notre Dame Fighting Irish, wins=0. Wait, but the total is zero. But let's check each category. Home wins=0, away=0, neutral=0. So all are zero. This team would fit the claim.\n\nBut I thought the claim said three teams. Let me continue checking to see if there are two more.\n\nRow 11: Pitt Panthers, wins=0. Similarly, their home, away, and neutral wins are all zero.\nRow 12: Syracuse Orange, wins=0. Same here; all categories zero.\nRow 13: Virginia Cavaliers, wins=8. Some wins.\nRow 14: Virginia Tech Hokies, wins=3. Some wins.\nRow 15: Wake Forest Demon Deacons, wins=10. They have some.\nRow 16: Overall stats, but that's the aggregate.\n\nSo from rows 10, 11, and 12, Notre Dame, Pitt Panthers, and Syracuse Orange all have zero wins in all categories (home, away, neutral). That makes three teams.\n\nWait, does the claim specify \"in the big ten challenge\"? I need to check if these teams are part of the Big Ten. The user mentioned \"Big Ten Challenge,\" which is a specific event or competition, so I might need to verify if these institutions are part of the Big Ten conferences. \n\nLooking at the institution names:\n\n- Boston College: Not in Big Ten.\n- Clemson: ACC, not Big Ten.\n- Duke: ACC.\n- Florida State: SEC (though now they're moving to Big 12, but as per current), so FSU is SEC.\n- Georgia Tech: ACC.\n- Maryland: Currently in the Big Ten as of 2023? Wait, no, Maryland left the ACC for the Big Ten. So yes, they are part of the Big Ten now.\n\nWait, let me correct:\n\nBoston College - ACC\nClemson - ACC\nDuke - ACC\nFlorida State - SEC (though moving to Big 12)\nGeorgia Tech - ACC\nMaryland - BIG TEN\nMiami - ACC\nNorth Carolina - ACC\nNC State - ACC\nNotre Dame - Independent\nPittsburgh - BIG TEN\nSyracuse -Independent, but part of the Big Ten in some sports.\nVirginia - SEC\nVirginia Tech - SEC\n\nSo in the Big Ten Conference as of now (2023), the members include:\n\n- Illinois\n- Indiana\n- Iowa\n- Maryland\n- Michigan\n- Michigan State\n- Minnesota\n- Nebraska\n- Northwestern\n- Ohio State\n- Penn State\n- Purdue\n- Rutgers\n- Wisconsin\n\nWait, so among these rows 10 to 15, only Pitt Panthers (Row 11) and Syracuse Orange (Row 12) are in the Big Ten. Notre Dame is an independent but sometimes plays in the Big Ten's Notre Dame Stadium for football. So if the Big Ten Challenge refers to specific teams in that conference, maybe only Pitt and Syracuse fit. But wait, Row 10 is Notre Dame, which isn't a Big Ten member, unless it's considering them as part of the challenge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Big Ten Challenge includes non-conference teams as well. For example, Notre Dame might be invited to participate in some events or challenges within the Big Ten framework.\n\nIf that's the case, then the three teams with zero wins across all categories would be Notre Dame (Row 10), Pitt (11), and Syracuse (12). That makes three teams.\n\nBut I need to ensure that they are indeed part of the Big Ten Challenge. If the challenge includes only Big Ten schools, then maybe only Pitt and Syracuse qualify, making it two teams. But if non-Big Ten teams are invited, then Notre Dame could be included as well.\n\nSince the user didn't specify, but the claim says \"in the big ten challenge,\" I might need to assume that the challenge includes these three: Notre Dame, Pitt, Syracuse. Alternatively, perhaps only Pitt and Syracuse are part of the Big Ten Challenge. \n\nWait, looking at the data again:\n\nRow 10: Notre Dame Fighting Irish - wins=0\nRow 11: Pitt Panthers - wins=0\nRow 12: Syracuse Orange - wins=0\n\nSo three teams with zero wins in all categories.\n\nIf the Big Ten Challenge includes these three, then the claim is TRUE because there are three teams (Notre Dame, Pitt, Syracuse) who have no wins in any category within the challenge. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about their conference affiliations in this context. If the challenge only includes Big Ten schools, then only Pitt and Syracuse would fit. But if it's a broader challenge that includes non-Big Ten teams like Notre Dame, then three teams qualify.\n\nSince the problem statement says \"in the big ten challenge,\" I might need to consider whether these three are part of it. Without more info, perhaps I should assume that all three are included because the user didn't specify otherwise.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be rows 10,11,12 for wins being zero.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are three teams in the Big Ten Challenge (Notre Dame, Pitt Panthers, and Syracuse Orange) who have no wins across any category. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim states: \"The north carolina tar hill be the only team in the big ten challenge whose win and loss be the same.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant row for North Carolina Tar Heels in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 8 is for North Carolina Tar Heels. Let me double-check that\u2014yes, institution: north carolina tar heels is indeed Row 8.\n\nNext, I need to look at their wins and loss columns. From Row 8, under \"wins\" it's 7 and \"loss\" is also 7. So their win-loss record is equal, 7-7.\n\nNow, the claim says they are \"the only team in the big ten challenge whose win and loss be the same.\" I need to verify if this is true by checking all other teams in the Big Ten Challenge to see if any have matching wins and losses.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each institution:\n\n- Boston College Eagles (Row 1): wins=6, loss=1 \u2192 not equal\n- Clemson Tigers (Row 2): wins=9, loss=5 \u2192 not equal\n- Duke Blue Devils (Row3): 12-2 \u2192 no\n- Florida State Seminoles (Row4): 6-8 \u2192 no\n- Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (Row5): 4-9 \u2192 no\n- Maryland Terrapins (Row6):10-4\u2192no\n- Miami Hurricanes (Row7):2-4\u2192no\n- North Carolina Tar Heels (Row8):7-7\u2192yes, we've already noted this\n- NC State Wolfpack (Row9):5-8\u2192no\n- Notre Dame Fighting Irish (Row10 to 12): all zeros\u21920-0, but are they in the Big Ten Challenge? Wait, the overall row (Row16) shows totals, but each team's stats are their own. So, from the given data, it seems each of the first 15 rows is a specific team, and Row16 is the aggregate.\n\nWait, the claim says \"in the big ten challenge.\" The term \"Big Ten Challenge\" might be a conference or event, but in this context, looking at the table, all teams listed are part of the same dataset. So I need to check if any other team besides North Carolina Tar Heels has wins equal to losses.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Pitt Panthers (Row11): 0-0\u2192they have equal wins and losses\n- Syracuse Orange (Row12):0-0\u2192also equal\n- Virginia Cavaliers (Row13):8-5\u2192no\n- Virginia Tech Hokies (Row14):3-5\u2192no\n- Wake Forest Demon Deacons (Row15):10-3\u2192no\n\nSo, both Pitt Panthers and Syracuse Orange have 0 wins and 0 losses. That means there are other teams besides North Carolina Tar Heels with equal wins and losses.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the only team in the big ten challenge.\" So if there's more than one team with equal wins and losses, then the claim is FALSE because it's not the only one.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim that the North Carolina Tar Heels are the sole team in the Big Ten Challenge with equal wins and losses, we first check their record: 7 wins and 7 losses. Next, we review all other teams in the challenge to find any others with equal wins and losses.\n\n- **North Carolina Tar Heels (Row 8)**: Wins=7, Losses=7 \u2192 Equal.\n- **Pitt Panthers (Row 11)**: Wins=0, Losses=0 \u2192 Equal.\n- **Syracuse Orange (Row 12)**: Wins=0, Losses=0 \u2192 Equal.\n\nSince both Pitt and Syracuse also have equal wins and losses, the North Carolina Tar Heels are not unique in this aspect within the challenge. \n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because there are multiple teams with matching win-loss records.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are exactly 10 institutions playing in the Big Ten Challenge. So my task is to check if the table supports this statement accurately.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an institution with various statistics like wins, losses, home and away performances, etc. The last row (Row 16) has a \"Overall\" category which might summarize the total performance across all institutions.\n\nI need to focus on the number of institutions that are part of the Big Ten Challenge. From my knowledge, the Big Ten Conference typically includes teams from universities like Michigan, Ohio State, Indiana, etc. However, the table doesn't specify which conferences these institutions belong to. That's a bit confusing because some might be in the ACC or SEC, for example.\n\nThe claim is about the number of institutions playing in the Big Ten Challenge, not their performance. So I should look for any mention of the Big Ten Challenge in the columns. Scanning through each row's column names: wins, loss, home wins, etc., none of them are \"Big Ten Challenge\" or anything similar.\n\nSince there's no explicit information about which institutions participate in the Big Ten Challenge within the table, I can't directly verify if there are 10 from this data alone. However, the last row (Overall) shows total wins as 82 and losses as 61, but that doesn't relate to the number of institutions.\n\nWait, maybe the \"neutral wins\" column for each school could indicate games played at neutral venues. But I don't think that's directly related to conference membership or participation in a specific challenge like the Big Ten Challenge.\n\nWithout any data pointing to the Big Ten Challenge participation count, I can't confirm whether there are exactly 10 institutions involved. The claim might be based on general knowledge outside of this table, but since the task is to evaluate based solely on the given data, and that data doesn't mention the Big Ten Challenge, the statement can't be fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because the table doesn't provide information to confirm that exactly 10 institutions play in the Big Ten Challenge.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The name suggests it's called the Big Ten, implying there are ten teams involved. The claim says eight of these ten have no win, meaning they lost all their games. But looking at the table, I need to see if any row has zero total wins.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Boston College Eagles - wins:6\n- Row 2: Clemson Tigers - wins:9\n- Row 3: Duke Blue Devils - wins:12\n- Row 4: Florida State Seminoles - wins:6\n- Row 5: Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets - wins:4\n- Row 6: Maryland Terrapins - wins:10\n- Row 7: Miami Hurricanes - wins:2\n- Row 8: North Carolina Tar Heels - wins:7\n- Row 9: NC State Wolfpack - wins:5\n- Row 10: Notre Dame Fighting Irish - wins:0\n- Row 11: Pitt Panthers - wins:0\n- Row 12: Syracuse Orange - wins:0\n- Row 13: Virginia Cavaliers - wins:8\n- Row 14: Virginia Tech Hokies - wins:3\n- Row 15: Wake Forest Demon Deacons - wins:10\n- Row 16: Overall - wins:82\n\nWait, the last row is the overall, so I need to look at rows 1 through 15 for individual team data. Now, looking for teams with zero total wins.\n\nRows 10, 11, and 12 have wins:0. That's three teams. The claim says eight teams, so this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"Big Ten Challenge.\" Perhaps it refers to a subset of the table or specific conference members. However, based on the data provided, only three teams have zero total wins. Therefore, the claim that there are eight such teams is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we check for eight teams with zero total wins in the provided table.\n\nThe relevant rows and columns to verify this are:\n\n- **Row 10**: Total wins: 0\n- **Row 11**: Total wins: 0\n- **Row 12**: Total wins: 0\n\nOnly three teams have zero wins, not eight. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 2 institution who have vegetable in their name in the big ten challenge.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's about finding two institutions within the Big Ten Challenge whose names contain the word \"vegetable\" or parts of it.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with various statistics. The relevant columns for checking the name would be \"institution\". So I need to examine each institution's name to see if any include a vegetable-related term.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Boston College Eagles \u2013 Doesn't have \"vegetable\" in the name.\n2. Clemson Tigers \u2013 No.\n3. Duke Blue Devils \u2013 No.\n4. Florida State Seminoles \u2013 The word \"Seminoles\" doesn't relate to vegetables.\n5. Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets \u2013 No.\n6. Maryland Terrapins \u2013 No.\n7. Miami Hurricanes \u2013 No.\n8. North Carolina Tar Heels \u2013 No.\n9. NC State Wolfpack \u2013 No.\n10. Notre Dame Fighting Irish \u2013 No.\n11. Pitt Panthers \u2013 No.\n12. Syracuse Orange \u2013 No.\n13. Virginia Cavaliers \u2013 No.\n14. Virginia Tech Hokies \u2013 No.\n15. Wake Forest Demon Deacons \u2013 The word \"Deacons\" doesn't have a vegetable connection.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check again. Maybe \"Seminoles\" refers to something else, but it's derived from the Seminole tribe and doesn't relate to vegetables. The same goes for all the other names; none seem to include words like \"lettuce,\" \"carrot,\" or similar.\n\nSo after reviewing each institution's name, I don't find any that have \"vegetable\" in their name. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because there aren't two institutions with vegetable in their names as stated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    ...\n    // Include all rows to check each institution's name for \"vegetable\"\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, none of the institutions have \"vegetable\" in their names. Therefore:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"institution\"},\n    ...\n    // Include all rows to check each institution's name for \"vegetable\"\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be 4 teams in the Big Ten Challenge whose win and loss be the same.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. It seems like the claim is saying that there are four teams (from the Big Ten Challenge) where their total wins equal their total losses. So, for each team, wins = losses.\n\nLooking at the table, it has 16 rows: rows 1 to 15 represent individual institutions with their respective win-loss records, and row 16 is an \"overall\" total.\n\nI need to check if any four teams have their total wins equal to their total losses. \n\nSo for each team from row 1 to 15, I'll calculate (total_wins - total_losses). If this difference is zero, that means the team's wins and losses are the same.\n\nLet me go through each team:\n\nRow 1: Boston College Eagles\nTotal Wins: 6\nTotal Losses: 1\n6 \u2260 1 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 2: Clemson Tigers\n9 vs 5 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 3: Duke Blue Devils\n12 vs 2 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 4: Florida State Seminoles\n6 vs 8 \u2192 Not equal (actually, 6 < 8)\n\nRow 5: Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets\n4 vs 9 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 6: Maryland Terrapins\n10 vs 4 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 7: Miami Hurricanes\n2 vs 4 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 8: North Carolina Tar Heels\n7 vs 7 \u2192 Equal! So, one team meets the condition.\n\nRow 9: NC State Wolfpack\n5 vs 8 \u2192 Not equal\n\nRow 10: Notre Dame Fighting Irish\n0 vs 0 \u2192 Equal! Second team.\n\nRow 11: Pitt Panthers\n0 vs 0 \u2192 Equal! Third team.\n\nRow 12: Syracuse Orange\n0 vs 0 \u2192 Equal! Fourth team.\n\nWait, so rows 10, 11, and 12 all have zero wins and losses. That's three teams where wins equal losses. But the claim says four teams. Did I miss a fourth?\n\nLooking back at row 8: North Carolina Tar Heels have 7 wins and 7 losses \u2192 Equal as well.\n\nSo rows 8,10,11,12 \u2192 Four teams with equal wins and losses.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 8: 7-7 \u2192 Equal\nRow 10: 0-0\nRow 11: 0-0\nRow 12: 0-0\n\nThat's four teams where wins = losses.
