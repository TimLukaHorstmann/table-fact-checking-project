    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a baseball team's game on June 9 is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"on june 9 , the record be 28 - 29 with a loss of mulholland (5 - 6) and an opponent of the yankee.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table. The table has 26 rows, each representing a game on specific dates in June.\n\nLooking at the date first: June 9. I'll scan through the table to find the row with date June 9. Scrolling down... Row 7 is June 9. So that's the relevant row.\n\nNow, let's check each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Record**: The claim states the record is 28 - 29. In the table, row 7 shows the record as 28 - 29 after the game on June 9. That matches.\n\n2. **Loss**: The loss is attributed to Mulholland with a score of 5 - 6. In row 7, under \"loss\" it says mulholland (5 - 6). So that's correct too.\n\n3. **Opponent**: The claim says the opponent is the Yankees. Looking at row 7, the opponent is listed as yankees. That matches as well.\n\nPutting it all together: All elements of the claim are supported by row 7 of the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about June 9th aligns with the information in row 7 of the table. The record, loss, and opponent details match the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
