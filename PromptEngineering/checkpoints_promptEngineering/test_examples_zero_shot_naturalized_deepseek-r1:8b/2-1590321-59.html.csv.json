    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"active from 1947 - 1964 , titus ozon score 157 goal.\" So, there are two main parts here. One part talks about the years of activity (1947-1964) and the other mentions Titus Ozon scoring 157 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows for different individuals, each having attributes like rank, name, years active, matches, and goals. The last row in the table is Row 10, which corresponds to Titus Ozon. \n\nIn Row 10, we see that his years of activity are from 1947 to 1964. That directly matches the first part of the claim about him being active during those years. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that he scored 157 goals. In Row 10, under 'goals', it's stated as 157. So this also aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table data for Titus Ozon, the entire claim seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 10 of the table, which provides the relevant information about Titus Ozon's active years and goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"during the year of 1950 through 1965 , the goal score be less than 160.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and see if any player's goals are less than 160 during those years. The relevant column here is \"goals.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Dudu Georgescu from 1970-1986, goals 252. Not relevant because the time period doesn't overlap with 1950-1965.\n\nRow 2: Ionel Danciulescu from 1993-present, goals 210. Also not relevant as his years start in 1993.\n\nRow 3: Rodion Camataru, 1974-1989, goals 198. His period is after 1965, so not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Marin Radu, same time as Row 3, goals 190. Again, post-1965, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 5: Ion Oblemenco, 1964-1976. His years include 1964 and go up to 1976. Wait, the claim is from 1950 through 1965. So in 1964 and 1965, his goals were 170. Hmm, but 170 is less than 160? No, 170 is more than 160. So he doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 6: Florea Dumitrache, 1966-1983. His years start in 1966, which overlaps with 1965 only if considering 1965 as part of the range. But his goals are also 170, same as Row 5, which is more than 160.\n\nRow 7: Mircea Sandu, 1970-1987, goals 167. Again, post-1965, so not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Victor Piturca, 1975-1989, goals 166. Same time frame, doesn't apply.\n\nRow 9: Mihai Adam, 1962-1976. His years include up to 1976 but start in 1962. In 1962 and 1963, 1964, 1965: his goals are 160. Wait, the claim is that the goal score was less than 160. But Mihai Adam's goals are exactly 160. So that's not less than 160; it's equal to. So he doesn't meet the condition either.\n\nRow 10: Titus Ozon, 1947-1964. His years end in 1964, which is within the claim period of up to 1965. His goals are 157, which is less than 160. Ah, this seems relevant.\n\nWait, but let me check all rows again to see if there's any player with goals below 160 during that time. So, only Row 10 has goals below 160 (157). But does he play in 1950-1965? His years are up to 1964, so yes. However, the claim says \"during the year of 1950 through 1965,\" which might include all players active during those years.\n\nBut each player's data is about their career, so if a player started before 1965 and ended after 1965, their entire period isn't within the claim's timeframe. For example, Ion Oblemenco started in 1964, so he was active during part of 1965 but not all of it? Wait, no, the claim is from 1950 through 1965, so any player who was active at any point during those years would be considered.\n\nWait, but each row gives a player's entire career. So for example, Mihai Adam started in 1962 and ended in 1976. He was active during 1962-1965, which is within the claim period. His goals were 160, which is equal to 160, not less than.\n\nSo only Titus Ozon had goals below 160 (157). But does that mean the claim is FALSE because at least one player had goals above or equal, and another had below? Wait, no, the claim says \"the goal score be less than 160.\" It doesn't specify all players. So if at least one player's goals during that period were less than 160, it might support the claim.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the claim again: \"during the year of 1950 through 1965 , the goal score be less than 160.\" It seems to suggest that during those years, the goals (probably per player) were less than 160. But does it mean for all players? Or any player?\n\nLooking at the table, we have Titus Ozon with 157 in 1947-1964, so during 1950-1965, he scored 157. That's below 160. So there exists a player who met the condition.\n\nBut wait, other players like Ion Oblemenco had 170 in 1964-1976. But he was active in 1964 and 1965. His goals were higher than 160. Similarly, Florea Dumitrache had 170 in 1966-1983, so maybe in 1965? Wait, his years started in 1966, so perhaps not in 1965.\n\nBut the claim is about the year of 1950 through 1965. So any player active during those years who scored less than 160 would support it. Since Titus Ozon did that (157), then the claim's statement isn't entirely true because at least one player didn't meet the goal score.\n\nWait, no. The claim is saying \"during the year of 1950 through 1965 , the goal score be less than 160.\" So does it mean all players during those years had goals less than 160? Or that during those years, some players scored less?\n\nI think it's the latter. If any player had a goal score less than 160 during those years, then the statement is partially true. But since the claim is phrased as \"the goal score be less than 160,\" without specifying all or any, but given that one player did have goals below 160 (157), it might support the claim.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the claim is asserting that for all players active during 1950-1965, their goal scores were below 160. In that case, since some had higher goals (like 170, 167, etc.), the statement would be FALSE because not all did.\n\nBut the way the claim is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says \"the goal score be less than 160\" during those years. It could mean that overall, the goals were below 160, which isn't accurate since some players scored higher. Alternatively, it might mean for any player, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the exact wording: \"You are tasked to determine whether there was a time when, during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score was less than 160.\" So perhaps it's about any individual's goals being below 160 during that period. Since Titus Ozon scored 157, which is below, then yes, such a time existed.\n\nBut in that case, the claim isn't necessarily wrong because at least one player met the condition. However, if the claim meant that all players had goals below 160, then it's incorrect.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but since the task is to determine whether there was a time when during 1950-1965, the goal score was less than 160, and considering \"the goal score\" as any player's score, I think it's TRUE because Titus Ozon had goals below 160. So the answer would be that such a time existed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all players:\n\n- Mihai Adam: 160 (exactly 160)\n- Titus Ozon: 157 (below 160)\n- Others have higher scores or equal to or above 160.\n\nSo yes, at least one player had goals below 160 during that period. Therefore, the claim is not entirely incorrect because a player did meet the condition. But perhaps the wording suggests that all players scored below 160, in which case it's FALSE.\n\nI think I need to be precise. Let me re-examine the original question: \"You are tasked to determine whether there was a time when, during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score was less than 160.\"\n\nSo it's about any player scoring less than 160 at some point between 1950 and 1965. So yes, Titus Ozon did that.\n\nTherefore, such a time existed, making the statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during the years 1950 through 1965, there was a time when the goal score was less than 160. By examining the provided data:\n\n- **Titus Ozon** had a goal score of 157 during his career, which spans from 1947 to 1964. This means he scored below 160 during the years 1950 through 1965.\n\nSince there exists at least one player who met this condition, the claim is considered TRUE.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE because Titus Ozon's goal score of 157 during 1950-1965 was less than 160.",
