    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check if the claim about Kaharoa School is correct. The claim says it's a coed school with a decile of 9. Let me start by looking through each relevant cell in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll search for \"Kaharoa School\" in the table. Scanning through, I see that on row 7, the name is \"Kaharoa School.\" So that's definitely the right row to check.\n\nNow, let's look at the columns for this row. The first thing to check is whether it's coed. Looking at the 'Gender' column, it says \"Co-ed,\" which means both boys and girls attend, so the school is indeed coed. That part checks out.\n\nNext, the decile is given as 9 in the claim. In the table, under the 'Decile' column for row 7, the value is 9. So that's correct too.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information or other entries that would contradict these points. Both conditions stated in the claim are fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check two specific columns for \"Kaharoa School.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:** Locate \"Kaharoa School\" in the table, which is found on row 7.\n\n2. **Check Coed Status:** Examine the 'Gender' column for row 7. It states \"Co-ed,\" confirming that the school is indeed coed.\n\n3. **Verify Decile Level:** Check the 'Decile' column for row 7, which shows a value of 9, matching the claim's decile level.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Gender\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Decile\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the Lynmore Primary School has a coed student body\" is true based on the provided table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the claim itself: it mentions that Lynmore Primary School is a coed school. So, I'm looking for information about whether the student body is composed of both boys and girls.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different school. I need to find the row where the school name is \"Lynmore Primary School\". Let's scan through the list:\n\nRow 1: Lynmore Primary School\n\nYes, that's the one. Now, for this school, I need to check which columns are relevant. The columns provided in the table include several aspects like \"Name\", \"Address\", \"Phone\", \"Fax\", \"Email\", and \"Website\". But since the claim is about the student body being coed, the relevant information would likely be under \"Gender\" or something similar.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial problem statement, I realize that in the table provided by the user, there isn't a column explicitly labeled like \"Gender\" or \"Student Body\". The columns listed are \"row_index\", and then the data seems to start with \"Name\", but it's unclear. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the user hasn't provided any actual table data in the query beyond the headers. They just provided a list of school names under each row from 1 to 47. So, for example, Row 1 is \"Lynmore Primary School\", and so on.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify: the user has a table with columns like Name, Address, Phone, etc., but in their problem description, they listed all school names in order from row 1 to row 47. So each row's name is the school's name.\n\nGiven that, for Lynmore Primary School (row 1), I need to check if there's a column related to gender or student body composition.\n\nLooking at the columns provided by the user: they mentioned \"Name\", \"Address\", \"Phone\", \"Fax\", \"Email\", and \"Website\". But in the problem statement, the user didn't include any actual data beyond the school names. So perhaps each row only has a single cell with the school name, which is the value under the \"Name\" column.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the user's initial instruction said to consider each cell as per the columns listed, which include Name, Address, etc., but in their example JSON, they refer to \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the claim is about the student body being coed. So, we need to verify if Lynmore Primary School has a coed student body.\n\nIn the table provided by the user, each school's details are listed in columns like Name, Address, Phone, etc., but since the user only listed the names of the schools from row 1 to 47, it's possible that the relevant column for gender is not explicitly present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Gender\" information is part of another column. Wait, looking at the problem statement again, the columns are Name, Address, Phone, Fax, Email, and Website. So, none of these directly relate to student body composition.\n\nTherefore, if there's no explicit information about gender or coed status for Lynmore Primary School in any of these columns, we can't confirm that it's a coed school based on the table.\n\nWait, but perhaps the \"Gender\" is part of another column. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. If each row has multiple cells (columns), but since the user hasn't provided the actual data beyond the names, perhaps the only information we have for each school is their name and possibly other details in columns like Address, Phone, etc.\n\nBut since the claim is about being coed, which relates to student body composition, we would need a column that indicates whether it's a coed school. If such a column doesn't exist, or if there's no data indicating that it's coed, then the claim may be false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the table provided by the user, each row has a single cell with the name, and nothing else. That would mean we have no information about gender or student body composition for any school.\n\nIn that case, since there's no data to support that Lynmore Primary School is coed, the claim would be false. However, without explicit information, it's impossible to verify.\n\nWait, but in the example provided by the user, they referred to columns like \"Revenue\" and \"Employees\". So perhaps each row has multiple cells corresponding to these columns. If that's the case, then for Lynmore Primary School, we'd look at all relevant columns. But since I don't have the actual data, I can only infer.\n\nSo, given that the claim is about being coed, and assuming there's no column explicitly stating this, or if such a column doesn't exist, then we can't confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the table, one of the columns like \"Description\" might indicate whether it's a coed school. But without knowing what each column corresponds to, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the \"Name\" column is sufficient, and if the name indicates it's a primary school, that could imply it's coed. However, not all primary schools are necessarily coed; some may be single-sex. So just being a primary school doesn't confirm it's coed.\n\nTherefore, without specific information about the gender composition of the student body in the table, we can't verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"the Lynmore Primary School has a coed student body\" cannot be verified based on the provided information. The table does not contain explicit details regarding the gender composition or student body status of the school. Therefore, there is insufficient data to confirm whether the school is coed.\n\nAnswer: The information provided does not specify that Lynmore Primary School has a coed student body, so the claim cannot be confirmed.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the lynmore primary school take coed student in year 1 - 8\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim and seeing which parts need to be verified.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"lynmore primary school,\" so I'll look for that name in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see row 36 is named \"sunset primary school\" and row 37 onwards are different names, but wait, let me check again. Hmm, actually, looking closer, row 34 is \"st mary 's catholic school,\" row 35 is \"st michael 's catholic school,\" and then row 33 is \"selwyn school.\" Wait, no lynmore primary school there.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each row carefully. Row 1: \"Rotorua Intermediate,\" row 2: \"Rotorua Lakes High School,\" up to row 34: \"st mary 's catholic school.\" Hmm, I don't see a \"lynmore primary school\" in the list provided.\n\nNow, perhaps it's a typo or a different name. Maybe \"Lynmore Primary School\" is referred to as something else in the table. Let me check again. The closest match might be row 34: \"st mary 's catholic school,\" but that's not the same as Lynmore Primary. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing it because of formatting issues.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"take coed student.\" So, I need to verify if Lynmore Primary School accepts coed students across years 1-8. If the table doesn't mention this school, then the claim might be false.\n\nAdditionally, the instruction says to check each condition against the table. Since the school's name isn't in the table, that already makes the claim suspect. Also, without information about the student intake, I can't confirm if they take coed students in those years.\n\nTherefore, since \"lynmore primary school\" isn't listed and there's no data on coed students in years 1-8 for any similar entry, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim made about Kaharoa School is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"the Kaharoa School has a decile of 9 and coed students serve the Roturua district in years 7-13.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Decile refers to a ranking system where schools are categorized into deciles based on their academic performance. A decile of 9 would mean the school is among the top-performing ones.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll start by searching for \"Kaharoa School.\" Scanning through each row, I find that Kaharoa School is listed in row 7 with details: coed student, district as Roturua, and years 1-8. Wait, but the claim mentions years 7-13. That doesn't match up because the table shows only up to year 8 for Kaharoa.\n\nNext, checking the decile column for that specific row (row 7), I see that the decile is listed as 10. The claim says 9, so there's a discrepancy here. Decile 10 isn't 9, which means this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, regarding the coed students and Roturua district, from the table, Kaharoa School does have coed students serving in the Roturua district. However, their academic years only go up to 8. The claim says they serve from year 7-13, which isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, even though part of the claim is correct regarding coed students and location, the decile and the range of years are incorrect. Therefore, the entire claim can't be fully supported as true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Decile\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Years\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
