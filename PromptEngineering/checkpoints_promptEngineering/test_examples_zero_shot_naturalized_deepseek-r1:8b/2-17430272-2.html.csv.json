The claim is: \"in the match against valentijn overeem , the method use to win be submission via achilles lock.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any matches where the opponent is Valentijn Overeem.\n\nLooking at Row 8: res: win, record: 4 - 1, opponent: valentijn overeem, method: submission (achilles lock), event: rings russia : russia vs the world, round: 1, location: ekaterinburg , russia. This row shows a win against Overeem with the method being a submission via Achilles lock.\n\nSo, there's at least one match where he used that method against Overeem. I don't see any other rows where the opponent is Overeem, so this seems to be the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the table confirms that in their match, Overeem was defeated via a submission using the Achilles lock.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 8 of the table, which shows a win against Valentijn Overeem using a submission via Achilles lock.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"moscow , russia be the location of the match that result in a win by tko.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's specifically looking for matches where the location is Moscow, Russia and the result was a win via TKO (Technical Knockout). \n\nNow, I need to go through each row of the table and check two things: whether the location is Moscow, Russia, and whether the method of victory was TKO.\n\nLet me start by identifying all rows that have \"moscow , russia\" as the location. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 4: location: moscow, russia\n- Row 7: location: ekaterinburg, russia (not Moscow)\n- Row 8: location: ekaterinburg, russia (same as above)\n- Row 9: location: moscow, russia\n- Row 12: location: moscow, russia\n\nWait, no. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 1: saitama, japan \u2013 not Moscow.\nRow 2: lithuania \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: moscow, russia \u2013 yes.\nRow 4: moscow, russia \u2013 yes.\nRow 5: yaroslavl, russia \u2013 no.\nRow 6: tokyo, japan \u2013 no.\nRow 7: ekaterinburg, russia \u2013 no.\nRow 8: ekaterinburg, russia \u2013 same as above.\nRow 9: moscow, russia \u2013 yes.\nRow 10: tokyo, japan \u2013 no.\nRow 11: russia \u2013 but the location is just \"russia,\" not specifying Moscow. So maybe not?\nRow 12: moscow, russia \u2013 yes.\n\nSo rows 3,4,9,12 have \"moscow, russia\" as their locations.\n\nNow, for each of these rows, I need to check if the result was a win by TKO (Technical Knockout). \n\nLooking at the method column:\n\nRow 3: method: decision \u2013 not TKO.\nRow 4: method: tko \u2013 yes. So this row matches both location and method.\nRow 9: method: submission (armbar) \u2013 no.\nRow 12: method: submission (strikes) \u2013 no.\n\nSo only Row 4 meets both criteria: the location is Moscow, Russia and the method was TKO.\n\nNow, does the claim state that \"moscow , russia be the location of the match that result in a win by tko\"? It says \"the location\" which might imply one specific location. Since there's at least one row (Row 4) where this is true, the claim is supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the event bar - moscow v st petersburg last 2 round\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and which parts of the table are relevant.\n\nThe claim mentions an event named \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\" and refers to the \"last 2 rounds\". So, I should look for rows in the table where the 'event' column matches this description and check the 'round' number specified.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: event: pride 21\nRow 2: event: rings lithuania : bushido rings 3\nRow 3: event: bars - bars\nRow 4: event: bar - moscow vs st petersburg\nRow 5: event: iafc - pankration russian championship 2001\nRow 6: event: rings : king of kings 2000 block a\nRow 7: event: rings : russia vs georgia\nRow 8: event: rings russia : russia vs the world\nRow 9: event: iafc - pankration world championship 2000\nRow 10: event: rings : king of kings 1999 block a\nRow 11: event: iafc - pankration russian championship 1999\nRow 12: event: iafc - pankration european championship 1998\n\nThe only row that matches the event description is Row 4: \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\". Now, checking the 'round' column for this row. It's listed as round 2.\n\nThe claim refers to the \"last 2 rounds\", which I assume means the two most recent or latest rounds. Since only one row matches the event description, and it's in round 2, there isn't enough information to confirm a pattern of the last two rounds. There might be only one relevant round here, so it doesn't necessarily cover both required rounds.\n\nAlso, checking if any other rows could be related, but none match the specific event name. Therefore, there isn't sufficient data to support that this particular event's last two rounds are as described.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table for the specified event and round information. The claim mentions \"bar - moscow vs st petersburg\" in the last 2 rounds. Only one row matches the event description (Row 4) with a round number of 2, insufficient to confirm two relevant rounds.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the round in which be the match bar - moscow v st petersburg be in the 3.\" Hmm, let me parse this.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions a match between \"bar\" and \"moscow vs st petersburg.\" Wait, that seems off because looking at the table, I don't see any entries for \"bar\" as an opponent. The opponents listed are things like gary goodridge, mindaugas kulikauskas, and others, but not \"bar - moscow v st petersburg.\"\n\nWait, maybe \"bar\" is a typo or misrepresentation? Let me look through the table again to see if there's any match involving Moscow vs St Petersburg. Scanning each row:\n\nRow 4: res: win, record: 6 - 3, opponent: stanislav nuschik, method: tko, event: bars - moscow vs st petersburg, round: 2, location: moscow, russia.\n\nOh, here it is! So the event for Row 4 is \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg.\" That must be what the claim is referring to. The claim mentions \"bar - moscow v st petersburg,\" but in the table, it's written as \"bars - moscow vs st petersburg.\" Maybe that's a typo or different phrasing.\n\nNow, the claim says the round is 3 for this match. Let me check Row 4: round is 2. So if the claim states the round is 3, but in reality it's 2, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each relevant row. The only match involving Moscow vs St Petersburg is in Row 4 with a round of 2. There are no other matches with that event or opponents mentioned in the table beyond that one.\n\nSo the claim says the round is 3, but according to the table, it's actually 2.

So the opponent here is valentijn overeem, but the method used was a submission (achilles lock), not an armbar.\n\nI'll keep checking other rows to make sure there's no match where he used an armbar against overeem. Rows 1 through 12 don't show any other matches with his name and armbar method. \n\nSince Row 8 uses a different submission method, the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to verify if there's a match where \"valentijn overeem\" was the opponent and the method used was \"submission (armbar)\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- **Row 8** mentions valentijn overeem as the opponent, but the method used was \"submission (achilles lock)\", not an armbar.\n\nSince there's no match where both conditions are met, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the match when the record be 2 - 1 end with the method of tko via a kick.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's talking about a specific fight where the fighter's record was 2-1 and the method of victory was a TKO (Technical Knockout) via a kick.\n\nNow, I'll look at each row in the table to see if any match this description.\n\nStarting with Row 0: The result is a loss, so it doesn't fit. \n\nRow 1: It's a win with a record of 7-4. Doesn't apply.\n\nRow 2: Another loss, not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Loss again, moving on.\n\nRow 4: Win, but the method is TKO, and the opponent is different. Let me check that more closely. The event is bars - Moscow vs St Petersburg, round 2, location Moscow. So it's a win via TKO, but since the record here is 6-3, not 2-1, this isn't the match we're looking for.\n\nRow 5: Loss with record 5-3. Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Loss again, so skip.\n\nRow 7: Win, method is submission (Achilles lock), record 5-1. Not matching the claim.\n\nRow 8: Another win via submission, not relevant.\n\nRow 9: Win via submission (armbar), record 3-1. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 10: Loss with record 2-1. Hmm, so this row shows a loss when the fighter had a 2-1 record. So it's a loss, which doesn't match the claim of a win.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading something. The claim says \"the match when the record be 2 - 1 end with the method of tko via a kick.\" So we're looking for a fighter who had a 2-1 record and won using a TKO via a kick.\n\nContinuing through the rows:\n\nRow 11: Win, opponent Zabir elbiev, method is TKO (cut). Record is 2-0. Wait, that's interesting. So this row shows a win with a 2-0 record, not 2-1. But it's a TKO via a kick, which might be relevant. Let me check the exact wording of the claim again: \"the match when the record be 2 - 1 end with the method of tko via a kick.\" So it's looking for a 2-1 record and a TKO via a kick.\n\nRow 12: Win with 1-0 record, not relevant.\n\nSo where is the row with a 2-1 win and TKO via a kick?\n\nWait, maybe I missed Row 10. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 10: res: loss, record: 2 - 1, opponent: Lee Hasdell, method: tko (kick), event: rings : king of kings 1999 block a, round: 2, location: tokyo , japan.\n\nThis is a loss with a 2-1 record. So it's not a win. Therefore, this row doesn't help the claim because the result is a loss.\n\nLooking again at Row 11: res: win, record: 2 - 0, method: tko (cut), opponent Zabir elbiev. So the fighter had a 2-0 record when he won via TKO (cut). This isn't 2-1, so it doesn't match.\n\nSo in the table provided, there's no fight where the fighter had a 2-1 record and ended with a TKO via a kick as a win. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific match where the fighter's record was 2-1 and they won via a TKO (Technical Knockout) caused by a kick. Upon reviewing each row of the table, none of the wins match this criterion exactly. The closest related entry is Row 11, which shows a win but with a 2-0 record rather than 2-1.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The claim involves two specific columns - 'res' (result) and 'method'. However, since the 'record' mentioned in the claim isn't directly listed as a column, it's inferred from the 'res' field or other text.\n\n2. **Check Each Row**:\n   - **Row 10**: Loss with record 2-1. Not a win.\n   - **Row 11**: Win with method TKO (cut) and record 2-0. Close but doesn't match 2-1.\n   \n3. **Conclusion**: No row meets both conditions of the claim, making it FALSE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"the round do the match go to when tko ( kick) be 1\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim. It seems like it's saying that a fight goes into round 1 when the method of victory is TKO via a kick. So, we're looking for matches where the result was a TKO due to a kick, and the round number is 1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: res (result), record (win/loss), opponent, method, event, round, location. I need to check each row to see if it meets both conditions: res is win, method is Tko (kick), and round is 1.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: res is loss, so no.\nRow 2: res is win, method is decision, not Tko. No.\nRow 3: res is loss. No.\nRow 4: res is win, method is tko. The event mentions bars - moscow vs st petersburg, round 2. So round 2, not 1. Doesn't fit.\nRow 5: res is loss. No.\nRow 6: res is loss. No.\nRow 7: res is win, method is submission (achilles lock). Not Tko(kick). No.\nRow 8: res is win, method is submission (achilles lock). Same as above. No.\nRow 9: res is win, method is submission (armbar). No.\nRow 10: res is loss. No.\nRow 11: res is win, method is tko (cut). So Tko(kick) and round 1. This fits the claim!\nRow 12: res is win, but opponent's name doesn't matter; however, method is submission via strikes, not Tko.\n\nWait, so only row 11 meets both conditions: result is win, method is tko (kick), and round is 1.\n\nNow, checking if all parts of the claim are satisfied. The claim says \"the round do the match go to when tko ( kick) be 1\". So yes, in that case, the match went to round 1 via a TKO kick.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's at least one instance where the fight ended in round 1 with a Tko(kick). The relevant cells are row 11, columns: res (win), method (tko), and round (1).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other rows. Scanning again:\n\n- Rows with tko and win: only rows 4, 11.\n- Of those, only row 11 has round 1.\n\nSo yes, only row 11 is relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by one instance in the table where a fight ended in round 1 via TKO(kick).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"in ekaterinburg , russia , the match be keep when the result be a win and they use the tko method\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about matches in Ekaterinburg, Russia where the result was a win, and the method used was TKO (Technical Knockout). So I need to check if there are any such matches in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location. The location column is where each match took place. The 'res' column tells the result\u2014win or loss. The 'method' column indicates how the match was decided, like TKO or Decision.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match in Ekaterinburg (location: Ekaterinburg, Russia) resulted in a win with the method being TKO.\n\nStarting from Row 1: location is Saitama, Japan. Not Ekaterinburg.\nRow 2: Lithuania. No.\nRow 3: Moscow, Russia. Not the location we're looking for.\nRow 4: Moscow again. No.\nRow 5: Yaroslavl, Russia. Nope.\nRow 6: Tokyo, Japan. No.\nRow 7: Ekaterinburg, Russia. The result is win, method is submission (achilles lock). So this one doesn't use TKO.\nRow 8: Also Ekaterinburg. Result is win, method is submission again. Not TKO.\nRow 9: Moscow. No.\nRow 10: Tokyo. No.\nRow 11: Russia location. Win via Tko (cut). But the event is in Russia, not Ekaterinburg. So the location isn't matching.\nRow 12: Moscow. No.\n\nWait, Row 7 and Row 8 are in Ekaterinburg but use submission methods. Row 11's TKO is in Russia, not Ekaterinburg. So none of the matches in Ekaterinburg have a result of win with TKO method.
