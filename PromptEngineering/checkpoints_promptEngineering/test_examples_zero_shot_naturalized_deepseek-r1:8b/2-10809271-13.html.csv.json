    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Prince Park be home to the Carlton team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Prince Park is the home venue for the Carlton team.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are six rows, each representing a different game. Each row has information about the home team, their score, the away team, their score, the venue, the crowd size, and the date.\n\nI need to find out which row corresponds to Carlton as the home team and then check where that game was played. \n\nLooking at Row 3: The home team is Carlton, with a score of 13.12 (90). The venue for this game is Princes Park. Wait, the claim mentions Prince Park, but in the table, it's Princes Park. That might be a spelling difference\u2014Prince vs. Princes. I need to check if that's significant.\n\nWait, maybe there's a typo in the claim or the table. Let me double-check the venues. Row 3: venue is Princes Park. So, according to the table, Carlton played at Princes Park, not Prince Park.\n\nSo the claim says \"Prince Park,\" but the actual venue was \"Princes Park.\" That would mean the claim is incorrect. However, I should consider if \"Prince Park\" and \"Princes Park\" are the same or different venues. In some contexts, they might be considered the same due to possible variations in naming over time or regions.\n\nBut in this specific table, it's Princes Park. So if the claim refers to Prince Park, that's a mismatch. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the correct venue for Carlton was Princes Park, not Prince Park.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states \"Prince Park\" as Carlton's home venue, while the table lists \"Princes Park.\" Since these are different venues, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
