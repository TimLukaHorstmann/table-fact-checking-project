    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the european championship have an extra 400 m hurdle.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. \"Extra\" here might refer to an event or a specific competition within the European Championships that includes the 400m Hurdles. So I need to check if any row in the table lists 400m Hurdles as the extra event.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: European Junior Championships, Duisburg, W. Germany, 1st, Extra: 4x400 m relay.\nSo here, the extra is 4x400m relay, not 400m Hurdles.\n\nRow 2: European Indoor Championships, Katowice, Poland, 1st, Extra: 800m. No mention of hurdles here.\n\nRow 3: Olympic Games, Montreal, Canada, 4th, Extra: 800m. Again, no hurdle event.\n\nRow 4: European Championships, Prague, Czechoslovakia, 6th, Extra: 800m. Still no hurdles.\n\nRow 5: European Championships, Prague, Czechoslovakia, 6th, Extra: 400m Hurdles. Ah, here we go. This row has the extra as 400m Hurdles.\n\nRow 6: European Indoor Championships, Vienna, Austria, 2nd, Extra: 800m. No hurdles here either.\n\nSo only Row 5 lists the 400m Hurdles as the extra event in the European Championships. Since this supports the claim that there's an extra 400m Hurdles at the European Championships, the claim is true.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. The claim is about whether the European Championship has an extra 400m Hurdle. From the table, the relevant row is Row 5 because it specifically mentions this event. The columns we need are 'tournament' and 'extra', as these directly address what the claim is about.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- Row 5, column 'tournament' (European Championships)\n- Row 5, column 'extra' (400m Hurdles)\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant_cells pointing to those specific columns in Row 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"extra\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the result of 1973 be 1st\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and understand its structure. The table has six rows, each corresponding to a different year from 1973 to 1979. Each row contains information about the tournament, venue, result, and an extra. The claim is specifically about the result in 1973 being 1st.\n\nSo, my first action should be to identify which row corresponds to the year 1973. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: year: 1973\nRow 2: year: 1975\nRow 3: year: 1976\nRow 4: year: 1978\nRow 5: year: 1978 (duplicate with row 4)\nRow 6: year: 1979\n\nSo, Row 1 is the one for 1973. Now, I need to look at the \"result\" column for this row. According to the table, Row 1 has a result of \"1st\".\n\nNext, the claim states that \"the result of 1973 be 1st\". Since Row 1 (1973) indeed shows a result of \"1st\", it seems like the claim is correct at first glance.\n\nBut I should also consider if there's any other relevant information in the table that might affect this conclusion. Looking through the other rows, they correspond to different years and don't impact the 1973 result directly. The claim isn't about another year or event, so those can be ignored for this specific check.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other details. For example, are there multiple entries for 1973 in the table? No, only Row 1 is for 1973. So, there's no conflicting information from another row for the same year.\n\nAlso, checking the \"extra\" column might provide additional context, but since the claim is about the result, which is a separate column, it doesn't affect the outcome here. The extra details are about the specific event (like 4x400 m relay), but the result is clearly stated as \"1st\".\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim that the result of 1973 was 1st is supported by the data in Row 1 of the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

Each row has the year, tournament, venue, result, and extra event. The claim is specifically about 1979, so I should focus on the rows where the year is 1979.\n\nRow 6 is the only one with a year of 1979. It says: tournament: european indoor championships, venue: vienna, austria, result: 2nd, extra: 800 m. So, the tournament is European Indoor Championships, which matches part of the claim. The extra event is indeed 800 m, and the result is 2nd.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the tournament of european indoor championship play where the extra be 800 m...\" I think it's a slight wording difference but essentially means the same thing. So all elements in Row 6 match the claim: year 1979, European Indoor Championships, Vienna, Austria, result 2nd, and extra 800m.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by this row. No other rows for 1979 exist in the table, so it's only relevant to check Row 6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"extra\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down what the claim says and then cross-reference it with the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"in 1979 be the year of the tournament play call the european indor champion where the team finish 2nd with an extra of 800 m.\" Hmm, there are a few things here I need to parse. Let me try to rephrase it for clarity. It seems like they're saying that in 1979, there was a European Indoor Championship where the team finished second, and their extra event was the 800m.\n\nLooking at the table now, which has six rows each representing different events over the years from 1973 to 1979. The columns are year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. I need to check if any row matches the criteria specified in the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: 1973, European Junior Championships, Duisburg, W. Germany, 1st, 4x400 m relay. Doesn't match because the year is 1973 and result is 1st, not 2nd, and it's a junior event.\n\nRow 2: 1975, European Indoor Championships, Katowice, Poland, 1st, 800m. Year doesn't match (1979), and result is 1st.\n\nRow 3: 1976, Olympic Games, Montreal, Canada, 4th, 800m. Not 1979.\n\nRow 4: 1978, European Championships, Prague, Czechoslovakia, 6th, 800m. Also not 1979.\n\nRow 5: Same year as row 4, same venue and result is 6th for 400 m hurdles. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: 1979, European Indoor Championships, Vienna, Austria, 2nd, 800m. Oh, this looks promising! The year is 1979, the tournament is European Indoor Championships, the result is 2nd, and the extra event is 800m. That's exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check the wording of the claim again to make sure I didn't misread anything. It says \"the year of the tournament play call the european indor champion.\" Hmm, maybe that part is a bit confusing, but looking at row 6, it's definitely about the European Indoor Championships in 1979.\n\nSo, yes, row 6 directly supports the claim. The team finished 2nd with an extra of 800m in 1979 for the European Indoor Championships.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"extra\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see if it's relevant to the claim. The claim mentions \"second place\" and relates specifically to the \"european junior championships,\" so I should focus on rows that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: European Junior Championships in 1973, but it doesn't mention second place.\nRow 2: European Indoor Championships in 1975. The result is 1st, not second.\nRow 3: Olympic Games in 1976, result is 4th.\nRow 4 and 5: European Championships in 1978, both are 6th.\nRow 6: European Indoor Championships in 1979, result is 2nd.\n\nNow, the claim says that the european junior championship comes in second place since 1975. The only row related to \"european junior championships\" is Row 1 (1973), which doesn't show a second-place finish. \n\nThe other relevant rows are for European Indoor Championships and Olympic Games, but they don't match the criteria either.

From the table, there is no such row. The closest is Row 6 in 1979, which is about European Indoor Championships, not Juniors, and it's Austria, so probably different event.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table after 1975.

The claim given is: \"french championship have an extra of 400 m hurdle.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The key parts are \"french championship\" and \"extra of 400 m hurdle.\" So, I need to check if in the table there's a row that mentions French Championships, or something related, and whether it has an extra for the 400m hurdles.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has information about year, tournament, venue, result, and extra. The tournaments listed are European junior championships, European indoor championships, Olympic games, European championships, and another European indoor championships. I notice that none of these directly mention \"French championship\" or anything similar to it.\n\nSo, the first part of the claim is about French Championships, but in the table, there's no tournament named like that. Therefore, even before checking the extra, the base of the claim isn't supported by any row in the table. \n\nBut just for thoroughness, I should check if any row has \"400 m hurdle\" as the extra, regardless of the tournament name. Scanning through each row: Row 1 mentions 4x400 m relay, which is a different event. Rows 2 and 6 mention 800 m. Row 5 mentions 400 m hurdles specifically.

Row 1 is for 1973. The details are:\n- Year: 1973\n- Tournament: European junior championships\n- Venue: Duisburg, West Germany\n- Result: 1st\n- Extra: 4x400 m relay\n\nSo, in this row, the result was 1st.

The extra info is 800m. Result was 1st. So this seems close. But wait, the claim mentions \"before 1979,\" and 1975 is before 1979. However, the result here is 1st, not 2nd. So it partially matches but doesn't fully support the claim.\n\nRow 3: Year 1976, Olympic Games, Montreal, Canada. Extra info is 800m, result was 4th. Not matching because it's an Olympic event, and the result is 4th, not 2nd.\n\nRow 4: Year 1978, European Championships, Prague, Czechoslovakia. Extra is 800m, but result is 6th. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: Same year as Row 4, same venue, extra info is 400m hurdles. So no relevance here.\n\nRow 6: Year 1979, European Indoor Championships, Vienna, Austria. Extra is 800m, result was 2nd. Wait, but the claim says \"before 1979,\" so this row's year is 1979, which isn't before. So it doesn't apply.\n\nWait, but let me double-check Row 6.
