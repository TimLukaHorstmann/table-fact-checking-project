Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the total attendance on may 28 be 17132.\" So the user is asserting that on May 28th, the attendance was 17,132 people. My task is to verify if this matches what's in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nEach row represents a date, with several attributes: visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. The rows are numbered from 0 to 5 (since there are six rows).\n\nThe claim specifically mentions May 28th. So I need to find the corresponding row in the table where the date is May 28.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n- Row 1: May 24\n- Row 2: May 26\n- Row 3: May 28\n- Row 4: May 31\n- Row 5: June 2\n- Row 6: June 4\n\nSo, row 3 is May 28. That's the relevant row.\n\nNow, I need to check what the attendance was on that day. In row 3, the \"attendance\" column has a value of 17,132. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the attendance on May 28 was indeed 17,132, making the claim TRUE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cell is in row 3 and the column \"attendance\". So the relevant_cells list will include an object with row_index 3 (since rows start at 0) and the column name \"attendance\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the total attendance on May 28 was 17,132, I checked the table for the corresponding date. The third row (row index 2 if counting from 1) corresponds to May 28 with an attendance of 17,132.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** Look through each row's date until finding May 28 in row 3 (index 2).\n2. **Check Attendance Value:** The attendance for this row is 17,132.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since the claim matches the table data, the answer is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the attendance on May 28 be lower than the attendance on May 31\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the attendance for May 28 was lower (i.e., a smaller number) than the attendance for May 31. So, I need to find out how many people attended each of these games and compare them.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows with dates ranging from May 24 to June 4. Each row has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. Since the claim is about attendance on specific dates, I should focus on the \"attendance\" column for those dates.\n\nThe relevant dates mentioned in the claim are May 28 and May 31. So, I need to look at each of these dates in the table to find their respective attendances.\n\nStarting with May 28: Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 3 corresponds to May 28. The visitor is Detroit, home is Pittsburgh, and the attendance is 17132.\n\nNext, May 31: Looking for May 31, I find that's Row 4. Visitor is Detroit again, home is Pittsburgh, and the attendance here is also 17132.\n\nWait a minute, both attendances are the same\u201417,132. So if both days had the same number of attendees, then May 28 was not lower than May 31; it was equal. That means the claim that \"attendance on May 28 be lower\" is actually false because they're the same.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Row 3: May 28, attendance 17132. Row 4: May 31, attendance 17132. Yes, exactly the same number.\n\nSo the claim is saying that one was lower than the other when in fact they were equal. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the highest attendance for a match with a score of 0 - 4 be 20066\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific things: the attendance being the highest and the score being 0-4. So I need to find all the matches where the score was 0-4 and then check if the highest attendance among those is exactly 20066.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a different match. Each row has several pieces of information: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and series. I'm specifically interested in matches where the home team or the visitor has a score of 0-4. Wait, no\u2014actually, since it's a match between two teams, one will have the higher score. So when the claim says \"score of 0 - 4\", that likely refers to either the home or the visitor having scored 0-4. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: date May 24, visitor Pittsburgh, score 0-4, home Detroit.\nHere, the visitor's score is 0-4. So this match has a score of 0-4.\n\nRow 2: May 26, visitor Pittsburgh, score 0-3. Visitor's score is lower, but not 0-4, so doesn't qualify.\n\nRow 3: May 28, visitor Detroit, score 2-3. Visitor's score isn't 0-4.\n\nRow 4: May 31, visitor Detroit, score 2-1. Not 0-4.\n\nRow 5: June 2, visitor Pittsburgh, score 4-3. Visitor's score is 4-3; home would be Detroit with 3-4? Wait no, the score is listed as 4-3 for visitor Pittsburgh and home Detroit, so the home team's score is 3. So the match has a score of 4-3.\n\nRow 6: June 4, visitor Detroit, score 3-2. Visitor's score is 3, home's is 2; not 0-4.\n\nWait, no\u2014row 5: the score is 4-3 for visitor Pittsburgh at home in Detroit. So the home team (Detroit) scored 3, and the visitor scored 4. So the overall score of the match is 4-3, which isn't 0-4. \n\nSo, only Row 1 has a score of 0-4 (visitor: Pittsburgh). The attendance for that row is 20066.\n\nLooking at other rows to see if any have a higher attendance when the score is 0-4. Since only Row 1 meets the score condition, there are no others. Therefore, 20066 is the highest attendance for matches with a score of 0-4.\n\nSo the claim should be TRUE because it correctly states that the highest attendance in such matches is 20066.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim made about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"the total lowest attendance with a score of 4 - 2 be higher than 20066.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key parts are \"total lowest attendance\" and \"with a score of 4-2,\" then comparing it to 20066.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows with dates from May 24 to June 4. Each row has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, series. The score seems to represent the home team's points minus the visitor's points. So for example, in Row 1, the score is 0-4, which probably means the home team scored 0 and the visitor scored 4.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"score of 4 - 2.\" Wait, that doesn't seem to match any score in the table because all scores are either something like 0-4, 0-3, 2-3, etc. So maybe I'm misunderstanding it. Could it be a typo or perhaps the direction is reversed? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, the score in Row 6 is 3-2, so that's home team scored 3, visitor scored 2. But the claim says \"4 - 2,\" which would mean home scored 4 and visitor scored 2. Is there a row where the score is exactly 4-2? Let me scan through all the rows.\n\nLooking again: Row 1: 0-4; Row 2: 0-3; Row 3: 2-3; Row 4: 2-1; Row 5: 4-3; Row 6: 3-2. So, no row has a score of exactly 4-2. The closest is Row 5 with 4-3 and Row 6 with 3-2. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is referring to a series score? Because each row also has a \"series\" column. Let me check that. For example, in Row 1, the series is 1-0; Row 2: 2-0; Row 3: 2-1; Row 4: 3-1; Row 5: 3-2; Row 6: 4-2. Oh, okay, so each row has a series score as well.\n\nSo the claim might be referring to when the home team's series score is 4-2. Let me see if such a series exists. Looking at the last few rows, Row 5: series 3-2, Row 6: series 4-2. So yes, in Row 6, the series is 4-2.\n\nSo now, I need to check two things for this row: what's the attendance and whether it's higher than 20066.\n\nLooking at Row 6: date june 4, visitor detroit, score 3-2 (so home team pittsburgh scored 3, detroit scored 2), series 4-2, attendance 17132. So the attendance here is 17,132.\n\nThe claim says that the total lowest attendance with a score of 4-2 is higher than 20066. Wait, but in Row 6, the attendance is 17,132 which is less than 20,066. So if we're looking for the lowest attendance when the series is at 4-2, then 17,132 would be that lowest figure.\n\nBut wait, does the term \"total lowest\" mean something else? Maybe it's a misinterpretation. Perhaps it refers to the minimum attendance across all games where the series was 4-2. But in this table, there's only one game with a series of 4-2 (Row 6). So if that's the only one, then the lowest attendance for that is 17,132.\n\nSo the claim says that this lowest attendance is higher than 20,066, but 17,132 is less than 20,066. Therefore, the claim is false because the attendance is lower than what's stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"total lowest attendance.\" Maybe it refers to adding up all attendances where the series was 4-2. But in this case, only one game, so total would still be 17,132. Either way, both interpretations lead me to the conclusion that the attendance is lower than 20066.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim's assertion is incorrect because the actual attendance for the series score of 4-2 is 17,132, which is less than 20,066.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance with a series score of 4-2 is higher than 20066. However, in Row 6, the only occurrence of a series score of 4-2 has an attendance of 17132, which is lower than 20066. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
