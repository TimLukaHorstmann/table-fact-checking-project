    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim states: \"On Sunday, September 30, the Chicago Bear beat the Green Bay Packer 31 - 20.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table are relevant. Since the date given is September 30, I need to look at rows that have dates around that time in September. Scanning through the table, I see that Row 3 has a date of Sunday, September 30, 1951. That's close but not exactly September 30, 1959 or any other year mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, the last row is Row 20: November 8, 1959, which is after September 30. So maybe I made a mistake there. Let me go back to the table and focus on the date September 30. The only row that matches this date exactly is Row 3 in 1951. But the claim mentions Chicago Bears beating Green Bay Packers on that date with a score of 31-20.\n\nLooking at Row 3, it's from 1951 and shows the Chicago Bears winning with 31-20 against Green Bay Packers in Green Bay. So, this row seems to support the claim, right? But wait, the claim is about Sunday, September 30, which matches exactly with Row 3's date.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because sometimes dates might be similar but different years can throw me off. The claim doesn't specify the year, but the table shows that in 1951, there was indeed a game on September 30 where Chicago won 31-20. So, the claim is referring to that exact game.\n\nWait, no. Wait another second. Let me check all rows again because sometimes multiple games can have similar dates but different years or winners. For example, Row 3 is September 30, 1951, with Chicago winning. Are there any other rows around September 30 in other years? Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 15: September 29, 1957 (Green Bay win)\n- Row 17: September 28, 1958 (Chicago win)\n- Row 19: September 27, 1959 (Green Bay win)\n\nSo, no other games on September 30 in different years. Therefore, the only relevant row is Row 3.\n\nWait again, the claim doesn't specify the year, but the table has a game on that date in 1951. So, the claim's date and score match that exact game. Therefore, it should be TRUE, supported by Row 3.\n\nBut let me double-check: The claim says \"Chicago Bear beat Green Bay Packer 31-20\" on September 30. In the table, Row 3 has exactly that result on that date in 1951. So yes, it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from Row 3 of the table, which matches the date, winner, and score described.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the chicago bear be the loser against the green bay packer more than 10 times.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that the Chicago Bears lost to the Green Bay Packers more than 10 times. So, I need to count how many times the Bears were the losers in games against the Packers.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 20 rows, each representing a game between these two teams. Each row has details like year, date, winner, result, loser, attendance, and location.\n\nI'll go through each row and see who won and lost. Whenever Chicago Bears (Bears) are the losers, I'll note it down as a Green Bay Packers win.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Winner is Green Bay Packers, so Bears lose \u2013 that's one.\nRow 2: Bears win, so Packers lose \u2013 not counting.\nRow3: Bears win again, Packers lose.\nRow4: Bears win, Packers lose.\nRow5: Bears win, Packers lose.\nRow6: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 that's two.\nRow7: Bears win.\nRow8: Bears win.\nRow9: Bears win.\nRow10: Bears win.\nRow11: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 three.\nRow12: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 four.\nRow13: Bears win.\nRow14: Bears win.\nRow15: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 five.\nRow16: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 six.\nRow17: Bears win.\nRow18: Bears win.\nRow19: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 seven.\nRow20: Packers win, Bears lose \u2013 eight.\n\nWait, that's only 8 times where the Bears lost. So the claim says more than 10 times. That would be false then because it's only 8.\n\nBut let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss any. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nRow1: Packers win \u2013 count 1\nRow2: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow3: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow4: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow5: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow6: Packers win \u2013 count 2\nRow7: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow8: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow9: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow10: Bears win \u2013 no\nRow11: Packers win \u2013 count3\nRow12: Packers win \u2013 count4\nRow15: Packers win \u2013 count5\nRow16: Packers win \u2013 count6\nRow19: Packers win \u2013 count7\nRow20: Packers win \u2013 count8\n\nYep, only 8 times. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe Chicago Bears lost to the Green Bay Packers a total of 8 times based on the table provided, which is less than 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
