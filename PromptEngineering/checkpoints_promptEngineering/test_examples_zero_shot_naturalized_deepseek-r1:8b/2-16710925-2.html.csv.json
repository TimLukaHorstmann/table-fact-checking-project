The claim says: \"On September 26, 1971, the attendance at the game was 57,895 crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which row in the table corresponds to September 26, 1971. Looking at Row 2, week: 2, date: September 26, 1971. That's the one we need.\n\nNow, from Row 2, the relevant information is the attendance, which is listed as 57,895. So that matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to September 26, 1971, with an attendance figure matching Row 2's attendance of 57895.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"week 14 be on september 26 , 1971 and the attendance be 57895.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at what week 14's details are in the table. Let me scan through each row to find where week 14 is. \n\nLooking at Row 1: week 1, date September 19, etc.\nRow 2: week 2, September 26... Hmm, that's the second week on September 26, but wait, the claim mentions week 14 on September 26. So I need to find a row where the week is 14 and the date is September 26.\n\nContinuing down:\n- Week 3: October 3\n- Week 4: October 10\n- Week 5: October 17\n- Week 6: October 24\n- Week 7: October 31\n- Week 8: November 7\n- Week 9: November 14\n- Week 10: November 22\n- Week 11: November 28\n- Week 12: December 5\n- Week 13: December 12\n- Week 14: December 19\n\nWait, so in the table, week 14 is on December 19, not September 26. That means the claim's first part is incorrect because it says week 14 is on September 26. \n\nNow, for attendance, I need to check what the attendance was for week 14. From the table, week 14 has an attendance of 75954. The claim states that the attendance should be 57895. \n\nSince both parts of the claim are incorrect (week 14 is on December 19 and not September 26, and the attendance is 75954 instead of 57895), the overall claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly specifies the week number and attendance for a particular game. Week 14 occurs on December 19, not September 26, and its attendance was 75,954, not 57,895.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
