    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tom watson win in year 1977 and 1981\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate Tom Watson in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see Tom Watson listed in Row 6. His details are: player: tom watson, country: united states, year(s) won: 1977 , 1981, total: 154, to par: +10.\n\nNow, the claim says he won in 1977 and 1981. Looking at his years won, it's exactly those two years: 1977 and 1981. There are no other years mentioned for Tom Watson in this table.\n\nSo, all the information provided in the claim is directly supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells would be the ones showing his years of victory.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Tom Watson indeed won in both 1977 and 1981 as per the table. The relevant cells are Row 6's \"year(s) won\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"tom watson win in 1977 and in 1981.\" So, I should check if Tom Watson won in both those years according to the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table for the player named Tom Watson. Scanning the rows:\n\nRow 6: player: tom watson, country: united states, year (s) won: 1977 , 1981, total: 154, to par: + 10.\n\nSo, in this row, Tom Watson's years won are listed as 1977 and 1981. That matches the claim exactly. There's no conflicting information elsewhere because the other rows don't mention Tom Watson again. \n\nTherefore, all relevant cells are found by checking each row for \"tom watson.\" Only Row 6 is relevant. The columns we need to check are \"year (s) won\" because that's where the years are listed.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include the row index of Row 6 and the column name \"year (s) won.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Tom Watson did win in both 1977 and 1981. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Tom Watson's total par is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"tom watson have a total par of 154.\" First, I notice that it's talking about Tom Watson specifically. Looking at the table, I need to check if there is a row for Tom Watson. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: ian woosnam\nRow 2: raymond floyd\nRow 3: nick faldo\nRow 4: bernhard langer\nRow 5: mark o'meara\nRow 6: tom watson\nRow 7: craig stadler\nRow 8: fuzzy zoeller\nRow 9: gary player\nRow 10: sandy lyle\n\nYes, Row 6 is Tom Watson. Now, the claim mentions \"total par of 154.\" Looking at the table, each row has several columns: player, country, year(s) won, total, and to par.\n\nSo for Tom Watson (Row 6), I need to check the \"total\" and \"to par\" columns. The \"total\" is listed as 154, which matches exactly what the claim states. The \"to par\" is +10, but that's not relevant here because the claim only mentions the total.\n\nTherefore, since the total for Tom Watson in the table is indeed 154, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the table shows that Tom Watson has a total of 154.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about different golf players, including their countries, the years they won, their total wins, and their to-par scores. \n\nThe claim in question is: \"ian woosnam parred a total of 154 , +10 to par.\" I need to check this against the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should locate Ian Woosnam's row in the table. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: player: ian woosnam\nSo that's row 0 if we're starting from 0 index.\n\nNow, let me see what information is given for Ian Woosnam. From the table, his total wins are listed as 149, and to par is +5. \n\nWait, the claim says he parred a total of 154 with a to-par of +10. But according to the table, his total is 149 and to-par is +5. That's different from what the claim states.\n\nSo, I need to check if any cells in the table support the claim. The relevant columns for this check are \"year(s) won\" and \"total.\" Also, \"to par\" since that's part of the claim.\n\nLooking at row 0:\n\n- year(s) won: 1991\n- total: 149\n- to par: +5\n\nSo none of these match the claim. The claim's numbers are higher than what's in the table for Woosnam.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the total wins and to-par score don't align with the actual data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ian Woosnam has a total of 154 wins with a +10 to par. However, according to the table, he actually won 149 times with a +5 to par. The relevant cells are his total and to-par score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Tom Watson is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"tom watson win for wale in 1977 and 1981 , and parred a total of 161.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts: wins and total par.\n\nStarting with the wins: The claim mentions that Tom Watson won in 1977 and 1981. Looking at the table, each row has a 'year(s) won' column. I need to check if Tom Watson's years match these. \n\nRow 6 is for Tom Watson, country United States. His year(s) won are listed as 1977 and 1981. That matches exactly what the claim states about his wins in those years.\n\nNext, regarding the total par: The claim says he \"parred a total of 161.\" In the table, each row has a 'total' column which likely refers to total strokes or score. For Tom Watson's row (row 6), the total is listed as 154. This doesn't match the claim stating it was 161.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me double-check: The table for Tom Watson shows his total as 154, but the claim says 161. That's a discrepancy.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm misinterpreting the columns. The 'total' column might be something else, like total wins or another metric. However, given that other players have totals matching their achievements (like Gary Player has 160 with 16 par), it's more likely that 'total' refers to total strokes or score.\n\nSo Tom Watson's total is 154, but the claim says 161. That doesn't add up. Therefore, one part of the claim is incorrect. Since the total is wrong, the entire claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, but the wins do match. So does the claim have both correct and incorrect parts? The instruction says if it's fully supported, answer TRUE; otherwise, FALSE. Even one incorrect part makes it false.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check which cells are relevant. For Tom Watson, his row is row 6, with columns 'year(s) won' and 'total'. So the relevant_cells would include these two columns from row 6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about Tom Watson winning in 1977 and 1981 is correct, but the total par stated is incorrect as it's 154 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"tom watson win prior to 1975\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Tom Watson won something before 1975. Now, looking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a player with their country and some details about their wins. My task is to check if there's any relevant information in the table that can confirm or deny this claim.\n\nLet me look through each row:\n\nRow 1: ian woosnam, Wales, won in 1991, total wins 149, etc.\nRow 2: raymond floyd, USA, 1976, total 152\nRow 3: nick faldo, England, won in 1989,90,96, total 153\nRow 4: bernhard langer, Germany, 1985,93, total 153\nRow 5: mark o'meara, USA, 1998, total 154\nRow 6: tom watson, USA, won in 1977 and 1981, total 154. His years are 77 and 81.\nRow 7: craig stadler, USA, 1982, total 155\nRow 8: fuzzy zoeller, USA, 1979, total 159\nRow 9: gary player, South Africa, won in 61,74,78, total 160\nRow 10: sandy lyle, Scotland, 1988, total 161\n\nWait a minute. The claim is about Tom Watson's wins prior to 1975. So I need to check if he had any wins before 1975.\n\nLooking at Row 6: Tom Watson won in 1977 and 1981. But 1977 is after 1975, right? Because the claim says \"prior to 1975.\" So his first win was in 1977, which is after 1975. That would mean he didn't have any wins before 1975.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the column names. The table shows for each row: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par. So \"year(s) won\" is probably when he won something. So if Tom Watson's earliest win is in 1977, then prior to 1975 would be before that.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. The columns for each row are: player, country, year(s) won, total, to par. So yes, the years when he won are listed there.\n\nSo Tom Watson's first win is in 1977. Since 1977 is after 1975, that means he didn't have any wins before 1975. Therefore, the claim \"tom watson win prior to 1975\" would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm interpreting it correctly. The claim says \"prior to 1975,\" so any win in 1975 or earlier would support it. Since Watson's first win is in 1977, which is after 1975, he didn't have a win before that. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells: since Tom Watson is involved, we need to look at his row. In the table, Tom Watson is Row 6. The column for years won would be relevant because it shows when he first won. So the columns we need are \"year(s) won\" in Row 6.\n\nBut looking back at the JSON example, the relevant_cells should include each cell that's checked. In this case, only Row 6's \"year(s) won\" is relevant because that's where his wins are listed, and those are after 1975.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tom Watson won prior to 1975. Checking the table, Tom Watson's first win was in 1977, which is after 1975. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"}\n  ]\n}",
