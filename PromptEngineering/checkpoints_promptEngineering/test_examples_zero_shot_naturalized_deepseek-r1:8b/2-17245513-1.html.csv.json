    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"t7 be the place of peter oosterhuis , who win 7500\". \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two things: \n1. Peter Oosterhuis's place is t7.\n2. He won 7500.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: place (t1, t3, etc.), player's name, country, score, to par, and money. So I need to check these two aspects for Peter Oosterhuis.\n\nStarting with the first part, checking if his place is t7. I'll go through each row to find where Peter Oosterhuis is listed. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 1: Lou Graham\n- Row 2: John Mahaffey\n- Row 3: Frank Beard\n- Row 4: Ben Crenshaw\n- Row 5: Hale Irwin\n- Row 6: Bob Murphy\n- Row 7: Jack Nicklaus\n- Row 8: Peter Oosterhuis (England)\n- Row 9: Pat Fitzsimons\n- Row 10: Arnold Palmer\n- Row 11: Tom Watson\n\nYes, Peter Oosterhuis is in row 8. Now, looking at his place: it's t7. So the first part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, checking if he won 7500. In the table, each player has a 'money' column with different amounts. For row 8, the money is 7500. So that matches as well.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies in the data provided. Both aspects of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Peter Oosterhuis is indeed placed at t7 and earned 7500 according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis , who have 10875\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things:\n1. Place is t7 for Peter Oosterhuis.\n2. His money is 10875.\n\nSo I need to check both conditions against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: place, player, country, score, to par, and money. \n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Is Peter Oosterhuis's place t7? Let me scan through the rows. Row 7 is where his name appears. Checking the 'place' column for that row, it indeed says \"t7\". So that condition checks out.\n\nNext, checking his money. In row 7, under the 'money' column, it's listed as 7500. But the claim states 10875. That doesn't match. So this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nSince one part is true and another is false, overall the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
