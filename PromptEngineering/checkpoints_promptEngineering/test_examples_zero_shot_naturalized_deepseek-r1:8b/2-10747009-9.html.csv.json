    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a football match in the 1927 Victorian Football League season is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nThe claim states: \"in the 1927 season of the victorian football league , essendon lose to south melbourne at windy hill.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of this claim correspond to specific data points in the table. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Team1**: Essendon (home team)\n2. **Team2**: South Melbourne (away team)\n3. **Venue**: Windy Hill\n4. **Result**: Essendon loses to South Melbourne\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The dates provided are all June 25, 1927, which aligns with the season in question.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the relevant information:\n\n- **Row 2**: Home team is Essendon with a score of 12.12 (84). Away team is South Melbourne with 15.9 (99). Venue is Windy Hill. Crowd is 17,000.\n  \nThis row directly matches Team1 as Essendon and Team2 as South Melbourne at Windy Hill. The scores indicate that Essendon scored 84 points and South Melbourne scored 99 points. Since the home team's score is lower than the away team's, this means Essendon lost the match.\n\nOther rows in the table don't mention Essendon or South Melbourne on June 25, 1927, so they can be disregarded for this specific claim.\n\nTherefore, based on Row 2 of the table, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as supported by data from Row 2 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells used in the verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim thoroughly. The claim states: \"the game at victoria park have the largest crowd , while the game at glenferrie oval saw the smallest.\" So, it's making two assertions:\n1. The game at Victoria Park had the largest crowd.\n2. The game at Glenferrie Oval had the smallest crowd.\n\nNext, I should look at the table provided to extract the necessary information about each game's venue and crowd size. The table has six rows, each corresponding to a different game on the same date (25 June 1927). For each row, I can find the home team, away team, their scores, the venue name, the crowd number, and the date.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows are relevant to the claim. The claim mentions two specific venues: Victoria Park and Glenferrie Oval. So, I need to locate these in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Venue is Glenferrie Oval with a crowd of 10,000.\n- Row 2: Venue is Windy Hill, not relevant here.\n- Row 3: Venue is Junction Oval, not relevant.\n- Row 4: Venue is MCG, not relevant.\n- Row 5: Venue is Corio Oval, not relevant.\n- Row 6: Venue is Victoria Park with a crowd of 33,000.\n\nSo, Rows 1 and 6 are the ones that need to be considered for the claim. \n\nNow, I'll analyze each part of the claim against these rows:\n1. The game at Victoria Park had the largest crowd. Looking at Row 6, Victoria Park indeed has a crowd of 33,000, which is higher than all other venues listed in the table.\n2. The game at Glenferrie Oval saw the smallest crowd. From Row 1, Glenferrie Oval has a crowd of 10,000. I should check if this is indeed the smallest compared to other games. The other venues have crowds as follows:\n   - Windy Hill: 17,000\n   - Junction Oval: 13,000\n   - MCG: 15,171\n   - Corio Oval: 13,500\n   - Victoria Park: 33,000\n\nThe smallest crowd is at Glenferrie Oval with 10,000. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in Rows 1 and 6.\n\nSince both assertions hold true based on the table data, the overall claim should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the crowd numbers for games at Victoria Park and Glenferrie Oval.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - **Glenferrie Oval:** Found in Row 1 with a crowd of 10,000.\n   - **Victoria Park:** Found in Row 6 with a crowd of 33,000.\n\n2. **Verify Crowd Sizes:**\n   - **Largest Crowd:** Victoria Park's 33,000 is indeed the highest among all listed venues.\n   - **Smallest Crowd:** Glenferrie Oval's 10,000 is the lowest, confirming that it had the smallest attendance.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both conditions of the claim are satisfied with the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE because both games at Victoria Park and Glenferrie Oval have the largest and smallest crowds respectively.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some football match details from June 25, 1927. The claim says that on that date, St Kilda beat out North Melbourne at Junction Oval. I need to verify if this is true based on the table.\n\nFirst, let me look through each row of the table to find any matches involving St Kilda and North Melbourne on that specific date. All rows have the same date: June 25, 1927. That's a good starting point.\n\nRow 3 says home team is St Kilda with a score of 15.7 (97), and away team is North Melbourne with a score of 13.10 (88). The venue is Junction Oval. This matches the claim exactly: St Kilda playing against North Melbourne at Junction Oval on that date.\n\nI don't need to check other rows because they involve different home teams, like Essendon, Hawthorn, Melbourne, etc., and their away opponents aren't St Kilda or North Melbourne in this context.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim about the 1927 VFL season is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the closest game of the 1927 VFL season occurred at the Glenferrie Oval between Hawthorn, who scored 9.6, and Richmond, who scored 9.2.\"\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying. It mentions a specific game happening at a particular venue with specific scores from two teams.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows for each match on June 25, 1927. Each row includes information about the home team, their score, the away team, their score, the venue, crowd number, and date. \n\nThe claim specifically refers to the game between Hawthorn and Richmond at Glenferrie Oval. So I'll need to find in the table a row where the home team is Hawthorn, the away team is Richmond, and the venue is Glenferrie Oval.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Home team - Hawthorn, score 9.6 (60), away team - Richmond, score 9.20 (74), venue - Glenferrie Oval. The date matches June 25, 1927. So this seems to match exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nWait, but the scores in the table are written as \"home team score: 9.6 (60)\" and similarly for away teams. In the claim, it's stated as 9.6 and 9.2. Hmm, so I need to check if the scores are correctly represented.\n\nIn row 1, Hawthorn scored 9.6 (which is 9 goals and 6 behinds, totaling 60 points) and Richmond scored 9.20 (which is 9 goals and 20 behinds, totaling 74 points). The claim says Hawthorn scored 9.6 and Richmond scored 9.2. Wait, that doesn't add up because the table shows Richmond scoring 9.20, which is different from 9.2.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the scores are represented. In Australian Rules Football, the score format is goals.behinds (goals). So 9.6 for Hawthorn would be 9 goals and 6 behinds, totaling 60 points. Richmond has 9.20, which is 9 goals and 20 behinds, so that's 29 points? Wait no, because each goal is worth 6 points, and each behind is 1 point. So 9 goals would be 54 points plus 20 behinds equals 74 points total. \n\nBut the claim says Richmond scored 9.2. That doesn't match with 9.20 in the table. Wait, perhaps there's a typo or misunderstanding here. Maybe the claim meant 9.2 as in 9 goals and 2 behinds? But in the table, it's clearly written as 9.20.\n\nSo this discrepancy might mean that either the table has a typo, or the claim is incorrect. However, since I have to rely on the table provided, perhaps there's an issue here. Let me double-check the relevant row again.\n\nRow 1: Hawthorn (home) scored 9.6 (60), Richmond (away) scored 9.20 (74). The venue is Glenferrie Oval, date June 25, 1927. So the claim says both teams scored 9.6 and 9.2, but according to the table, it's 9.6 and 9.20. \n\nSo there's a difference in the scores as stated in the claim versus what's in the table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect in the score for Richmond.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again: row 1 has home team Hawthorn with 9.6 (60) and away team Richmond with 9.20 (74). So the scores don't match the claim's 9.2 for Richmond.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a different game where Richmond scored 9.2? Let me check other rows to see if there's another game involving Hawthorn or Richmond at Glenferrie Oval with those scores.\n\nLooking through the rest of the rows:\n\nRow 2: Essendon vs South Melbourne at Windy Hill.\nRow 3: St Kilda vs North Melbourne at Junction Oval.\nRow 4: Melbourne vs Footscray at MCG.\nRow 5: Geelong vs Fitzroy at Corio Oval.\nRow 6: Collingwood vs Carlton at Victoria Park.\n\nNone of these other rows mention Hawthorn or Richmond, so the only relevant row is Row 1. But as established earlier, the scores don't match exactly with the claim. The claim says Richmond scored 9.2, but in the table, it's 9.20 (74 points), while Hawthorn scored 9.6 (60 points).\n\nWait, maybe there was a typo in the table or the claim. If the claim meant 9.20 as 9 goals and 2 behinds (totaling 56 points) that would be different, but that's not what is written. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to a game where Richmond scored 9.2, which doesn't match any row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect in both venue and scores. Wait no, the venue is correct as Glenferrie Oval, but the scores don't match. The claim states that Hawthorn scored 9.6 and Richmond scored 9.2, but according to the table, Hawthorn did score 9.6, but Richmond scored 9.20.\n\nSo the main issue is the discrepancy in the away team's score. Therefore, the claim is false because it provides incorrect scores for Richmond.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the closest game occurred at Glenferrie Oval with Hawthorn scoring 9.6 and Richmond scoring 9.2. However, according to the table, Richmond scored 9.20 (74 points), not 9.2. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the 1927 VFL season is true or false. The claim says that \"footscray score lowest of all the game with 7.9\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It lists six games from June 25, 1927. Each row represents a game where one team is home and the other is away, along with their scores, venue, crowd, and date. My focus is on the away team's score for each game because the claim mentions \"footscray\" scoring the lowest.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 9.6 (60), away Richmond scored 9.20 (74). Footscray isn't here.\nRow 2: Home Essendon scored 12.12 (84), away South Melbourne scored 15.9 (99). Not Footscray.\nRow 3: Home St Kilda scored 15.7 (97), away North Melbourne scored 13.10 (88). Nope.\nRow 4: Home Melbourne scored 10.13 (73), away Footscray scored 7.9 (51). Ah, here we go. That's the only game where Footscray is the away team with a score of 7.9.\nRow 5: Home Geelong scored 12.15 (87), away Fitzroy scored 12.8 (80). Not Footscray.\nRow 6: Home Collingwood scored 13.5 (83), away Carlton scored 14.11 (95). No.\n\nSo, only Row 4 lists Footscray's score as 7.9. The claim says they scored the lowest of all games. To confirm this, I need to check all away teams' scores across all rows to see if any other team scored lower than 7.9.\n\nLooking at each away team's score:\n\n- Richmond: 9.20 (74)\n- South Melbourne: 15.9 (99)\n- North Melbourne: 13.10 (88)\n- Footscray: 7.9 (51)\n- Fitzroy: 12.8 (80)\n- Carlton: 14.11 (95)\n\nNow, comparing all these away scores: 74, 99, 88, 51, 80, 95. The lowest is indeed 51, which is Footscray's score. Therefore, the claim that Footscray scored the lowest with 7.9 is correct.\n\nI also need to note which cells in the table are relevant. Each row has a \"home team\", \"away team\", and their scores. Since the claim is about Footscray being away, I should look at each row's away team field. So, for each row:\n\n- Row 1: away team Richmond\n- Row 2: away team South Melbourne\n- Row 3: away team North Melbourne\n- Row 4: away team Footscray (relevant)\n- Row 5: away team Fitzroy\n- Row 6: away team Carlton\n\nThus, the relevant cells are in row_index 4, specifically the column \"away team score\" because that's where their score is listed. So, the relevant_cells should include {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"away team score\"}.\n\nWait, but the user example includes both home and away team scores in relevant_cells when the claim refers to a specific aspect of either. In this case, since the claim refers specifically to Footscray's score as an away team, I should only include the cell where their score is listed, which is under \"away team score\". So yes, only row 4, column \"away team score\" is relevant.\n\nI think that covers it. The claim is true because Footscray indeed had the lowest away score of all games in that season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"in the 1927 season of the victorian football league , essendon lose to south melbourne at windy hill in front of a crowd of 15171\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **League and Season**: Victorian Football League (VFL), 1927 season.\n2. **Teams Involved**: Essendon as home team and South Melbourne as away team.\n3. **Venue**: Windy Hill.\n4. **Crowd Size**: 15,171.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to verify each part of the claim.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with six rows (Rows 1 to 6), each representing a match on June 25, 1927. The columns relevant here are: home team, away team, venue, and crowd.\n\n- **Row 2**: Home team is Essendon, away team is South Melbourne.\n- **Venue for Row 2**: Windy Hill.\n- **Crowd Size**: 17,000 according to the table.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions a crowd of 15,171. But in the table, for Row 2 (Essendon vs South Melbourne at Windy Hill), the crowd is listed as 17,000. There's no row with Essendon and South Melbourne at Windy Hill with a crowd of 15,171.\n\nI need to check each match:\n\n- **Row 1**: Hawthorn vs Richmond at Glenferrie Oval, crowd 10,000.\n- **Row 2**: Essendon vs South Melbourne at Windy Hill, crowd 17,000.\n- **Row 3**: St Kilda vs North Melbourne at Junction Oval, crowd 13,000.\n- **Row 4**: Melbourne vs Footscray at MCG, crowd 15,171. Wait, this is a different match between Melbourne and Footscray, not Essendon vs South Melbourne.\n- **Row 5**: Geelong vs Fitzroy at Corio Oval, crowd 13,500.\n- **Row 6**: Collingwood vs Carlton at Victoria Park, crowd 33,000.\n\nSo, the claim mentions Essendon losing to South Melbourne at Windy Hill with a crowd of 15,171. However, looking through all the rows:\n\n- There's no match where Essendon is the home team against South Melbourne.\n- The only match involving Essendon is Row 2, where they are the home team and scored 12.12 (84), while South Melbourne scored higher with 15.9 (99). So, actually, South Melbourne won that game, not Essendon.\n\nAlso, the crowd for this match was 17,000, not 15,171. Additionally, there's no match where Essendon loses to South Melbourne at Windy Hill with a specific crowd number mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim has inaccuracies regarding both the crowd size and the team scores. So, it must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Essendon lost to South Melbourne at Windy Hill with a crowd of 15,171. However, the table shows that on June 25, 1927, Essendon played against South Melbourne at Windy Hill but actually won or drew, and the crowd was 17,000. There's no match where Essendon lost to South Melbourne with the crowd size mentioned.

The difference between these two crowds should be calculated to see if it's 22,000.\n\nCalculating the difference: 33,000 (Victoria Park) - 10,000 (Glenferrie Oval) = 23,000. \n\nThe claim says the difference is 22,000, but according to the table, it's actually 23,000.

Looking at row 1, the crowd is listed as 10,000, but in row 2, it's 17,000. However, the venue for that row is windy hill, which isn't glenferrie oval. So, the crowd figure of 17,000 doesn't match with the venue specified.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. The claim refers to glenferrie oval, so we should only consider row 1 for venue and crowd. In row 1, the crowd is 10,000, not 17,000 as stated in the claim. That's a discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the scores: Hawthorn scored 9.6 (60) and Richmond 9.20 (74). The claim simplifies these to 9.6 and 9.2. Since 9.20 is different from 9.2, the scores don't match either.\n\nSo, two main issues here: the crowd number doesn't match the venue given, and the scores are misrepresented. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data in row 1. \n\nWait again\u2014maybe I should double-check. The claim says the closest game occurred at glenferrie oval between Hawthorn and Richmond with their respective scores. But in the table, Hawthorn scored 9.6 (60), and Richmond 9.20 (74). So, the claim's simplified scores don't match exactly.\n\nAdditionally, for the crowd, the only row with glenferrie oval has a crowd of 10,000, not 17,000. The 17,000 figure is from a different venue in another row. So, that's incorrect too.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because both the scores and the crowd number provided don't align with the data from the correct row (row 1). There might be confusion between rows if someone mistakenly took numbers from different games, but based on the specific venue given in the claim, it doesn't hold up.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each aspect against the corresponding table row. The claim incorrectly states the scores and crowd size for the game at glenferrie oval, which doesn't match the actual data.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score (Home)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Score (Away)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"On June 25, 1927, St Kilda beat out North Melbourne at Junction Oval by a score of 14.11 (95) to 13.5 (83).\"\n\nFirst, I'll check the date in the claim. The table shows that all matches occurred on \"25 june 1927.\" So the date part checks out.\n\nNext, looking for the home team St Kilda. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Hawthorn vs Richmond\n- Row 2: Essendon vs South Melbourne\n- Row 3: St Kilda vs North Melbourne\n- Row 4: Melbourne vs Footscray\n- Row 5: Geelong vs Fitzroy\n- Row 6: Collingwood vs Carlton\n\nSt Kilda is indeed the home team in Row 3. Their venue is Junction Oval, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the scores. The claim states St Kilda scored 14.11 (95) and North Melbourne scored 13.5 (83). Looking at Row 3 of the table:\n\n- Home team: St Kilda, score: 15.7 (97)\n- Away team: North Melbourne, score: 13.10 (88)\n\nWait, the scores don't match. The claim says St Kilda scored 14.11 (95), but in the table, they have 15.7 (97). Also, the away team's score is listed as 13.10 (88) in the table, not 13.5 (83).\n\nSo there are discrepancies here. The scores don't align with what's stated in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, checking the venue: Junction Oval is correct for St Kilda's match. So that part matches.\n\nBut since the scores in the table don't match the claim, the overall statement isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the scores and the match details doesn't fully align with the table data provided.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The home team St Kilda's row is Row 3. The score in the claim (14.11 (95)) doesn't match the actual score of 15.7 (97) from Row 3.\n- The away team North Melbourne's score in the table is 13.10 (88), not 13.5 (83).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"In the 1927 VFL season, Footscray scored lowest of all the games with 7.9 at Victoria Park.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table provided to find the relevant information. Each row seems to represent a game between two teams, with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'm specifically looking for Footscray's score in these games. Since it's an away team in some matches and a home team in others, I need to check both possibilities.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Hawthorn (home) vs Richmond (away). Footscray isn't mentioned here.\n- Row 2: Essendon (home) vs South Melbourne (away). No mention of Footscray.\n- Row 3: St Kilda (home) vs North Melbourne (away). Still no Footscray.\n- Row 4: Melbourne (home) vs Footscray (away). Here, Footscray is the away team with a score of 7.9 (51).\n- Row 5: Geelong (home) vs Fitzroy (away). No Footscray here.\n- Row 6: Collingwood (home) vs Carlton (away). No mention of Footscray.\n\nSo, in Row 4, Footscray is the away team with a score of 7.9 (51). Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest score among all games listed that day. \n\nLooking at all scores:\n- Hawthorn: 9.6\n- Richmond: 9.20\n- Essendon: 12.12\n- South Melbourne: 15.9\n- St Kilda: 15.7\n- North Melbourne: 13.10\n- Melbourne: 10.13\n- Footscray: 7.9\n- Geelong: 12.15\n- Fitzroy: 12.8\n- Collingwood: 13.5\n- Carlton: 14.11\n\nThe scores range from 7.9 to 15.9 and other higher numbers. So, Footscray's 7.9 is the lowest score among all teams that played on that day.\n\nAdditionally, the claim specifies the venue as Victoria Park. Looking back, Row 4's venue is McG, not Victoria Park. Therefore, there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says Footscray scored 7.9 at Victoria Park. But according to the table, they played at McG in Row 4. So, perhaps the venue is incorrect in the claim. That would mean the claim is false because the game wasn't at Victoria Park but at McG.\n\nAlternatively, if Footscray didn't play at Victoria Park that season, then their lowest score might not be from that specific match. But according to the table, they played against Melbourne at McG with a score of 7.9.\n\nTherefore, two points: the score and the venue. The claim's venue is incorrect. Also, if Footscray scored the lowest overall, but since it's possible another team had an even lower score elsewhere not listed here, but in this table, yes, they have the lowest.\n\nBut since the venue is incorrect, the claim's statement about where the game was played is wrong, which would make the entire claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Footscray scored the lowest with 7.9 at Victoria Park, but according to the table, their game was at McG, not Victoria Park. Additionally, checking all scores, Footscray's 7.9 is indeed the lowest.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Identify which row(s) involve Footscray.\n2. Check Footscray's score in those rows (found in Row 4).\n3. Verify if this score is the lowest among all teams in the table (yes, it is).\n4. Confirm the venue for that game (Row 4: McG, not Victoria Park).\n\nSince the venue discrepancy invalidates the claim's location, despite the score being correct, the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
