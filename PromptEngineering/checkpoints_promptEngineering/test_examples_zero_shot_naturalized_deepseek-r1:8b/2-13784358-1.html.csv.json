    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the year 1989 with symphony tower holds the rank of 2.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows in the table are relevant. The claim mentions two specific things: the year 1989 and the building called Symphony Tower. So, I'll look for rows where the 'year' is 1989 and the 'name' is Symphony Tower.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 2 has name: Symphony Towers, height feet (m): 499 (152), floors: 34, year: 1989. Wait, the claim says \"Symphony tower,\" but here it's \"Symphony Towers.\" Is that a typo or are they different? The name might be slightly different, so I need to check if the exact name matches.\n\nNext, I'll look for any other rows with 'year' 1989. Scanning through, Row 8 and Row 9 have year: 1992, which is not 1989. Rows 4-7 don't either. So only Row 2 has the year 1989.\n\nNow, checking the rank of Symphony Tower in 1989. The claim says it holds the rank of 2. Looking at Row 2, the 'rank' is 2. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if there are any other buildings from 1989 that might have a lower rank than 2, but since we're focusing on the specific claim about Symphony Tower in 1989, I think only Row 2 is relevant here.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are where 'year' is 1989 and 'name' is Symphony Towers. That's Row 2 for both. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because in 1989, Symphony Towers have rank 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the year 1989, the \"Symphony Tower\" holds the rank of 2. By examining the table, we find that Row 2 corresponds to \"Symphony Towers\" with a rank of 2 and the year 1989. The slight difference in the building name (\"Tower\" vs. \"Towers\") may be a variation, but it's reasonable to assume they refer to the same structure. Since no other buildings from 1989 have a lower rank, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"meridian condominium have 28 floor\" is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows in the table could potentially refer to the Meridian Condominium. Looking at the 'name' column, I see that Row 21 has \"meridian condominiums\". That seems like the correct one because the claim is about \"meridian condominium,\" not \"condominiums\" plural or a different name.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'floors' column for this specific row. From the table, Row 21 (Meridian Condominiums) has 28 floors. The claim says they have 28 floors, which matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nI should also ensure that there are no other rows with \"meridian\" or similar names that might confuse things, but it looks like only Row 21 is related to Meridian Condominiums. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is supported by the data in the table under the 'floors' column for the corresponding row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It mentions the NBC building and specifies the year 1975.\n\nNow, I'll search through the table for any rows related to the NBC building. Let me scan each row's name until I find a match.\n\nLooking at Row 31: The name is \"nbc building.\" That's exactly what we're looking for.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'year' column for this row. The year listed is 1975. So, it matches the claim perfectly.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other rows that might mistakenly fit or contradict, but in this case, only Row 31 refers to NBC building with the specified details.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"year\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"meridian condominium have 27 number of floor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows in the table where the name is \"meridian condominium\". Scanning through the list, I see Row 21: rank: 21, name: meridian condominiums, height feet (m): 371 (113), floors: 28, year: 1985. Wait, that's not exactly matching because it says \"condominiums\" with an 's' at the end, and the claim is about \"meridian condominium.\" Maybe there's another row.\n\nContinuing down, I see Row 22 and 23 are both for \"marriott hotel and marina tower i\" and \"ii,\" so not relevant. Next, after that, I don't immediately see another meridian entry. Hmm, maybe the claim is referring to a different building or perhaps there's a typo.\n\nWait, maybe the name is slightly different. Let me check again. The claim says \"meridian condominium.\" Looking at Row 21: it's \"meridian condominiums\" with an 's.' Maybe that's a variant, but I'm not sure if it's considered the same building. Alternatively, perhaps there's another meridian entry elsewhere.\n\nLooking further down, I don't see any other entries for \"meridian.\" So maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no row with exactly \"meridian condominium\" as the name. Therefore, the number of floors isn't listed for that specific name, so the claim can't be fully supported.\n\nAdditionally, even if Row 21 is considered as part of the same building, it has 28 floors, not 27. So regardless of whether it's the correct name or not, the floor count doesn't match 27.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that in the year 1975, there was a building with rank 30. So, I need to check if any row in the table has a rank of 30 and a year equal to 1975.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: rank, name, height in feet (m), floors, and year. I'll focus on the \"rank\" and \"year\" columns specifically for this claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Rank is 1, Year 1991 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: Rank 2, 1989 \u2192 No.\n- Row 3: Rank 3, 1992 \u2192 No.\n- Row 4: Rank 4, 2007 \u2192 No.\n- Row 5: Rank 5, 1990 \u2192 No.\n- Row 6: Rank 5, 2005 \u2192 No.\n- Row 7: Rank 7, 2003 \u2192 No.\n- Row 8: Rank 8, 1992 \u2192 No.\n- Row 9: Rank 8, 1992 \u2192 No.\n- Row 10: Rank 10, 2004 \u2192 No.\n- Row 11: Rank 10, 2005 \u2192 No.\n- Row 12: Rank 10, 2009 \u2192 No.\n- Row 13: Rank 13, 2005 \u2192 No.\n- Row 14: Rank 14, 2009 \u2192 No.\n- Row 15: Rank 15, 1969 \u2192 Close, but not 30.\n- Row 16: Rank 16, 2008 \u2192 No.\n- Row 17: Rank 17, 2007 \u2192 No.\n- Row 18: Rank 18, 2008 \u2192 No.\n- Row 19: Rank 19, 1982 \u2192 No.\n- Row 20: Rank 20, 2004 \u2192 No.\n- Row 21: Rank 21, 1985 \u2192 No.\n- Row 22: Rank 22, 1987 \u2192 No. Wait, but the rank is 22 here, and I'm looking for rank 30. So, no match yet.\n- Row 23: Same as above.\n- Row 24: Rank 24, 1982 \u2192 No.\n- Row 25: Rank 25, 1963 \u2192 No.\n- Row 26: Rank 26, 1982 \u2192 No.\n- Row 27: Rank 27, 1974 \u2192 Close but not 30.\n- Row 28: Rank 28, 2012 \u2192 No.\n- Row 29: Rank 29, 1984 \u2192 No.\n- Row 30: Rank 30, 1927 \u2192 Wait, this is rank 30 but the year is 1927, not 1975. So that's a no.\n- Rows beyond 30 are given, but rank 30 is only at row 30.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed something. Let me check again. The claim says \"rank 30\" in 1975. But looking through all the rows, none of them have both rank 30 and year 1975. \n\nRow 15 has rank 15, year 1969.\nRow 27 has rank 27, year 1974. Close but not 1975.\nRow 30 is rank 30, year 1927.\n\nSo, there's no row where rank is 30 and the year is 1975. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the rows. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking for Rank = 30 and Year = 1975.\n\nScanning through each row again:\n\nRow 15: Rank 15, 1969\nRow 27: Rank 27, 1974\nRow 30: Rank 30, 1927\n\nNone match both rank 30 and year 1975. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1975, there was a building with rank 30. After reviewing each row, none of the buildings have both rank 30 and the year 1975. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
