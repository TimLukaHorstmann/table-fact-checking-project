    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\"\n\nFirst, I need to carefully examine each part of the claim against the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: \"only 7 games in all the games.\" Looking at the table, each row has a 'games' column. All rows except one have 7 listed under 'games'. Wait, row 8 says 'games: 7', so all rows indeed have 7 games. So that part checks out.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" This seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it. It seems to say that in 4 specific instances, there were draws, and each time, no more than 1 game was drawn. Wait, actually, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps it's saying that on 4 occasions, the number of games drawn is as follows: for example, on 4 occasions where the games drew, in each case, only 0 or 1 game was drawn, but not more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the 'drawn' column in the table. Let me check each row's 'drawn' value:\n\nRow 1: drawn: 0\nRow 2: drawn: 0\nRow 3: drawn: 1\nRow 4: drawn: 1\nRow 5: drawn: 1\nRow 6: drawn: 0\nRow 7: drawn: 1\nRow 8: drawn: 0\n\nSo, the total number of rows where 'drawn' is greater than 0 is Row 3,4,5,7. That's four instances where a game was drawn. So that part seems to fit\u2014there are indeed 4 occasions with draws.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim: \"never more than 1 game drawn.\" Looking at the 'drawn' column, all values are either 0 or 1, so each time there's a draw, only one game was drawn. So that condition is satisfied.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original instruction says to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. The claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" From the table, exactly four rows have a drawn value of 1, which means on those four occasions (rows 3,4,5,7), one game was drawn each time. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The claim says \"on 4 occasion,\" but there are only four instances where the games were drawn, so it's exactly four occasions. Each of those has 1 drawn game, never more than one. That aligns with the table data.\n\nWait another point: in row 3,4,5,7, each has 'drawn' as 1. So yes, on four occasions, there was a draw, and each time only one game was drawn.\n\nSo both parts of the claim seem to be supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that there are exactly 7 games with no draws in most instances and four specific rows where a single game was drawn on each occasion. This matches the claim accurately.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"when there be 14 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 7.\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down. It seems to be stating two conditions:\n\n1. When a team has 14 points and a points difference of 41 - 07 (which I think is 41 minus 7), the game count should be 7.\n2. When a team has 10 points and a points difference of 26 - 16, the game count should also be 7.\n\nSo for each condition, I need to check if such a row exists in the table that meets both the points, points difference, and game count specified.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 8 rows (since it's up to Row 8). Each row has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points.\n\nLet me go through each condition one by one.\n\nFirst Condition:\n- Points = 14\n- Points difference = 41 - 07, which is 34.\n- Games = 7\n\nSo I need a row where games are 7, points are 14, and points difference is 34. Let's check the table for any such row.\n\nLooking at Row 1: games=7, drawn=0, lost=0, points difference=41 - 07=34, points=14. Yes, that matches exactly. So this condition is satisfied in Row 1.\n\nSecond Condition:\n- Points = 10\n- Points difference =26 -16=10\n- Games=7\n\nSo I need a row where games are 7, points are 10, and points difference is 10. Let's check the table.\n\nLooking at Row 2: games=7, drawn=0, lost=2, points difference=26 -16=10, points=10. That matches too. So this condition is also satisfied in Row 2.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim are met by rows in the table. The claim doesn't seem to be making any incorrect statements based on the data provided.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row to ensure I didn't miss anything. For the first condition, only Row 1 matches all three criteria: games=7, points=14, points difference=34. For the second condition, only Row 2 matches games=7, points=10, points difference=10.\n\nI don't see any other rows that satisfy these conditions. So the claim is supported by the data in both specified cases.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two rows in the table: Row 1 and Row 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be 9 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me first read through the claim carefully: \"there be 9 points on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\" \n\nHmm, breaking this down, the claim mentions two specific instances where there are 9 points each, along with two different points differences. So I need to check if in the table, there are two rows where both 'points' column equals 9, and also that these rows have the corresponding 'points difference' values of 30-15 and 26-21.\n\nLet me look at the table provided. The table has eight rows, each representing a different scenario with games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. I'll go through each row to see if they match the claim's conditions.\n\nStarting from Row 1: games=7, drawn=0, lost=0, points difference=41-07 (which is 34), points=14. This doesn't have 9 points or either of the differences mentioned in the claim, so I can rule this out.\n\nRow 2: games=7, drawn=0, lost=2, points difference=26-16 (10), points=10. Again, points are 10, not 9, and the difference is 10, which isn't either of the two mentioned. So no match here either.\n\nRow 3: games=7, drawn=1, lost=2, points difference=30-15 (15), points=9. Okay, here we have points=9. The points difference is 30-15, which is one of the differences in the claim. So this row is a candidate for one part of the claim.\n\nRow 4: games=7, drawn=1, lost=2, points difference=26-21 (5), points=9. Points are 9 here as well. The points difference is 26-21, which is the second difference mentioned in the claim. So this row also fits both criteria of having 9 points and one of the specified differences.\n\nRow 5: games=7, drawn=1, lost=3, points difference=17-23 (-6), points=7. Points are 7, so not matching the claim's 9 points. The difference is negative, which isn't mentioned either, so no match here.\n\nRow 6: games=7, drawn=0, lost=5, points difference=19-28 (-9), points=4. Points are 4, and difference is -9, neither of which fit the claim. Moving on.\n\nRow 7: games=7, drawn=1, lost=5, points difference=20-28 (-8), points=3. Points are 3, not 9, so no match here either.\n\nRow 8: games=7, drawn=0, lost=7, points difference=05-46 (-41), points=0. Points are 0, which doesn't fit. The difference is negative and quite large, so it's not relevant.\n\nSo from the table analysis, Rows 3 and 4 both have 9 points. Additionally, Row 3 has a points difference of 30-15, which is one of the differences mentioned in the claim. Similarly, Row 4 has a points difference of 26-21, which is the other difference in the claim. \n\nTherefore, the claim states that there are two occasions with 9 points and those specific point differences, which both exist in Rows 3 and 4. So the claim appears to be TRUE.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any rows or misinterpret the data. Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 3: points=9, difference=30-15 (which is 15). Yes.\n- Row 4: points=9, difference=26-21 (5). Yes.\n- No other rows have points=9 with those differences.\n\nSo yes, both conditions of the claim are satisfied. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are Rows 3 and 4 at 'points' column each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by two rows in the table where 'points' equal 9, along with their respective point differences. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like the claim is saying that whenever a team has 0 points (assuming 'points' refers to some sort of score), they have 0 draws and 7 losses in their games. So, for every row where points are 0, there should be 0 drawn games and 7 lost games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different scenario with various statistics: games played, drawn, lost, points difference, and total points. The rows go from Row 1 to Row 8.\n\nI'll need to check each row where the 'points' column is 0. Let's scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: points are 14 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 2: points are 10 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 3: points are 9 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 4: points are 9 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 5: points are 7 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 6: points are 4 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 7: points are 3 \u2192 not 0.\n- Row 8: points are 0 \u2192 this is relevant.\n\nSo, only Row 8 has points equal to 0. Now, I need to check the values for 'drawn' and 'lost' in this row.\n\nLooking at Row 8:\n- games: 7\n- drawn: 0\n- lost: 7\n- points difference: 05 - 46 \u2192 but points are 0 here.\n\nAccording to the claim, when points are 0, both drawn should be 0 and lost should be 7. In Row 8, drawn is indeed 0, and lost is 7. So this row supports the claim.\n\nNow, since there's only one row with points as 0, I just need to check that specific row for the two conditions mentioned in the claim. Both are satisfied here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on Row 8.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"there be no draw more than 1 and no loss more than 7.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should check what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's making two assertions:\n\n1. No draw (I assume this refers to drawn games) exceeds 1.\n2. No losses exceed 7.\n\nSo, I need to look at both draws and losses in the table and see if any row violates these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points. So, for each row, I can extract the number of draws and losses.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: games=7, drawn=0, lost=0. So, no issues here. Draws are 0, which is \u22641, and losses 0 \u22647.\n\nRow 2: games=7, drawn=0, lost=2. Again, draws 0, losses 2 \u22647. Okay.\n\nRow 3: games=7, drawn=1, lost=2. Here, draws are exactly 1, which is fine, and losses 2 still within limit.\n\nRow 4: games=7, drawn=1, lost=2. Similar to row 3, no issues.\n\nRow 5: games=7, drawn=1, lost=3. Losses here are 3 \u22647. Draws at 1, which is acceptable.\n\nRow 6: games=7, drawn=0, lost=5. So, losses are 5 \u22647. No problem there.\n\nRow 7: games=7, drawn=1, lost=5. Losses 5, draws 1. Still okay.\n\nRow 8: games=7, drawn=0, lost=7. Now, this is interesting. The number of losses here is exactly 7, which matches the second part of the claim. But does the claim say \"no loss more than 7\" or \"losses don't exceed 7\"? If it's saying \"no loss more than 7,\" then 7 would be acceptable because it's not exceeding, just equal to.\n\nWait, but I should check if any row has losses greater than 7. In this table, the maximum is 7 in row 8. So that's exactly 7, which doesn't exceed. Therefore, none of the rows have more than 7 losses.\n\nNow, checking draws: each row's drawn column goes up to 1 (except row 8, which has 0). So no row exceeds a draw count beyond 1. For example, row 3 and 4 have 1, but that's within the limit of not exceeding 1. Wait, actually, if the claim says \"no draw more than 1,\" then having exactly 1 is okay because it's not more than 1. So, rows with drawn=1 are fine.\n\nIs there any row where draws exceed 1? Let me see: looking through each row, the maximum draws in a single row is 1. So no row has draws beyond that. Therefore, both conditions of the claim are met.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since none of the rows have more than 1 draw and none have losses exceeding 7, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6.\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down into two parts.\n\nFirst part: \"when there be 10 points and a point difference of 41 - 07, the game be 7.\" So I think this is saying that if a team has 10 points and a points difference of (41-7)=34, then their game count should be 7.\n\nSecond part: \"when there be 10 points, the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6.\" Wait, this seems a bit off. Maybe it's saying that when they have 10 points, their points difference is (26-16)=10, and their game count is 6.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me look at the table to see what each row represents.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points.\n\nSo for example, Row 1: games=7, drawn=0, lost=0, points difference=41-07=34, points=14. So that's a perfect score, no losses, all 7 games won by 14 points? Wait, points difference is points earned minus points against? Or is it total points?\n\nWait, the points difference is written as \"points difference: 41 - 07\", which probably means their points minus opponents' points. So in Row 1, points are 14, so opponents must have scored 7.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 2, points difference is 26-16=10, and points=10.\n\nSo the claim seems to be stating two conditions:\n\n1. If a team has 10 points and a points difference of 34 (41-07), then their games played are 7.\n2. If a team has 10 points, then their points difference is 10 (26-16) and they have played 6 games.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because in the table, there's no row where points=10 with a points difference of 34. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: Points=14\nRow 2: Points=10\nRow 3: Points=9\nRow 4: Points=9\nRow 5: Points=7\nRow 6: Points=4\nRow 7: Points=3\nRow 8: Points=0\n\nSo the only row with points=10 is Row 2. Let's look at Row 2: games=7, drawn=0, lost=2, points difference=26-16=10.\n\nNow, according to the claim, when there are 10 points and a points difference of (41-07)=34, then games should be 7. But in the table, no row has both 10 points and 34 point difference. The closest is Row 1 with 14 points and 34 point difference.\n\nSo maybe the first part of the claim is checking if when there's a team with 10 points and 34 point difference, they have played 7 games. But since such a team doesn't exist in the table, that condition might be irrelevant.\n\nThen, the second part says when there are 10 points, the point difference should be (26-16)=10, and games should be 6. Wait, but Row 2 has 10 points, points difference=10, and games=7. So if the claim is saying that at 10 points, the point difference is 10 and games are 6, but in reality, it's games=7.\n\nSo that would mean the claim is FALSE because the actual data shows that when a team has 10 points, they played 7 games with a points difference of 10. The claim says when there are 10 points, point difference should be 10 and games=6, which doesn't match the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is a condition: if points=10 and points difference=(41-7)=34, then games=7. But as I said, no team in the table has both 10 points and 34 point difference.\n\nThe second part says when there be 10 points, point difference should be (26-16)=10, and games should be 6. So looking for a row where points=10 and point difference=10 with games=6.\n\nIn the table, Row 2 has points=10, point difference=10, but games=7. There's no row with points=10, point difference=10, and games=6. Therefore, that condition isn't met either.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are checking for specific conditions in the table. Since none of those exact rows exist, the claim would be FALSE because it's not supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if a team with 10 points has a point difference of 34 (41-7) and 7 games, or another condition that doesn't match any row in the table.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **First Condition**: Check if any row has points=10 and point difference=34 (41-7).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding both the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: Each row represents a team with games played, drawn, lost, points difference, and total points. There are 8 rows, each starting with \"games: 7\", which indicates that each team has played 7 games.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" \n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. It seems to be saying two things:\n\n1. There are only 7 games in total (but from the table, each team has played 7 games, but since there are 8 rows, that would mean each team played 7 games, possibly implying a league with 8 teams each playing 7 games against others? Or is it referring to the number of games in total across all teams?)\n\n2. On 4 occasions, there was a draw. \"Never more than 2 game draw\" \u2013 this part is unclear. Maybe it's saying that on 4 occasions, draws occurred, and each time no more than 2 games were drawn? Or perhaps that the maximum number of drawn games in any category doesn't exceed 2?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. The claim could be saying two things: \n\n- Total games played is only 7 across all teams.\n- There are 4 draws (games where the points difference is zero?), and each draw situation involves no more than 2 drawn games.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row has a \"points difference\" column. So in some rows, the points difference is something like 41-07, which would be 34, not zero. But for example, Row 3: points difference is 30 -15, which is 15. Wait, no, that's not zero either. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the \"points difference\" column might actually represent the team's score minus the opponent's score. So if it's zero, that would mean a draw. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: points difference 41-07 \u2192 34\nRow 2: 26-16 \u2192 10\nRow 3: 30-15 \u2192 15\nRow 4: 26-21 \u21925\nRow 5:17-23\u2192 -6\nRow 6:19-28\u2192 -9\nRow7:20-28\u2192 -8\nRow8:05-46\u2192 -41\n\nWait, none of the points differences are zero. So maybe \"draw\" refers to when both teams had the same points? Or perhaps it's a different column.\n\nLooking back at the table, each row has games, drawn, lost, points difference, points. Maybe \"drawn\" is the number of draws for that team. So if a team has 1 draw, that means they drew one game.\n\nSo, the claim says: on 4 occasions (across all teams), there was a draw, and each time, no more than 2 games were drawn in total.\n\nWait, but each row is a separate team's performance. So maybe \"on 4 occasion\" refers to across all rows, there are 4 instances where draws occurred for that team. But the claim isn't entirely clear.\n\nAlternatively, the claim could be misinterpreted by me. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe first part of the claim: \"there be only 7 game in all the game.\" Maybe it's trying to say that across all teams, there are a total of 7 games played. But with 8 rows each having 7 games, that would be 56 games in total, which doesn't make sense because each game involves two teams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's referring to the number of games per team being 7, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe second part: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" Perhaps it means that across all teams, there are 4 draws (each a separate occurrence), and each draw involves no more than two drawn games. Or maybe it's saying that in the total number of drawn games across all teams, there are only 4 such instances, and each instance has at most two drawn games.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me break down the claim into possible interpretations:\n\n1. Total number of games played is 7 across all teams.\n2. There have been draws on exactly 4 occasions (maybe 4 games in total).\n3. In each of these draws, no more than two games were drawn (which doesn't make much sense because a game is either a draw or not; each game can only be one outcome).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that across all teams, there are exactly four draws (i.e., four games where the result was a draw), and in none of these did more than two games have a draw. But this still doesn't make much sense because each game is either a win/loss or a draw; it's not about the number of draws per team.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is stating that there are 4 draws across all teams, meaning that four games ended in draws, and no team has more than two draws. Or perhaps it's saying that each team had at most two drawn games.\n\nLooking back, let me count the number of draws per row:\n\nRow 1: drawn:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nRow7:1\nRow8:0\n\nSo total draws across all teams are 4 (Rows 3,4,5,7). So that's four instances where a team had a draw.\n\nNow, the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" Maybe it's saying that there have been four draws in total, and each of these draws involved no more than two games being drawn. Wait, but each draw is a single game, so this part might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is stating that in each instance where there was a draw (across all teams), the number of draws per team did not exceed two. But looking at the data:\n\nRows 3,4,5,7 have 1 drawn game each, which is within two. So maybe that's what it refers to.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what the claim is saying. The wording is a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is stating that across all teams, there are only four draws in total (i.e., four games ended as draws), and no team had more than two draws. Let me check:\n\nIn the table, each row has \"drawn: x\", so the number of drawn games per team. So for each row, it's the number of games that ended in a draw for that team.\n\nSo total draws across all teams would be the sum of drawn columns. From the table:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nRow7:1\nRow8:0\n\nTotal draws = 0+0+1+1+1+0+1+0=4.\n\nSo there are four games that ended in a draw across all teams (Rows3,4,5,7 each had one draw).\n\nNow, the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 2 game draw.\" So perhaps it's saying that there have been four draws (games), and no team has more than two drawn games. Let me see:\n\nEach of the teams that have a draw: Row3 had 1, Row4 had 1, Row5 had1, Row7 had1.\n\nSo each of these teams only had one draw, which is certainly not exceeding two. So maybe the claim is saying that across all teams, there are exactly four draws (four games) and no team has more than two drawn games. Since none have more than one, it's definitely true.\n\nBut wait, the first part of the claim says \"there be only 7 game in all the game.\" That might not make sense. Perhaps it means that each team played seven games? But if there are eight teams, each playing seven games, that would be 56 games, but considering each game involves two teams, so total number of games is 28 (since each game is counted twice when summing per-team counts). Wait, the table shows each row as a team's games. So for example, if Team A plays Team B, then both Team A and Team B will have that game in their \"games\" count.\n\nBut without knowing how many games each team played against others, it's hard to say. However, each row has \"games: x\", so I think each team played seven games.\n\nSo the claim could be stating that each team played only seven games, which is correct as per the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mistranslation or misstatement, and they meant that there are four draws across all teams, with no team having more than two draws. But in our case, total draws are four, spread across four different teams, each with one draw, so none have more than one.\n\nSo putting this together, the claim seems to be stating two things:\n\n1. Each team played seven games (which is true as per the table).\n2. There were exactly four drawn games across all teams, and no team had more than two drawn games (which is also true, as each draw was only for one team).\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's what the claim is exactly saying. The wording is a bit unclear to me.\n\nIn any case, based on the data provided, the number of draws across all teams is four, each with one per team, and each team played seven games. So it seems both parts of the claim are accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that the claim accurately reflects the data provided in the table:\n\n1. Each team indeed played seven games.\n2. There were exactly four drawn games across all teams, each involving a different team, so no team had more than one drawn game.\n\nTherefore, both aspects of the claim hold true based on the given information.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as follows:\n\n- Each team played seven games.\n- There were four drawn games in total, with no team having more than one draw.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells that support this determination. Let me start by understanding the claim and the table structure.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5.\" So, it's saying that when points are zero (points: 0), the number of drawn games is 3 and the number of lost games is 5. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team with various statistics: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. The rows go from 1 to 8.\n\nFirst, I need to find all rows where \"points\" column is exactly 0. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: points 14 \u2192 Not 0.\nRow 2: points 10 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: points 9 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: points 9 \u2192 No.\nRow 5: points 7 \u2192 No.\nRow 6: points 4 \u2192 No.\nRow 7: points 3 \u2192 No.\nRow 8: points 0 \u2192 Yes. This is the only row where points are 0.\n\nSo, there's only one relevant row: Row 8.\n\nNow, I need to check what \"drawn\" and \"lost\" columns say for this row. \n\nLooking at Row 8:\n- games:7\n- drawn:0\n- lost:7\n\nAccording to the claim, when points are 0, drawn should be 3 and lost should be 5. But in reality, in Row 8, drawn is 0 and lost is 7. These numbers don't match the claim at all. \n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any row where points are zero. Since there's no row with points 0 that also has drawn=3 and lost=5, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nI should then identify which cells to check. The relevant cells would be the ones in Row 8 for \"drawn\" and \"lost\". \n\nSo, I'll include the cells from Row 8 where column_name is \"Drawn\" and \"Lost\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"there be 10 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions two points:\n\n1. There should be a score of 10 points on two separate occasions.\n2. There should be two different point differences: one being 30 - 15 and another being 26 - 21.\n\nI need to check each part against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the first part, \"10 points on two occasions.\" I'll go through each row of the table to find where points are 10. \n\nRow 1: Points =14\nRow2: Points=10 \u2192 That's one occasion.\nRow3: Points=9\nRow4: Points=9\nRow5: Points=7\nRow6: Points=4\nRow7: Points=3\nRow8: Points=0\n\nOnly Row2 has 10 points. So there's only one occurrence, not two as claimed. That already suggests the claim might be FALSE.\n\nNext, checking the point differences mentioned in the claim:\n\nThe claim lists two point differences:\n- 30 -15 and \n-26 -21\n\nI need to find if these exact differences exist in any row.\n\nLooking at each row's points difference:\n\nRow1: Points diff=41-7=34\nRow2: 26-16=10\nRow3:30-15=15\nRow4:26-21=5\nRow5:17-23=-6 (but usually, point difference is positive, so maybe it's written as 23-17=6? The table shows \"points difference: 17 - 23\", which would be -6, but perhaps the absolute value is considered. I'm not sure if that's intended.)\nRow6:19-28=-9\nRow7:20-28=-8\nRow8:05-46=-41\n\nLooking for 30-15=25 and 26-21=5 in the point differences.\n\nFrom the table:\nRow3 has points diff=15 (which is 30-15) \u2192 that's one.\nRow4 has points diff=5 (26-21). So both differences exist, but only in different rows.\n\nWait, the claim says \"point difference be 30 - 15 and 26 -21\". So in the table, Row3 has 30-15=15 and Row4 has 26-21=5. So both are present.\n\nBut the first part of the claim is about having 10 points on two occasions. Since only one row (Row2) has 10 points, that part fails.\n\nSo even though the point differences exist, the number of times points reach 10 is insufficient. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two instances of 10 points and two specific point differences. However, only one row has 10 points, making the first condition false. Despite both point differences being present, the overall claim fails due to the incorrect number of 10-point occasions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list out the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7\". So, I think it's saying that in all rows of the table, the number of draws doesn't exceed 3 and the number of losses also doesn't go beyond 7. Wait, actually, maybe I should parse it differently. It could mean for each row, the maximum between draws and losses shouldn't be more than 3 or 7 respectively? Or perhaps that in each row, neither draws nor losses exceed their respective numbers.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nEach row has games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. So, for each row, I need to check if the number of drawn (drawn) is no more than 3, and the number of lost is no more than 7.\n\nWait, but looking at the claim again: \"no draw more than 3\" probably means that in any given scenario, draws don't exceed 3. Similarly, losses don't exceed 7. So, for each row, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Is the number of drawn games <=3?\n2. Is the number of lost games <=7?\n\nWait, but looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: drawn=0, so okay.\nRow 2: drawn=0, okay.\nRow 3: drawn=1, okay.\nRow 4: drawn=1, okay.\nRow 5: drawn=1, okay.\nRow 6: drawn=0, okay.\nRow 7: drawn=1, okay.\nRow 8: drawn=0, okay.\n\nSo for all rows, the number of draws is 0,1. So no row has more than 3 draws, which satisfies the first condition.\n\nNow, checking losses:\n\nRow 1: lost=0\nRow 2: lost=2\nRow 3: lost=2\nRow 4: lost=2\nRow 5: lost=3\nRow 6: lost=5\nRow 7: lost=5\nRow 8: lost=7\n\nSo the maximum number of losses in any row is 7, which matches the second condition (no loss more than 7). So both conditions are satisfied for all rows.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"no draw more than 3\" and \"no loss more than 7\". So for each row, draws should be <=3 and losses <=7.\n\nSince in every row, the number of draws is either 0 or 1, which is definitely less than or equal to 3. And the maximum number of losses in any row is 7 (in Row8), so that also satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because all rows comply with the stated conditions regarding maximum draws and losses.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that no draw exceeds 3 and no loss exceeds 7 across all rows. Since each row's drawn count is at most 1 and the lost counts do not exceed 7, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
