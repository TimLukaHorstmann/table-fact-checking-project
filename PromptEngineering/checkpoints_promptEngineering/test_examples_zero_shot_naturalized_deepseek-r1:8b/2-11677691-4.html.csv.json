    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"connor mcgovern go to college in missouri\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that Connor McGovern attended college in Missouri.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has 12 rows, each representing a player with details like their name, position, school, hometown, and college. I need to find out if Connor McGovern is listed in any of these rows and whether his college is mentioned as Missouri.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nRow 1: Player is Connor McGovern, Position: Defensive Line, School: Shanley High School, Hometown: Fargo, North Dakota, College: Missouri.\n\nSo right away, I see that Connor McGovern is indeed in Row 1. His college is listed as Missouri. That directly supports the claim because it says he went to college in Missouri. \n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells, but since the claim is specifically about Connor McGovern and his college, only the row for him is important here. The position, school, hometown, etc., don't add more information related to the specific claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Connor McGovern's college is listed as Missouri in Row 1 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Kevin Mcreynolds went to college at UCLA and his hometown is Washington, DC.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Kevin Mcreynolds in the table. Looking through each row, I see that Row 2 has the player name as \"kevin mcreynolds\". So, his information is in Row 2.\n\nNext, I need to check two pieces of information: his college and his hometown. \n\nStarting with the college: The claim says he went to UCLA. In Row 2, under the 'college' column, it lists \"ucla\". Since the claim uses \"UCLA\" (with a capital U), but the table has it as \"ucla\", I think they are referring to the same institution. However, sometimes schools have different notations or cases might matter. But in this context, it's likely that \"UCLA\" and \"ucla\" refer to the same college, so this part checks out.\n\nNow, checking his hometown: The claim states it's Washington, DC. In Row 2, under 'hometown', it lists \"washington , dc\". Again, the claim uses \"Washington, DC\", which is essentially the same as \"washington , dc\" in the table. So this also matches.\n\nPutting it together, both pieces of information are correctly stated in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 5: player: trey depriest, position: linebacker,...\n\nSo, Trey Depriest is in row 5. Next, check his position. The claim says he plays linebacker, and looking at Row 5, his position is indeed linebacker. That seems to support the claim.\n\nNow, I should make sure there are no conflicting information. Let me scan through all rows quickly. Wait, row 5 says position: linebacker, while others in defensive line or linebacker positions don't mention Trey Depriest again, so it's just row 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying: it's asserting that Brandon Mullins' hometown is Coppell, Texas.\n\nFirst, I'll search through each row of the table to find the player named Brandon Mullins. Scanning the rows, I see Row 9: player: brandon mullins. That's the one we're interested in.\n\nNow, looking at Row 9, let's check the columns relevant to the claim. The claim is about his hometown, so the \"hometown\" column is crucial here. In Row 9, the hometown is listed as coppell, texas. That matches exactly what the claim is stating: Coppell, Texas.\n\nI also need to make sure there are no other relevant cells that might affect this check. The columns we look at for verification are only \"hometown\" and possibly others if needed, but in this case, just checking \"hometown\" suffices since the claim is specifically about that attribute.\n\nSo, all the information needed is present in Row 9's \"hometown\" column, which fully supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"hometown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"jabriel washington go to trinity christian academy and play defensive back.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for Jabriel Washington in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that Row 12 lists a player named Jabriel Washington. His position is listed as defensive back. \n\nNext, I check his school. According to Row 12, his school is Trinity Christian Academy. So both parts of the claim are correct: he attends Trinity Christian Academy and plays defensive back.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this claim. For his school, it's Column \"school\" in Row 12. For his position, it's Column \"position\" in Row 12. Therefore, the relevant cells are row_index 12 for both \"school\" and \"position.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, Connor's information is in Row 1.\n\nNow, I need to check where Connor attended high school. Looking at Column \"school\" in Row 1, it says Shanley High School. That means Connor went to Shanley High School, not St John's High School as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim made about Connor McGovern attending St John's High School is incorrect.

The claim is: \"Kevin Mcreynolds be from Washington DC and go to college at Virginia Tech.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Kevin Mcreynolds exists in the table. Let me scan through each row's player name.\n\nLooking at Row 2: player: kevin mcreynolds. Yep, that's him. So he is in the table.\n\nNow, the claim has two parts. The first part says he is from Washington DC. So I need to check his hometown. In Row 2, the hometown is \"washington , dc\". That matches, so the first part is correct.\n\nNext, the second part says he went to college at Virginia Tech. Let's look at his college. In Row 2, the college is \"ucla.\" Hmm, that's University of California Los Angeles, not Virginia Tech. So this part doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, so even though the first part of the claim is true, the second part isn't. But does that mean the entire claim is false? Because both parts need to be correct for the whole statement to be TRUE, right?\n\nSo, because the college in the table doesn't match Virginia Tech but is UCLA, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The player's name is Row 2, so row_index 1 (since it starts from 0). For the first part, the hometown is \"hometown\" column. For the second part, the college is in the \"college\" column.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"Washington DC and go to college at Virginia Tech.\" So both pieces of information are needed. Therefore, I need to include the relevant cells for both parts.\n\nSo Row 2 has two columns: hometown and college. That means row_index 1 with both \"hometown\" and \"college\" as relevant columns.\n\nBut wait, in the instructions, it says to list a list of objects each with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string). So for Row 2, we have two cells: hometown and college. Therefore, I should include both.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"hometown\"},\n  {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"college\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions both aspects, so both columns are needed to verify.
