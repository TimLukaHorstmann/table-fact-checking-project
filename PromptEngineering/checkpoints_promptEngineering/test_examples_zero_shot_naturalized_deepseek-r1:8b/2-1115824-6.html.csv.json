    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the Prudential Tower's street address is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the street address for the prudential tower building be 800 boylston street.\" So, it's asserting that the Prudential Tower is located at 800 Boylston Street.\n\nNow, I need to check this against the table provided. Let me go through each row to find the relevant information about the Prudential Tower.\n\nLooking at Row 6: name: prudential tower, street address: 800 boylston street, years as tallest: 1964 - 1976, height ft (m): 04.0 749 (228), floors: 52. \n\nSo, in Row 6, the street address is listed as 800 Boylston Street. That matches exactly what the claim is saying.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The table has columns like name, street address, years as tallest, height ft (m), and floors. Since the claim is specifically about the street address, I only need to look at that column. \n\nTherefore, the street address for the Prudential Tower is indeed 800 Boylston Street according to the table. There's no discrepancy or conflicting information here.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe street address of the Prudential Tower in the table matches the address stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"street address\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Prudential Tower having 52 floors is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading the problem and the data.\n\nThe table has seven rows, each representing a different building with various attributes like name, street address, years as tallest, height in feet (including both meters and the conversion), and floors. The claim specifically mentions that \"the prudential tower have 52 floor.\" I need to check if this is correct by looking at the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which row corresponds to the Prudential Tower. Looking through the names:\n\n- Row 1: old state house\n- Row 2: old north church\n- Row 3: park street church\n- Row 4: church of the covenant\n- Row 5: custom house tower\n- Row 6: prudential tower\n- Row 7: hancock place\n\nSo, Prudential Tower is in Row 6. Now, I need to look at the columns related to this row that could verify the claim about the number of floors.\n\nIn the table, each row has several pieces of information:\n\n1. name\n2. street address\n3. years as tallest\n4. height ft (m): which includes both feet and meters, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n5. floors\n\nThe claim is about the number of floors, so the most relevant column would be \"floors.\" Additionally, maybe the \"name\" and \"street address\" could be used to confirm it's the correct row, but for the floors specifically, only the \"floors\" column is directly relevant.\n\nSo, looking at Row 6 (Prudential Tower), under the \"floors\" column, the value is 52. That matches the claim exactly: \"the prudential tower have 52 floor.\" Wait, the claim uses \"floor\" singular, but in the table it's plural as \"floors.\" Does that matter? Well, the claim says \"have 52 floor,\" which might be a typo, using singular instead of plural. But in terms of content, the number is correct.\n\nTherefore, since Row 6's \"floors\" column states 52, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells to check are the \"name\" and \"floors\" columns for Row 6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the custom house tower have thirty - 2 floor\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that the Custom House Tower has \"thirty - 2 floor.\" That seems a bit confusing at first glance. I think it might mean either 30 floors or 32 floors, but there's a typo with the dash and space. Regardless, I need to check what information is provided about the Custom House Tower in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building. The Custom House Tower is listed as Row 5. Let me focus on Row 5: name: custom house tower, street address: 3 mckinley square, years as tallest: 1915 - 1964, height ft (m): 05.0 496 (151), floors: 32.\n\nSo, from the table, I can see that the Custom House Tower has 32 floors. The claim mentions \"thirty - 2 floor,\" which likely refers to either 30 or 32 floors. Since it's saying \"have thirty-2 floor,\" it could be a typo for \"32 floors.\" But I need to check if 32 is correct.\n\nLooking at Row 5 again, the 'floors' column clearly states 32. Therefore, the claim that the Custom House Tower has 30 or 32 floors seems accurate because one of those numbers is explicitly stated as correct.\n\nWait a second, but the claim says \"thirty-2 floor.\" If it's trying to say 30, that would be incorrect since the table shows 32. However, if it's a typo and they meant 32, then it's correct. Since the exact wording in the claim isn't precise, I should consider both possibilities.\n\nBut according to the table, the Custom House Tower has 32 floors. So, if the claim is stating that it has 30 or 32 floors, and one of those matches exactly (32), then part of the claim is true. However, since the exact wording says \"thirty-2,\" which might mean 30, but the actual number is 32, does that make the entire claim false?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"thirty-2\" was intended to denote 32 floors, as in thirty (30) minus two (so 28), which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a typo for 32. This ambiguity makes it tricky.\n\nGiven that in the table, the floors are listed as 32, and assuming the claim is trying to reference that number correctly, I think the intended meaning was 32 floors. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because the Custom House Tower does have 32 floors as per the table.\n\nWait, but if the claim says \"thirty-2 floor,\" maybe it's a way of denoting 30 floors minus 2, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's meant to say 30 floors and 2 more, making 32. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the information in the table, it has 32 floors, so if the claim is asserting that, even with some ambiguity in wording, it's technically correct because one of the numbers mentioned (32) aligns with the data.\n</think>\n\nThe Custom House Tower has 32 floors according to the table. The claim mentions \"thirty-2 floor,\" which could be interpreted as 30 or possibly 32. Since 32 is accurate, the claim is true.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim says: \"the building on 800 boylston street have fifty - 2 floor.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the street address is 800 Boylston Street. Scanning through the table, Row 6 has the address 800 Boylston Street. So that's relevant. The column we need here is \"floors.\"\n\nNow, looking at Row 6 under \"floors,\" it says 52 floors. The claim mentions \"fifty - 2 floor.\" Wait, does that mean 52? Hmm, \"fifty-2\" would be 52. So the number of floors is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's any other part of the claim that needs verification. The street address part seems to match exactly with Row 6, and the floors match as well. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check two aspects: the address and the number of floors.\n\n1. **Street Address**: The claim specifies \"800 Boylston Street,\" which matches Row 6 in the table.\n2. **Number of Floors**: The claim states \"fifty-2 floor,\" which is equivalent to 52 floors, as indicated by Row 6's \"floors\" column.\n\nSince both parts are correctly supported by the data, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 5: name: custom house tower\n\nSo, we're focusing on Row 5. Now, the claim is about the number of floors. The relevant column for this would be the \"floors\" column because it directly relates to the number of floors.\n\nLooking at Row 5's floors value: floors: 32.\n\nSo, the custom house tower has 32 floors according to the table. The claim states that it should have only 1 floor, but the table clearly shows it has 32. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to map this out in JSON format. The relevant cells would be Row 5 and the \"floors\" column. So, the row index is 5 (since rows start at 0 or 1? Wait, looking back, the first row is Row 1, so it's 1-based indexing. But the example given in the instructions shows row_index as starting from 0, so maybe that's a mistake. Let me check the example:\n\nIn the sample JSON, the relevant_cells are [{\"row_index\": 0, ...}, ...]. So, it seems like rows are 0-indexed even though the table is presented as Row 1 to Row 7.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, the first row is Row 1: old state house, so if we're following that, row indices would be from 1 to 7. However, the example shows \"row_index\": 0 and another one for employees. So perhaps the rows are 0-indexed despite being labeled as 1 in the table.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check again. The sample JSON has:\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n]\n\nSo, it seems like row_index starts at 0 for Row 1 in the table, meaning each row is offset by -1. So, the first row in the table (Row 1) corresponds to row_index: 0.\n\nTherefore, for Row 5 in the table, which is \"custom house tower,\" the row_index would be 4 because it's the fifth row, starting from 0.\n\nWait no, let me count:\n\n- Row 1: index 0\n- Row 2: index 1\n- Row 3: index 2\n- Row 4: index 3\n- Row 5: index 4\n\nYes, so Row 5 in the table corresponds to row_index 4.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be [ { \"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"floors\"} ].\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"floors\"}]}",

But given the context and the term used in the claim (\"most amount of floor\"), it's likely referring to the number of floors as a measure of height.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there is a misunderstanding about how the data is presented. For example, in Row 6, \"floors\" is listed as 52, which seems high but possible for skyscrapers. Similarly, Hancock Place has 60 floors, making it taller than Prudential Tower.\n\nTherefore, since the building on 800 Boylston Street (Prudential Tower) does not have more floors than Hancock Place, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"floors\"}]}",
