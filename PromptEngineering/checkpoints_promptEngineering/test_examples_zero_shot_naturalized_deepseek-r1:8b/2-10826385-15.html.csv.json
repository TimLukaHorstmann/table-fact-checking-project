    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"melbourne have the lowest score when playing as the away team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table involve Melbourne as the away team. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Footscray, away is St Kilda.\nRow 2: Home is Fitzroy, away is North Melbourne.\nRow 3: Home is Essendon, away is Richmond.\nRow 4: Home is Carlton, away is South Melbourne.\nRow 5: Home is Hawthorn, away is Geelong.\nRow 6: Home is Collingwood, away is Melbourne.\n\nSo, the only row where Melbourne is the away team is Row 6. That's relevant because it's the only instance we need to check for their score when they are away.\n\nNow, I need to look at Melbourne's score in that row. According to the table, Melbourne scored 8.10 (58) as the away team in Row 6. To determine if this is the lowest score, I should compare it with all other away scores in the table.\n\nLet me list out all the away teams and their scores:\n\n- St Kilda: 9.11 (65)\n- North Melbourne: 9.12 (66)\n- Richmond: 17.9 (111)\n- South Melbourne: 8.15 (63)\n- Geelong: 15.8 (98)\n- Melbourne: 8.10 (58)\n\nNow, I can see that Melbourne's score is 58, which is lower than St Kilda (65), North Melbourne (66), Richmond (111), South Melbourne (63), and Geelong (98). So Melbourne does have the lowest away team score in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are in Row 6 for the away team's score.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"Melbourne have the lowest score when playing as the away team,\" we need to check all away teams' scores. Only Melbourne's away game is in Row 6, with a score of 58, which is indeed lower than other away scores.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim about the Collingwood vs Melbourne game having the largest crowd size is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the collingwood v melbourne game have the largest crowd size.\" So, it's specifically about that game and whether its crowd was the largest among all games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows, each representing a different match. Each row includes information about both teams, their scores, the venue, crowd size, and the date, which is all 15 July 1972. So, all games are on the same day.\n\nI need to focus on the 'crowd' column because the claim is about crowd size. Let me list out each game's crowd number:\n\nRow 1: Footscray vs St Kilda \u2013 18,655\nRow 2: Fitzroy vs North Melbourne \u2013 7,007\nRow 3: Essendon vs Richmond \u2013 22,251\nRow 4: Carlton vs South Melbourne \u2013 14,465\nRow 5: Hawthorn vs Geelong \u2013 12,425\nRow 6: Collingwood vs Melbourne \u2013 30,883\n\nNow, the claim is about Collingwood vs Melbourne. Their crowd number is 30,883.\n\nI need to check if this is the largest. Let me compare it with others:\n\n- Footscray: 18,655 (less than 30k)\n- Fitzroy: 7,007 (much less)\n- Essendon: 22,251 (also less)\n- Carlton: 14,465 (nope)\n- Hawthorn: 12,425 (still less)\n- Collingwood: 30,883 (the highest so far)\n\nLooking at the crowd sizes, Collingwood vs Melbourne has the highest number. None of the other games have a higher figure than 30k.\n\nSo, the claim should be TRUE because their crowd size is indeed the largest in the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells to verify are the crowd numbers for each game, with Collingwood vs Melbourne having the highest at 30,883.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the crowd at the fitzroy vs north melbourne game be smaller than the crowd at the essendon v richmond game.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The claim mentions two games: FitzyRoy vs North Melbourne and Essendon vs Richmond. So I'll look for these home teams in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 2: Home team is Fitzroy, away is North Melbourne. The crowd for this game is 7007.\n\nRow 3: Home team is Essendon, away is Richmond. Their crowd is 22251.\n\nNow, comparing the two crowds: FitzyRoy's game had 7007 attendees, while Essendon's game had 22,251 attendees. So 7007 is definitely smaller than 22251.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game is smaller is TRUE. The relevant cells are in row 2 for FitzyRoy's crowd and row 3 for Essendon's crowd.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about the crowd sizes, we need to compare the specific rows mentioned:\n\n- **Fitzroy vs North Melbourne**: Row 2, crowd = 7007\n- **Essendon vs Richmond**: Row 3, crowd = 22251\n\nSince 7007 (Fitzroy) is less than 22251 (Essendon), the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the average of all the home team score be 15.67\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly needs to be checked.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to identify which ones are relevant. The claim mentions the home team scores, so I should focus on the \"home team score\" column for all rows.\n\nThere are six rows in total. I'll list out the home team scores from each row:\n\n1. Row 1: 14.7 (91)\n2. Row 2: 16.14 (110)\n3. Row 3: 13.12 (90)\n4. Row 4: 20.8 (128)\n5. Row 5: 19.14 (128)\n6. Row 6: 10.13 (73)\n\nNext, I need to calculate the average of these scores. To do that accurately, I'll convert each score into a decimal format because the claim uses decimals.\n\nLet's go through each one:\n\n1. 14.7 (91) \u2192 91 points\n2. 16.14 (110) \u2192 110 points\n3. 13.12 (90) \u2192 90 points\n4. 20.8 (128) \u2192 128 points\n5. 19.14 (128) \u2192 128 points\n6. 10.13 (73) \u2192 73 points\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n91 + 110 = 201  \n201 + 90 = 291  \n291 + 128 = 419  \n419 + 128 = 547  \n547 + 73 = 620\n\nSo the total is 620 points across six games.\n\nTo find the average, I divide the total by the number of home teams, which is 6:\n\n620 \u00f7 6 \u2248 103.333...\n\nWait a minute, that's not matching the claim at all. The claim says the average is 15.67, but my calculation shows approximately 103.33. That's way higher than 15.67.\n\nI must have made a mistake somewhere because the scores in the table are way higher than 15 points. Let me double-check each conversion from goals and behinds to total points.\n\nIn Australian rules football, the scoring system is as follows:\n\n- A goal (G) is worth 6 points.\n- A behind (B) is worth 1 point.\n- So for example, 14.7 would be 14 goals and 7 behinds: 14*6 +7 =84 +7=91.\n\nSimilarly, 16.14 would be 16*6 +14=96+14=110. That part seems correct.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the average of home team scores being 15.67. But according to my calculations, each home team scored over 90 points on average. That's nowhere near 15.67.\n\nIs there a misunderstanding here? Maybe the user meant the average per game or something else. But looking at the table, the \"home team score\" is in the format of goals and behinds, so it's definitely higher than 15 for each home team.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because the actual average is much higher.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the average of all the home team scores is 15.67 is FALSE. The calculated average based on the table is significantly higher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"melbourne have the second lowest score when playing as the away team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a game with details like home team, their score, away team, away team's score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim specifically mentions Melbourne as the away team and talks about their scores.\n\nI need to identify all instances where Melbourne is listed as the away team in the table because that's directly relevant to the claim. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home team is Footscray, so Melbourne isn't here.\n- Row 2: Away team is North Melbourne; nope.\n- Row 3: Away team is Richmond; no.\n- Row 4: Away team is South Melbourne; not Melbourne.\n- Row 5: Away team is Geelong; no.\n- Row 6: Here, the away team is Melbourne. So that's one game.\n\nWait, only one row has Melbourne as the away team. That means I need to check their score in that particular game.\n\nLooking at Row 6:\n- Home team: Collingwood with a score of 10.13 (73).\n- Away team: Melbourne with a score of 8.10 (58).\n\nSo, Melbourne's score when playing away is 8.10 (58). The claim says they have the second lowest score. I need to check all away teams' scores to see if that holds.\n\nLet me list out all the away team scores from each row:\n\n1. Row 1: St Kilda - 9.11 (65)\n2. Row 2: North Melbourne - 9.12 (66)\n3. Row 3: Richmond - 17.9 (111)\n4. Row 4: South Melbourne - 8.15 (63)\n5. Row 5: Geelong - 15.8 (98)\n6. Row 6: Melbourne - 8.10 (58)\n\nNow, I'll rank these scores from lowest to highest:\n\n- South Melbourne: 8.15 (63)\n- Melbourne: 8.10 (58)\n- St Kilda: 9.11 (65)\n- North Melbourne: 9.12 (66)\n- Geelong: 15.8 (98)\n- Richmond: 17.9 (111)\n\nSo, the order is South Melbourne lowest, then Melbourne, followed by St Kilda, etc.\n\nThe claim says Melbourne has the second lowest score as an away team. Based on this ranking, that would mean they are indeed in the second position. However, I should double-check if there's another away team with a lower score than Melbourne but higher than South Melbourne. \n\nLooking at the scores:\n- South Melbourne: 8.15 (63)\n- Melbourne: 8.10 (58)\n\nWait, actually, 8.10 is less than 8.15 because in scoring, the numbers are compared as follows: 8.10 (58) is lower than 8.15 (63). So, South Melbourne has a higher score than Melbourne when both have 8 points.\n\nTherefore, South Melbourne's score is higher than Melbourne's, making Melbourne's away score the second lowest. \n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because Melbourne indeed has the second lowest score as an away team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe claim is: \"1 / 3 of the away team have a score greater than 10.\" So, I need to check if for each away team in the table, one-third of their players scored more than 10 points.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. Each row has information about home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant columns here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"home team score,\" and \"away team score.\" Since the claim is about the away team's scores, I'll focus on the \"away team score\" column.\n\nI should go through each row and check the corresponding away team's scores to see if one-third of them exceed 10 points. Let me list out all the away teams and their scores:\n\n1. St Kilda: 9.11 (65)\n2. North Melbourne: 9.12 (66)\n3. Richmond: 17.9 (111)\n4. South Melbourne: 8.15 (63)\n5. Geelong: 15.8 (98)\n6. Melbourne: 8.10 (58)\n\nWait, but looking at the table again:\n\nRow 1: away team is St Kilda with score 9.11 (65)\nRow 2: away team is North Melbourne with 9.12 (66)\nRow 3: away team is Richmond with 17.9 (111)\nRow 4: away team is South Melbourne with 8.15 (63)\nRow 5: away team is Geelong with 15.8 (98)\nRow 6: away team is Melbourne with 8.10 (58)\n\nWait, that's correct. Now, for each of these away teams, I need to see if one-third have scores greater than 10.\n\nBut wait, how are the scores structured? They're in the format \"goals.behinds (total points).\" So, for example, St Kilda scored 9 goals and 11 behinds, totaling 65 points.\n\nI think each score is per team, not per player. Wait, no, in Australian rules football, the scoring system is that a goal is 6 points and a behind is 1 point. So, \"9.11 (65)\" means 9 goals and 11 behinds, which is 9*6 + 11 = 54 + 11 = 65 points.\n\nBut wait, does each player have individual scores? No, I think the away team's total score is listed. So for example, in Row 1, St Kilda's total score is 65, not per player.\n\nWait a second, this might be a misunderstanding. The table lists \"away team score,\" but does that refer to each player or the total? Typically, in sports tables, the away team's total points are listed, not individual players' scores.\n\nSo if the claim is about one-third of the away team having scores greater than 10, it's referring to their total scores. So, for each away team, how many (if any) have a score >10?\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because all teams scored well over 10 points. For example, St Kilda has 65, which is way above 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's not about the total score of the away team, but about individual players on the away team. So, for each away team, how many players scored more than 10 points? But in that case, we don't have player-level data here; the table only gives team totals.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. The claim says \"1 / 3 of the away team have a score greater than 10.\" If it's referring to individual players, but we don't have their scores, then perhaps it's about the team's total score. But that doesn't make much sense because all teams scored over 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misinterpreted and refers to something else. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, each row has \"away team score\" as a single number in parentheses. For example, St Kilda: 9.11 (65), which I think means their total points scored in that game is 65. So if we're considering individual players on the away team, but without knowing how many players each away team has or their individual scores, this becomes tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo and actually refers to something else, like points per quarter or something else entirely. Alternatively, maybe the claim is misinterpreted and should be about the total team score being greater than 10 for one-third of the teams.\n\nBut let's see:\n\n- St Kilda: 65 >10 \u2192 yes\n- North Melbourne: 66 >10 \u2192 yes\n- Richmond: 111 >10 \u2192 yes\n- South Melbourne:63>10\u2192yes\n- Geelong:98>10\u2192yes\n- Melbourne:58>10\u2192yes\n\nSo all away teams have scores above 10, which would mean more than 1/3 of them (actually all) have scores over 10. So the claim is \"1/3\" but in reality, it's 6/6, so the statement is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding again. Maybe the claim refers to something else, like per player or per game segments. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about the home team, but no, it's about the away team.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scores are in points per game, and we're looking at individual players' performance. But without knowing how many players each away team has, we can't determine if one-third of them scored over 10.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me check the data again.\n\nThe table lists for each row:\n\n- Home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nSo for each away team, their total score is given. So perhaps the claim is that one-third of the away teams have a total score greater than 10 points.\n\nLooking at the six away teams:\n\nSt Kilda:65 >10 \u2192 yes\nNorth Melbourne:66>10\u2192yes\nRichmond:111>10\u2192yes\nSouth Melbourne:63>10\u2192yes\nGeelong:98>10\u2192yes\nMelbourne:58>10\u2192yes\n\nAll 6 have scores over 10. So the number of away teams with score >10 is 6, which is more than one-third (which would be about 2). Therefore, the claim \"1/3 of the away team have a score greater than 10\" is false because all of them do.\n\nBut wait, if the claim is that for each away team, one-third of their players scored over 10, but without knowing how many players are on each team or their individual scores, we can't verify this. So perhaps the claim is about something else, like points per quarter or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a misinterpretation and should be read as \"points for\" rather than \"against,\" but that wouldn't change anything.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the score is in goals, where 10 goals would be a certain number of points. But in that case, 9.11 (65) is 65 points, which are above 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about something else entirely, like time played or possession stats, but without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nBut given the information provided, all away teams have scores well over 10, so if the claim is that one-third of them do, then the statement is false because all six do. Therefore, the answer would be that the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"1/3 of the away team have a score greater than 10\" is false. All six away teams scored more than 10 points, not just one-third.\n\nAnswer: The claim is false because all six away teams have scores exceeding 10 points.",

Let me start by carefully analyzing both games' attendance numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant rows in the table. The Fitzy vs North Melbourne game is Row 2, and the Essendon vs Richmond game is Row 3. \n\nLooking at the crowd numbers:\n- Fitzy vs North Melbourne had a crowd of 7,007.\n- Essendon vs Richmond had a crowd of 22,251.\n\nThe claim states that more people attended the Fitzy game than the Essendon game. However, comparing the two, it's clear that 7,007 is less than 22,251. Therefore, the statement doesn't hold true because more people actually attended the Essendon game than the Fitzy one.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the Essendon vs Richmond game had a higher attendance of 22,251 compared to Fitzroy's 7,007 attendees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the average of all the home team score be less than 12\". \n\nFirst, I should figure out which cells in the table are relevant for verifying this claim. The key part here is calculating the average of the home team scores and then checking if that average is less than 12.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"home team score\" value. So, I need to look at the \"home team score\" column across all rows. There are six rows in total (from Row 1 to Row 6), so I'll extract those scores and calculate their average.\n\nLet me list out the home team scores from each row:\n\nRow 1: 14.7 (91)\nRow 2: 16.14 (110)\nRow 3: 13.12 (90)\nRow 4: 20.8 (128)\nRow 5: 19.14 (128)\nRow 6: 10.13 (73)\n\nNow, I need to sum all these scores and then divide by the total number of rows (which is 6) to find the average.\n\nLet me add them up:\n\n91 + 110 = 201\n201 + 90 = 291\n291 + 128 = 419\n419 + 128 = 547\n547 + 73 = 620\n\nSo, the total sum of home team scores is 620. Now, divide that by 6 to get the average:\n\n620 / 6 \u2248 103.333...\n\nWait, that can't be right because 103.33 is way higher than 12. That would mean the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nRow 1: 91\nRow 2: 110 \u2192 total so far: 201\nRow 3: 90 \u2192 total: 291\nRow 4: 128 \u2192 total: 419\nRow 5: 128 \u2192 total: 547\nRow 6: 73 \u2192 total: 620\n\nYes, that's correct. So the average is approximately 103.333.\n\nSince 103.33 is much greater than 12, the claim that the average of all home team scores is less than 12 is definitely FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10\" is true based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It says that more than half of the away teams have scores above 10 points. So, I need to check each row where there's an away team and see if their score exceeds 10.\n\nLooking at the table, it has six rows, each representing a different game. Each row lists both home and away teams along with their scores, venue, crowd, and date. The date is consistent across all rows, which might mean these games were played on the same day, possibly in different venues.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to find out how many away teams have a score greater than 10.\n\nRow 1: Home team Footscray scored 14.7 (91), and the away team St Kilda scored 9.11 (65). The away team's score is 65, which is more than 10? Wait, no\u2014wait, in Australian rules football, scores are in goals and behinds, written as Goals.Behinds (Total Points). So, for example, a score like 14.7 (91) means 14 goals and 7 behinds, totaling 91 points. Similarly, St Kilda has 9.11 (65), which is 9 goals and 11 behinds.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"scores greater than 10.\" Now I'm a bit confused because in some contexts, people might refer to total points or perhaps something else. But looking at the scores:\n\nIn Row 1: St Kilda away team scored 65 points. Is 65 > 10? Yes, it is.\n\nRow 2: Away team North Melbourne scored 66 points (9.12). That's also greater than 10.\n\nRow 3: Away team Richmond scored 111 points (17.9). 111 is definitely more than 10.\n\nRow 4: Away team South Melbourne scored 63 points (8.15). 63 > 10? Yes, it is.\n\nRow 5: Away team Geelong scored 98 points (15.8). That's greater than 10.\n\nRow 6: Away team Melbourne scored 58 points (8.10). 58 > 10? Yes.\n\nWait a second\u2014that would mean all away teams in the table have scores over 10. Let me count them:\n\nSt Kilda:65, North Melbourne:66, Richmond:111, South Melbourne:63, Geelong:98, Melbourne:58.\n\nSo that's six away teams, each with scores greater than 10? But that can't be possible because in any set of six, more than half is four or more. So if all six are over 10, then yes, more than half (which would be three) have scores greater than 10. Wait, but six away teams\u2014more than half would mean at least three, which they all satisfy. But the claim says \"more than half,\" so if it's more than half, like four or five or six, it's still true.\n\nWait, but let me check each row again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Maybe I misread some of the scores.\n\nRow 1: St Kilda away score is 9.11 (65). So yes, that's correct.\n\nRow 2: North Melbourne is away with 9.12 (66).\n\nRow3: Richmond is away with 17.9 (111). Correct.\n\nRow4: South Melbourne away score is 8.15 (63). Yes.\n\nRow5: Geelong away scored 15.8 (98). Yes.\n\nRow6: Melbourne away scored 8.10 (58). That's correct.\n\nSo all six away teams have scores greater than 10. Therefore, more than half of them (which would be at least three) indeed have scores over 10. Since there are six away teams, exactly six, so more than half is four or more. Here, all six meet the condition, which definitely satisfies \"more than half.\"\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in the table, each row has a home and away team. So there are six games, each with one away team. That's why there are six away teams listed.\n\nSo yes, all six away teams have scores over 10, so more than half (which would be three or more) is definitely true.\n\nWait, but let me think again: more than half of the away teams in the table. How many rows are we considering? Each row is a game with one away team, so there are six games, hence six away teams. More than half of six is more than 3, i.e., at least four.\n\nSince all six have scores over 10, this condition is certainly met. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because all six away teams have scores greater than 10, which means more than half (all) satisfy the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
