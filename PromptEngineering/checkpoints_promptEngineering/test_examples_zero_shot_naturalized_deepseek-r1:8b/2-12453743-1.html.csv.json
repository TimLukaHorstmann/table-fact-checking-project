Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the inegi code for mexicali , which have an area of 12 , 700 km be 2.0\". So, I need to find if there's a row with the inegi code as 2.0, the municipality is mexicali, and its area is 12,700 km\u00b2.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: inegi code 1, ensenada, area 52482.4 km\u00b2.\nRow 2: inegi code 2, mexicali, area 13700.0 km\u00b2.\nRow 3: inegi code 3, tecate, area 3079.0 km\u00b2.\nRow 4: inegi code 4, tijuana, area 879.2 km\u00b2.\nRow 5: inegi code 5, playas de rosarito, area 513.32 km\u00b2.\n\nFirst, check for inegi code 2 and mexicali. Yes, Row 2 matches both conditions with an inegi code of 2 and the municipality being mexicali.\n\nNow, check the area. The claim mentions 12,700 km\u00b2, but Row 2 has an area of 13,700.0 km\u00b2. Wait, that's a difference\u2014maybe a typo? The claim says \"12 , 700\" which could be a formatting issue, perhaps meaning 12,700 or 12700. But the actual value is 13,700 km\u00b2.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy here. The area in Row 2 is 13,700, not 12,700 as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the area doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. No, Row 2's area is indeed 13700.0 km\u00b2. So the claim's area figure is off by 1,000 km\u00b2. That makes the claim FALSE.\n\nAlso, checking the rest of the columns: inegi code is correct as 2 for mexicali, so that part is right. But since the area doesn't match, the entire statement is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"area (km2)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
