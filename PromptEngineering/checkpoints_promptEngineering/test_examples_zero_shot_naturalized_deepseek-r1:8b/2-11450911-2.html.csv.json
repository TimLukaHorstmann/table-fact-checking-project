First, I should carefully analyze the claim and then check each relevant row in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions \"keiko tamai,\" but looking at the table, I don't see a fighter with that name. The opponents listed are shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, jan finney, mamiko mamiko, hitomi akano, kamei natsuko, megumi fujii, natsuko kikukawa, roxanne modafferi, hikaru shinohara, lee hee - jin, hitomi akano again, yumiko sugimoto, kumiko maekawa, ha na kim, hikiroku (I think this might be a typo for someone else), hari hari, yuiga yuiga, kaoru ito, akino akino, natsuko kikukawa again, yuiga yuiga again, kazue terui, yuuki kondo, mika harigae, and etsuko kato. None of these are \"keiko tamai.\"\n\nSo, if \"keiko tamai\" isn't in the table, it might mean that the claim is false because she doesn't have any matches here. Alternatively, maybe the name is misspelled or not present, which would also make the statement false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim refers to a fighter who hasn't won their first match yet? Or maybe \"keiko tamai\" is an alias for someone else. Let me check again. The table has 28 rows with various fighters and their results. I don't see any row where the opponent is keiko tamai, which suggests that she either didn't fight in this context or the name was misspelled.\n\nIf the claim says she lost twice after winning her first match, but if she didn't win a match here, then it's false. Alternatively, even if she did win one, does she lose two more? But since there's no data on her, the claim can't be verified as true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on a fighter named \"keiko tamai\" who supposedly lost twice after winning her first match. Upon reviewing the table, there is no fighter by that name listed, meaning the premise of the claim isn't supported by the provided data. Therefore, the claim must be considered false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Fighter:** The claim refers to \"keiko tamai,\" which isn't present in any row of the table.\n2. **Check for Any Matches:** Since there's no record of her fighting, there's no basis for evaluating wins or losses.\n3. **Conclusion:** Without evidence of her participating, the statement cannot be true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to figure out whether the claim \"keiko tamia win 1 time by tko and lose 1 time by tko\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Keiko Tamia winning once via TKO (Technical Knockout) and losing once also via TKO. So, in total, she should have one win and one loss, both by TKO methods.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists fight results for various opponents, each with details like outcome (res), record before the fight (record), opponent's name, method of loss or win, round, and time. The rows go from 1 to 28, so I should check through these to find any entries where Keiko Tamia is involved.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for \"keiko tamia\" as the res (result) or opponent. Wait, actually, in this table, it seems that each row represents a fighter's fight result. So, each row might be about Keiko Tamia's own fights, but I'm not sure if the opponent is her. Alternatively, she could be the fighter, and the opponent is someone else.\n\nWait, no, looking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 1: res: loss, record:14-14... Opponent: shayna baszler, method: submission (neck crank). So each row seems to represent a fight that Keiko Tamia had. Because in Row 5, for example, she wins against mamiko mamiko with a submission armbar.\n\nWait, no, maybe the table is listing all fights across multiple fighters, so each row is about a fighter's victory or loss. But I need to confirm if \"keiko tamia\" is listed as either the res or the opponent in any of these rows.\n\nWait, looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent: shayna baszler. So Keiko Tamia lost to her via submission. No mention of her winning here.\n\nRow 2: Opponent: marloes coenen, she lost again by submission.\n\nRow 3: Opponent: michiko takeda, loss by decision.\n\nRow 4: res is win, opponent: jan finney, method: submission armbar.\n\nSo Keiko Tamia has one win here. Now, in the claim, she should have one loss via TKO as well.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 5: Win over mamiko mamiko by armbar.\n\nRow 6: Loss to hitomi akano via armbar.\n\nRow7: Win over kamei natsuko via armbar.\n\nRow8: Loss to megumi fujii via armbar.\n\nRow9: Loss to natsuko kikukawa via TKO.\n\nWait, here in Row9, the method is tko. So Keiko Tamia lost to natsuko kikukawa via TKO.\n\nThat's one loss by TKO. Now, does she have a win by TKO?\n\nLooking through the rest of the rows:\n\nRows 10-28: I don't see any more entries where the res is \"win\" and method is tko. Let me check each row quickly.\n\nRow4: Win via armbar, not tko.\n\nRow5: Win via armbar.\n\nRow7: Armbar again.\n\nRow25: Decision win.\n\nRow28: Win via armbar.\n\nSo in all her wins, she uses methods like submission armbar or decision, but I don't see any where the method is tko. Therefore, she hasn't won by TKO according to this table.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row for \"tko\". Because sometimes it might be abbreviated differently, but in the given data, the methods are listed as:\n\n- submission (neck crank), submission (armbar), etc., and then tko appears once in Row9. So only one loss via tko.\n\nSince there's no win by tko, the claim that she won 1 time by tko is false. Therefore, the entire statement is false because she has one loss by tko but zero wins by tko.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\", and I need to point out which rows are relevant. The row where she lost via tko is Row9, so that's the only relevant cell for her losses. Since there's no win via tko, that's all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Keiko Tamia has one win by TKO and one loss by TKO. From the table, we found that she has a loss via TKO (Row9) but no wins recorded as TKO. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So maybe Keiko Tamia isn't in this table at all.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each row again. The opponents listed are shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, jan finney, mamiko mamiko, hitomi akano, kamei natsuko, megumi fujii, natsuko kikukawa, roxanne modafferi, hikaru shinohara, lee hee - jin, hitomi akano again, yumiko sugimoto, kumiko maekawa, ha na kim, hikaru shinohara again, hari hari, yuiga yuiga, kaoru ito, akino akino, natsuko kikukawa, yuiga yuiga again, kazue terui, yuuki kondo, mika harigae, and etsuko kato.

Perhaps \"keiko tamia\" is a typo or different name. Or perhaps Keiko Tamia is not present in this table at all. So if the claim is about her losing once after the second round, but she didn't have any losses recorded here, then the claim isn't supported.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table doesn't include all her matches. But based on the data given, there's no row where she lost or won.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false based on the given table. The claim is about Keiko Tamai's record in matches ending with a unanimous decision being 7-2. \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows in the table pertain to Keiko Tamai. Looking through each row, the names listed are Keiko Tamia? Hmm, actually, looking at the opponent names, I don't see a fighter named Keiko Tamai. Wait, maybe I misread it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the opponents are: shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, etc. The name \"Keiko Tamai\" doesn't appear as an opponent in any of these rows. Maybe Keiko Tamai is the fighter whose record we need to check. So I should look for a fighter named Keiko Tamai in the table.\n\nLooking through each row's res column: it shows the result as win or loss, but the names are opponents. Wait, perhaps the table only lists the opponents and their methods, not the fighters themselves. That might mean that the rows don't include information about Keiko Tamai's own matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for any row where the opponent is Keiko Tamai, which would indicate that the fighter in question has fought against her. But I don't see any rows with \"Keiko Tamai\" as the opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if there are any results where Keiko Tamai was the fighter and ended a match with a unanimous decision. So maybe I should look for the row where res is either win or loss, but specifically when the method is decision (unanimous). \n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: method is decision (unanimous), record becomes 14-12.\nRow 15: method is decision (unanimous), record is 9-5.\nRow 16: same opponent? No, opponent is Kumiko Maekawa.\nRow 17: same method, opponent Ha Na Kim.\nRow 18: submission, so no.\nRow 19: decision (unanimous), but the res is win, and her record goes to 5-5.\nRow 20: same method, result is loss, record 4-5.\nRows beyond that don't show Keiko Tamai as the fighter.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table seems to list each fight's details, including the outcome for the fighter in that row. So perhaps the res column indicates whether the fighter in question lost or won that particular match.\n\nBut the claim is about Keiko Tamia's record specifically when her matches ended with a unanimous decision. So I need to find all of her fights where she decided by unanimous decision and sum up her wins and losses in those cases.\n\nLooking through the table, perhaps the rows are each individual fights, so for each fight, if the method is decision (unanimous) and res is win or loss, that counts towards Keiko's record in such matches.\n\nSo I need to identify all rows where method is \"decision\" AND either res is \"win\" or \"loss\", then tally up her total wins and losses in those specific matches.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't have a column for the fighter's name. It only shows opponents. So how can I know if Keiko Tamai was involved in any of these fights?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the row_index corresponds to the fighter's ID or something else. Wait, no, each row is an individual match, so each row represents one fight. The res column indicates whether that particular fighter won or lost that match.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I need to see if there's a way to track Keiko Tamai's total wins and losses in matches ending with unanimous decision from this table.\n\nBut without knowing which rows correspond to her fights, it's difficult. Unless the table is structured such that each row is a fight she participated in, but that would mean looking for rows where she's involved. But since I don't see her name anywhere, perhaps the table isn't about her.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no Keiko Tamai in the table as an opponent or fighter. So if she's not present, her record can't be 7-2 based on this data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table doesn't list all matches, but only those where certain opponents fought, and I need to infer her wins and losses from other sources.\n\nBut since the instruction is to base it solely on the given table, I should focus on what's there. Since Keiko Tamai isn't listed as an opponent in any row, maybe she didn't fight against these opponents, so her record in matches ending with unanimous decision can't be determined here.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a match that she participated in, and the res column is whether she won or lost. So if I can find all rows where the method is \"decision (unanimous)\" and then sum up her wins and losses in those cases, that would give me her record.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 3: method is decision (unanimous), res is loss.\nRow 15: same, res is win.\nRow 17: same, opponent different.\nRow 19: same, res is win.\nRows beyond that don't have Keiko Tamai involved.\n\nWait, but without knowing which rows correspond to her, it's impossible. Unless the table includes all of her fights, in which case I can count how many times she won or lost with a unanimous decision.\n\nBut since I don't see her name, perhaps she isn't present here. Therefore, the claim about her record being 7-2 is based on data not provided in this table, making it false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists all of her matches, and I need to count how many times she had a unanimous decision outcome. But without her name, I can't link which rows are hers.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Keiko Tamia\" is a typo or misrepresentation. Maybe in the original data, there's someone else with that last name, but it's spelled differently here. Or maybe it's a different fighter.\n\nGiven all this confusion, and since the table doesn't list Keiko Tamai as an opponent or fighter, I can conclude that the claim is false because there's no data supporting her record in such matches.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

It probably means \"the most matches keiko tamia won in a row be 6.\" So, I need to check how many consecutive wins Keiko Tamia has in the table.\n\nFirst, I should look for any mention of Keiko Tamia in the table. Scanning through the opponent names, I see some names like Keiko Tsurii and others, but not Keiko Tamia. Hmm, maybe her name is different? Or perhaps it's a typo. Wait, looking again, row 7 has an opponent named keiko maekawa. Is that a variation of Keiko Tamia? Maybe the table uses \"maekawa\" instead.\n\nBut I'm supposed to look for Keiko Tamia specifically. Since her name isn't in the opponents list, maybe she's not present in the table at all. If that's the case, then there are zero consecutive wins for her. Therefore, the claim saying she won 6 in a row would be false because she didn't even fight any matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Keiko Tamia is represented by another name in the opponents. For example, row 7 has an opponent named keiko maekawa. If that's the same person, then looking at their record: they have 7 wins, but it's not specified if those are consecutive. The table only shows each fight as a single entry without showing streaks.\n\nSo, without knowing how many consecutive wins she had before row 7, I can't determine if she reached six in a row. But since the claim is about her having \"the most match... won in a row be 6,\" it's unclear. However, since Keiko Tamia isn't listed as an opponent, maybe she didn't fight at all, making the maximum consecutive wins zero.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim refers to a specific fighter named Keiko Tamia, but in the table, opponents are different. So if there's no mention of her fighting anyone, then she has zero wins, so six is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"keiko tamia\" is a typo for another name. For example, row 7's opponent is keiko maekawa, and perhaps that's meant to be Tamia. If so, looking at their record: in row 7, they have 12-10 with a submission win. But again, without knowing the sequence of wins, it's hard to say if there are six in a row.\n\nBut since Keiko Tamia isn't listed as an opponent, I think the answer is that she didn't fight anyone, so she can't have six consecutive wins.

So that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me check again. The table has columns: res (result), record (win-loss), opponent, method, round, and time. Each row represents a fight outcome for a fighter. Since there's no Keiko Tamai in any of these rows, does that mean she doesn't exist in this dataset?

Let me look again: Row 5 has mamiko mamiko; Row 16 has kumiko maekawa; Row 25 has kazue terui. None of these seem to match \"keiko tamai.\" It's possible that Keiko Tamai isn't in the table, which would mean the claim is automatically false because she didn't have any wins or losses after her first fight.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm supposed to look for someone who won their first match and then lost only once. Let me check if any fighter fits this pattern.

So, if Keiko Tamia isn't in the table as an opponent, maybe she's not part of this data set. That might mean that there are no records of her fighting in this table.\n\nNext, the claim says \"win and lose 2 time by tko.\" TKO stands for Technical Knockout. I need to check if Keiko Tamia has both a win and a loss via TKO in the table. But since she's not listed as an opponent in any row, there can't be any wins or losses attributed to her.\n\nLooking at the 'method' column, rows 4,5,13,18,19,20 mention submission (armbar), decision, etc., but none explicitly say TKO. Tko is a possible method, so I should check if any row has 'tko' as the method and if Keiko Tamia was involved.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 4: res: win, method: submission (armbar)\nRow 9: res: loss, method: tko\nBut in Row 9, opponent is natsuko kikukawa. So that's a loss by tko for her opponent, not Keiko Tamia.\n\nSo, the claim is about Keiko Tamia having two wins and losses via TKO, but she's not present as an opponent.

So I need to look through each row of the table and find where Keiko Tamia fought, check if the method was a unanimous decision, and then see her record in those cases.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I notice that all the rows have \"opponent\" names, but the name \"Keiko Tamia\" doesn't appear anywhere. Wait, maybe the claim is about another fighter named Keiko? Or perhaps there's a typo. Hmm, I should double-check if Keiko Tamia is even present in the table.\n\nScanning through each row: Row 1 has opponents like Shayna Baszler, Row 2: Marlones Coenen, Row 3: Michiko Takeda, and so on. I go all the way down to Row 28, but I don't see Keiko Tamia listed as an opponent or the fighter. Maybe the claim is about someone else, perhaps a typo like Keiko Maekawa or another name. But without seeing Keiko Tamia in any row, it's impossible to verify her record.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row has \"res\" (result), \"record,\" \"opponent,\" etc. Maybe the fighter is in another column not shown here? No, from the given data, each row seems to represent a match with details like result, opponent, method, round, and time.\n\nSince there's no mention of Keiko Tamia anywhere in the table, I can't find any relevant cells to check her record. Therefore, the claim can't be supported because she doesn't have any entries in this table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most match keiko tamia won in a row be 5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about Keiko Tamia's consecutive wins. Specifically, it claims that she won \"the most match... in a row be 5.\" So, I think it's saying that Keiko Tamia has a streak of 5 consecutive wins at some point.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a fight or a match with several details. The columns relevant here are:\n\n- res: which is either 'win' or 'loss'.\n- record: this likely shows her current win-loss record.\n- opponent: who she fought against.\n- method: how she won or lost the fight.\n- round: in which round it happened.\n- time: duration of the fight.\n\nMy goal is to find if there's a point where Keiko Tamia has 5 consecutive wins. So, I'll need to look through each row and track her record after each match.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 1: loss, so she didn't win here.\nRow 2: loss.\nRow 3: loss.\nRow 4: win, so her record becomes 14-11. But since this is the fourth win, not consecutive yet.\nRow 5: win, now 13-11. Still just two in a row.\nRow 6: loss.\nRow 7: win, 12-10. So that's three wins in a row?\nWait, wait. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track each fight and how many consecutive wins she has after each fight. Let's make it step by step.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n\n1. Row 1: loss \u2192 record remains at 0-0 for her current streak.\n2. Row 2: loss \u2192 same as above.\n3. Row 3: loss \u2192 same.\n4. Row 4: win \u2192 she now has 1 win, so a streak of 1.\n5. Row 5: win \u2192 streak becomes 2.\n6. Row 6: loss \u2192 streak resets to 0.\n7. Row 7: win \u2192 streak is 1.\n8. Row 8: loss \u2192 streak back to 0.\n9. Row 9: loss \u2192 same.\n10. Row 10: loss \u2192 same.\n11. Row 11: win \u2192 streak is 1.\n12. Row 12: loss \u2192 streak resets.\n13. Row 13: win \u2192 streak is 1.\n14. Row 14: loss \u2192 back to 0.\n15. Row 15: win \u2192 streak 1.\n16. Row 16: win \u2192 streak 2.\n17. Row 17: win \u2192 streak 3.\n18. Row 18: win \u2192 streak now 4.\n19. Row 19: win \u2192 streak reaches 5.\n\nWait, hold on. So at row 19, she wins her fifth consecutive fight. Let me check the record after each win:\n\n- After row 4: 1 win\n- After row 5: 2 wins\n- After row 7: 1 win\n- After row 11: 1 win\n- After row 13: 1 win\n- After row 15: 1 win\n- After row 16: 2 wins\n- After row 17: 3 wins\n- After row 18: 4 wins\n- After row 19: 5 wins.\n\nSo yes, in row 19, her consecutive wins reach 5. So the claim is saying that she has a streak of 5, which is true at this point.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that these are consecutive fights where she won each one after another without losing in between. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rows from 15 onwards:\n\n- Row 15: win\n- Row 16: win \u2192 streak 2\n- Row 17: win \u2192 3\n- Row 18: win \u21924\n- Row 19: win \u21925\n\nYes, so these are consecutive wins without any losses in between. Therefore, Keiko Tamia does have a streak of 5 consecutive wins.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in row 19 where Keiko Tamia achieved her fifth consecutive win. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"res\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
