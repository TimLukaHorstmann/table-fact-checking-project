    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the location that be found in 1891 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two key points: the institution was founded in 1891 and left in 1975, and its location is Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find an institution that fits these criteria. Let me go through each row to see which ones match.\n\nRow 9: Institution is Lenoir-Rhyne University, founded in 1891, type: private, enrollment: 1983, nickname: bears, joined: 1930, left: 1975, current conference: SAC. The location is Hickory, North Carolina. So this seems to fit both the founding year and the departure year.\n\nI should check if any other rows might also fit but I don't think so because each row has unique locations and founding years. For example, Row 10 is Longwood University in Virginia, founded in 1839, which doesn't match. Similarly, other institutions have different founding years or locations that don't align with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on Row 9 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data from Lenoir-Rhyne University located in Hickory, North Carolina, founded in 1891 and leaving in 1975.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"founded\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"left\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the former private member that be found in 1839 and leave in 1975 be hickory , north carolina.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this sentence. It seems to refer to a private institution founded in 1839 which left (likely left a conference or the university) in 1975, located in Hickory, North Carolina.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with various attributes like location, founding year, type (public/private), and the years they joined and left a conference. The key here is to find if there's a private institution founded in 1839 that left in 1975 located in Hickory, NC.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Anderson University \u2013 Founded 1911, Private, Left 2010. Not matching.\n2. Row 1: Appalachian State \u2013 Public, founded 1899. Not private.\n3. Row 2: Catawba College \u2013 Private, founded 1851. Not 1839.\n4. Row 3: Coker College \u2013 Private, founded 1908. Not 1839.\n5. Row 4: East Carolina University \u2013 Public. Not private.\n6. Row 5: Elon University \u2013 Private, founded 1889. Not 1839.\n7. Row 6: Guilford College \u2013 Private, founded 1837. Close but not 1839.\n8. Row 7: High Point University \u2013 Private, founded 1924. Not relevant.\n9. Row 8: Lenoir-Rhyne University \u2013 Private, founded 1891. Not 1839.\n10. Row 9: Mars Hill College \u2013 Private, founded 1856. Not matching.\n11. Row 10: Newberry College \u2013 Private, founded 1856. Not relevant.\n12. Row 11: UNC Pembroke \u2013 Public. Not private.\n13. Row 12: Presbyterian College \u2013 Private, founded 1880. Not matching.\n14. Row 13: Queens University \u2013 Private, founded 1857. Not 1839.\n15. Row 14: St Andrews University \u2013 Private, founded 1958. Too recent.\n16. Row 15: Wingate University \u2013 Private, founded 1896. Not relevant.\n\nWait, I might have missed some details. Let me check again, especially for Hickory, NC. Looking at the location column:\n\nRow 9: Lenoir-Rhyne University is in Hickory, NC. Founded in 1891, private. It joined in 1930 and left in 1975.\n\nSo, does that match? The claim mentions a former member founded in 1839, but this institution was founded in 1891. So it doesn't fit the founding year.\n\nWait another thought: The user might have made a mistake in the row indices because sometimes rows start at 0 or 1. Let me double-check the table's structure. Each row is numbered from 0 to 18, but sometimes people count them starting at 1. So, for example, Row 8 would be Lenoir-Rhyne, which is in Hickory.\n\nBut regardless of that, the founding year doesn't match the claim of 1839. The closest is Row 6: Elon University (1889) and Row 7: Guilford College (1837). None are 1839.\n\nWait, could there be an institution I'm missing? Let me see all private institutions:\n\nRows 0-18, excluding public ones. Looking for a private school founded in 1839 that left in 1975 located in Hickory, NC.\n\nI don't see any such institution in the table. The only one in Hickory is Lenoir-Rhyne, but it was founded in 1891, not 1839. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a private institution established in 1839 that left in 1975 located in Hickory, NC. After examining each row, no such institution matches these criteria exactly.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Founding Year\"}\n  ]\n}",
