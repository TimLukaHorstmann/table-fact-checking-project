    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the north american record be set on july 14 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row seems to represent a different type of record (world, African, Asian, etc.) for the same athlete: Saif Saeed Shaheen from Qatar. Each row has several pieces of information:\n\n1. The title of the record (e.g., world record).\n2. The athlete's name and nationality.\n3. Two time values in the format minutes:seconds. I assume these are the times recorded by the athlete for different events or records.\n4. The city and country where the record was set.\n5. The date when the record was set.\n\nThe claim is about a specific north American record being set on July 14, 2006. So, I need to find in the table which row corresponds to the North American record and check if it matches the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: African record\n- Row 2: World leading\n- Row 3: Asian record\n- Row 4: European record\n- Row 5: North American record\n- Row 6: South American record\n\nSo, Row 5 is the North American record. Let's check the details of Row 5.\n\nRow 5:\n- Athlete: Daniel Lincoln (USA)\n- Times: 7:53.63 and 8:08.82\n- City: Brussels, Belgium\n- Location: Rome, Italy\n- Date: 3 September 2004\n\nWait a minute, the claim says the North American record was set on July 14, 2006. But according to Row 5, the North American record was set on 3 September 2004, not in 2006.\n\nThat's a discrepancy. So, does this mean the claim is false? It seems so because the date in the table doesn't match the date in the claim.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are multiple entries for North American records or if I'm misunderstanding something. However, looking at the rows, only Row 5 mentions the North American record. So, no other row relates to it.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the actual date was September 3, 2004, not July 14, 2006.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the North American record was set on July 14, 2006. However, checking Row 5 in the table shows the North American record was established on September 3, 2004.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the world lead record be set by ezekiel kemboi with a time of 7:58.85",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"the world lead record be set by ezekiel kemboi with a time of 7:58.85\". So the claim is saying that Ezekiel Kemboi holds the world leading record with a specific time.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if it's relevant. The table has seven rows, each corresponding to different records like world record, championship record, African record, etc., and each mentions an athlete from a specific country along with their performance details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: This is about the world record for something (probably not specified clearly) held by Moses Kiptanui. Not relevant to Ezekiel Kemboi or the time mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 2: World leading record, set by Ezekiel Kemboi with a time of 7:53.63 and 7:58.85. Wait, the claim says 7:58.85, which matches this row's second time. So this row is definitely relevant because it mentions Ezekiel Kemboi and 7:58.85.\n\nRow 3: African record set by Brahim Boulami. Not relevant to the claim.\n\nRow 4: Asian record held by Saif Saeed Shaheen. Doesn't apply here.\n\nRow 5: North American record, not related.\n\nRow 6: South American record, again unrelated.\n\nRow 7: European record by Bouabdellah Tahri. Not relevant.\n\nSo only Row 2 is directly related because it mentions Ezekiel Kemboi and the time 7:58.85. The claim specifically states that Ezekiel set this world leading record with that exact time. Since Row 2 confirms both the athlete and the time, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells are relevant. Each row has multiple columns: world record, championship record, etc., but looking at the table structure, each row starts with \"world record\" or another term, followed by the athlete's name, times, location, etc.\n\nIn Row 2, the relevant parts are:\n- Column for the athlete: saif saaeed shaheen ( qat ): ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\n- The time column: 7:58.85\n\nSo, I should extract both of these cells as relevant. But wait, in the table, each row has two times listed after the colon, which might be start and finish times or something else. In Row 2, the times are 7:53.63 and 7:58.85. The claim mentions 7:58.85 specifically, so that's the relevant cell.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the row where Ezekiel Kemboi is listed (Row 2) with both his name and the specific time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2 in the table, which confirms Ezekiel Kemboi's world leading record with the specified time.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"saif saaeed shaheen ( qat ): ezekiel kemboi ( ken )\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"7:58.85\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the asian record be set on september 3rd 2004\" is true based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row corresponds to a different type of record (world, championship, etc.), and within that, there are details about who holds the record, their country, the times, locations, and dates.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"Asian Record\" set on September 3rd, 2004. So I should focus on rows that mention an Asian record.\n\nLooking at Row 4: It's titled \"world record: asian record\". The athlete here is Saif Saeed Shaheen from Qatar, and the date listed is September 3rd, 2004. The location is Brussels, Belgium.\n\nI need to check if this row supports the claim. Since it directly mentions the Asian Record being set on that specific date, Row 4 seems relevant. \n\nSo, the relevant cells are in Row 4. Specifically, the \"date\" column is critical here because it's the one that matches the claim. Therefore, I should include both the row index and the column name for this cell.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any row mentions the Asian Record set on September 3rd, 2004.\n\nThe relevant cells are in Row 4 under the \"date\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the asian record be make by saif saaeed shaheen in july 14 2006.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table and identify which parts are relevant. Each row represents a different record (world, championship, African, Asian, etc.) set by specific athletes for Saif Saaeed Shaheen.\n\nThe claim mentions the \"Asian Record\" made by Saif Saaeed Shaheen on July 14, 2006. So I should focus on Row 4 of the table because it's labeled as the Asian record.\n\nLooking at Row 4:\n- Athlete: Saif Saaeed Shaheen (QAT)\n- Time: 7:53.63\n- Location: Brussels, Belgium\n- Date: 3 September 2004\n\nWait a minute, the date here is September 3, 2004, not July 14, 2006. That means the claim's date doesn't match the actual record in the table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might be relevant. Rows 1-7 cover different records (world, championship, African, Asian, North American, South American, European). Only Row 4 pertains to the Asian record by Saif Saaeed Shaheen.\n\nSince the date in Row 4 doesn't match July 14, 2006, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Asian Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"july 14 2006 be when the european record be make.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a relevant entry for July 14, 2006, specifically related to the European record.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It mentions a championship record on September 3, 2004. Doesn't match the date in question.\n\nRow 2: Talks about a world leading record set on May 8, 2009. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 3: African record set on August 24, 2001. Again, not the date mentioned.\n\nRow 4: Asian record is from September 3, 2004. Still doesn't match July 14, 2006.\n\nRow 5: North American record set on July 14, 2006. This is interesting because it's the same date as the claim, but it's about the North American record, not European.\n\nRow 6: South American record from March 22, 1995. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: European record set on July 3, 2009. This doesn't match July 14, 2006.\n\nWait, so none of the rows mention a European record being set on July 14, 2006. The closest is Row 5's North American record on that date. Therefore, the claim doesn't have support in the table for a European record being made on July 14, 2006.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list any European record set on July 14, 2006.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"September 3, 2004 be the date when Daniel Lincoln hit the Asian record\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table and how each row relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table. There are seven rows, each starting with \"world record\" followed by different types like African, Asian, etc. Each row mentions a runner, their country, times, locations, dates, and another location which seems to be related to the event or something else.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Daniel Lincoln hitting the Asian record on September 3, 2004. So I need to look through each row to see if any of them mention Daniel Lincoln and the date September 3, 2004 in relation to an Asian record.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Talks about Moses Kiptanui (Ken). Not relevant since it's not Daniel Lincoln.\nRow 2: Mentions Ezekiel Kemboi. Also not Daniel Lincoln.\nRow 3: Brahim Boulami is mentioned, again not Daniel Lincoln.\nRow 4: Here, the runner is Saif Saeed Shaheen from Qatar. The country is Asian (Qatar), and the date is September 3, 2004. But wait, this row is about the Asian record, set by Shaheen himself on that date. So if the claim says Daniel Lincoln hit the Asian record, this might not be relevant unless Daniel Lincoln also ran on that day.\n\nRow 5: This one mentions Daniel Lincoln (USA). The location is Brussels, Belgium, and the date is September 3, 2004. But what's the event here? It's the North American record. So the time he ran was 8:08.82, which is slower than the Asian record time of 7:53.63. Therefore, this isn't the Asian record.\n\nRow 6: Wander Do Prado Moura from Brazil. Not Daniel Lincoln.\nRow 7: Bouabdellah Tahri from France. Again, not Daniel Lincoln.\n\nSo, in none of the rows except Row 4 does the date September 3, 2004 appear with an Asian record. However, Row 4 is about Saif Saeed Shaheen setting the Asian record on that date. The claim refers to Daniel Lincoln, which isn't mentioned in Row 4.\n\nWait, but looking back at Row 5: It's about Daniel Lincoln and the North American record on September 3, 2004. So maybe there's confusion here. The claim is about the Asian record, not the North American one. Therefore, Daniel Lincoln didn't set an Asian record; it was Shaheen in Row 4.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Daniel Lincoln hit the North American record on that date, not the Asian record.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions Daniel Lincoln setting the Asian record on September 3, 2004. Checking the table:\n\n- **Row 5** (North American record) shows Daniel Lincoln ran on September 3, 2004 in Brussels, Belgium, with a time slower than the Asian record. \n- **Row 4** refers to Saif Saeed Shaheen setting the Asian record that day.\n\nThus, Daniel Lincoln didn't set an Asian record on that date; he set a North American one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"asian record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"daniel lincoln\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
