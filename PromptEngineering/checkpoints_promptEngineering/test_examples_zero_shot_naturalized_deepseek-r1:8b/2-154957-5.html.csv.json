    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Ben Frank having 30 caps for the Hawke's Bay Hurricanes is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate Ben Frank in the table. I'll go through each row one by one until I find his name. Scanning through, I see that Row 6 is Ben Franks. So his details are in Row 6.\n\nNow, looking at Ben Franks' information: position is prop, date of birth (age) is November 21, 1988, and he has caps as 23. His club is Hawke's Bay Hurricanes. The claim says he has 30 caps for that team, which doesn't match the number in the table.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check his row. Yes, it's definitely Row 6 with Ben Franks and 23 caps. So the claim is incorrect because it states 30 caps instead of 23.\n\nI should also check if there's another Ben Frank or a similar name, but in this table, I don't see any other Ben Frank entries. It seems like only one entry exists for him with 23 caps.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Ben Frank has 30 caps for the Hawke's Bay Hurricanes is false because according to the table, he has 23 caps.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"caps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
