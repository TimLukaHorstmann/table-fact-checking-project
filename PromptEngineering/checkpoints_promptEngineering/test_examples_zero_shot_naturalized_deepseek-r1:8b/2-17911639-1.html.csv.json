    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim is: \"euro 2000 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. The competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying.\"\n2. The score is \"3 - 0.\"\n\nI need to check each row of the table to see if there's a match where both conditions are met.\n\nLooking at Row 1: date June 5, 1999. Venue is Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in Baku. Score is 3-0 and result is 4-0. Competition is \"euro 2000 qualifying.\" So this row has the score 3-0 and the competition is euro 2000 qualifying. This seems to satisfy both parts of the claim.\n\nBut I should check all rows just in case there are multiple matches, although it's enough if at least one satisfies.\n\nRow 2: Score is 3-1, result 5-1, competition friendly. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 3: Score is 1-0, result 1-1, competition euro 2000 qualifying. Only the competition matches, but not the score.\n\nRow 4: Score is 1-0, result 1-0, competition friendly. No match.\n\nRow 5: Score 2-0, result 2-0, competition 2002 world cup qualification. Not matching.\n\nRow 6: Score 0-1, result 2-1, competition friendly. Doesn't apply.\n\nSo only Row 1 satisfies both the competition and the score condition. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's at least one instance where \"euro 2000 qualifying\" is the competition and the score is 3-0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and some conditions. The claim is: \"euro 2001 qualifying be the competition when the score be 3 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two things: that the competition is \"euro 2001 qualifying\" and that the score was 3-1. So I need to check each row in the table to see if any match both of these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: date June 5, 1999, venue in Baku, score 3-0, competition Euro 2000 qualifying.\nHere, the score is 3-0, which isn't 3-1. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: August 18, 1999, venue Samarkand, score 3-1, competition friendly. The score here is 3-1, but the competition is not Euro 2001 qualifying. It's a friendly match, so doesn't fit.\n\nRow 3: September 4, 1999, Baku again, score 1-0, result 1-1, competition Euro 2000 qualifying. Score is 1-0, no match.\n\nRow 4: February 26, 2001, Varna venue, score 1-0, result 1-0, friendly competition. Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: June 6, 2001, Baku, score 2-0, Euro 2002 qualification. Score is 2-0, not 3-1.\n\nRow 6: August 17, 2005, Tirana venue, score 0-1, result 2-1, friendly. The score here is 0-1, so not matching.\n\nWait, the claim says \"euro 2001 qualifying,\" but looking at the table, I don't see any row with competition as Euro 2001 qualifying. The closest is Euro 2000 in rows 1 and 3, and Euro 2002 in row 5. So there's no row where the competition is Euro 2001 qualifying.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could \"euro 2001 qualifying\" be a typo or different terminology? No, because the table clearly lists competitions like Euro 2000 qualifying and friendly matches. So there's no row that has both the competition as Euro 2001 qualifying and a score of 3-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the rows. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 2: Score is 3-1, but competition is friendly, not Euro 2001 qualifying. So it meets the score condition but not the competition one.\n\nTherefore, none of the rows meet both conditions specified in the claim. So the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
