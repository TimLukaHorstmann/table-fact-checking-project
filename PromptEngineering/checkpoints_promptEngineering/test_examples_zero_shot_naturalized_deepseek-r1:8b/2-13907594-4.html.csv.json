    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10\". \n\nSo, I need to check if there's a game in the table where:\n1. The score is 5 - 4 (OT).\n2. The location/attendance is Montreal Forum.\n3. The date is after May 10.\n\nLet me look at each row of the table provided:\n\nRow 1: April 26, Bruins, 4-2, Montreal Forum, MTL 1-0\nRow 2: April 28, Bruins, 5-2, Montreal Forum, MTL 2-0\nRow 3: May 1, Bruins, 1-2, Boston Garden, MTL 2-1\nRow 4: May 3, Bruins, 3-4, Boston Garden, Tie 2-2\nRow 5: May 5, Bruins, 5-1, Montreal Forum, MTL 3-2\nRow 6: May 8, Bruins, 2-5, Boston Garden, Tie 3-3\nRow 7: May 10, Bruins, 5-4 (OT), Montreal Forum, MTL 4-3\n\nNow, I need to check each condition for the claim. \n\nFirst condition: Score is 5 - 4 (OT). Looking through the table, Row 7 has a score of 5-4 (OT). So that's one match.\n\nSecond condition: Location/attendance is Montreal Forum. Checking the locations:\nRow 1 and Row 2 are at Montreal Forum.\nRows 3,4,6 are at Boston Garden.\nRow 5 and Row 7 are also at Montreal Forum.\n\nThird condition: Date after May 10. Let's see what dates we have:\n- April 26, 28\n- May 1,3,5,8,10\n\nSo the latest date is May 10 (Row 7). Any dates after May 10? No, because May 10 is the last one provided.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"after may 10\", so does that include May 10 itself or only after? The term \"after\" usually means after, not including. So May 10 isn't after May 10, it's on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, there are no dates after May 10. So if the claim requires a date strictly after May 10, then none of the rows meet that condition because Row 7 is on May 10. But if \"after\" includes May 10, then maybe Row 7 counts, but I think in most contexts, it's after meaning later than.\n\nSo, does Row 7 (May 10) count as being after May 10? No, because the date is May 10 itself. Therefore, there are no dates strictly after May 10 in the table.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"the date after may 10\". So if a game was on May 11 or later, that would be after May 10. But in the table, all games are up to May 10. So there's no game where the date is strictly after May 10.\n\nSo, condition three isn't met by any row because none have dates after May 10.\n\nBut wait, let me check Row 7 again. The date is May 10. Is May 10 considered \"after\" May 10? No, it's on that day. So the claim would require a game with all three conditions: 5-4 OT score, at Montreal Forum, and after May 10.\n\nSince there are no games after May 10, the third condition isn't met by any row, so the entire claim fails.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread something. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The dates in the table go up to May 10, so nothing is after that date. Therefore, there are no relevant rows for this claim.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the date condition isn't met by any row.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
