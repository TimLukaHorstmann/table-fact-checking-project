    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the padre be the 2005 milwaukee brewer season opponent 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Padres were the opponents for the Milwaukee Brewers in four games during the 2005 season. So, I need to check if there are four instances where the Brewers played against the Padres in September 2005.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a game played by the Milwaukee Brewers on a specific date. The \"opponent\" column tells us who they were playing against each day. The dates given range from September 1 to September 30, which likely covers the entire month of September 2005. \n\nI'll need to go through each row and count how many times the opponent is listed as the Padres. Let's start scanning:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Padres\n- Row 2: Opponent is Padres\n- Row 3: Opponent is Padres\n- Row 4: Opponent is Padres\n- Then, rows 5 onwards: Opponent switches to Reds and Astros.\n\nSo, in the first four rows (September 1-4), the Brewers played against the Padres. That's already four games. \n\nI should check if there are any other instances where the Padres were opponents beyond these four. From row 5 onwards, the opponents change, so it seems like only the first four games against the Padres occurred in September.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is TRUE because the Padres indeed were the Brewers' opponents four times during that season.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the red in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season play them after the padre.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It seems like it's talking about a specific series or event where the Milwaukee Brewers played against \"the red\" after playing against \"the padre.\" So I need to look for instances where both \"Reds\" and \"Padres\" are opponents of the Brewers in the same season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a game, including the opponent. Let me scan through each row to find when the Brewers played both the Padres and the Reds.\n\nStarting from row 1: The first four rows (september 1-4) are against the Padres. Then starting from row 5, they play the Reds on September 5. Wait, but in row 6, it's a loss to the Reds as well. So from row 5 onwards, they're playing the Reds.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking at row 5: opponent is Reds, score 6-1. Then row 6 is also against Reds with a different loss. So that means after playing the Padres (rows 1-4), the Brewers next played the Reds starting on September 5.\n\nBut the claim says \"play them after the padre.\" That would mean after playing the Padres, they play the Reds. So the relevant games should be when they play the Reds after having already played the Padres.\n\nIn the table, the first four rows are against Padres, then from row 5 onward, they play Reds. So each game in row 5 onwards is a Reds opponent. Therefore, all these games (rows 5 to 26) are Brewers vs Reds after playing Padres.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the red in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season play them after the padre.\" It might be specifically about a particular series or event, but the way the table is structured, each game is against either Padres or Reds. So all Reds games are after the Padres have already played.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a specific instance where Brewers played both teams in order, but the table shows that Brewers first play Padres for four games (sept 1-4), then switch to playing Reds starting on Sept 5. So yes, all the Reds games happen after the Padres games.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all rows where opponent is Reds and row index >4 because those are after the Padres series.\n\nWait, but let me check each occurrence. From row 5 onwards, they play Reds, so each of these would be a Brewers vs Reds game occurring after the Padres. So the relevant cells are rows 5 to 26, with column_name \"Opponent\" equal to \"Reds.\" But in the JSON, I need to include all relevant cells that verify the claim.\n\nBut perhaps the user is asking for specific instances where they played Reds after Padres, so each of those games would be relevant. Alternatively, maybe only a specific game or series is being referred to. However, without more context, it's safer to assume that any Brewers vs Reds game in 2005 is after playing Padres.\n\nWait, but the season might have started with Padres first. Let me check if there are any other opponents before Padres. Looking at row indices: rows 1-4 are Padres (opponent Padres), then row 5 onwards are Reds. So yes, all Reds games are after Padres.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be from row 5 to row 26 where opponent is Reds. But wait, in row 27, the opponent is Pirates. So the last Reds game is row 26 on Sept 29. Therefore, rows 5-26 (and 27 isn't Reds). Wait, no, row 27 is against Pirates.\n\nSo rows 5 to 26: opponent is Reds. Each of these games would be Brewers playing Reds after having already played Padres in the first four games.\n\nThus, all these games are relevant to verifying that Brewers played Reds after Padres.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by multiple instances where the Milwaukee Brewers played against the Reds (their opponents) after having already faced the Padres. The relevant cells are all games where the opponent is \"Reds\" and occur after row 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 4 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season where one team scores no points\" is true based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions four games where \"one team scores no point.\" In baseball, a \"no point\" scenario would mean that the team failed to score any runs in that game. So, I need to look through the table for games where both teams have 0 points, or more accurately, one team has 0 and the other has some, but the claim says \"one team scores no point,\" which could imply either team.\n\nWait, actually, if a team scores no points in a game, it means their score is 0. So I need to check each row's 'score' column to see if one team scored 0 and the other scored something else, or both scored 0. The claim specifies \"one team,\" so even if both have 0, that counts as one team scoring no points.\n\nBut looking at the table, in each row, the score is given as something like \"5 - 6\" or \"1 - 2 (10)\". I think the first number is the home team's score and the second is the away team's. So for each game, I need to check if either the home or the away team scored 0.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Padres vs Brewers. Score 5-6. Both teams scored runs.\nRow 2: Padres vs Brewers. 12-2. Both scored.\nRow 3: Padres 1-6. Both scored.\nRow 4: Padres 3-2. Both scored.\nRow 5: Reds vs Brewers. 6-1. Both scored.\nRow 6: Reds 1-2 (10). Both scored.\nRow 7: Reds 14-5. Both scored.\nRow 8: Astros 7-4. Both scored.\nRow 9: Astros 5-7. Both scored.\nRow 10: Astros 4-2. Both scored.\nRow 11: DBacks 3-1. Both scored.\nRow 12: DBacks 1-2 (12). Both scored.\nRow 13: DBacks 14-2. Both scored.\nRow 14: Astros 1-2. Both scored.\nRow 15: Astros 0-7. Here, the Brewers scored 0? Wait, the score is \"0 - 7.\" If the Brewers are the home team, then their score is 0 and the Astros scored 7. So that's one game where one team scored no points.\n\nRow 16: Pirates 6-5. Both scored.\n\nWait, I think the table only goes up to row 27, but maybe the 2005 season had more games. However, looking at the data provided, only row 15 shows a Brewers' score of 0.\n\nSo that's one game where the Brewers scored no points. Now, let me check if any other rows have a team scoring 0.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nRow 14: Astros 1-2. Both scored.\nRow 15: Astros 0-7. Brewers scored 0.\nAny others? Let's see.\n\nWait, in row 23: Reds vs Brewers, score is 12-9. Both scored.\nRow 24: Reds 6-2. Both scored.\nRow 25: Reds 4-11. Both scored.\nRow 26: Reds 2-0. Here, the Brewers scored 2, Reds scored 0. So that's another game where one team scored no points.\n\nSo now we have two games: row15 (Brewers 0) and row26 (Reds 0). Wait, row26 is Brewers 2-0, so Brewers scored 2, Reds scored 0. So that counts as another game where the Reds scored no points.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"one team score no point,\" not necessarily the Brewers or any specific team. So each of these two games would count towards the four required by the claim.\n\nAre there more?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 27: Pirates 6-5. Both scored.\nRow 16: Pirates 6-5? Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table provided goes from row1 to row27, each representing a game. So let's list all games where one team scored 0:\n\nLooking at each score:\n\nRow1: 5-6 \u2192 both scored\nRow2:12-2\u2192both\nRow3:1-6\u2192both\nRow4:3-2\u2192both\nRow5:6-1\u2192both\nRow6:1-2(10)\u2192both\nRow7:14-5\u2192both\nRow8:7-4\u2192both\nRow9:5-7\u2192both\nRow10:4-2\u2192both\nRow11:3-1\u2192both\nRow12:1-2(12)\u2192both\nRow13:14-2\u2192both\nRow14:1-2\u2192both\nRow15:0-7\u2192Brewers scored 0\nRow16: Not sure if it's in the table. Wait, the table starts at row1 and goes to row27.\n\nWait, let me check each score:\n\nLooking for a score like \"0 - x\" or \"x - 0\".\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow15: 0-7 \u2192 yes\nRow26: Brewers scored 2, Reds scored 0 \u2192 yes\nAny others?\n\nLet me check row23:12-9\u2192both scored\nRow24:6-2\u2192both\nRow25:4-11\u2192both\nRow27:6-5\u2192both\n\nSo only two games where one team scored no points. But the claim says there are four such games.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some.\n\nLet me go through each row again:\n\nRow1: 5-6 \u2192 both scored\nRow2:12-2\u2192both\nRow3:1-6\u2192both\nRow4:3-2\u2192both\nRow5:6-1\u2192both\nRow6:1-2\u2192both\nRow7:14-5\u2192both\nRow8:7-4\u2192both\nRow9:5-7\u2192both\nRow10:4-2\u2192both\nRow11:3-1\u2192both\nRow12:1-2\u2192both\nRow13:14-2\u2192both\nRow14:1-2\u2192both\nRow15:0-7\u2192Brewers scored 0\nRow16: Not in the table.

Therefore, the claim says there are four such games, which isn't supported by this table.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some rows.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nLooking for \"0\" in either home or away scores.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow15: 0-7 \u2192 home team scored 0\nRow26: 2-0 \u2192 visiting team scored 0\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLooking at row4:3-2\u2192both scored\nWait, what about other games where one team scored 0.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nRow1:5-6\u2192no\nRow2:12-2\u2192no\nRow3:1-6\u2192no\nRow4:3-2\u2192no\nRow5:6-1\u2192no\nRow6:1-2\u2192no\nRow7:14-5\u2192no\nRow8:7-4\u2192no\nRow9:5-7\u2192no\nRow10:4-2\u2192no\nRow11:3-1\u2192no\nRow12:1-2\u2192no\nRow13:14-2\u2192no\nRow14:1-2\u2192no\nRow15:0-7\u2192yes (Brewers)\nRow16: Not in the table? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing row numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The table has 27 rows, each representing a game.\n\nLooking for \"0\" in any score:\n\nOnly row15 and row26 have scores where one team scored 0.\n\nSo that's two games.\n\nThus, the claim that there are four such games is incorrect based on this data.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the task. Perhaps the user wants to confirm if the Brewers had four games where they scored no points in 2005.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only shows a part of the season.\n\nBut given the information provided, only two games meet the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that there are fewer than four such games based on the data.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis reveals that based on the provided data, there are only two instances where one team scored no points. Therefore, the claim that there are four such games is not supported by the information given.\n\n**Answer:** The data shows only two games where one team scored no points, so the claim of four such games cannot be confirmed based on the provided information.",

The claim is: \"8 game in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season was attended by more than 30,000 crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand exactly what it's asking. It specifies that there was a particular game (the 8th game) during the Brewers' 2005 season where the attendance exceeded 30,000 people.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a specific game with various details like date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. The key here is to find the row that corresponds to the 8th game and check its attendance figure.\n\nThe dates in the table start on September 1 and go through September 30. However, the opponents vary, including Padres, Reds, Astros, Diamondbacks, Cubs, and Cardinals. It's important to note that all games are listed with their respective dates, so if I can find the 8th game, regardless of the date, I can check the attendance.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I reach the 8th game. \n\nRow 1: September 1 vs Padres\nRow 2: September 2 vs Padres\nRow 3: September 3 vs Padres\nRow 4: September 4 vs Padres\nRow 5: September 5 vs Reds\nRow 6: September 6 vs Reds\nRow 7: September 7 vs Reds\n\nSo, the 8th game would be Row 8. Looking at Row 8:\n\nDate: September 9, Opponent: Astros, Score: 7-4, Loss: Clemens, Attendance: 18130.\n\nThe attendance for this game is 18,130, which is more than 30,000. Wait, that's not correct. 18,130 is less than 30,000. So, this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the rows to make sure I'm on the right track.

The attendance is 18,130.\n\nNow, checking if this attendance is more than 30,000. Since 18,130 is less than 30,000, this doesn't meet the claim's condition.\n\nTherefore, there is no game in the table where the attendance exceeds 30,000. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to identify the 8th game and check its attendance.

First, I'll break down the claim into its components.\n\nThe claim mentions \"cub,\" which likely refers to the Milwaukee Brewers, a baseball team. The term \"opponent 4 time\" suggests that this was their fourth opponent in some context, possibly in a playoff series or a significant series, like a divisional round or World Series.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played on a specific date with details like the opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. The opponents listed are Padres, Reds, Astros, Diamondbacks, Cubs, and Pirates.\n\nI need to check if the Brewers faced the Cubs in their 2005 season, specifically as their fourth opponent in some series. From the table, I see that the Brewers played against the Cubs on September 20, 21, 22, and 23 (rows 17-20). That's four games against the Cubs in a row. The claim says \"opponent 4 time,\" which aligns with this as their fourth opponent during those four games.\n\nBut wait, does \"opponent 4 time\" mean they were the fourth opponents overall in some playoff series? In 2005, the Milwaukee Brewers made it to the NLCS (National League Championship Series). If that's the case, maybe the claim is about them being the fourth opponent in a playoff series. However, in the table, the season seems to be divided into September games leading up to October.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"opponent 4 time\" refers to them facing the Cubs for the fourth time during the regular season. From row 17 to 20, they played the Cubs four times starting on September 20. If that's their fourth meeting in a series or playoff context, then it fits.\n\nI don't see any other opponent listed as \"Cubs\" except in rows 17-20, where they play four games against them. Therefore, the Brewers had the Cubs as their fourth opponent in a series, possibly during the playoffs or towards the end of the season.\n\nThus, the claim appears to be supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the Milwaukee Brewers playing the Astros after the Padres in 2005 is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that in 2005, the Milwaukee Brewers played the Astros after the Padres. So, the sequence of opponents for the Brewers would be Padres first, then Astros later in the same series or perhaps on the schedule.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. The dates provided are from September 1 to September 30, which likely corresponds to September 2005 since that's when the Brewers were active in 2005.\n\nThe claim implies that there was a series where the Brewers played the Padres first, then later faced the Astros. So, I need to check if in the same season or month, after facing the Padres, they played the Astros.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows 1-4: Opponents are Padres (September 1-4). The Brewers lost these games, with varying records but all within the same week against the Padres.\n\nThen, Row 5 starts against the Reds on September 5. So, after playing the Padres from September 1 to 4, the next opponent is the Reds. There's no Astros mentioned in this initial period.\n\nWait, but let me check further down. The Brewers face the Astros starting from Row 8 (September 9). So, the first time they play the Astros is on September 9, which is a few days after playing the Padres (rows 1-4) and then Reds (row 5). However, the claim mentions \"after the Padres,\" so perhaps the sequence was Padres followed by Astros without an intermediate opponent like Reds.\n\nBut in the table, after the Padres (rows 1-4), they play the Reds on September 5 (Row 5). Then, on September 9, they play the Astros (Row 8). So, there's a game against Reds in between. Therefore, the Brewers didn't play the Astros immediately after the Padres but with a Reds game in between.\n\nWait, is there another series where they might have played the Padres again? The table shows several games against Padres in early September, so it's likely that they were playing multiple series. For instance, rows 1-4: Padres; then row 5: Reds; then rows 8 onwards: Astros; and later on, other opponents.\n\nSo, the claim says \"in 2005 Milwaukee Brewer play the astros after the padre.\" To check if they played the Astros after playing the Padres in the same series or context. But in this case, they first played the Padres (rows 1-4), then Reds (row 5), and then later Astros starting from row 8.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is referring to a specific game where after facing the Padres, they faced the Astros without another team in between? That might not be the case here because there's an intermediate Reds game. However, I need to verify if the Brewers faced the Astros at all in September 2005.\n\nFrom the table, yes, they do play the Astros starting on September 9 (Row 8). So, they did face the Astros after facing other teams like Padres and Reds. But specifically, after playing the Padres, they played Reds before Astros. Therefore, the sequence was Padres, then Reds, then Astros.\n\nThe claim says \"after the padre,\" which might imply directly after, but in reality, there's a Reds game in between. So, the Brewers did play the Astros after playing the Padres, but not immediately afterward. However, the key point is whether they played the Astros at all after the Padres in 2005.\n\nFrom the table, they did play the Astros (Row 8: September 9). Therefore, the claim's statement that \"in 2005 Milwaukee Brewer play the astros after the padre\" would be partially true because they did face the Astros after playing the Padres. However, there was an intervening game against the Reds.\n\nBut wait, the instruction is to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim could be interpreted as whether the Brewers faced the Astros anytime after facing the Padres in 2005, regardless of other opponents in between. If that's the case, then yes, they did play the Astros after the Padres.\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"in 2005 milwaukee brewer play the astros after the padre.\" It doesn't specify the exact sequence but just that there was a game where they played the Astros after playing the Padres. From the table, since they have games against both Padres and Astros in September 2005, it's accurate.\n\nHowever, I need to check if all conditions are met. The claim might be implying that in the same series or directly following, but from the table, it's not the case. They played multiple opponents over the season, so \"after the padre\" might not mean immediately after, just that they faced the Astros sometime after playing the Padres.\n\nIn that interpretation, the Brewers did play the Astros after the Padres in 2005. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to verify if the Milwaukee Brewers played the Astros after the Padres in 2005 based on the provided table.\n\n1. **Check for games against Padres**: The Brewers played multiple games against the Padres from September 1-4 (Rows 1-4).\n2. **Check for subsequent games against Astros**: After playing the Padres, the Brewers faced the Reds on September 5 (Row 5) and then later played the Astros starting on September 9 (Row 8).\n\nSince the Brewers did face the Astros after their series against the Padres (even though there was an intervening game against the Reds), the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer**: TRUE\n\n**Relevant cells**: The relevant cells are the games where the Brewers faced the Padres and then the Astros. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on this table of Milwaukee Brewer games in September 2005. The claim says: \"there be 10 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season where one team scores no points.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that in the Brewers' 2005 season, there were at least 10 games where a team scored zero points. So, I need to check each game and see if any team had a score of 0-0 or something like that.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss (with pitcher info), attendance, and record. The key columns here are \"score\" because that's where the points scored by each team are listed.\n\nI should go through each row's score and see if either team in the game has a score of 0. If at least 10 games have one team scoring zero, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet me start from Row 1 to Row 27:\n\nRow 1: Score 5-6. Both teams scored points, so no zeros.\nRow 2: 12-2. Padres score 12, Brewers 2. No zeros.\nRow 3: 1-6. Padres win 6-1. Brewers scored 1, Padres 6. No zeros.\nRow 4: 3-2. Both teams scored points.\nRow 5: 6-1. Reds won, no zeros.\nRow 6: 1-2 (10). This might be a walk-off or something, but both teams scored at least 1 point. So no zero.\nRow 7: 14-5. Both teams scored.\nRow 8: 7-4. Astros scored 7, Brewers 4. No zeros.\nRow 9: 5-7. Both teams scored.\nRow 10: 4-2. No zeros.\nRow 11: 3-1. D-backs scored 3, Brewers 1. No zeros.\nRow 12: 1-2 (12). Diamondbacks scored 2 in extras? But both teams scored at least one point before that. So no zero.\nRow 13: 14-2. Both teams scored.\nRow 14: 1-2. Both teams scored.\nRow 15: 0-7. Wait, here Brewers scored 0 and Astros 7. That's a zero! So this is one game where a team scored no points.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 16: Opponent is Reds, score 6-2. No zeros.\nRow 17: 4-11. Both teams scored.\nRow 18: 2-0. Brewers scored 2, Reds 0. Another zero! That's the second game where a team scored no points.\n\nRow 19: 12-9. Both teams scored.\nRow 20: 6-2. No zeros.\nRow 21: 4-11. Both teams scored.\nRow 22: 0-2. Brewers scored 0, Reds 2. That's the third zero game.\n\nWait, no, Row 22 is Brewers vs Reds, score 0-2. So Brewers scored 0.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 23: 12-9. Both teams scored.\nRow 24: 6-2. No zeros.\nRow 25: 4-11. Both scored.\nRow 26: 2-0. Brewers scored 2, Reds 0. Fourth zero game.\n\nWait, Row 26 is Brewers vs Reds, score 2-0. So Reds scored 0.\n\nRow 27: 6-5. Pirates scored 5, Brewers 6. No zeros.\n\nSo let me count how many times a team scored no points:\n\nLooking through each row's score:\n\n- Row 15: Brewers 0\n- Row 22: Brewers 0\n- Row 26: Reds 0\n\nWait, that's only three games where a team scored zero points.\n\nBut the claim says \"10 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season where one team scores no point.\" So according to my count, it's 3 games. That would make the claim false.\n\nWait, but I might have missed some rows. Let me check each score again:\n\nRow 1: 5-6 \u2192 both scored\nRow 2:12-2 \u2192 both scored\nRow3:1-6\u2192both\nRow4:3-2\u2192both\nRow5:6-1\u2192both\nRow6:1-2(10)\u2192both scored at least once\nRow7:14-5\u2192both\nRow8:7-4\u2192both\nRow9:5-7\u2192both\nRow10:4-2\u2192both\nRow11:3-1\u2192both\nRow12:1-2\u2192both\nRow13:14-2\u2192both\nRow14:1-2\u2192both\nRow15:0-7\u2192Brewers 0\nRow16:6-2\u2192both\nRow17:4-11\u2192both\nRow18:2-0\u2192Reds 0\nRow19:12-9\u2192both\nRow20:6-2\u2192both\nRow21:4-11\u2192both\nRow22:0-2\u2192Brewers 0\nRow23:12-9\u2192both\nRow24:6-2\u2192both\nRow25:4-11\u2192both\nRow26:2-0\u2192Reds 0\nRow27:6-5\u2192both\n\nSo in total, I see Brewers scoring zero in Row15 and Row22, and Reds scoring zero in Row18 and Row26. So that's four games where a team scored no points.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 10 such games. So even if it were four, that's still not 10. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all the games where a team scored zero:\n\n- Row15: Brewers 0\n- Row18: Reds 0\n- Row22: Brewers 0\n- Row26: Reds 0\n\nThat's four games. So only four instances where a team scored no points.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are 10 such games is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

The claim says: \"in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewer season play the Yankee only 2 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers' season, they played against the Yankees twice. So, I need to check if there are any games between the Brewers and Yankees in September 2005.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game on a specific date with an opponent. The opponents listed include Padres, Reds, Astros, Diamondbacks, Cubs, Cardinals, Pirates. There's no mention of the Yankees as the opponent in any of these rows.\n\nI should go through each row one by one to confirm this. \n\nRow 1: Opponent is Padres.\nRow 2: Also Padres.\nRows 3 and 4: Still Padres.\nThen, starting from Row 5, opponents switch to Reds, Astros, Diamondbacks, Cubs, Cardinals, Pirates\u2014no Yankees.\n\nSo, in the entire table provided for September 2005, there are no games against the Yankees. The claim says they played twice, but according to this data, it didn't happen at all.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe the table isn't covering the entire season. It's only from September 1 to September 30. So perhaps the Brewers faced the Yankees earlier in the season? But the date range of the table is specific, so I can only consider the games listed here. Since none are against the Yankees, even if they played elsewhere earlier, this particular stretch doesn't include those games.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the claim is false because there's no evidence of two games between the Brewers and Yankees in September 2005 as per the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyze each row to identify if any game was played against the Yankees.
