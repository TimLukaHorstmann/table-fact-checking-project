The claim says that the entrant team Lotus has 0 points for the year 1963.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see if there's a row for 1963. Row 1 is for 1963, so that's relevant. Now, within that row, the columns are year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points.\n\nThe claim focuses on the points for team Lotus in 1963. So I need to check the 'points' column for Row 1. In Row 1, the points are 0. That matches the claim exactly: 0 points.\n\nI should make sure there's no other row that could confuse things, but since the claim is specifically about 1963, only Row 1 matters. The other rows are for different years, so they don't affect this check.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Row 1 and the 'points' column because that's where the information to verify the claim is found.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look at the row corresponding to 1963 and check the points column. The data confirms that team Lotus had 0 points in that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"1963 be the only year where team lotus have less than 10 points.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that in 1963, Team Lotus scored fewer than 10 points, and that this was the only such year in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has five rows, each representing a different year: 1963, 1964, 1966 (with two entries for 1966). Each row includes the year, entrant (which is Team Lotus in all cases), chassis, engine, and points.\n\nSo my first step is to check how many times Team Lotus had less than 10 points across the years listed. The claim specifies that 1963 was such a year, so I'll need to verify if it's true and whether it's the only one.\n\nStarting with Row 1 (year 1963), the points are 0, which is indeed less than 10. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, checking the other years:\n\n- Row 2: 1964, points 11. That's above 10.\n- Row 3 and Row 4: both in 1966 with points 1 each. Since 1 is less than 10, these are additional instances where Team Lotus had fewer than 10 points.\n- Row 5: also in 1966 but with points 1 again.\n\nSo now I see that not only does 1963 have less than 10 points, but so do both entries for 1966. That means there are multiple years where this condition is true, not just 1963 alone.\n\nThe claim says \"the only year,\" which is incorrect because 1966 also has entries with less than 10 points. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that 1963 was the sole year Team Lotus scored fewer than 10 points. Actually, both 1966 entries also have scores below 10.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",
