    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the highest attendance was 54092.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of this claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. It's about the 2004 Texas Ranger season.\n2. They're claiming that the highest attendance for that season was 54,092.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list games with dates, opponents, scores, losses (pitcher and score), and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific game on a specific date.\n\nSo my task is to find if any of these attendances reach or exceed 54,092. If the highest attendance in all the games listed here is exactly 54,092, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the attendance numbers:\n\nRow 1: 17,136\nRow 2: 18,098\nRow 3: 49,372\nRow 4: 51,910\nRow 5: 54,092\nRow 6: 25,286\nRow 7: Postponed (probably not relevant)\nRow 8: Postponed (same here)\nRow 9: N/A (not applicable, so probably a game that wasn't played or data missing)\nRow 10: 27,219\nRow 11: 32,962\nRow 12: 42,173\nRow 13: 41,087\nRow 14: 36,501\nRow 15: 39,114\nRow 16: 40,383\nRow 17: 20,506\nRow 18: 31,021\nRow 19: 23,643\nRow 20: 32,364\nRow 21: 30,418\nRow 22: 26,266\nRow 23: 46,088\nRow 24: 40,131\nRow 25: 43,328\nRow 26: 28,253\nRow 27: 34,844\nRow 28: 32,754\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is in Row 5, which is 54,092. So that's the maximum listed here.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no higher attendances beyond what's shown. The table seems to list games from June 1 to June 30, 2004. But is this a complete schedule? If some games were played later in the season not listed here, maybe attendance could have been higher. However, based on the data provided, the highest is indeed 54,092.\n\nSo the claim says the highest attendance was 54,092, which matches Row 5's attendance. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that the highest attendance in the 2004 Texas Ranger season was 54,092, we check each row for the highest attendance number listed. The maximum attendance found is indeed 54,092 in Row 5. \n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:**\n- `row_index`: 5 (Corresponding to June 6 against Yankees)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the highest score by a single team was 12.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like each row corresponds to a game played by the Texas Rangers, with details such as the date, opponent, score, loss information, and attendance figures.\n\nThe key part of the claim is about the \"highest score by a single team\" being 12. So, I should look for any game where one team scored 12 runs. But wait, baseball scores typically involve both teams scoring runs, so the highest score in a game would be the maximum of both teams' scores.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Score is 6 - 5 (Rangers won). The highest score here is 6.\n- Row 2: Score is 5 - 3. Highest is 5.\n- Row 3: 7 - 6. Highest is 7.\n- Row 4: 8 - 1. Highest is 8.\n- Row 5: 2 - 1. Highest is 2.\n- Row 6: 6 - 5. Highest is 6.\n- Rows 7 and 8 are postponed, so no score there.\n- Row 9: Split into two games because the opponent is pirates with two scores. The first game has a score of 9 - 7 (so highest 9), and the second game 10 - 4 (highest 10).\n- Rows 10 to 28 continue with various opponents and scores.\n\nLooking for any game where either team scored 12 runs. Since I don't see any such scores in the table, especially in the Texas Rangers' games, it seems like the highest score achieved by a single team was less than 12.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim might be about the Texas Rangers scoring 12 runs in a game, but looking at their games:\n\n- Their highest score is in Row 4: 8 -1, so 8 runs.\n- In Row 9 (game 2), they scored 10 -4, which is their highest with 10 runs.\n\nSo the Texas Rangers never reached 12 runs in a single game during the season. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence of them scoring 12 in any game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the highest score by a single team was 12. Upon reviewing each row in the table, none of the games show either team scoring 12 runs. The Rangers' highest score was 10 against the Pirates. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"in the 2004 texas ranger season 9 game have an attendance of over 40000.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It refers to a specific game in the Texas Rangers' 2004 season\u2014the ninth game\u2014and says that the attendance for that game was over 40,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different game. The columns include date, opponent, score, loss (withpitcher and era), and attendance. The row numbers are from 1 to 28, but since the claim is about the ninth game, I need to find the corresponding row in the table.\n\nWait, actually, the table's row numbering starts at 1 as June 1st. So, the first row is Game 1 on June 1, and so on. Therefore, Game 9 would be row number 9. But looking at the table, I see that rows 9 and 10 are both for June 10th against pirates with different attendances: 27219 for one game and n/a for another. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: June 1\nRow 2: June 2\nRow 3: June 4\nRow 4: June 5\nRow 5: June 6\nRow 6: June 7\nRow 7: June 8 (postponed)\nRow 8: June 9 (postponed)\nRow 9: June 10, Pirates, score 9-7, attendance n/a\nRow 10: June 10, Pirates, score 10-4, loss Fogg, attendance 27219\n\nWait, so Game 9 is the one on June 10 with a score of 9-7, and the other game on June 10 is another game against pirates. So, if we're talking about the ninth game, it's row 9: date june 10, opponent pirates, score 9-7, attendance n/a.\n\nBut wait, in the table, row 9 has attendance listed as \"n / a\", which probably means the data isn't available. Then row 10 is another game on June 10 against Pirates with attendance 27219.\n\nSo, for Game 9 (row 9), the attendance is not reported\u2014it's n/a. Therefore, there's no way to confirm if it was over 40,000 because the information is missing. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the games.\n\nWait, perhaps each row corresponds to a single game, but June 10 has two games against pirates: one on the 10th and another on the 11th? Let me check again:\n\nLooking at rows 9-10: both are for June 10. Row 9 is score 9-7 with attendance n/a, and row 10 is score 10-4 with attendance 27219.\n\nBut if the claim is about Game 9, then row 9's attendance is missing. Therefore, we can't confirm that Game 9 had over 40k attendees because it's not provided. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each date represents a single game, but sometimes multiple games are listed on the same date. For example, June 10 has two entries, which might indicate two games that day. So Game 9 would be row 9: June 10, score 9-7, n/a attendance. Then Game 10 is row 10.\n\nSo, if the claim is about Game 9 (June 10), then we don't have the attendance data, so it can't be confirmed as over 40k. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because there's no evidence in the table that Game 9 had such high attendance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the maximum attendance is over 40k, but the claim specifically mentions Game 9. Since the relevant data for Game 9 isn't present, we can't verify it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the season's ninth game is row 9, and if its attendance is over 40k, but since it's n/a, then it's not. So the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The key here is understanding that the term \"lowest attendance\" refers to the smallest number of people attending any game in that season. So, my task is to look through the table and find the minimum attendance value, then check if it's 17136.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different date with corresponding opponent, score, loss details, and attendance.

However, I should check if there are any lower numbers beyond that. Scanning through them again:\n\nRow 19 has 23,643 which is higher than 17k.\nRow 17:20,506, which is still higher.\nRow 6:25,286, higher.\nWait, but Row 1 is the lowest so far.\n\nBut wait, I think there's a mistake.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the 2004 Texas Ranger season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"In the 2004 Texas Ranger season on only 1 occasion do both sides fail to score.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It's saying that in the entire season, there was only one game where both teams failed to score. So, I have to check each game in the table and count how many times both teams had a score of 0 or not scored at all.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details: date, opponent, score (for both teams), loss information, attendance, etc. The key columns here are \"score\" for each team. For each game, I need to check if either team scored or not.\n\nThe rows go from Row 1 to Row 28, covering different dates in June. Let's go through them one by one:\n\nRow 1: Indians opponent, score is 6-5. Both teams scored.\nRow 2: Indians, 5-3. Both scored.\nRow 3: Yankees, 7-6. Both scored.\nRow 4: Yankees, 8-1. Both scored.\nRow 5: Yankees, 2-1. Both scored.\nRow 6: Pirates, 6-5. Both scored.\nRow 7: Postponed game. Score is postponed. So, no score recorded here.\nRow 8: Another postponed game. Same as above.\nRow 9: Postponed again.\nRow 10: Pirates, 9-7 and 10-4. Wait, this row seems odd because it has two different scores for the same date (June 10). The first score is 9-7 with an attendance of n/a, and then another game on June 10 against Pirates with a score of 10-4. This might indicate that there were two games scheduled on June 10 against the Pirates. So, each score here represents separate games.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 11: Cardinals, 12-7. Both scored.\nRow 12: Cardinals, 7-2. Both scored.\nRow 13: Cardinals, 3-2. Both scored.\nRow 14: Reds, 5-4. Both scored.\nRow 15: Reds, 7-4. Both scored.\nRow 16: Reds, 4-3. Both scored.\nRow 17: Marlins, 8-1. Both scored.\nRow 18: Marlins, 7-6. Both scored.\nRow 19: Marlins, 4-2. Both scored.\nRow 20: Mariners, 10-2. Both scored.\nRow 21: Mariners, 6-3. Both scored.\nRow 22: Mariners, 9-7. Both scored.\nRow 23: Astros, 3-1. Both scored.\nRow 24: Astros, 8-7. Both scored.\nRow 25: Astros, 1-0. Both scored.\nRow 26: Mariners again, 8-5. Both scored.\nRow 27: Mariners, 4-3. Both scored.\nRow 28: Mariners, 9-6. Both scored.\n\nNow, focusing on the games where both sides failed to score. From the table, I can see that most games have scores for both teams. The only possible exceptions are the postponed games in Rows 7, 8, and 9.\n\nIn Row 7, the score is listed as \"Postponed.\" Similarly, Rows 8 and 9 also mention Postponed. However, the term \"fail to score\" typically refers to when both teams have a score of 0 or didn't score at all. In the case of a postponed game, it's more about the game not being played rather than both teams failing to score.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"both sides fail to score,\" which implies that neither team scored any points. If a game is postponed, there might be no official scoring data, but it doesn't necessarily mean both teams failed to score; it could just mean the game was rescheduled.\n\nLooking back at the table, in all the non-postponed games, both teams scored. So, how many times did both sides fail? Well, if we consider only the games that were played and had scores, then none of them resulted in both teams failing to score because every game had some points.\n\nHowever, if we include the postponed games as both sides failing to score, then there are three instances (Rows 7,8,9). But the claim says \"on only 1 occasion,\" which would mean only one time. Therefore, this interpretation doesn't align with the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers that in a postponed game, both teams effectively didn't score because the game wasn't played. So, if we count each postponed game as a failure for both sides to score, then there are three such cases. But the claim says only one occasion, so this doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"fail to score.\" If a team fails to score, it means they scored 0 points. So, both teams failing would mean both scored 0. In the table, that's not explicitly stated anywhere except for the postponed games, which are considered as no score.\n\nBut in reality, if a game is postponed, it might be rescheduled later, so the original scheduled date would have no score, but the actual game might happen on a different day with scores. So, in that sense, each of those three rows (7,8,9) could be considered as both teams failing to score because they didn't play on that date.\n\nIf we consider that, then there are three instances where both sides failed to score, not one. This contradicts the claim's statement of only one occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is considering only the games that were actually played, then none of them resulted in both teams failing to score because every game had some points scored.\n\nBut the problem is that the table includes multiple entries for the same opponent on the same date. For example, Row 10 has two separate scores: 9-7 and 10-4, which likely means two games on June 10 against the Pirates. So, each of those is a separate game with their own score.\n\nGiven all that, let's consider that the claim is looking for games where both teams failed to score. From the table, I can only find the three postponed games (Rows 7,8,9). Each of these would represent a date where both sides failed to score because the game didn't take place.\n\nTherefore, there are three occasions, not one, where both sides failed to score. This means the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, both teams failed to score on only one occasion. However, upon examining the table, there are three instances where games were postponed (Rows 7, 8, and 9), which likely indicates that both teams failed to score as no points were recorded for those games. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

However, upon examining the table, rows 4 and 5 have attendances of 51,910 and 54,092 respectively, which are both higher than 27,219. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the highest score by a single team was 10\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like each row corresponds to a game played by the Texas Rangers during June 2004. Each row has details like the date, opponent, score, loss (with starting pitcher and ERA), and attendance.\n\nThe claim is about the highest score by a single team in that season. So I need to look for the highest score in any game where the Texas Rangers scored against an opponent. The key here is that the highest score should be 10 as per the claim.\n\nLooking at each row, the \"score\" column shows the result of the game, with the Texas Rangers' score first and the opponent's second. For example, Row 1: \"6 - 5\" means the Rangers scored 6 runs against the Indians, who scored 5.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to find the highest score by the Rangers:\n\n- Row 1: Score 6\n- Row 2: Score 5\n- Row 3: Score 7\n- Row 4: Score 8\n- Row 5: Score 2\n- Row 6: Score 6\n- Row 10: Score 9 and then another game later in the same row with 10. Wait, no, Row 10 seems to be for June 10 against Pirates, first score is 9-7, second game on same date is 10-4. So that's two games, the second one being a 10-4 win.\n\nWait, looking back at the table description, I see that each row represents a single game, but in Row 10, it's June 10 against Pirates with two scores: 9 -7 and 10 -4. So that means on June 10, they played two games? Or maybe it's a typo and should be two separate rows for the same date. But according to the table structure, each row is one game.\n\nSo in Row 10, Texas Rangers scored 10 runs against the Pirates in one game. That's the highest score I've seen so far in the table.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\n- Row 4: 8\n- Row 24: 8\n- Row 25: 1\n- Row 27: 4\n- Row 28: 9\n\nSo the highest is indeed 10 in Row 10. Therefore, the claim that \"the highest score by a single team was 10\" seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there isn't any higher score elsewhere. Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 1:6\n- Row2:5\n- Row3:7\n- Row4:8\n- Row5:2\n- Row6:6\n- Row10:9 and 10\n- Row11:12 (but that's the opponent's score, Rangers scored 12)\nWait, hold on. Wait, in Row 11, date June 11 against Cardinals, score is 12 -7. So Texas Rangers scored 12 runs? That would be higher than 10.\n\nOh no, I didn't notice that. Let me check again:\n\nRow 11: score is 12-7. So the opponent (Cardinals) scored 7, but Texas Rangers scored 12. So that's a game where they scored 12 runs. That's higher than the 10 in Row 10.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Did I misinterpret the table? Let me make sure.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nEach row has \"score\", which is something like \"6 -5\" or \"12-7\". The format seems to be [Ranger's score] - [Opponent's score]. So in Row 11, Texas Rangers scored 12 runs. That would mean the highest score by a single team in the season was 12, not 10.\n\nWait, but then why does Row 10 have 9 and 10? Maybe it's two games on June 10: one where they scored 9 runs, another where they scored 10.\n\nBut if in Row 11, they scored 12, which is higher than both 9 and 10, that would make the highest score 12. Therefore, the claim of 10 would be incorrect; it should be FALSE because there was a game where they scored 12.\n\nWait, but let me check if Row 11 is indeed Texas Rangers' game. The opponent is Cardinals, yes. So that's correct.\n\nSo now I'm seeing that in Row 11, Texas Rangers scored 12 runs against the Cardinals on June 11. That's higher than any other score in the table.\n\nTherefore, the highest score by a single team was 12, not 10. Thus, the claim is FALSE because there was a game where they scored more than 10.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that in the 2004 Texas Rangers season, there were 9 games where the attendance never exceeded 40,000. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. There are rows from June 1 to June 30, so that's 30 days, but not all dates have games\u2014some are postponed.\n\nI should check each game's attendance to see if any of the first nine games had over 40,000 attendees. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about nine specific games where the attendance never went over 40k. So I need to find all games in the season and count how many had attendance above that number, but specifically focusing on the first nine games.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: Attendance 17,136 \u2013 well below 40k.\nRow 2: 18,098 \u2013 also below.\nRow 3: 49,372 \u2013 this is over 40k. So that's one game.\nRow 4: 51,910 \u2013 another over.\nRow 5: 54,092 \u2013 third over.\nRow 6: 25,286 \u2013 no.\nRow 7 & 8: Postponed, so not counted.\nRow 9: N/A \u2013 maybe not considered?\nWait, the table might have multiple entries for the same date. For example, row 10 and 11 are June 10 and 11. So I need to list all games in order.\n\nLet me list out the attendance for each game in sequence until I find nine games:\n\n1. Row 1: 17k \u2013 under\n2. Row 2: 18k \u2013 under\n3. Row 3: 49k \u2013 over (1)\n4. Row 4: 51k \u2013 over (2)\n5. Row 5: 54k \u2013 over (3)\n6. Row 6: 25k \u2013 under\n7. Row 7: Postponed\n8. Row 8: Postponed\n9. Row 9: N/A, maybe not counted?\n10. Row 10: 27k \u2013 under\n11. Row 11: 32k \u2013 under\n12. Row 12: 42k \u2013 over (4)\n13. Row 13: 41k \u2013 just below (doesn't count as over)\n14. Row 14: 36k \u2013 under\n15. Row 15: 39k \u2013 under\n16. Row 16: 40k \u2013 exactly 40k, so maybe counts? But the claim is \"over\" 40k.\n17. Row 17: 20k \u2013 under\n18. Row 18: 31k \u2013 under\n19. Row 19: 23k \u2013 under\n20. Row 20: 32k \u2013 under\n21. Row 21: 30k \u2013 under\n22. Row 22: 26k \u2013 under\n23. Row 23: 46k \u2013 over (5)\n24. Row 24: 40k \u2013 exactly, not over.\n25. Row 25: 43k \u2013 over (6)\n26. Row 26: 28k \u2013 under\n27. Row 27: 34k \u2013 under\n28. Row 28: 32k \u2013 under\n\nSo in the first nine games (rows 1-9), how many had attendance over 40k? Let's see:\n\nRow 3: 49k \u2013 over (1)\nRow 4: 51k \u2013 over (2)\nRow 5: 54k \u2013 over (3)\n\nThat's three games in the first nine where attendance was over 40,000. The claim says that there are nine games where none exceeded 40k. But clearly, there were more than nine games with over 40k. Wait, no\u2014the claim is about any nine specific games. Maybe it refers to all nine games never having attendance over 40k.\n\nBut looking at the first nine rows, three of them had over 40k. So that would mean the statement isn't true because in those nine games, some exceeded 40k. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which nine games they're referring to.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about all nine home games or something else. But from the table, the earliest attendance above 40k is row 3 with 49k. So within the first nine games (assuming consecutive), three exceeded. Therefore, the claim that in those nine games attendance never went over 40k is false because there were at least three games where it did.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the 2004 Texas Rangers season's first nine games, none had attendance over 40,000. Checking each of these games:\n\n- **Row 3**: 49,372 (Over)\n- **Row 4**: 51,910 (Over)\n- **Row 5**: 54,092 (Over)\n\nSince three of the first nine games exceeded 40k, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season, the lowest attendance was 54092.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and find where the attendance is given. The goal is to check if any row has an attendance number lower than 54092.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row's attendance:\n\n- Row 1: 17136\n- Row 2: 18098\n- Row 3: 49372\n- Row 4: 51910\n- Row 5: 54092 (this is exactly the number in the claim)\n- Rows 6 to 13 have higher attendances.\n- Row 14: 36501\n- Rows 15-16 also have lower numbers but above 34k, which are still higher than 54k.\n- Rows 17-20, 22-27: all above 20k but not below 54k.\n- Rows 25: 43328 (lower than 54k)\n- Row 26: 28253\n- Row 27: 34844\n- Row 28: 32754\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed some lower attendances. Let me list them properly:\n\nLooking at each row's attendance:\n1. 17136 - Lowest so far\n2. 18098 - Next lowest\n3. 49372\n4. 51910\n5. 54092\n6. 25286 (Row 6)\n7. Postponed, skip\n8. Postponed, skip\n9. n/a (Row 9)\n10. 27219 (Row10)\n11. 32962\n12. 42173\n13. 41087\n14. 36501\n15. 39114\n16. 40383\n17. 20506\n18. 31021\n19. 23643\n20. 32364\n21. 30418\n22. 26266\n23. 46088\n24. 40131\n25. 43328\n26. 28253 - This is lower than 54k\n27. 34844\n28. 32754\n\nNow, I need to identify the lowest attendance in this list. The numbers go as low as 17136 (Row1), 18098 (Row2), and others like 23643, 25286, etc., but all are above 17k.\n\nWait, the claim is about the lowest being 54092. So, if there's any row with attendance lower than that, then the claim is false because there are multiple rows with attendance below 54,092.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow5: 54092 (exact number)\nRow6:25286 <54k\nRow9:n/a (maybe not considered)\nRow10:27219 <54k\nRow17:20506 <54k\nRow18:31021 <54k? Wait no, 31k is less than 54k.\nWait, 31021 is 31 thousand, which is less than 54k. So that's another lower attendance.\n\nSimilarly, Row19:23643 <54k\nRow20:32364 <54k\nRow21:30418 <54k\nRow22:26266 <54k\nRow26:28253 <54k\nRow27:34844 <54k? No, 34k is less than 54k.\nWait, 34844 is 34k, which is still lower than 54k.\nRow28:32754 <54k\n\nSo, all of these rows have attendance numbers below 54092. Therefore, the lowest attendance in the season was not 54092; it's lower. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nI think I've considered each row and their attendances. The key columns are \"attendance\" because that's what the claim refers to.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any row has an attendance number below 54,092.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in the 2004 Texas Ranger season on only 1 occasion both side score\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that during the 2004 Texas Rangers season, there was only one game where both teams scored. That means I need to look for games where the home team (Texas Rangers) and their opponent both scored runs. Importantly, it's \"only on 1 occasion,\" so I'm looking for exactly one such game in the entire season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss, and attendance. The key columns here are 'score' and whether any runs were scored by both teams. \n\nI'll go through each row and check if both teams scored:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Score is 6 - 5. So Texas Rangers scored 6, Indians scored 5. Both teams scored. That's one occurrence.\n2. **Row 2**: 5 - 3. Rangers:5, Indians:3. Both scored. Now that's two.\n3. **Row 3**: 7 - 6. Rangers:7, Yankees:6. Both scored. Three now.\n4. **Row 4**: 8 - 1. Rangers:8, Yankees:1. Both scored. Four.\n5. **Row 5**: 2 - 1. Rangers:2, Yankees:1. Both scored. Five.\n6. **Row 6**: 6 -5. Rangers:6, Pirates:5. Both scored. Six.\n7. **Row 7 & 8**: Postponed games. These are not actual games, so they don't count towards scoring.\n8. **Row 9**: Two entries for June 10. First game is 9-7. Rangers:9, Pirates:7. Both scored. That's seven.\n9. **Row 10**: 10 -4. Rangers:10, Pirates:4. Both scored. Eight.\n10. **Row 11-12**: Against Cardinals. 12-7 and 7-2. Both games, both teams scored. So that's 9 and 10 for these.\n11. **Rows 13-14**: Against Cardinals and Reds. 3-2 and 5-4. Both scored. So 11 and 12.\n12. **Rows 15-16**: Against Reds again. 7-4 and 4-3. Both teams scored. That's 13 and 14.\n13. **Rows 17-19**: Against Marlins. 8-1,7-6,4-2. Rangers won all but in each game both scored. So that's 15,16,17.\n14. **Rows 20-22**: Against Mariners. 10-2,6-3,9-7. Both teams scored every time. That's 18,19,20.\n15. **Rows 23-25**: Against Astros. 3-1,8-7,1-0. Rangers won all but in each game both scored. So that's 21,22,23.\n16. **Rows 26-27**: Against Mariners again. 8-5 and4-3. Both scored each time. That's 24,25.\n17. **Row 28**: 9-6. Rangers:9, Mariners:6. Both scored.\n\nCounting all these, it seems like there are multiple games where both teams scored runs. From the initial count, I already have at least 14 games where both teams scored. That's way more than one occurrence.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"on only 1 occasion both sides score\" is definitely FALSE because there were many such games in the season.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis reveals multiple instances where both teams scored during the 2004 Texas Ranger season, far exceeding one occurrence.
