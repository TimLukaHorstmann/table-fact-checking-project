It says both of them are from Argentina (ARG), with specific years they were active.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim details. The claim mentions \"player fabi\u00e1n esp\u00edndola with year 2007 - 2012\" and \"player javier morale with year 2007 - present.\" Both should be from Argentina.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find each player's row and check their nation and years.\n\nStarting with Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola. His rank is 9, so I'll look for rank:9 in the table. That's Row 9. The columns relevant are \"player,\" \"nation,\" and \"years.\" From the table, his player name is Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola, nation ARG, years 2007-2012. So that matches the claim.\n\nNext, Javier Morales. His rank is 6, so Row 6. Player: Javier Morales, nation ARG, years 2007-present. The claim says he's from Argentina with years 2007-2012, but wait\u2014the table shows his years as 2007 - present. That means the claim might be incorrect because it specifies 2007-2012, whereas the actual data goes beyond that.\n\nSo for the claim to be TRUE, both players should have their specified years and nation correct. Since Javier Morales' years in the table are longer than what's stated in the claim, there's a discrepancy there.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly specifies the end year of Javier Morales' career.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes two players: Fabi\u00e1n Esp\u00edndola and Javier Morales.

So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about players in a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"player kyle beckerman who be not from the usa have more than 21 goal , but player nat borchers who also isn't from the usa have only 4 goal.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing because of some typos like \"be not\" instead of \"is not\". But I think it's trying to say that Kyle Beckerman, who is not from the USA, has more than 21 goals, but Nat Borchers, also not from the USA, only has 4 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for both players mentioned. \n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman: his row in the table has rank 3. The columns we have are rank, player, nation, caps, goals, and years. So, for Kyle Beckerman, I should check the 'player' column for his name and see if he's from the USA. According to the table, his nation is usa, so he is from the USA. That means the claim about him must be incorrect because it says he isn't from the USA but has more than 21 goals. Since he is actually from the USA, this part of the claim seems false.\n\nNow, looking at Nat Borchers: his row is rank 5. His nation is also listed as usa, so he's from the USA too. The claim says that Nat Borchers isn't from the USA but only has 4 goals. Since he actually is from the USA, this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me double-check. The claim says Kyle Beckerman who \"be not\" from the USA, so perhaps it's a mistake and they meant to say he's from another country but has more goals. However, in reality, both players are from the USA, which means the claim is incorrect because it incorrectly states their nationalities.\n\nAlso, checking the number of goals: Kyle Beckerman has 21 goals, not more than that. Nat Borchers have 9 goals. So even if they were from other countries, the goal numbers don't align with what the claim says.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The answer should be \"FALSE\" because neither part is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Kyle Beckerman and Nat Borchers are not from the USA and provides incorrect goal counts for them.

First, whether Ned Grabavoy's goals are less than 8, and second, whether Tony Beltr\u00e1n has exactly 5 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a player with various details like rank, name, nation, caps (which I think stands for 'caps', meaning the number of games played?), goals, and years.

But according to the table, his goals are exactly 8. So that part of the claim would be false because 8 is not less than 8. \n\nNow checking Tony Beltr\u00e1n. He's in row 7: rank 7, player name Tony Beltr\u00e1n, nation USA, caps 135, goals 0, years 2008 - present.\n\nThe claim says he has 5 goals. But according to the table, his goals are 0.
