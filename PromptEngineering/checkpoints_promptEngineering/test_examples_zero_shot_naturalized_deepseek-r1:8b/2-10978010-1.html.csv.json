    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim specifies three specific values: annual ridership in 2012 should be 123,219,300, rider per mile should be 4,056, and there should be 44 stations.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to find the relevant data points. \n\nStarting with annual ridership (2012), I look for the value 123,219,300. Scanning down, I see that this number is in Row 5.\n\nNext, rider per mile should be 4,056. Checking each row, I find this exact number in Row 5 as well.\n\nThen, for the number of stations, the claim states it should be 44. Looking through the table, Row 5 also lists 44 stations.\n\nSince all three values\u2014annual ridership, rider per mile, and stations\u2014align with Row 5, the claim is supported by this row's data. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"annual ridership (2012)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stations\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false. The claim states: \"5 line have more than 10,000 rider per mile.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what exactly is being claimed. It seems like it's saying that there are five lines (probably referring to transit lines or something similar) where each has an annual ridership (rider per mile) exceeding 10,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different line with various details. The relevant column for this claim is \"rider per mile\" because we're interested in whether it's above 10,000. \n\nI need to check all rows where the number under \"rider per mile\" is more than 10,000. So I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: 37613 \u2192 Yes, over 10k.\nRow 2: 9227 \u2192 Yes.\nRow 3: 7095 \u2192 Yes.\nRow 4: 13982 \u2192 Yes.\nRow 5: 4056 \u2192 No.\nRow 6: 9172 \u2192 Yes.\nRow 7: 18123 \u2192 Yes.\nRow 8: 4594 \u2192 No.\nRow 9: 9115 \u2192 Yes.\nRow10:2904\u2192No\nRow11:3871\u2192No\nRow12:3794\u2192No\nRow13:2606\u2192No\nRow14:881\u2192No\nRow15:1071\u2192No\n\nNow, count how many rows have rider per mile over 10k. Let's see:\n\nRows 1,2,3,4,6,7,9. That's seven lines.\n\nBut the claim says \"5 line.\" So it's not exactly five. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, rows are from 0 to 15? Or is row 1 the first one? Actually, looking back at the table, each row starts with Row 1, up to Row 15. So the count is correct: seven lines have rider per mile over 10k.\n\nBut the claim says \"5 line have more than 10000 rider per mile.\" That's a discrepancy because it's claiming five, but there are actually seven. So this would mean the claim is false because not exactly five lines meet that criterion.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the count. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 37613 \u2192 yes (1)\nRow2:9227\u2192yes(2)\nRow3:7095\u2192yes(3)\nRow4:13982\u2192yes(4)\nRow6:9172\u2192yes(5)\nRow7:18123\u2192yes(6)\nRow9:9115\u2192yes(7)\n\nYes, seven. So the claim says five lines have more than 10k, but there are seven. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, maybe the user meant that any line has more than 10k? No, the wording is \"5 line have more than...\", so it's about exactly five lines or at least five lines. Either way, the actual number is higher than five. So the statement is false because it claims five but there are seven.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the claim. Maybe it says that each of the five lines has more than 10k, but in reality, it's about all lines with more than 10k. Hmm, no, the wording is specific: \"5 line have more than...\", so it's referring to exactly five or at least five.\n\nSo since there are seven such lines, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five lines have rider per mile exceeding 10,000. By examining each row, we find that seven lines meet this criterion. Therefore, the claim is false as it underestimates the number of lines with high rider per mile.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rider per mile\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
