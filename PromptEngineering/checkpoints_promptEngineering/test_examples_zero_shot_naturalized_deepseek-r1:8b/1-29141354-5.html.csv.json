    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has three main components:\n\n1. **Guest**: Jessica Ennis\n2. **Show**: Andrew and Jack (probably a talk show with Andrew and Jack as hosts)\n3. **Episode Broadcast Date**: 4 May 2012\n\nNow, I'll need to check the table provided to see if there's an episode that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row seems to represent an episode of the show. Each row has columns like \"episode\", \"first broadcast\", \"andrew and jacks guest\", and others. The key columns for this claim are likely the \"andrew and jacks guest\" column because it lists who was the guest on that particular episode.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Episode 05x01, first broadcast on April 20th, 2012. Guest is Georgie Thompson.\n- **Row 2**: Episode 05x02, first broadcast on April 27th, 2012. Guest is Louise Hazel.\n- **Row 3**: Episode 05x03, first broadcast on May 4th, 2012. Guest is Jessica Ennis.\n- **Row 4**: Episode 05x04, first broadcast on May 11th, 2012. Guest is Zo\u00eb Ball.\n- **Row 5**: Episode 05x05, first broadcast on May 18th, 2012. Guest is Mo Farah.\n- **Row 6**: Episode 05x06, first broadcast on May 25th, 2012. Guest is Ronnie O'Sullivan.\n- **Row 7**: Episode 05x08, first broadcast on June 8th, 2012. Guest is Claudia Winkleman.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Row 3 has the guest as Jessica Ennis and the episode was broadcasted on May 4th, 2012. The claim mentions the episode was broadcast on 4 May 2012, which matches. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"episode broadcast on 4 may 2012.\" In Row 3, it's listed as first broadcast: 4 May 2012. So that part checks out.\n\nAlso, the guest in Row 3 is indeed Jessica Ennis. So both parts of the claim are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on Row 3 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 3 of the table, which lists Jessica Ennis as the guest and the episode broadcast date as May 4th, 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim and figure out whether it's true or false. The claim says: \"the first broadcast with jessica ennis as andrew and jack guest be before may 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify which row in the table has Jessica Ennis as a guest on Andrew and Jack's show. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Guests are Georgie Thompson.\nRow 2: Louise Hazel.\nRow 3: Jessica Ennis.\nRow 4: Zo\u00eb Ball.\nRow 5: Mo Farah.\nRow 6: Ronnie O'Sullivan.\nRow 7: Claudia Winkleman.\n\nSo, the relevant row is Row 3. Now, I need to check when this episode first aired. According to Row 3, the first broadcast was on 4 May 2012. \n\nNow, let's analyze the claim. It says the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as a guest happened before May 2012. But according to the table, it was on 4 May 2012, which is in May 2012. The term \"before\" might imply strictly earlier than May 2012, so if the date is within May, it's not technically \"before\" May.\n\nWait, but sometimes \"before May\" could include May itself depending on context. However, in many cases, \"before May\" refers to before the month starts, i.e., April or earlier. If that's the case, then since the first broadcast was in May 2012, it wouldn't be considered before May.\n\nBut the claim isn't entirely clear on this point. It just says \"before May 2012,\" which could be interpreted as any time up to and including May. So if the date is May 4th, that's within May, so technically not strictly before May.\n\nTherefore, the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis was in May 2012, not before May.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}]}",
