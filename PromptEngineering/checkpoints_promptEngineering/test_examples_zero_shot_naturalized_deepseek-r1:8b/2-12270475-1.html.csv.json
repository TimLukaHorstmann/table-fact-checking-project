    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with data about different states and their scores in some kind of contest. The claim says that the North Carolina contest has a preliminaries score of 8.068 and an evening gown score of 8.472. I need to check if this is true by looking at the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the state \"North Carolina\" in the table. Scanning through the rows: row 1 is Washington, row 2 Wyoming, row3 Hawaii, row4 Missouri, row5 Texas, row6 Illinois, row7 North Dakota, row8 North Carolina. There it is, row8.\n\nNow, looking at the columns for this row: state, preliminaries, interview, swimsuit, evening gown, average. The claim mentions two scores: preliminaries and evening gown.\n\nIn row8, the preliminaries score is 8.068, which matches exactly what the claim says. Then, checking the evening gown score, it's listed as 8.472. That also matches the claim.\n\nSo both numbers are correct in the table for North Carolina. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"preliminaries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"evening gown\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
