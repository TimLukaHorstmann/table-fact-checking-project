    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first read and understand the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"Croatia air odavde do vje\u010dnosti on doma tv after they air it on nova tv.\"\n\nBreaking this down, it seems to be about Croatia's TV channel \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti\" (which I think is Croatian for \"From Morning to Eternity\") airing on two different TV networks: first on Nova TV and then later switching to Doma TV.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country, with information about two TV shows: \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" (translated as \"Tomorrow Is Forever\") and \"el canal de las estrellas\" (The Star Channel). The table lists the countries in the first column, followed by details of these shows for each country.\n\nI need to find rows related to Croatia and check their show information. Let's look at the relevant rows:\n\nRow 4: mexico: croatia, ma\u00f1ana es para siempre: odavde do vje\u010dnosti, el canal de las estrellas: nova tv...\n\nRow 5: mexico: croatia, ma\u00f1ana es para v\u017edy: odavde do vje\u010dnosti, el canal de las estrellas: doma tv...\n\nSo, for Croatia (mexico: croatia), the show \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti\" first aired on Nova TV in October 2008 and later moved to Doma TV. The claim mentions that after airing on Nova TV, it airs on Doma TV, which matches what I see in rows 4 and 5.\n\nI should check if the dates align. In row 4, the show started on Nova TV in October 2008 and ended in June 2010. In row 5, it starts on Doma TV in June 2009 and ends in October 2011. The claim doesn't specify exact dates but just the order of networks, which seems to be correct.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm that \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti\" translates correctly to \"Tomorrow Is Forever.\" Yes, \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" is the Spanish title, but in Croatian, it's often referred to as \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti.\"\n\nSo all details in the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"el canal de las estrellas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"el canal de las estrellas\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"lithuania air am\u017einai tavo before romania air impreuna pentru totdeauna.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is saying. It seems like it's comparing two TV shows' air dates between Lithuania and Romania. Specifically, it's stating that the Lithuanian version of \"Ma\u00f1ana Es Para Siempre\" (\"Morning Is Forever\") aired before the Romanian version of \"Impreuna Pentru Totdeauna.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country (like Mexico, Lithuania, Romania) and provides information about two TV shows: \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" and \"el canal de las estrellas,\" along with their air dates. The relevant columns here are \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" and the dates.\n\nI'll start by finding the rows for Lithuania and Romania. \n\nFor Lithuania (row 9), the \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" is listed as \"am\u017einai tavo.\" The air dates provided are: October 20, 2008; June 14, 2009; and October 30, 2009. Wait, actually, looking closer, row 9 has three dates: october 20 , 2008 (probably a typo for the format), june 14, 2009, and october 30, 2009. But in the claim, it's referring to \"am\u017einai tavo before,\" so I need to check when it aired. The first date is October 20, 2008, but there's also a June 14, 2009 entry and another on October 30, 2009.\n\nFor Romania (row 11), the \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" is \"impreuna pentru totdeauna.\" The air dates are: october 20 , 2008; march 29, 2010; june 14, 2009; and september 4, 2010.\n\nWait a second. The claim says that Lithuania's show aired before Romania's. So I need to see which one started earlier. Let me look at the first date each show had.\n\nLithuania's \"am\u017einai tavo\" first aired on October 20, 2008. Romania's \"impreuna pentru totdeauna\" also first aired on October 20, 2008. So they premiered on the same day. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nBut then there are later dates. Lithuania has another airing on June 14, 2009, and again on October 30, 2009. Romania's show aired on March 29, 2010, June 14, 2009, and September 4, 2010. \n\nWait, in row 11 for Romania, the dates are: october 20 , 2008; march 29 , 2010; june 14 , 2009; september 4 , 2010.\n\nBut looking at row 9, Lithuania's show has dates: october 20 , 2008; june 14 , 2009; october 30 , 2009. So the first airing is on October 20, 2008 for both. Then, Lithuania aired again on June 14, 2009, while Romania also aired on that same date but in a later year? Wait no, both are in 2009.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The dates for each show are separate per country. So, for Lithuania's \"am\u017einai tavo,\" the air dates are October 20, 2008; June 14, 2009; and October 30, 2009. For Romania's \"impreuna pentru totdeauna,\" the air dates are October 20, 2008; March 29, 2010; June 14, 2009; September 4, 2010.\n\nSo in 2008, both shows aired on October 20. Then, in 2009, Lithuania's show aired again on June 14, while Romania's show also aired on that same date but perhaps as a different episode or something? Wait, the dates are listed per country, so for each country, their own version has multiple air dates.\n\nBut the claim is about \"lithuania air am\u017einai tavo before romania air impreuna pentru totdeauna.\" So it's about when each show started in their respective countries. If both premiered on October 20, 2008, then they started on the same day, so neither came before the other. \n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is that the Lithuanian version of \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" aired before the Romanian version of \"Impreuna Pentru Totdeauna.\" So in terms of their own countries' air dates, if both started on the same day, then it's not true that one came before the other. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because they both premiered simultaneously.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look at the earliest date each show has. But since they both have October 20, 2008 as their first airing, there's no before and after.\n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps the table is structured such that each country has multiple air dates for their respective shows. So, for Lithuania, \"am\u017einai tavo\" aired on Oct 20, 2008; Jun 14, 2009; Oct 30, 2009. For Romania, \"impreuna pentru totdeauna\" aired on Oct 20, 2008; Mar 29, 2010; Jun 14, 2009; Sep 4, 2010.\n\nSo the first airing for both was on the same date in 2008. Therefore, neither came before the other in their own country's context. So the claim that Lithuania's show aired before Romania's is incorrect because they started on the same day.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"lithuania air am\u017einai tavo before romania air impreuna pentru totdeauna.\" By examining the table, both shows premiered on October 20, 2008. Since they began on the same date, neither aired before the other.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim says: \"rtv pink be the el canal de las estrellas in slovakia , where the october 20 , 2008 statistic be june 5 , 2009.\" So, I need to check two main points here:\n\n1. Is \"rtv pink\" the channel for \"el canal de las estrellas\" in Slovakia?\n2. For the specific dates October 20, 2008, and June 5, 2009, is there a statistic or information about that?\n\nLooking at the table, I see rows corresponding to different countries, with columns like \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\", \"el canal de las estrellas\", and various dates along with day ranges (like Monday to Friday or Saturday).\n\nI'll start by looking for Slovakia in the table. Scanning through the row indices, I find Row 13: mexico: slovakia. Let me check that.\n\nIn Row 13:\n- \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\": love never dies\n- \"el canal de las estrellas\": joj plus\n- Dates:\n  - October 20, 2008: December 21, 2009\n  - June 14, 2009: April, 2010\n\nWait a minute. The claim mentions \"rtv pink\" as the channel for Slovakia. But in Row 13, the channel is listed as \"joj plus\". So that's different from \"rtv pink.\" That suggests that either \"rtv pink\" isn't the correct channel or maybe it's another row.\n\nWait, but I only see one entry for Slovakia, which is Row 13. There's no other row for Slovakia in the table provided. So if the claim says \"rtv pink be the el canal de las estrellas in slovakia,\" then based on the table, that would be incorrect because it's actually \"joj plus.\"\n\nNow, checking the second part of the claim: October 20, 2008 statistic being June 5, 2009. In Row 13, under \"el canal de las estrellas\" there is a date October 20, 2008 but no corresponding date in 2009 listed as June 5. Instead, it goes from October 20, 2008 to December 21, 2009. So the specific date of June 5, 2009 isn't mentioned here.\n\nWait, maybe I should check other rows for Slovakia, but looking through all the rows, only Row 13 mentions Slovakia, and that's with \"joj plus\" as the channel. So there's no mention of \"rtv pink\" in that row or any other row for Slovakia.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect on both points: the channel name is wrong, and the specific date statistic isn't present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Is there another row where Slovakia is mentioned? No, only Row 13. So \"rtv pink\" isn't listed for Slovakia, which would make the first part of the claim FALSE. The second part about the statistic also doesn't align with the data provided.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim isn't supported by the table data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"el canal de las estrellas\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"slovakia be the mexico statistic where ma\u00f1ana e para siempre be love never die where the october 20 , 2008 statistic be september 25 , 2009\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what it's asking. It seems to compare Slovakia and Mexico in terms of a show called \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\" (\"Every Morning Is Forever\") on TV. The specific part mentions that for Slovakia, the show \"love never dies\" was on October 20, 2008, and ended on September 25, 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a country (like Mexico, Bulgaria, etc.) and provides information about the show's name, another show (\"el canal de las estrellas\"), dates when they aired or ended, and days of the week.\n\nI need to find rows where the country is Slovakia. Scanning through, I see Row 13: mexico: slovakia. So, Slovakia is in row 13. Now, let's check the details for Slovakia.\n\nIn Row 13:\n- \"ma\u00f1ana es para siempre\": love never dies\n- \"el canal de las estrellas\": joj plus\n- Dates: october 20 , 2008: december 21 , 2009 and june 14 , 2009: april , 2010.\n\nWait, the claim mentions two dates: October 20, 2008 and September 25, 2009. For Slovakia, the \"october 20 , 2008\" date is December 21, 2009, not September 25, 2009. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think I might have misread it. Let me check again. The claim says that for Slovakia, the show \"love never dies\" started on October 20, 2008 and ended on September 25, 2009. But in the table, for Row 13 (Slovakia), under \"june 14 , 2009\", it's April 2010, not September 2009. So that date doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the specific columns mentioned. The claim talks about two dates: october 20 , 2008 and then another date for the same show in Slovakia. In the table, under Row 13, there are two dates after \"june 14 , 2009\": december 21 , 2009 and april , 2010. So the first date is October 20, 2008 to December 21, 2009, and then another run from June 14, 2009 to April, 2010.\n\nThe claim states that for Slovakia, the show \"love never die\" started on October 20, 2008 and ended on September 25, 2009. But according to the table, it actually ended in December 2009, not September 2009. So the end date doesn't match. \n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the show didn't end in September 2009 but rather in December 2009 for Slovakia.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that for Slovakia, \"love never dies\" aired from October 20, 2008, to September 25, 2009. However, according to the table, Slovakia's run of the show ended on December 21, 2009, not September 25, 2009. This discrepancy means the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"october 20 , 2008\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
