    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"roscoe tanner be the ninth rank tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several rows, each representing a different tennis player with various attributes such as their ranking (rk), name, country, matches played, matches won, points, and prize money in USD. \n\nThe claim is about Roscoe Tanner being the ninth-ranked tennis player on the 1973 world tennis circuit. To verify this, I need to find the corresponding row in the table where the name is \"Roscoe Tanner\" and check if his rank (rk) is 9.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: ken rosewall\n- Row 2: arthur ashe\n- Row 3: marty riessen\n- Row 4: roger taylor\n- Row 5: mark cox\n- Row 6: brian fairlie\n- Row 7: jan kode\u00e5\u00a1\n- Row 8: tom okker\n- Row 9: roscoe tanner\n\nRow 9 is the only one where the name is \"roscoe tanner.\" Now, checking his rank (rk): it's listed as 9. \n\nHowever, I notice that there are two entries with rk:4. The first one is roger taylor, and then mark cox. This duplication might be a mistake or perhaps a ranking adjustment during the season. But for this specific claim, we're only concerned about Roscoe Tanner's rank.\n\nSince Roscoe Tanner is indeed ranked 9th in row 9, the claim should be TRUE. \n\nTo ensure I'm correct, I'll cross-check each relevant cell. The key columns are \"rk\" and \"name.\" For Roscoe Tanner, these values are \"9\" and \"roscoe tanner,\" respectively. There's no discrepancy here that would make the claim false.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in row 9, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that Roscoe Tanner is ranked 9th.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen both winning 26 matches each is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully going through the instructions and the data.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen have won 26 matches each. My task is to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different player with several attributes: rank (rk), name, country, number of matches played, matches won, points, and prize money. So, for each named individual mentioned in the claim\u2014Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen\u2014I need to locate their respective rows in the table.\n\nStarting with Arthur Ashe: I'll search through the 'name' column for \"Arthur Ashe\". Scanning down the list, I see row 2 is Arthur Ashe. Now, looking at his matches won, which is one of the columns we care about. According to the table, he has 26 matches won. That's a match for the claim.\n\nNext, Marty Riessen: Similarly, I'll look for \"Marty Riessen\" in the 'name' column. Row 3 corresponds to Marty Riessen. Checking his 'matches won' column, it says 26 as well. So that's another point for the claim.\n\nWait a minute\u2014I should double-check if there are any other entries with these names or if I might have misread something. Let me go through each row again to ensure I didn't skip over anything. Rows 1 and onwards: no, only rows 2 and 3 have Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen respectively.\n\nNow, considering the prize money might be a red herring, but the claim is specifically about matches won, so I can focus on that aspect. Both players indeed have 26 wins each in their respective rows. There's no discrepancy or conflicting information here.\n\nTherefore, since both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen have exactly 26 matches won according to the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we checked the relevant cells for Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen.

Looking at Row 1, his prize money is $66,400.\n\nNext, I need to find Tom Okker's prize money. He's in Row 8 with $34,400, and Roscoe Tanner is in Row 9 with $25,250. \n\nTo check if Ken's prize money is more than the combined total of Tom and Roscoe's, I'll add their amounts: 34,400 + 25,250 equals 59,650.\n\nKen has $66,400, which is indeed greater than $59,650. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells. Ken Rosewall is in Row 1 (index 0) under \"prize money (usd)\". Tom Okker is Row 8 (index 7), and Roscoe Tanner is Row 9 (index 8).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen both lose 26 match each.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and identify where Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen are located. Scanning through the rows, I see that Arthur Ashe is in row 2 and Marty Riessen is in row 3.\n\nNow, focusing on Arthur Ashe (row 2), I'm looking for a column related to matches lost or something similar. The columns listed are: rk, name, country, matches played, matches won, points, prize money (usd). Hmm, there's no direct \"matches lost\" column here. But wait, sometimes in sports stats, the number of matches lost can be inferred from the total matches played and the matches won. So if I subtract the matches won by Arthur Ashe from the total matches he's played, that should give me his losses.\n\nFor Arthur Ashe: matches played = 36, matches won = 26. So 36 - 26 = 10. That means he lost 10 matches, not 26. So that part of the claim doesn't hold up.\n\nNext, looking at Marty Riessen (row 3), same approach. Matches played = 36, matches won = 26. So 36 - 26 = 10 losses as well. Again, the claim says he lost 26 each, but according to this, he only lost 10. \n\nTherefore, both of them didn't lose 26 matches each; they each lost 10. So the claim is false.\n\nTo make sure I'm not missing anything, I'll cross-check each relevant row and column. For both Arthur Ashe and Marty Riessen, the 'matches won' column clearly states 26, so subtracting that from their total matches gives 10 losses each. There's no data indicating they lost 26, so the claim doesn't align with the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"matches won\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"matches won\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"roscoe tanner be first ranked tennis player for the 1973 world tennis circuit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a player with various attributes like their rank (rk), name, country, number of matches played and won, points, and prize money. The claim is about Roscoe Tanner being first ranked in 1973.\n\nI need to check if there's any information in the table that can confirm or deny this claim. Let me start by finding where Roscoe Tanner is in the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 1: ken rosewall\n- Row 2: arthur ashe\n- Row 3: marty riessen\n- Row 4: roger taylor\n- Row 5: mark cox\n- Row 6: brian fairlie\n- Row 7: jan kode\u00e5\u00a1\n- Row 8: tom okker\n- Row 9: roscoe tanner\n\nSo, Roscoe Tanner is in Row 9. Now, the claim says he was first ranked in 1973. Looking at the table, I don't see a column that directly shows the ranking for each player in 1973.\n\nThe columns present are: rk (which seems to be the rank), name, country, matches played, matches won, points, prize money (usd). The 'rk' column lists numbers like 1 through 9. However, I'm not sure if these ranks correspond directly to the year 1973 or are for a specific event or time period.\n\nI need to check if there's any information that ties Roscoe Tanner's rank in 1973 specifically. Since the table doesn't have a column indicating the year, it's unclear whether the 'rk' numbers reflect his ranking in 1973. \n\nWait, perhaps 'matches played' and 'matches won' can help infer his performance around 1973. If he was the top performer in 1973, maybe his number of matches and wins would be higher than others in that year.\n\nLooking at other players: Arthur Ashe has 36 matches played and 26 won, points 41, prize money $63,150.\nRoscoe Tanner is Row 9, so his rk is 9. His matches played are 27, matches won 16, points 24, prize money $25,250.\n\nComparing to others: He has fewer matches than Arthur Ashe and some others. For example, Tom Okker (Row 8) has 29 matches played and 19 won with points 25. Roscoe's points are lower as well. This suggests he wasn't performing as well as others in 1973.\n\nBut wait, the 'rk' column is probably his rank, not his performance. So if 'rk:1' is first place, then being ranked 9 would mean he was ninth. But the claim says he was first. However, in the table, the highest rk (1) is Arthur Ashe. So unless Roscoe was ranked number 1 at some point during the year, this might not hold.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the 'rk' seems to be their position in the table, but maybe it's their actual ranking. Let me check if any source says that Roscoe Tanner was first-ranked in 1973. From what I remember, Arthur Ashe was the top player in the early '70s, so it's unlikely Roscoe was first. \n\nBut wait, maybe in 1973 he had a significant year. However, according to the table data, his performance metrics don't indicate he was leading. He won 16 matches and earned less prize money than others like Arthur Ashe.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, Roscoe Tanner's rank is 9, which doesn't support the claim that he was first ranked in 1973. The data shows he wasn't leading; Arthur Ashe had a higher rank (rk:1) with more wins and points.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists players with their respective ranks. Roscoe Tanner is ranked 9th, while Arthur Ashe is ranked 1st. Since the claim states that Roscoe was first-ranked in 1973, but the data shows he wasn't, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Answer: \"FALSE\"**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"rk\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"ken rosewell lose more prize money than tom ekker and roscoe tanner combine.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify who Ken Rosewell is from the table. Looking at row 1, name: ken rosewall, country: aus. So his prize money is $66,400.\n\nNext, the claim mentions Tom Ekker. Wait, in the table, I see a row with rk:8, name: tom okker, country: ned. Hmm, the name is \"tom okker,\" not \"ekker.\" That might be a typo or mispronunciation. So I should use \"Tom Okker\" as his name.\n\nRoscoe Tanner's data is in row 9. His prize money is $25,250.\n\nThe claim says that Ken Rosewell loses more prize money than the combined total of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner. Wait, but losing implies he has less than others. But looking at the numbers:\n\nKen Rosewell: $66,400\nTom Okker: $34,400\nRoscoe Tanner: $25,250\n\nIf I add Tom's and Roscoe's prize money, it would be 34,400 + 25,250 = $59,650.\n\nNow, does Ken lose more than that? Ken has $66,400. So if the claim is about losing more, maybe it's implying he lost more in total or something else. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The phrase \"lose more prize money\" could mean he loses (i.e., doesn't win) more than the combined amount they have.\n\nWait no, actually, when someone \"loses\" prize money, it might mean that they didn't receive it, so their own prize money is less than others. But the claim is comparing Ken's loss to the total of two others. That interpretation isn't clear. Alternatively, perhaps it means he lost (as in, gave away) more prize money than the sum of the other two.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The claim could be stating that Ken Rosewell has less prize money than the combined total of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner. Because if you combine their prize money, it's 34k +25k=59k. So if Ken's is 66k, he actually has more than both combined.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look again. The claim is \"ken rosewell lose more prize money than tom ekker and roscoe tanner combine.\" So maybe it means that the amount Ken lost (i.e., didn't win) is more than what Tom and Roscoe have combined.\n\nBut in that case, Ken's prize money is $66k. The others together have 59k. So if he \"loses\" more than their combined total, that would mean his own prize money is less than theirs, which isn't the case because 66k > 59k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about who has less prize money. If Ken's prize money is $66k, and others have less, then he doesn't lose more than them. So maybe the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The term \"lose\" might be used in a way that means he didn't win, so his own prize money is lower. But the claim compares how much he lost (as in, the amount he didn't win) to the total of the two others.\n\nIf that's the case, then Ken's prize money would be what he didn't win, and the others' combined is 59k. So if his own prize money is higher than their combined, he \"lost\" more than they did. But I'm not sure if this interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that Ken lost (i.e., didn't win) more matches, but the column here is prize money, so it's about the prize money.\n\nWait, no, the claim is specifically about prize money. So perhaps the claim is that Ken Rosewell has less prize money than Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner combined. Since his prize money is 66k, which is more than their 59k combined, he does not lose more than them. Therefore, the claim would be false.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is incorrect because Ken's prize money is higher than the sum of Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner's.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ken Rosewell loses more prize money than Tom Okker and Roscoe Tanner combined. After analyzing their respective prize amounts:\n\n- **Ken Rosewall**: $66,400\n- **Tom Okker**: $34,400\n- **Roscoe Tanner**: $25,250\n\nAdding Tom's and Roscoe's amounts gives a total of $59,650.
