    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , and et al be the owner when blueeyesintherein be the winner in 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the row for 2012 because the claim mentions that year. Scanning through the table, Row 1 is indeed 2012. The columns relevant here are 'winner', 'jockey', 'trainer', and 'owner'.\n\nIn Row 1, the winner is \"blueeyesintherein\". Now, checking the owner column, it says \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" So that matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but sometimes in these tables, \"et al\" might mean there are more owners listed elsewhere or perhaps it's a placeholder. But here, it's explicitly mentioned as part of the owner name in Row 1. That seems to fully support the claim.\n\nI should also check if any other rows for 2012 exist, but looking through all the rows, only Row 1 has 2012 as the year. So no need to look elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are Row 1, columns 'owner' because that's where the owner is listed, and maybe 'winner' just to confirm the horse's name. But since the claim specifically mentions the owner, I think only the owner column is necessary for verification.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 1 of the table, specifically under the 'owner' column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"blueeyesintherein win on 2012, with the owner self, king morgenson, travis, and so on.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Each row represents a different year from 2000 to 2012. I'm focusing on the year 2012 because that's when blueeyesintherein supposedly won.\n\nLooking through the rows for 2012, there's only one row: Row 1. In this row, the winner is \"blueeyesintherein,\" which matches the claim. The jockey is leandro goncalves, trainer is gary simms, and owner is listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\"\n\nThe claim mentions the owner as self, king morgenson, travis, etc. In the table, the owner field for Row 1 is indeed \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" So that part checks out.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. The year is correct, and the owner's names match what's stated in the claim. Therefore, based on this information, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"overbrook farm and et al own winner bleeyesintherin after 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"overbrook farm and et al\". The term \"et al\" typically stands for \"and others,\" so it's referring to a group that includes Overbrook Farm and possibly other entities or individuals involved in ownership. The winner in question is \"bleeyesintherin,\" but looking at the table, I don't see a row with this exact name. Wait, maybe I made a typo. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row, the winners are: blueeyesintherein (Row 1), flashy lassie (Row 2), just louise (Row 3), decelerator (Row 4), garden district (Row 5), rated fiesty (Row 6), richwoman (Row 7), effectual (Row 8), classic elegance (Row 9), be gentle (Row 10), awesome humor (Row 11), cashier's dream (Row 12), gold mover (Row 13), chilukki (Row 14), silverbulletday (Row 15), love lock (Row 16), move (Row 17), golden attraction (Row 18). So, the only winner close to \"bleeyesintherin\" is in Row 1: blueeyesintherein. Maybe it's a typo or variation of the name.\n\nNext part of the claim is that this owner group (\"overbrook farm and et al\") owns the winner after 2009. So I need to check if Overbrook Farm and possibly others are listed as owners for any winners who won after 2009.\n\nLooking at each row, let's see which rows have a year after 2009. The latest years in the table go up to 2012. So Rows 1 through 12 (since Row 13 is 2000, but wait no, actually Row 1 is 2012, so it goes from 2012 down to 1995). Wait, the rows are ordered with year decreasing: Row 1 is 2012, then 2011, ..., up to Row 18 as 1995. So for after 2009, we're looking at Rows 1 (2012), Row 2 (2011), and maybe Row 3 (2010). Wait, 2010 is before 2009? No, wait: 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, etc. So after 2009 would be 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nSo I need to check Rows 1 (2012), Row 2 (2011), and Row 3 (2010). Let me look at their owners.\n\nRow 1: winner is blueeyesintherein. The owner field says \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" Hmm, that seems like it's listing multiple possible owners, including self, but Overbrook Farm isn't mentioned here.\n\nRow 2: year 2011, winner flashy lassie. Owner is Barry L King. Not Overbrook Farm.\n\nRow 3: year 2010, winner just louise. Owner Eldon Farm Equine. No mention of Overbrook.\n\nSo none of the winners after 2009 are owned by Overbrook Farm and et al. Wait, but in Row 18 (1995), the owner is Overbrook Farm for golden attraction, but that's before 2009.\n\nTherefore, there's no winner named blueeyesintherein or any other horse owned by Overbrook Farm and et al after 2009. The closest is Row 1, which lists \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al,\" not Overbrook Farm.\n\nSo the claim seems to be FALSE because Overbrook Farm isn't listed as an owner for any winner after 2009 in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Overbrook Farm and others own the winner blueeyesintherein after 2009. Upon reviewing the table, there's no entry for a winner named blueeyesintherein, and Overbrook Farm is not listed as the owner of any winners post-2009.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify the claim's key elements: Winner is blueeyesintherein, owned by Overbrook Farm and et al, after 2009.\n2. Check each row for years after 2009 (2010, 2011, 2012).\n3. Review ownership for these rows; none list Overbrook Farm.\n4. Conclude the claim is false as there's no evidence of such ownership.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"No owner listed as 'overbrook farm and et al' owns any winner after 2009 in the table.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et all own winner flashy lassie after 2009\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the group of people mentioned\u2014\"self / king / morgenson / travis\"\u2014own the winner \"flashy lassie\" and that this happened after 2009. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the winner is \"flashy lassie\" and the year is after 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"year\" column and a \"winner\" column. The years range from 2012 down to 1995. I need to find if there's a row for \"flashy lassie\" with a year greater than 2009.\n\nScanning through the list of winners, I see that in Row 2: year 2011, winner is \"flashy lassie\". That's after 2009, so that fits. So the claim says they own her after 2009, but looking at the table, the owner for Row 2 is \"barry l king\". The claim mentions \"self / king / morgenson / travis\" as the owners. \n\nWait, in Row 1: year 2012, the winner is \"blueeyesintherein\", and the owners are listed as \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al.\" So maybe that's the group they're referring to. Then, if in 2011, the same group owns \"flashy lassie\" in Row 2, then the claim would be TRUE because they did own her after 2009.\n\nBut wait, let me check each relevant cell. The claim is about ownership of \"flashy lassie\" by that group after 2009. So I need to find if \"flashy lassie\" was owned by them in a year later than 2009. \n\nIn Row 2: year 2011, winner is \"flashy lassie\", and the owner is \"barry l king\". That doesn't match the group mentioned in the claim. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is that the same group owns multiple winners after 2009. So, if \"self / king / morgenson / travis\" own any winner after 2009, then the claim would be TRUE. Looking at Row 1: year 2012, winner is \"blueeyesintherein\", and owners include that group. That's in 2012, which is after 2009. So they did own a winner (blueeyesintherein) after 2009.\n\nSo the claim says they own \"flashy lassie\" after 2009, but according to Row 2, \"flashy lassie\" was owned by \"barry l king\", not that group. However, in Row 1, their ownership is mentioned for another winner in 2012. So perhaps the claim isn't specifically about \"flashy lassie\" anymore\u2014it's a more general statement that they own any winner after 2009.\n\nBut wait, the exact wording of the claim is: \"...own winner flashy lassie after 2009\". So it's specifically about \"flashy lassie\". In Row 2, she was owned by barry l king. So that doesn't match. However, in Row 1, their group owns another winner in 2012, but not \"flashy lassie\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because \"flashy lassie\" wasn't owned by that group after 2009. Alternatively, if the claim was about any winner they own after 2009, then it would be TRUE since Row 1 shows another winner in their ownership. But the specific mention is of \"flashy lassie\".\n\nWait, but in the table, \"self / king / morgenson / travis\" are listed as owners for Row 1 (2012), and that's the only time I see them mentioned as owners. So, if they own any winner after 2009, even if not \"flashy lassie\", then the claim might still be about ownership in general. But the exact wording is about \"flashy lassie\". So since she was owned by another person, it's FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is that they own \"flashy lassie\" after 2009, but according to Row 2, she was owned in 2011, which is after 2009, but not by that group. So the claim is incorrect because it's asserting ownership by a different entity.\n\nWait, no\u2014Row 2's owner is barry l king, so the group mentioned in the claim isn't her owners. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"self / king / morgenson / travis\" own \"flashy lassie\" after 2009. Checking the table, Row 2 (year 2011) lists \"flashy lassie\" with an owner of \"barry l king,\" not the group mentioned in the claim. While the group owns another winner (\"blueeyesintherein\") in Row 1 (2012), the specific mention of \"flashy lassie\" is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is **FALSE** because \"flashy lassie\" was owned by \"barry l king,\" not the group mentioned, after 2009.",
