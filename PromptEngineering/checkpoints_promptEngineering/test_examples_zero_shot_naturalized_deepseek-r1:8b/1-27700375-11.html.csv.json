    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"jordan farmar lead the team in assist for more game than deron williams do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that Jordan Farmar led the team in assists more games than Deron Williams did. So I need to compare how many times Jordan Farmar was the leader in assists versus how often Deron Williams was the leader.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a game with details like team, date, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The relevant columns for this claim are \"high assists.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check who led in assists.\n\nRow 1: Game 75, Deron Williams had 7 assists. So he was the leader here.\nRow 2: Game 76, Deron Williams with 9 assists, so he led again.\nRow 3: Game 77, Deron Williams with 21 assists, leading.\nRow 4: Game 78, Jordan Farmar with 11 assists, so he led here.\nRow 5: Game 79, Jordan Farmar with 9 assists, leading.\nRow 6: Game 80, Jordan Farmar with 7 assists, so he led.\nRow 7: Game 81, Jordan Farmar with 9 assists, leading.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times each led. Deron Williams led in games 75,76,77 \u2013 that's 3 times. Jordan Farmar led in games 78,79,80,81 \u2013 that's 4 times.\n\nSo the claim says Farmar led more games than Williams. Since Farmar has 4 and Williams has 3, the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Brook Lopez is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"brook lopez lead the team in both point and rebound in a single game 3 different times.\" So, it's saying that Brook Lopez did this three separate games, each time leading in both points and rebounds. \n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row for the relevant information about Brook Lopez's performance in terms of high points and high rebounds.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1 (Game 75)**: Team is Philadelphia. High points are mentioned as Brandan Wright with 15, and rebounds also Brandan Wright with 11. So, Lopez isn't leading here.\n   \n2. **Row 2 (Game 76)**: Team is Miami. High points are Deron Williams with 18, and rebounds Travis Outlaw with 9. Again, no mention of Lopez leading.\n\n3. **Row 3 (Game 77)**: Team is Minnesota. High points and rebounds both by Brook Lopez: 30 points and 12 rebounds. So here, he leads in both categories in a single game.\n\n4. **Row 4 (Game 78)**: Team is Detroit. High points are Lopez with 39, but rebounds are Brook Lopez again with 7. Wait, that's interesting. So in this game, he leads in points and rebounds as well? But let me check the table again. Oh wait, no\u2014rebounds for Row 4 are listed as Brook Lopez (7). So yes, he leads in both.\n\n5. **Row 5 (Game 79)**: Team is New York. High points by Lopez with 27, but rebounds by Jordan Farmar with 8. So only points here.\n\n6. **Row 6 (Game 80)**: Team is Toronto. Both high points and rebounds by Lopez: 35 points and 11 rebounds. So that's another game where he leads both.\n\n7. **Row 7 (Game 81)**: Team is Charlotte. High points are Lopez with 31, but rebounds Dan Gadzuric with 8. So only points here.\n\nNow, let me count the games where Lopez led in both points and rebounds:\n\n- Game 77: Yes\n- Game 78: Wait, the high rebounds for Row 4 are listed as Brook Lopez (7). So that's another one.\n- Game 80: Yes\n\nWait, that's three games\u2014Games 77, 78, and 80. So that makes three instances where he led in both points and rebounds.\n\nBut let me double-check the table to make sure I didn't misread anything.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 3 (Game 77): High points and rebounds: Brook Lopez.\nRow 4 (Game 78): High points: Brook Lopez, high rebounds: Brook Lopez. Yes, that's two games so far.\nRow 6 (Game 80): Both stats led by Lopez. That makes three.\n\nSo the claim is saying he did this three different times, which matches my findings. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for each occurrence:\n\nFor Game 77 (Row 3), columns are 'high points' and 'high rebounds'.\nFor Game 78 (Row 4), same two columns.\nFor Game 80 (Row 6), same two columns.\n\nSo I need to list these as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by three games where Brook Lopez led in both points and rebounds. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"the Nets' only win come at the prudential center.\" This suggests that all of the Nets' wins are recorded at the Prudential Center. So, my task is to check each game in the table and see where the Nets won and whether those wins occurred at the Prudential Center.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The key columns here are \"team,\" \"score,\" and \"location attendance.\"\n\nI need to identify which games resulted in a Nets win. So, I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Game 75, Philadelphia vs. Nets. Score is L (loss), so not a win.\nRow 2: Game 76, Miami vs. Nets. Score is L (loss), not a win.\nRow 3: Game 77, Minnesota vs. Nets. Score is W (win). Location is Prudential Center.\nRow 4: Game 78, Detroit vs. Nets. Score is L (loss).\nRow 5: Game 79, New York vs. Nets. Score is L (loss).\nRow 6: Game 80, Toronto vs. Nets. Score is L (loss).\nRow 7: Game 81, Charlotte vs. Nets. Score is L (loss).\n\nWait a minute, from the table provided, only Row 3 shows a win for the Nets, and it's at Prudential Center. All other games result in losses.\n\nSo, the claim says that the Nets' only win comes at the Prudential Center. But according to the table, there is only one game where the Nets won, and that was at the Prudential Center. So, does this mean the claim is TRUE?\n\nBut hold on, I should double-check if there are any other games not shown in the table that might have wins for the Nets, but since the table goes up to Game 81, it's possible these are all the relevant games.\n\nSo, in the given data, the Nets only won once, and that was at Prudential Center. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if the term \"only\" is correctly interpreted. Does the claim mean that all wins are at Prudential Center? Since there's only one win in the table, and it's at Prudential Center, then yes, the Nets' only win is there. So, the statement holds.\n\nTherefore, after checking each game, I conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center\" is supported by the table as all wins (only one) are located at the Prudential Center.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brook lopez lead the team in point for 5 straight game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Brook Lopez leading the team in points for five consecutive games. So, I need to look through the table and check if there are at least five rows where Brook Lopez has the highest points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, etc. The \"high points\" column lists the player with the most points in that particular game.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if Brook Lopez is listed as the high points in consecutive games.\n\nRow 1: Game 75, April 1 vs Philadelphia. High points: Brandon Wright (15). So, not Lopez.\nRow 2: Game 76, April 3 vs Miami. High points: Deron Williams (18). Not Lopez.\nRow 3: Game 77, April 5 vs Minnesota. High points: Brook Lopez (30). That's one.\nRow 4: Game 78, April 6 vs Detroit. High points: Brook Lopez (39). Two in a row now.\nRow 5: Game 79, April 8 vs New York. High points: Brook Lopez (27). Three straight.\nRow 6: Game 80, April 10 vs Toronto. High points: Brook Lopez (35). Four in a row.\nRow 7: Game 81, April 11 vs Charlotte. High points: Brook Lopez (31). Five straight!\n\nSo, from game 77 to 81, that's five consecutive games where Brook Lopez led in points. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are exactly five in a row and not more or less. Looking at the table, games 3 through 7 (assuming rows 3-7 correspond to games 77-81) have Lopez as high points each time. So that's five games: 77,78,79,80,81. So yes, five straight.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Brook Lopez did lead the team in points for five consecutive games.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells confirming Brook Lopez led the team in points for five consecutive games are:\n\n- Game 77 (Row 3): high points: Brook Lopez\n- Game 78 (Row 4): high points: Brook Lopez\n- Game 79 (Row 5): high points: Brook Lopez\n- Game 80 (Row 6): high points: Brook Lopez\n- Game 81 (Row 7): high points: Brook Lopez\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the most highly attended game be against miami at the prudential center.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. It's about the \"most highly attended\" game.\n2. This game is \"against Miami.\"\n3. The location is the Prudential Center.\n\nSo, my task is to check if there's a game in the table that meets all these criteria and has the highest attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like team, date, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. I need to focus on the \"location attendance\" column because that's about how many people attended each game.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Game 75 against Philadelphia at Wells Fargo Center with 16,695 attendees.\n- **Row 2**: Game 76 against Miami at Prudential Center with 18,711 attendees.\n- **Row 3**: Game 77 against Minnesota at Prudential Center with 13,461 attendees.\n- **Row 4**: Game 78 against Detroit at the Palace of Auburn Hills with 14,554 attendees.\n- **Row 5**: Game 79 against New York at Prudential Center with 18,023 attendees.\n- **Row 6**: Game 80 against Toronto at Air Canada Centre with 17,755 attendees.\n- **Row 7**: Game 81 against Charlotte at Prudential Center with 13,853 attendees.\n\nNow, I need to see which game has the highest attendance. Let's list out the attendances:\n\n- Row 1: 16,695\n- Row 2: 18,711\n- Row 3: 13,461\n- Row 4: 14,554\n- Row 5: 18,023\n- Row 6: 17,755\n- Row 7: 13,853\n\nComparing these numbers:\n\nThe highest attendance is in Row 2 (18,711) and Row 5 (18,023). So, both games have over 18,000 attendees. Now, I need to check if these are against Miami and at the Prudential Center.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 2: Against Miami, location Prudential Center.\n- Row 5: Against New York, location Prudential Center.\n\nSo, the highest attendance is in both Game 76 (Miami) with 18,711 and Game 79 (New York) with 18,023. However, the claim specifically mentions \"against Miami,\" so only Game 76 fits that criteria.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the most highly attended game be against Miami.\" So, if there's another game against Miami with high attendance, but less than Row 2, then it might not be the highest overall. But in this case, Game 76 is higher than any other game, including others against different teams.\n\nBut to clarify, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Is there a game against Miami with the highest attendance?\n2. Does that game take place at Prudential Center?\n\nFrom the table, yes, Game 76 is against Miami and has the highest attendance of 18,711 at Prudential Center.\n\nSo, does this mean the claim is TRUE? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the most highly attended game be against miami at the prudential center.\" So it's asserting that the most attended game meets those two criteria. From the data, Game 76 (against Miami) has the highest attendance among all games listed here. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists a game (specifically Game 76) that is against Miami and has the highest attendance at Prudential Center.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the game is against Miami and has the highest attendance at Prudential Center. From the table, this corresponds to Row 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"brook lopez lead the team in assist for more games than deron williams do.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Brook Lopez has more games where he led the team in assists compared to Deron Williams. So, I need to look at each game and see who had higher assists.\n\nLooking through the table, each row represents a game with several columns like game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. The relevant column for this claim is \"high assists.\"\n\nI should go through each row and check if Brook Lopez or Deron Williams had the highest assists in that game.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Game 75, April 1. High assists are by Deron Williams with 7. So neither Lopez nor Williams here; maybe not relevant unless they're tied, but he's leading. Wait, no, it's just who has the high assist. So in this row, Deron has the highest.\n\nRow 2: Game 76, April 3. High assists are by Deron Williams with 9.\n\nRow 3: Game 77, April 5. High assists by Deron Williams with 21.\n\nRow 4: Game 78, April 6. High assists by Jordan Farmar with 11.\n\nRow 5: Game 79, April 8. High assists by Jordan Farmar with 9.\n\nRow 6: Game 80, April 10. High assists by Jordan Farmar with 7.\n\nRow 7: Game 81, April 11. High assists by Jordan Farmar with 9.\n\nWait, so looking through all these games from 75 to 81, I need to see in how many games Lopez led in assists compared to Williams. But wait, in the first three games (75-77), Deron has the high assists. In game 78, it's Farmar, then same for 79,80,81.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Brook Lopez leading more than Deron Williams. So I need to check if Lopez had higher assists than both his teammates and Williams in a particular game, or just compared directly to Williams.\n\nBut the way the table is structured, \"high assists\" refers to who had the highest number of assists in that game, regardless of others. So for each game, the player with the highest assist count is noted.\n\nSo I need to see, across all games listed (75-81), how many times did Lopez have more assists than Williams? Or perhaps just whether Lopez has a higher total in leading.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about \"lead the team in assist for more games.\" So it's about the number of games where Lopez led in assists compared to Williams. But actually, the high assists per game are either by Lopez, Williams, or others (like Farmar).\n\nSo let's check each row:\n\nRow 1: Game 75. High assists: Deron W. with 7. So neither Lopez nor Williams leading here? Wait, no, in this case, W has the highest. So in this game, it's not that Lopez leads; it's W.\n\nSimilarly, Row 2: Deron W again.\n\nRow3: Deron W.\n\nRow4: Jordan F.\n\nRow5: Jordan F.\n\nRow6: Jordan F.\n\nRow7: Jordan F.\n\nSo in none of these games does Brook Lopez have the highest assists. So if I'm looking for how many times Lopez led, it's zero. Deron Williams has 3 games where he was leading (Games 75,76,77). The other games were led by Farmar or others.\n\nTherefore, the number of games where Lopez led in assists is zero. The claim says Lopez leads more than Williams. Since Williams led in 3 games and Lopez led in none, the statement would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim that Brook Lopez led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams, we examine each game's high assist column:\n\n1. **Game 75**: High assists by Deron Williams (7).\n2. **Game 76**: High assists by Deron Williams (9).\n3. **Game 77**: High assists by Deron Williams (21).\n4. **Game 78**: High assists by Jordan Farmar (11).\n5. **Game 79**: High assists by Jordan Farmar (9).\n6. **Game 80**: High assists by Jordan Farmar (7).\n7. **Game 81**: High assists by Jordan Farmar (9).\n\nBrook Lopez did not lead in any of these games, while Deron Williams led in 3. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Travis Outlaw led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times.\" \n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to check for any occurrence where Travis Outlaw led in both points and rebounds.\n\nLooking at Row 1 (game 75), the high points are by Brandan Wright with 15 points. High rebounds are also by Brandan Wright. So, Travis didn't lead here.\n\nRow 2 is game 76. High points are Deron Williams with 18, and rebounds are Travis Outlaw with 9. Here, Travis leads in rebounds but not points. So that's one instance where he led in rebounds only.\n\nMoving to Row 3 (game 77), Brook Lopez has both high points and rebounds. So, no for this game.\n\nRow 4 is game 78. High points are Brook Lopez with 39, and rebounds by Brook as well. Not Travis here.\n\nRow 5 (game 79): High points by Brook again, so no.\n\nRow 6 (game 80): Brook leads both points and rebounds.\n\nNow, Row 7 is game 81.

Each time, either he leads in one or the other, but not both together. Therefore, there's no single game where he did both. \n\nSo, the claim that he did so three different times isn't accurate because he didn't do it even once. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the nets' only win come at the air canada centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Nets have their only wins at the Air Canada Centre. So, all of their victories (if any) happen in games played there. My task is to check each game in the table and see if any of them are wins for the Nets.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice it has 7 rows, each representing a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc. Each row seems to correspond to a specific game, so I should go through each one to check the outcome (win or loss) and the location of each game.\n\nLet me start by identifying which games are wins for the Nets. A win would be when their score is \"w\" followed by a number against another team's score starting with \"l\". For example, if it's \"w 107 - 105 (ot)\", that means they won.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: The game is on April 1 against Philadelphia. The score is listed as \"l 90 - 115 (ot)\". Since it starts with \"l\", that's a loss for the Nets. So, no win here.\n\nRow 2: Game on April 3 vs Miami. Score is \"l 94 - 108 (ot)\", another loss. Not a win.\n\nRow 3: April 5 against Minnesota. Score is \"w 107 - 105 (ot)\". That's a win for the Nets. The location is Prudential Center with attendance 13461.\n\nRow 4: April 6 vs Detroit. Score is \"l 109 - 116 (ot)\", loss again. No win here.\n\nRow 5: April 8 against New York. Score is \"l 93 - 116 (ot)\", another loss.\n\nRow 6: April 10 vs Toronto. The score is \"l 92 - 99 (ot)\", so that's a loss too. Wait, but the location is Air Canada Centre with attendance 17755.\n\nRow 7: April 11 vs Charlotte. Score is \"l 103 - 105 (ot)\", which means another loss.\n\nSo, from the table, the only game where the Nets won was Row 3. The location for that game is Prudential Center in Minneapolis, not the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim again: it says \"the nets' only win come at the air canada centre.\" But according to the table, their only win was in Minneapolis, not Toronto. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because their only win didn't happen at Air Canada Centre.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure there are no other wins. The table has 7 games, and only Row 3 is a win for the Nets. So yes, that's the only win. But it wasn't in Toronto (Air Canada Centre). Therefore, the claim is false because their only win didn't occur at Air Canada Centre.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be those where they won, so Row 3, specifically the columns: game (which is row_index 3), team, score, high points, etc., but particularly the location column. So in this case, for Row 3, the location is Prudential Center.\n\nSo, to sum up, the claim is false because their only win was not at Air Canada Centre.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the nets' only win come at the air canada centre\" is FALSE because the Nets' only win in the table occurred at Prudential Center in Minneapolis, not at Air Canada Centre.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"jordan farmar lead the team in points for 5 straight games\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Jordan Farmar led his team's points in five consecutive games. So, I need to check each relevant game row in the table and see if there's a game where Jordan Farmar was the top scorer for five straight times.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to look for any mention of Jordan Farmar as the player with the high points. \n\nLooking at Row 1: It mentions Brandan Wright with 15 high points, so not Farmar.\nRow 2: Deron Williams has 18, so nope.\nRow 3: Brook Lopez scored 30, so that's him.\nRow 4: Lopez again with 39.\nRow 5: Lopez with 27.\nRow 6: Lopez with 35.\nRow 7: Lopez with 31.\n\nHmm, in the first two rows, Farmar isn't even listed as a high scorer. Then, from Row 3 onwards, it's Lopez leading the points each time. So, when does Farmar lead? I don't see any row where Farmar is mentioned as having the highest points. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. In Row 4, the high assists are by Farmar (11), and in Row 5, he has some rebounds and assists. But for points, it's Lopez every time from Row 3 to Row 7.\n\nSo, Jordan Farmar doesn't lead in points in any of these games listed. The claim says five straight games, but I don't see any instance where he leads in points. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"jordan farmar lead the team in point for 5 straight game,\" we examine each relevant row in the table. None of the rows indicate that Jordan Farmar led the team in points; Brook Lopez holds that distinction from Row 3 onward. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main parts: the opponent (Minnesota) and the location (Prudential Center). It's about attendance, specifically the highest attended game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. The goal is to find out which games had the highest attendance at Prudential Center against Minnesota.\n\nTo verify the claim, I need to look for games where the opponent is Minnesota and check their location attendance. Among those, I have to see if any of them has the highest number of attendees compared to all other games in the table.\n\nStarting with row 1: Game 75 vs Philadelphia at Wells Fargo Center with 16,695 attendees.\nRow 2: Game 76 vs Miami at Prudential Center with 18,711 attendees.\nRow 3: Game 77 vs Minnesota at Prudential Center. The attendance here is 13,461.\nRow 4: Game 78 vs Detroit at Palace of Auburn Hills with 14,554.\nRow 5: Game 79 vs New York at Prudential Center with 18,023.\nRow 6: Game 80 vs Toronto at Air Canada Centre with 17,755.\nRow 7: Game 81 vs Charlotte at Prudential Center with 13,853.\n\nNow, focusing on games against Minnesota. From the table, only row 3 (Game 77) is against Minnesota. The attendance for that game is 13,461.\n\nNext, I need to see if any other games have higher attendance at Prudential Center. Looking through all rows, the highest attendance at Prudential Center is in row 5 with 18,023 and row 2 with 18,711.\n\nWait, actually, row 2 has a game against Miami with 18,711 attendees, which is higher than row 5's 18,023. So the highest attendance overall in the table is 18,711 at Prudential Center for Game 76 vs Miami.\n\nSince the claim says \"the most highly attended game be against Minnesota,\" but the highest attendance at Prudential Center isn't against Minnesota, it's against Miami. Therefore, the claim is false because the highest attended game isn't against Minnesota but another team.\n\nI should also check if any of the games against Minnesota have higher attendance than others. Only row 3 (13k) is against Minnesota, which is lower than other games at Prudential Center like rows 2 and 5 with over 18k attendees.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because the highest attended game isn't against Minnesota but another opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the most highly attended game was against Minnesota at Prudential Center is FALSE. The highest attendance figures in the table are from games not involving Minnesota, specifically row 2 (18,711) and row 5 (18,023).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
