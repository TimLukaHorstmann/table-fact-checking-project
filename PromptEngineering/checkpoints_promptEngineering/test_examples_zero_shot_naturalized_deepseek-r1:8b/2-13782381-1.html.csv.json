    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the average result for week 13 be l 28 - 17\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions an average result for week 13 being a loss with the score of l 28 - 17. So, I need to check if in week 13, the team lost by a score of 28-17 and then see how this compares to other games in week 13 across all weeks.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row represents a specific game for a particular week. Each row has 'week' as an identifier. So, I should check if any week 13 game had a result of l 28 - 17. However, I notice that the claim refers to \"the average result,\" which implies there might be multiple games in week 13.\n\nBut looking at the table provided, the weeks go from 1 to 16, but each week only has one game. So, week 13 is only once: row 13. Let me check what's in row 13.\n\nRow 13:\n- Week: 13\n- Date: 1984 - 11 - 26\n- Opponent: miami dolphins\n- Result: l 28 - 17\n- Game site: miami orange bowl\n- Attendance: 74884\n\nSo, week 13's game result is indeed a loss with the score of 28-17. Now, since there's only one game for week 13, we can't compute an average because that would just be the single result.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the average result.\" If there's only one result, then technically, it's both the mean and the only result. So, in that sense, maybe the claim is TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if the table included multiple week 13 games, we might need to compute an average, but since each week has a single game, week 13 only has one game, so there's no averaging needed; it's just that game's result.\n\nTherefore, the claim is stating that in week 13, the team lost with a score of 28-17. Since row 13 confirms this, the statement holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this claim means. It's saying that in week 12, the game result was an average of 28-17. Wait, but each game has a specific result, like win or loss with scores. So maybe it's referring to whether their performance that week matched an average score of 28-17.\n\nLooking at the table, I see each row represents a different week (from week 1 to week 16). Each row includes details like opponent, result, game site, and attendance.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"week 12\" and the result \"28 - 17\". So I should check if in week 12, the result was 28-17. Let me look at row 12: week:12, date:1984-11-18, opponent:houston oilers, result:l 31-20. Hmm, that's a loss with scores 31-20, not a win with 28-17.\n\nSo the result for week 12 isn't 28-17; it's actually a loss against Houston. That means the claim is false because in week 12, the result wasn't 28-17 but rather 31-20.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Could it be that the average of all previous results equals 28-17? No, the claim says \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17.\" So week 12's result is being compared to an average of 28-17 across games. But each game has a specific result, so it doesn't make sense because each result is unique; you can't have all results as 28-17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that in week 12, the result was exactly 28-17, and that's an average for that week's games. But since there's only one game per week, it would mean week 12's game had a result of 28-17, which isn't the case here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because in week 12, the result was not 28-17. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in week 12, the result was an average of 28-17. However, upon checking row 12, the game resulted in a loss (31-20), not 28-17.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the claimed week and result:** Week 12 with result \"28 - 17\".\n2. **Check the table for week 12 (row 12):** Opponent is Houston Oilers, result is a loss with scores 31-20.\n3. **Conclusion:** The result in week 12 does not match the claimed average of 28-17.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
