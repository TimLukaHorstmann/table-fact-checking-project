    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim states: \"rutgers university be found before the school with the nickname fly dutchmen.\" \n\nFirst, I should find Rutgers University in the table. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: University of Delaware\nRow 2: Lebanon Valley College (nickname: Flying Dutchmen)\nRow 3: URI\nRow 4: Rutgers University\n\nSo Rutgers is Row 4. The nickname for Rutgers isn't provided in the table, but I know from general knowledge that Rutgers has a nickname like Scarlet Knights, but it's not listed here.\n\nNext, the school with the nickname \"Fly Dutchmen\" is Lebanon Valley College (Row 2). \n\nThe claim says \"rutgers university be found before the school with the nickname fly dutchmen.\" So we need to check if Rutgers was founded earlier than Lebanon Valley. \n\nLooking at their founding years:\n\nRutgers: 1766\nLebanon Valley: 1866\n\nYes, 1766 is earlier than 1866. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because Rutgers was founded before Lebanon Valley College.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that only the relevant cells are identified. The key columns needed are \"school\" and \"founded\". So for both Rutgers (Row4) and Lebanon Valley (Row2), we need their founding years to compare them.\n\nSo relevant cells would be Row4's \"founded\" and Row2's \"founded\", along with their school names. Wait, but the columns needed are: school, founded. So the cells are:\n\n- Rutgers University's row has \"row_index\": 4, columns: school and founded.\n- Lebanon Valley College's row has \"row_index\": 2, columns: school and founded.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about whether Rutgers was found before the Fly Dutchmen school, so we need both their founding years. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Row4 (Rutgers): founded column.\nFor Row2 (Lebanon Valley): founded column.\n\nSo in the JSON, I'll include both rows with their \"founded\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Rutgers University was founded in 1766, which is earlier than Lebanon Valley College's founding year of 1866.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"2 of the schools in the eastern state collegiate hockey league be located in Pennsylvania.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asking. It's about the location of two schools within the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League that are situated in Pennsylvania.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows with information about different universities. Each row has details like school name, location, founding year, affiliation, enrollment, nickname, and primary conference.\n\nI need to check if any of these schools are part of the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League (ESCHL) and located in Pennsylvania. The claim states that two such schools exist in PA. \n\nBut wait, the table doesn't list the conferences as ESCHL. Instead, I see conferences like Colonial Athletic Association, MAC Commonwealth, Atlantic 10, American Athletic Conference, America East, and PSAC (Pennsylvania State Academy of Sports). There's no mention of ESCHL here.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the first step is to identify which schools are part of the ESCHL. Since the table doesn't include that information, maybe I need to look elsewhere or make an assumption based on typical conferences in Pennsylvania.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim refers to the ESCHL and PA locations, but the table doesn't provide conference info, perhaps the relevant cells can't be determined from this table. However, the task is to check against the given table, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, the user provided a naturalized table where each row has details including location. The claim is about two schools in ESCHL located in PA. Since the table doesn't mention ESCHL, perhaps none of the information is directly related here. Alternatively, maybe I should check if any of the listed schools are from Pennsylvania and then see their conferences.\n\nLooking at the locations: Row 2 is Lebanon Valley College in Annville, PA; Row 6 is West Chester University in West Chester, PA. So two schools in the table are located in Pennsylvania. Now, for the claim to be TRUE, these two schools should also be part of the ESCHL. But since the table doesn't specify their conferences as ESCHL, I can't confirm that.\n\nBut wait, the task is to check if the claim is supported by the table. The claim says there are two schools in the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League located in Pennsylvania. The table lists two PA schools but doesn't mention their conference memberships. So perhaps the relevant cells would be about these two schools (Lebanon Valley College and West Chester University) being in PA, but not necessarily in ESCHL.\n\nHowever, since the claim is about their league membership, which isn't directly provided in the table, maybe the answer is FALSE because we can't confirm their conference from this table. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to only check location, making it TRUE as two are in PA, but that's not enough for the claim.\n\nWait, the relevant cells should be where the info is checked. The claim refers to two schools in ESCHL located in PA, so looking at the 'location' and 'primary conference' columns would be relevant. Since the table doesn't list their conferences as ESCHL, those cells (row 2 and row 6) don't support the claim.\n\nBut perhaps I'm supposed to assume that schools from certain conferences are part of ESCHL? The claim is about two in PA being in ESCHL, but without conference info, we can't confirm. So the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two schools in the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League (ESCHL) are located in Pennsylvania. The table lists two Pennsylvania schools: Lebanon Valley College and West Chester University. However, the table does not specify their conferences, so we cannot verify if they are part of ESCHL.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant cells:** None, as the necessary conference information isn't provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Their location is Stony Brook, NY, founded in 1957, affiliation is public, enrollment is 23,997. So that's our first school.\n\nThen, looking for West Chester, PA. That should be Row 6. The row says West Chester University has a location of West Chester, PA, founded in 1871, and their enrollment is 12,800.\n\nNow, I need to compare the enrollments.

The claim says, \"the school with the lowest enrollment can be found after the school located in Newark, DE.\" \n\nFirst, I should find all the schools located in Newark, DE. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: school is University of Delaware, location is Newark, DE.\n\nSo there's only one school in Newark, DE, which is the University of Delaware. \n\nNext, I need to identify the school with the lowest enrollment. To do that, I'll list all enrollments from each row and find the minimum value.\n\nRow 1: 19067\nRow 2: 2100\nRow 3: 19095\nRow 4: 56868\nRow 5: 23997\nRow 6: 12800\n\nThe enrollments are: 19067, 2100, 19095, 56868, 23997, 12800. The smallest is 2100, which corresponds to Lebanon Valley College in Row 2.\n\nNow, the claim says that after the school located in Newark, DE (which is Row 1), you can find the school with the lowest enrollment. However, Lebanon Valley College is in Annville, PA (Row 2). So the next row after Row 1 isn't Row 2; there's another school in between. Therefore, the claim's assertion that the lowest enrollment is found right after the Newark DE school isn't accurate because it skips to Row 2.\n\nWait, but the instruction is about whether \"the school with the lowest enrollment can be found after the school located in Newark, DE.\" So it doesn't necessarily have to be immediately after; just somewhere after. But in this case, Row 1 is University of Delaware, and the next rows are Lebanon Valley College (Row 2), etc. The lowest enrollment is in Row 2, which is indeed after Row 1. So maybe the claim is true because the school with the lowest enrollment exists after the Newark DE school.\n\nWait, but the order in the table isn't necessarily the geographical order; it's just a list of schools. So the key point is whether Lebanon Valley College (Row 2) is after the Newark school. Since Row 1 is Newark and Row 2 comes next, yes, it's after. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the lowest enrollment school is found after the Newark DE school.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. The claim says \"after,\" which could mean in a list that follows. So in the table, Row 1 is Newark, and then Row 2 comes next. Since Lebanon Valley College is Row 2, it's indeed after Row 1. Therefore, the lowest enrollment school is found after the Newark DE school.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are Row 1 (University of Delaware) and Row 2 (Lebanon Valley College).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the school with the lowest enrollment can be found after the school located in Newark, DE. Checking the table:\n\n- University of Delaware (Row 1) is in Newark, DE.\n- The next row (Row 2) is Lebanon Valley College with the lowest enrollment.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are Row 1 and Row 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"only 1 school have an enrollment number less than 10000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has six rows, each representing a different school with various attributes like location, founding year, affiliation, enrollment, nickname, and primary conference. The claim specifically mentions enrollment numbers, so my focus will be on that column.\n\nI need to count how many schools have an enrollment number less than 10,000. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: University of Delaware has an enrollment of 19,067. That's above 10,000.\nRow 2: Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment of 2,100. That's below 10,000.\nRow 3: University of Rhode Island has an enrollment of 19,095. Above 10,000.\nRow 4: Rutgers University has an enrollment of 56,868. Way above 10,000.\nRow 5: Stony Brook University has an enrollment of 23,997. Also above 10,000.\nRow 6: West Chester University has an enrollment of 12,800. That's below 10,000.\n\nSo, from this, I can see that there are two schools\u2014Lebanon Valley College and West Chester University\u2014with enrollments under 10,000. Wait, no, that's not right because 2,100 and 12,800 are both less than 10,000? No, wait, 12,800 is more than 10,000. Oh, I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let me double-check Row 6: West Chester University has an enrollment of 12,800. Is that less than 10,000 or more? Hmm, no, because 10,000 would be exactly ten thousand. So 12,800 is higher than 10,000. So only Lebanon Valley College (2,100) is below 10,000.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought Row 6 was below 10k but upon rechecking, it's actually above. So that would mean only one school\u2014Lebanon Valley College\u2014is under 10,000. Wait no, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 19,067 - over\nRow 2: 2,100 - under\nRow 3: 19,095 - over\nRow 4: 56,868 - over\nRow 5: 23,997 - over\nRow 6: 12,800 - over\n\nWait, no, Row 6 is 12,800, which is more than 10,000. So only Lebanon Valley College (2,100) and maybe another one? Wait, looking back at the data:\n\nNo, Row 6's enrollment is 12,800, which is still above 10,000. So that's two schools: Lebanon Valley College with 2,100 and perhaps another one?\n\nWait no, I think only Lebanon Valley College is below 10,000 because the other enrollments are all over 10,000 except for Row 6, which is actually 12,800\u2014so it's still above. Therefore, only one school has an enrollment number less than 10,000.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't misread any numbers. For example, in Row 5: Stony Brook University has 23,997, which is over. Row 6: West Chester University with 12,800\u2014yes, that's still above 10k. So only Lebanon Valley College (Row 2) is below 10k.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"only 1 school\" have enrollment less than 10k, and based on my analysis, that's correct because there's only one such school. Wait, but I thought Row 6 might be under, but it's actually over. So yes, only one.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Let me go through each row again:\n\nRow 1: 19k+ - over\nRow 2: 2k - under\nRow 3: 19k+ - over\nRow 4: ~57k - over\nRow 5: ~24k - over\nRow 6: 12,800 - that's more than 10k. So only Row 2 is under.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"only 1 school\" which matches because there's only one (Lebanon Valley College). So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but wait another moment\u2014maybe I misread Row 6's enrollment as 12,800 or something else. Let me check: in the table, for Row 6, the enrollment is listed as 12800. So yes, that's over 10k. Therefore, only one school meets the condition.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the claim says \"less than 10000,\" so 12,800 is more than 10k, so not included. So only Lebanon Valley College (Row 2) has an enrollment less than 10k. That makes it one school, which aligns with the claim of \"only 1 school.\" So the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014did I miss any other rows? Let me check each row again:\n\n- Row 1: 19,067 - over\n- Row 2: 2,100 - under\n- Row 3: 19,095 - over\n- Row 4: 56,868 - over\n- Row 5: 23,997 - over\n- Row 6: 12,800 - over\n\nYes, only Row 2 is under. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait another moment\u2014what about the other rows? For example, are there any other enrollments under 10k that I might have missed? Let me check each number:\n\nRow 1: 19,067\nRow 2: 2,100\nRow 3: 19,095\nRow 4: 56,868\nRow 5: 23,997\nRow 6: 12,800\n\nSo yes, only Row 2 is under 10k. Therefore, the claim that only one school has an enrollment less than 10k is TRUE.\n\nWait, but wait again\u2014the claim says \"less than 10000.\" So 2,100 is less than 10,000, and 12,800 is not\u2014it's over. So yes, only one. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify how many schools have an enrollment number less than 10,000.\n\n1. **Analyze each row's enrollment:**\n   - Row 1: University of Delaware - 19,067 (over)\n   - Row 2: Lebanon Valley College - 2,100 (under)\n   - Row 3: University of Rhode Island - 19,095 (over)\n   - Row 4: Rutgers University - 56,868 (over)\n   - Row 5: Stony Brook University - 23,997 (over)\n   - Row 6: West Chester University - 12,800 (over)\n\n2. **Count the number of schools with enrollment <10,000:**\n   - Only Lebanon Valley College (Row 2) meets this criterion.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is exactly one school (Lebanon Valley College) with an enrollment less than 10,000.\n   - The claim \"only 1 school\" accurately reflects this situation.\n\n**Final Answer:** The claim is TRUE.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{TRUE}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"rutgers university be found after lebanon valley university\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim is stating that Rutgers University comes after Lebanon Valley University in some context. Looking at the table, each row represents a different university with various attributes like location, founding year, affiliation, enrollment, nickname, and primary conference.\n\nI should compare the positions of these two universities in the table to see their order. Let's list out the universities as per the table:\n\n1. University of Delaware\n2. Lebanon Valley College\n3. University of Rhode Island\n4. Rutgers University\n5. Stony Brook University\n6. West Chester University\n\nSo, according to this list, Lebanon Valley College is row 2 and Rutgers University is row 4. The claim says that Rutgers comes after Lebanon Valley, which in the table's order, it does because row 4 comes after row 2.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if \"after\" refers to something else, like founding date or another attribute. Let me look at their founding years:\n\n- Lebanon Valley College was founded in 1866.\n- Rutgers University was founded in 1766.\n\nRutgers is older than Lebanon Valley by about 170 years. So if the claim is referring to founding order, Lebanon Valley comes after Rutgers because it was established later. That might complicate things.\n\nHowever, the table's row index is based on the order presented, not necessarily chronological or alphabetical. The user's instruction seems to focus on the order in the table rather than actual founding dates unless specified otherwise.\n\nSince the claim doesn't specify the context of \"after,\" I should consider it as a positional order within the table. In that case, Rutgers is indeed after Lebanon Valley because it's listed later (row 4 vs. row 2). \n\nI should also check for any possible confusions with other attributes like conference or enrollment, but the claim doesn't mention those. It simply states the universities' names in a certain order.\n\nTherefore, based on the table structure provided, Rutgers is indeed listed after Lebanon Valley.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I need to understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe term \"most recent college to be found\" probably refers to which school was established last among all the listed institutions. So, I should look at the 'founded' year for each row in the table and determine which one has the highest (most recent) founding date.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: University of Delaware founded in 1743\nRow 2: Lebanon Valley College founded in 1866\nRow 3: University of Rhode Island founded in 1892\nRow 4: Rutgers University founded in 1766\nRow 5: Stony Brook University founded in 1957\nRow 6: West Chester University founded in 1871\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Row 5 says Stony Brook was founded in 1957, which is the latest among all of them. That would make Lebanon Valley College (1866) not the most recent.\n\nBut I need to double-check if I'm interpreting 'founded' correctly. The claim mentions \"to be found,\" so it's about when they were established, not when they were renamed or something else.\n\nSo Stony Brook has the highest founding year at 1957, making them the most recent. Therefore, the claim that Lebanon Valley is the most recent is FALSE because Stony Brook was founded later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Lebanon Valley University is the most recent college to be founded.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"2 schools in the eastern state collegiate hockey league be located in new jersey.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two schools from the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League (ESCHL) that are situated in New Jersey. So, my task is to look through the table and see if there are two entries that match these criteria: they belong to the ESCHL and their locations are in New Jersey.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that each row represents a different school with various attributes like school name, location, founding year, affiliation, enrollment, nickname, and primary conference. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"location\" because we need to check where each school is based, and possibly \"primary conference\" if it's necessary to confirm the league.\n\nWait, actually, the claim specifically mentions the ESCHL. So I should first check which schools in the table are part of the ESCHL. However, looking at the primary conferences of each row:\n\n- Row 1: Colonial Athletic Association (CAA)\n- Row 2: MAC Commonwealth Conference\n- Row 3: Atlantic 10 Conference (A10)\n- Row 4: American Athletic Conference (AAC)\n- Row 5: America East Conference (AE)\n- Row 6: PSAC (Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference)\n\nI don't see any mention of the ESCHL in these primary conferences. That could mean that either the schools are part of other conferences or perhaps the table doesn't list all their information, but since it's a naturalized table, it should include relevant details.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again. The \"primary conference\" column has abbreviations like (d - i), etc. Perhaps these correspond to different leagues. But without knowing what d-i stands for, it might be harder to identify which conferences are related to hockey. Maybe ESCHL is a different league that's not listed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to two schools in New Jersey that are part of the ESCHL. So even if their primary conference isn't listed as ESCHL, maybe they're part of it but under a different listing.\n\nLooking at the locations:\n\nRow 4: Rutgers University is in New Brunswick, NJ. Is Rutgers part of the ESCHL? I know that Division I schools often play in various conferences, and hockey leagues can be specific. Checking my knowledge, I recall that some universities in New Jersey are part of ECAC (Eastern College Athletic Conference), which has a hockey league. But again, without explicit information here, it's unclear.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"2 schools in the eastern state collegiate hockey league.\" So maybe the table is incomplete or perhaps the relevant info isn't directly stated. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if two schools are in New Jersey and their primary conference is part of a certain structure, they belong to ESCHL.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for any schools in New Jersey regardless of the conference because the claim might be more about location than the league itself.\n\nBut the key point is whether there are two schools from the ESCHL located in New Jersey. Since the table doesn't explicitly state their conferences beyond what's listed, and the primary conferences don't include ESCHL, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake. Let me think again: The claim is about two schools in the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League (ESCHL) located in New Jersey. So first, I need to identify if any of the schools are part of ESCHL and then check their locations.\n\nLooking at each school:\n\nRow 4: Rutgers University in NJ. If they're in a hockey league, is it ESCHL? From my knowledge, Rutgers men's hockey team competes in the ECAC Hockey conference, which has both Div I and Div II schools. So maybe they are part of that, but not necessarily ESCHL.\n\nSimilarly, other schools in New Jersey like Princeton or Dartmouth might be part of ECAC. But none of these are in the given table beyond Rutgers.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, only Row 4 is in NJ: Rutgers University. So there's only one school from NJ in this table. The claim says two, so that would make it false because only one is present.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's only one school (Rutgers) in New Jersey among those listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are two schools in the Eastern State Collegiate Hockey League located in New Jersey. However, upon examining the provided table, only Rutgers University from New Jersey is present. Since there is only one such school, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}",

Let me start by looking at the table and identifying the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the rows for Stony Brook University and West Chester University in the table. From the data provided:\n\n- **Stony Brook University**:\n  - Row 5: school name, location, founded, affiliation, enrollment (23,997), nickname, primary conference.\n  \n- **West Chester University**:\n  - Row 6: school name, location, founded, affiliation, enrollment (12,800), nickname, primary conference.\n\nThe claim is about comparing the enrollments of these two universities. So, I need to check their enrollment numbers. \n\nLooking at Row 5 for Stony Brook University, the enrollment number is 23,997. For West Chester University in Row 6, the enrollment is 12,800.\n\nComparing these two numbers: 23,997 (Stony Brook) is greater than 12,800 (West Chester). Therefore, Stony Brook has more students than West Chester. \n\nThe claim states the opposite, so it must be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"3 schools have an enrollment of under 10,000.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and extract relevant information. Each row in the table represents a different school with various attributes like school name, location, founding year, affiliation, enrollment numbers, nicknames, and primary conferences.\n\nThe key here is to focus on the \"enrollment\" column since the claim is about enrollment numbers. Specifically, I need to check which schools have enrollments under 10,000. \n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: University of Delaware - Enrollment is 19,067. That's above 10,000.\nRow 2: Lebanon Valley College - Enrollment is 2,100. That's below 10,000.\nRow 3: University of Rhode Island - Enrollment is 19,095. Above 10,000.\nRow 4: Rutgers University - Enrollment is 56,868. Definitely above.\nRow 5: Stony Brook University - Enrollment is 23,997. Also above.\nRow 6: West Chester University - Enrollment is 12,800. That's under 10,000.\n\nWait, let me count the enrollments under 10,000:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 2 (Lebanon Valley College): 2,100 \u2192 Under\n- Row 6 (West Chester): 12,800 \u2192 Under\n\nSo that's two schools with enrollment under 10,000. The claim says \"3 schools,\" but I'm only finding two so far.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: 19k+ - no\nRow 2: 2.1k - yes\nRow 3: ~19k - no\nRow 4: ~57k - no\nRow 5: ~24k - no\nRow 6: 12,800 - yes\n\nThat's only two schools with enrollment under 10,000. So the claim says three, but we have two. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nRow 2: Lebanon Valley College - 2,100 \u2192 Under\nRow 6: West Chester - 12,800 \u2192 Under\n\nThat's definitely two. No other rows have enrollments under 10k except these two. So the claim is incorrect because it claims three schools, but only two meet the criterion.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those two rows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"3 schools have an enrollment of under 10,000,\" we need to check each row's \"enrollment\" value. Only two schools (Lebanon Valley College and West Chester University) have enrollments below 10,000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
