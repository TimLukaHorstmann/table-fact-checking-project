    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The first part says that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088. The second part mentions that he became heir a year after Robert Curthose. So I need to check if both parts are accurate based on the table.\n\nStarting with Henry Beauclerc becoming heir in 1088: Looking through the table, Row 4 is about Henry Beauclerc. It says he became heir in 1088. That matches the first part of the claim. So that's correct so far.\n\nNext, the second part states that Henry became heir a year after Robert Curthose. I need to check when Robert Curthose became heir. Looking at Row 1 and Row 3 for Robert Curthose: In Row 1, he was the heir presumptive but it started in 1066. He then became heir again in 1087 as per Row 3. So Robert became heir in 1087.\n\nIf Henry became heir in 1088, that's exactly one year after Robert's heirship began in 1087. However, the claim says \"a year after robert curthose\", which could be interpreted as a year after he ceased to be heir or something else. Wait, let me check Row 3: Robert Curthose became heir in 1087 and then ceased in 1088. So he was heir from 1087 to 1088.\n\nSo Henry became heir in 1088, which is the next year after Robert's term ended. But the claim says \"a year after robert curthose\", which could imply that Henry became heir in the following year. However, if Robert was heir in 1087 and ceased in 1088, then 1088 would be the same year as when Henry became heir. Wait, that doesn't add up to a full year difference.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"henry beauclerc became heir in 1088 , a year after robert curthose\". So does it mean that Henry became heir one year after Robert? If Robert became heir in 1087 and Henry in 1088, that's only one year later. But wait, Robert was heir from 1087 to 1088, so in 1088 he ceased. Then Henry became heir in 1088. So the transition happened within the same year, not a full year after.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check the exact dates again. According to Row 3, Robert Curthose became heir in 1087 and ceased in 1088. So his heirship lasted from 1087 to 1088. Henry became heir in 1088, which was the same year Robert ended. So it's not a full year after Robert's tenure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. If Robert was heir starting in 1087 and then in 1088 he ceased, that means from 1087 to 1088 inclusive? Or does \"became heir\" in 1087 mean he started in 1087, and the next year he was no longer heir.\n\nSo if Henry became heir in 1088, which is after Robert's term ended in 1088, then it's not a full year after. The claim says \"a year after robert curthose\", implying that there was an interval of one year between when Robert was heir and when Henry became heir.\n\nBut according to the table, Robert was heir until 1088, and Henry took over in 1088 as well. So they were consecutive without a full year gap. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because it's not exactly a year after; it's within the same year.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The table shows that Robert became heir in 1087 (Row 3) and Henry in 1088 (Row 4). So the time between 1087 and 1088 is one year apart. Wait no: 1087 to 1088 is one year, so if Robert was heir in 1087 and Henry in 1088, that's a one-year difference. But since Robert's heirship ended in 1088, maybe the timing is overlapping.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If someone becomes heir in 1087, they are heir until 1088. Then another person becomes heir in 1088. So the first person was heir for two years (from 1087 to 1088 inclusive?), and the second takes over starting in 1088.\n\nIn that case, the time between Robert's heirship ending and Henry's beginning is zero years apart because they are in the same year. Therefore, the claim that Henry became heir a year after Robert is incorrect because it's not a full year later; it's within the same year.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is saying that Henry became heir in 1088, which was one year after Robert was heir in 1087. So from 1087 to 1088, that's one year apart. Therefore, Henry did become heir a year after Robert. But actually, the exact timing might be tricky.\n\nWait, the claim is specifically about when each became heir, not when they were heirs. So Robert became heir in 1087 and Henry in 1088. The difference between their becoming heir is one year apart (1087 to 1088). Therefore, the claim that Henry became heir a year after Robert is true.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when you become something in the same year as someone else stops, it might not count as a full year later. But according to the dates, 1088 is one year after 1087. So maybe it's correct.\n\nSo both parts of the claim seem correct: Henry became heir in 1088 and that was a year after Robert in 1087. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088, a year after Robert Curthose. According to the table:\n\n- **Henry Beauclerc** became heir in 1088 (Row 4).\n- **Robert Curthose** became heir in 1087 (Row 3).\n\nSince 1088 is one year after 1087, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row\": 3, \"col\": 2},  // Robert Curthose became heir in 1087\n    {\"row\": 4, \"col\": 2}   // Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"only 2 heirs have 'son' as their relationship to monarch.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this means. So, I should look through each row of the table and check where the relationship to the monarch is listed as 'son'. Then, count how many times this happens. If it's only two times, the claim holds; if more or less, it doesn't.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Relationship to monarch is \"son\". That's one.\nRow 2: All entries here are \"succession unclear,\" so no 'son' here. No count.\nRow 3: Relationship is \"elder brother.\" Not a son, so no.\nRow 4: Relationship is \"younger brother.\" Again, not a son.\nRow 5: All entries are unclear, so nothing to count here.\nRow 6: The relationship is \"only son,\" which fits the 'son' criterion. That's two.\nRow 7: Relationship is \"only child,\" but since she's female (empress matilda), it's not a son. So, no.\n\nWait, row 7 says 'only child,' which could be interpreted as only daughter or son, but since she's the empress and the heir, it's more about gender. Since she's female, she wouldn't be a son. So, that doesn't count.\n\nSo far, I see two instances where the relationship is 'son': Row 1 and Row 6. That would make the claim TRUE because there are exactly two heirs with 'son' as their relationship to the monarch.\n\nI should double-check if any other rows might have 'son' in their relationship to monarch. Looking back:\n\n- Row 2: succession unclear, not 'son'.\n- Row 3: elder brother.\n- Row 4: younger brother.\n- Row 5: unclear again.\n- Row 6: only son, which is correct.\n- Row 7: only child, but female.\n\nSo yes, only two heirs have 'son' as their relationship. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only two heirs had a \"son\" as their relationship to the monarch. By checking each row, we find that this occurs in Row 1 (Robert Curthose) and Row 6 (William Adelin), making the statement true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"William Adelin be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that William Adelin was the only person who became heir specifically because of their birth. So I need to check each row in the table to see if anyone else besides William Adelin became an heir for reasons related to their birth.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 because his father became king. So his becoming heir was not due to his own birth but his father's ascension.\nRow 2: This is about a period of succession uncertainty from 1077-1087. The status and other details are unclear, so maybe no specific individual became heir here.\nRow 3: Robert Curthose again in 1087, but this time it says \"by agreement.\" So perhaps he took the role through an agreement, not necessarily because of his birth.\nRow 4: Henry Beauclerc becomes heir in 1088 due to Robert's rebellion. His becoming heir was a result of conflict, not directly because of his own birth.\nRow 5: This is another period of succession uncertainty from 1100-1103, so details are unclear.\nRow 6: William Adelin became heir in 1103 because he was born. So this fits the claim about becoming heir due to birth.\nRow 7: Matilda becomes heiress presumptive after her brother died in 1120, but she was born before Henry I. Her becoming heir is not directly due to her own birth but due to her brother's death.\n\nNow, checking each heir:\n\n- Robert Curthose (twice) - neither time was it explicitly stated that he became heir because of his birth.\n- Henry Beauclerc - no, due to rebellion.\n- William Adelin - yes, specifically mentioned as \"born.\"\n- Matilda - not due to her own birth but her brother's death.\n\nSo only William Adelin fits the condition in the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that William Adelin was the only one who became heir due to his birth.

Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"Henry Beauclerc cease to be heir on 2 August 1100, followed by William Adelin 20 years later.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find relevant rows and columns related to each part of this claim. \n\nFirst, Henry Beauclerc. Scanning through the table, Row 4 is about him. In that row, under \"ceased to be heir\" it says 2 August 1100. So that's correct.\n\nNext, William Adelin. Looking at Row 6, which is about him. The date when he became heir is 1103, and he ceased in 1120. But the claim says he was 20 years after Henry, so from 1100 to 1120 would be roughly 20 years. However, the exact dates might not align perfectly. Let me check: 2 August 1100 to 25 November 1120 is about 20 years and some months, which can be considered as approximately 20 years for the claim's sake.\n\nWait, but the table says Henry became heir in 1088 (Row 4) and ceased in 1100. William Adelin became heir in 1103, so that's after Henry. So the order is correct: Henry ceases first, then William later. \n\nSo both parts of the claim seem to align with the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table entries for Henry Beauclerc and William Adelin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It says Robert Curthose was an heir twice\u2014once in 1066 and again in 1087.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different period when someone was heir. Let me go through each relevant row to see if Robert Curthose is mentioned as heir during those years.\n\nRow 1: This is about Robert Curthose. He became heir in 1066 because his father became king. So that's one instance where he was heir in 1066.\n\nThen, Row 3: It also mentions Robert Curthose again. Here, he became heir in 1087 by agreement. That's the second time he is recorded as an heir, in 1087.\n\nSo both times mentioned in the claim are supported by the table\u2014once in 1066 and once in 1087.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It says that Henry Beauclerc was the only person who became heir because of their birth. So, my goal is to check if there's any other individual in the table who also became an heir due to their birth.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent different instances where someone became heir. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Robert Curthose was an heir presumptive and he became the heir in 1066 because his father became king. So, his becoming heir is due to his father's status, not his own birth as a son. It seems more about succession based on existing titles rather than being born.\n\nRow 2: This row talks about succession being unclear from 1077-1087. The heir status is unclear here, so I don't think this row directly mentions anyone becoming heir due to their birth.\n\nRow 3: Robert Curthose again becomes heir in 1087 by agreement. It doesn't mention anything about his birth or being the only one.\n\nRow 4: Here's Henry Beauclerc. He became heir in 1088 because of Robert's rebellion. His status is as an heir presumptive, younger brother. So, it's not explicitly stated that he became heir due to his birth but rather due to the circumstances of his brother's rebellion. However, being a younger brother might imply line of succession based on birth order.\n\nRow 5: This row mentions succession being unclear from 1100-1103, so again, not about birth directly.\n\nRow 6: William Adelin becomes heir in 1103 because he was born. So here's someone else who became heir due to their birth as the only son. That means Henry Beauclerc isn't the only one who became heir due to being born.\n\nRow 7: Empress Matilda is mentioned, but her becoming heir is due to her brother dying. It doesn't state it was because she was born; rather, it's about her surviving her siblings.\n\nSo, from this analysis, William Adelin in Row 6 also became heir due to his birth. That directly contradicts the claim that Henry Beauclerc is the only one who did so. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The term used is 'succession unclear,' so no daughter mentioned.\nRow 3: Robert Curthose again, and his relationship is described as 'elder brother.'

The claim says: \"robert curthose became heir in 1094, a year after empress matilda.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and find information related to Robert Curthose and Empress Matilda.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It talks about Robert Curthose becoming heir in 1066. So that's when he first became heir under William I.\n\nRow 3 mentions Robert Curthose again, becoming heir in 1087, but this time it's under William II. That's his second time being heir.\n\nNow, Empress Matilda is mentioned in Row 7. It says she became heir in 1120, with the status as heiress presumptive. But it also mentions that she was declared heir in 1127 after her brother died. However, this seems to be under Henry I.\n\nThe claim is about Robert Curthose becoming heir in 1094. Looking through the table, Row 3 says he became heir in 1087, and then again in 1066. There's no mention of him becoming heir in 1094.\n\nSo, if the claim says Robert became heir in 1094, which isn't supported by the table, that part is false.

Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"William Adelin cease to be heir on 5 August 1119, followed by Empress Matilda 21 years later.\"\n\nLooking at the table, William Adelin is mentioned in Row 6. Specifically, he became heir in 1103 and then ceased to be heir on November 25, 1120. So his tenure ended in 1120, not 1119.\n\nNow, looking for when Empress Matilda became heir. She is in Row 7, where she became heir on November 25, 1120, the same year William Adelin ceased to be heir. However, the claim mentions a 21-year gap between their cessations. If William stopped being heir in 1120, then Empress Matilda would have taken over the same year, which is only about 6 months later, not 21 years.\n\nAdditionally, the table doesn't mention any period where Empress Matilda was an heir after William Adelin. She became heir in 1120 and later ceased in 1135. So there's no 21-year gap between them ceasing to be heir.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"robert curthose be the heir two times, in 1082 and 1094.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has several rows, each corresponding to different heirs with various details like their status, relationship to the monarch, when they became heir, why, when they ceased to be heir, and which monarch they were associated with.\n\nI'm specifically looking for Robert Curthose being an heir twice. So I need to go through each row and see if his name appears more than once, and note down the years he became heir each time.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It mentions Robert Curthose as the heir in 1066, but it's under William I. He was the heir presumptive then. Then, in Row 3, there's another entry for Robert Curthose becoming heir in 1087, again under William II. So that's two times he was an heir.\n\nNow, checking if those years are 1082 and 1094. Wait, in the table, Robert became heir in 1066 (Row1) and then again in 1087 (Row3). The claim mentions 1082 and 1094, which aren't matching exactly. So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Became heir in 1066.\nRow 3: Became heir in 1087.\nNo other Robert Curthose entries. So he was an heir twice, but not in 1082 and 1094. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the rows where Robert Curthose is the heir. That's Row1 (1066) and Row3 (1087). The columns are 'heir' for both.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"heir\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
