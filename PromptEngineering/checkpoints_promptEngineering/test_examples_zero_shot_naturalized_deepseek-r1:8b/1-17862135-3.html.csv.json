The claim is: \"warren kym perform 16 dance.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for rows that mention 'Warren Kym' because the couple's name might be a clue. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 2 has the couple as Warren & Kym. That's relevant since it mentions \"warren kym,\" so that's one row to check.\n- Now, looking at what they perform: in the 'number of dances' column for Row 2, it says 16. So their number of dances is indeed 16.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are present in Row 2. The couple is Warren & Kym, and they performed 16 dances.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure that there's no other row with the same name or something conflicting. Let me check all rows again quickly. No other row has \"warren kym,\" so it's definitely only Row 2 that matters here.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim are satisfied by Row 2, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Name**: Rocco and Karina are a couple.\n2. **Score**: They scored 89 points.\n3. **Number of dances**: They danced 5 times.\n4. **Average score**: The average is 17.8.\n\nNext, I'll refer to the table to find the corresponding row for Rocco and Karina. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Couple is Brooke & Derek\n- Row 2: Warren & Kym\n- Row 3: Lance & Lacey\n- Row 4: Maurice & Cheryl\n- Row 5: Cody & Julienne\n- Row 6: Toni B & Alec\n- Row 7: Susan & Tony D\n- Row 8: Misty & Maksim\n- Row 9: Ted & Inna\n- Row 10: Kim K & Mark\n- Row 11: Rocco & Karina\n- Row 12: Cloris & Corky\n\nSo, Rocco and Karina are in Row 11. Now, I'll check the relevant data in that row.\n\nIn Row 11:\n- **rank by average**: 11\n- **place**: 9\n- **couple**: rocco & karina\n- **total points**: 89\n- **number of dances**: 5\n- **average**: 17.8\n\nAll the components of the claim match exactly what's in Row 11. The score is indeed 89, they danced 5 times, and their average is 17.8.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Cody & Julianne's average score being 22.5 is true based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. Each row represents a different couple and provides several details: rank by average, place, couple name, total points, number of dances, and their average score. \n\nLooking for Cody & Julianne in the 'couple' column. Let me go through each row one by one until I find them.\n\nRow 1: Couple is Brooke & Derek \u2013 not them.\nRow 2: Warren & Kym \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Lance & Lacey \u2013 still not.\nRow 4: Maurice & Cheryl \u2013 not matching.\nRow 5: Couple is Cody & Julianne. Okay, found the row.\n\nNow, in Row 5, let's check what each column says. Specifically, we need to confirm if their average score is 22.5 as claimed.\n\nLooking at the 'average' column for this row: The value is indeed 22.5. So that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure there are no other couples with the same name or similar details that might be confused. Let me scan through all rows again to ensure Cody & Julianne only appear once and correctly in Row 5.\n\nYes, the couple is unique, so Row 5 is their specific row. Therefore, checking the 'average' column for that row is sufficient.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"there be more than 20 dance warren & kym have do together.\" First, I need to understand what this means. It seems like it's asking whether the couple named Warren & Kym has performed more than 20 dances in total.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a different couple and their performance details. So, I should look for the row where the couple is Warren & Kym. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Couple is Brooke & Derek\nRow 2: Couple is Warren & Kym\nRow 3: Couple is Lance & Lacey\nRow 4: Maurice & Cheryl\nRow 5: Cody & Julianne\nRow 6: Toni B & Alec\nRow 7: Susan & Tony D\nRow 8: Misty & Maksim\nRow 9: Ted & Inna\nRow 10: Kim K & Mark\nRow 11: Rocco & Karina\nRow 12: Cloris & Corky\n\nSo, Warren & Kym are in Row 2. Now, I need to check the number of dances they've done together. The table has a column called \"number of dances.\" For Row 2, that's 16 dances.\n\nWait, the claim says more than 20 dances. Since 16 is less than 20, this would mean the claim is false. But let me double-check if I'm interpreting it correctly. The term \"dance\" here refers to individual dances or total? The table uses \"number of dances,\" which likely means each performance counts as one dance, so 16 dances total.\n\nTherefore, since they have only done 16 dances together, the claim that they have more than 20 is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells for verifying the claim are in Row 2, specifically checking the number of dances. Since Warren & Kym performed 16 dances together, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"22.3 be the average for cody & julianne\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. Each row seems to represent a different couple with various details. The columns mentioned in the table include: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"22.3 be the average for cody & julianne.\" So I need to find the row where the couple is \"cody & julianne\" and check their average.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Couple is Brooke & Derek, average 27.1\n- Row 2: Warren & Kym, 24.8\n- Row 3: Lance & Lacey, 24.5\n- Row 4: Maurice & Cheryl, 22.9\n- Row 5: Cody & Julianne, 22.5\nWait, that's not matching the claim. The claim says 22.3, but here it's 22.5.\n\nHmm, let me keep checking to make sure I didn't skip any rows.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- Row 6: Toni B & Alec, 22.3\n- Row 7: Susan & Tony D, 21.3\n- Row 8: Misty & Maksim, 21.0\n- Row 9: Ted & Inna, 18.5\n- Row 10: Kim K & Mark, 18.0\n- Row 11: Rocco & Karina, 17.8\n- Row 12: Cloris & Corky, 17.3\n\nWait a minute, the only row with \"cody & julianne\" is Row 5, which has an average of 22.5, not 22.3 as claimed.\n\nSo that would mean the claim is FALSE because the average for Cody & Julianne is actually 22.5, not 22.3.\n\nI should make sure I didn't misread any rows. Let me check again.\n\nRow 6 has Toni B & Alec with an average of 22.3. That's a different couple, so that doesn't apply to the claim in question.\n\nTherefore, since the correct average for Cody & Julianne is 22.5, not 22.3 as stated, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are identified by checking each row for \"cody & julianne\" and their corresponding average. The couple's average is found to be 22.5 in Row 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
