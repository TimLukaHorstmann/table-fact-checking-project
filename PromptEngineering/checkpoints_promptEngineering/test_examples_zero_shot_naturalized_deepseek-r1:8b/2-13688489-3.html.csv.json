    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the 2009 clausura, 2008 clausura, 2008 apertura, and 2006 clausura season each have a score of 1:0.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part means. Each season is identified by the year and whether it's clausura or apertura. The scores are in the format home:away. So, for example, if a row has \"home: cerro porte\u00f1o\" and \"score: 1:0\", that would mean Cerro Porte\u00f1o scored 1 goal, and Olimpia scored 0, making it 1:0 in favor of Cerro Porte\u00f1o.\n\nI need to check each specified season's relevant matches. Let me go through each mentioned season one by one.\n\nStarting with the 2009 clausura. Looking at the table rows, I'll scan for any row where \"season\" is 2009 clausura. From the data provided, there are two such rows: Row 13 and Row 14.\n\nRow 13: home is Olimpia, score 1:2 against Cerro Porte\u00f1o on Nov 15. So the score here isn't 1:0; it's 1:2. That doesn't match.\nRow 14: home is Cerro Porte\u00f1o, score 1:0 against Olimpia on Aug 28. This matches the claim of 1:0.\n\nNext, 2008 clausura. There are two rows for this season as well: Row 17 and Row 18.\n\nRow 17: home is Olimpia, scored 1:3 against Cerro Porte\u00f1o. Not a 1:0.\nRow 18: home is Cerro Porte\u00f1o, scored 1:0 against Olimpia on Aug 24. This matches the claim of 1:0.\n\nThen, 2008 apertura. There are two rows for this season: Row 19 and Row 20.\n\nRow 19: home is Olimpia, scored 1:2 against Cerro Porte\u00f1o. Not a 1:0.\nRow 20: home is Cerro Porte\u00f1o, scored 1:0 against Olimpia on Mar 22. This matches the claim of 1:0.\n\nLastly, 2006 clausura. There are two rows for this season: Row 25 and Row 26.\n\nRow 25: home is Cerro Porte\u00f1o, scored 1:0 against Olimpia on Oct 29. This matches.\nRow 26: home is Cerro Porte\u00f1o, scored 1:1 against Olimpia on Aug 20. Doesn't match; it's a draw.\n\nSo for each season:\n- 2009 Clausura: Only Row 14 matches (1:0).\n- 2008 Clausura: Only Row 18 matches (1:0).\n- 2008 Apertura: Only Row 20 matches (1:0).\n- 2006 Clausura: Only Row 25 matches (1:0).\n\nThe claim states that each of these seasons has a score of 1:0, which is true for three out of the four seasons mentioned. However, I need to check if all the specified seasons have at least one match with a 1:0 score or if it's about each having exactly that score.\n\nWait, re-reading the claim: \"each have score of 1:0.\" So does it mean each season has at least one game with that score? Or does it mean every game in those seasons is 1:0?\n\nIf it's the former, then since for each of these seasons, there exists at least one match where the score was 1:0 (e.g., Row 14 for 2009 Clausura, Row 18 for 2008 Clausura, etc.), the claim holds as true because each specified season has a game with that score.\n\nIf it's the latter, and it requires every game in those seasons to be 1:0, then since other rows have different scores (like 1:2 or draws), the claim would be false. However, based on the wording of the claim, it seems it's stating that each season has a score of 1:0, implying at least one such game.\n\nTherefore, considering this interpretation, the claim is TRUE because each specified season has at least one match where the home team scored 1:0 against Olimpia.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim states: \"the season with a score of 0:1 be 2006 clausura , 2008 apertura , and 2006 clausura.\" Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nIt says that there are two seasons where the score is 0:1\u20142006 Clausura and 2008 Apertura. But the third part repeats 2006 Clausura, which might be a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe the user intended to say that both 2006 Clausura and 2008 Apertura have a 0:1 score.\n\nSo, I need to check each row in the table to find any where the score is 0:1, and then see if their season and competition match the claim.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Season 2012 Clausura, home Cerro Porte\u00f1o, score 4:1. Not 0:1.\nRow 2: Season 2012 Clausura, home Olimpia, score 0:0. No.\nRow 3: 2012 Apertura, Olimpia 1:2 vs Cerro Porte\u00f1o. No.\nRow 4: 2012 Apertura, Cerro Porte\u00f1o 0:1 vs Olimpia. So score is 0:1, season Apertura, which doesn't match the claim of Clausura.\nWait, but the claim mentions 2006 and 2008, so I need to go down further.\n\nRow 5: 2011 Clausura, Cerro Porte\u00f1o 0:0 vs Olimpia. No.\nRow 6: 2011 Clausura, Olimpia 1:1 vs Cerro Porte\u00f1o. No.\nRow7: 2011 Apertura, Olimpia 0:2. No.\nRow8: 2011 Apertura, Cerro 1:2. No.\nRow9: 2010 Clausura, Cerro 1:1. No.\nRow10: 2010 Clausura, Olimpia 2:2. No.\nRow11: 2010 Apertura, Cerro 0:0. No.\nRow12: 2010 Apertura, Olimpia 3:2. No.\nRow13: 2009 Clausura, Olimpia 1:2. No.\nRow14: 2009 Clausura, Cerro 1:0. No.\nRow15: 2009 Apertura, Cerro 1:2. No.\nRow16: 2009 Apertura, Olimpia 2:0. No.\nRow17: 2008 Clausura, Olimpia 1:3. No.\nRow18: 2008 Clausura, Cerro 1:0. No.\nRow19: 2008 Apertura, Olimpia 1:2. No.\nRow20: 2008 Apertura, Cerro 1:0. No.\nRow21: 2007 Clausura, Cerro 3:1. No.\nRow22: 2007 Clausura, Olimpia 2:1. No.\nRow23: 2007 Apertura, Cerro 0:0. No.\nRow24: 2007 Apertura, Olimpia 0:1. Yes, score is 0:1, season Apertura. So that's one match but not Clausura.\nRow25: 2006 Clausura, Cerro 1:0. No.\nRow26: 2006 Clausura, Cerro 1:1. No.\n\nWait, I thought maybe Row24 is the only score of 0:1, which is in 2007 Apertura. But the claim says 2006 Clausura and 2008 Apertura. So neither of those have a 0:1 score in the table. The only one with 0:1 is Row24, 2007 Apertura.\n\nSo the claim mentions two seasons (2006 Clausura and 2008 Apertura) that should have a 0:1 score, but according to the table, neither of those exist. Instead, it's Row24 which is 2007 Apertura with 0:1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there are no entries in the table for 2006 Clausura and 2008 Apertura with a 0:1 score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that two seasons (2006 Clausura and 2008 Apertura) each have a 0:1 score. Upon reviewing the table, only Row24 (Season 2007 Apertura) has a 0:1 score, not matching either specified season in the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
