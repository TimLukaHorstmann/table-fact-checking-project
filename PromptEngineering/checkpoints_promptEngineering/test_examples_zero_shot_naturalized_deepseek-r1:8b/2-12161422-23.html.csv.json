    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"Kevin Murray be the only player who have a 3 year break in between.\" Hmm, I need to check each condition against the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see if Kevin Murray has any career spans that include a 3-year break. Let me go through each row where the player is Kevin Murray. Looking at the table, I see Row 10: rank: 9, games: 333, player: kevin murray, club: fitzroy, career span: 1955 - 1964 , 1967 - 1974.\n\nWait, so his career spans are from 1955 to 1964 and then from 1967 to 1974. The gap between 1964 and 1967 is 3 years. So that's a break of 3 years in between. Now, I need to check if any other players have such breaks.\n\nLooking at the rest of the table, let me scan through each player's career span for any gaps of three consecutive years or more. For example:\n\n- Michael Tuck (Row1): 1972-1991, continuous, no break.\n- Kevin Bartlett (Row2): 1965-1983, continuous.\n- Robert Harvey (Row3): 1988-2008, continuous.\n- Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden both have long careers but without breaks. Simon Madden is at Essendon from 1974-1992, which seems continuous.\n- Craig Bradley: Carlton 1986-2002, no break.\n- Brad Johnson: Footscray/Western Bulldogs 1994-2010, continuous.\n- Brent Harvey: North Melbourne/Kangaroos 1996-present, still active, so no break yet.\n- Andrew McLeod: Adelaide 1995-2010, continuous.\n- Adam Goodes: South Melbourne/Sydney Swans from 1999 to present, ongoing, no break.\n- Ian Nankervis: Geelong 1967-1983, continuous.\n- Simon Black: Brisbane Lions 1998-present, ongoing.\n- Tony Shaw: Collingwood 1977-1994, continuous.\n- David Neitz: Melbourne 1993-2008, continuous.\n- Matthew Pavlich: Fremantle 2001-present, ongoing.\n- Glen Jakovich: West Coast Eagles 1991-2004, continuous.\n- Kane Cornes: Port Adelaide 1997-present, ongoing.\n- Roger Merrett: Brisbane Bears 1988-1996, continuous.\n- Bert Hurrey: University 1908-1913, but that's over a century ago, so probably not relevant.\n- Gary Ablett and Jonathan Giles have shorter careers but no breaks mentioned.\n\nWait, looking back at Row10 for Kevin Murray, the break is from 1964 to 1967, which is exactly three years. Now, I need to check if any other players have such a break of three or more consecutive years in their career spans. \n\nLet me look at each player's career span:\n\n- Michael Tuck: No breaks.\n- Kevin Bartlett: No breaks.\n- Robert Harvey: No breaks.\n- Dustin Fletcher: No breaks.\n- Simon Madden: No breaks.\n- Craig Bradley: No breaks.\n- Brad Johnson: No breaks.\n- Brent Harvey: Ongoing.\n- Andrew McLeod: No breaks.\n- Adam Goodes: Ongoing.\n- Ian Nankervis: No breaks.\n- Simon Black: Ongoing.\n- Tony Shaw: No breaks.\n- David Neitz: No breaks.\n- Matthew Pavlich: Ongoing.\n- Glen Jakovich: No breaks.\n- Kane Cornes: Ongoing.\n- Roger Merrett: No breaks.\n- Bert Hurrey: Old data, not relevant.\n- Gary Ablett and Jonathan Giles: Not enough info for breaks.\n\nWait, is there any other player with a 3-year break? Let me check Row21: rank:20, games:61, player:gary ablett, club:gold coast, career span:2011 - present. No break here.\n\nLooking at Row10 again, Kevin Murray's break is 1964-1967, which is exactly three years (since from 1964 to 1966 would be two years off, but perhaps the break is between 1964 and 1967, making it a 3-year gap? Or maybe it's considered as 1965, 1966, 1967, so three years in between. Wait, if he played until 1964, then resumed in 1967, that would mean a break of two seasons: 1965 and 1966. So is that a 2-year break or 3? Because sometimes breaks are counted by the number of years not played.\n\nWait, career spans are usually from one year to another. If he plays up to 1964 and then starts again in 1967, the gap is 1965, 1966, which is two years off. So that's a two-year break, not three.\n\nHmm, so maybe Kevin Murray doesn't have a three-year break after all. That would mean the claim might be false because he only has a two-year break, not three. Alternatively, if it's considered as three years (including 1967), but I think generally breaks are counted by the number of years not played, which in this case is two.\n\nTherefore, Kevin Murray's break is two years, not three. So the claim that he is the only player with a three-year break would be incorrect because perhaps no one has such a break.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if any other players have a three-year break.\n\nLooking at Row10 again: 1955-1964 and then 1967-1974. The gap is two years (1965, 1966). So that's two years, not three.\n\nWhat about other players? Let me check:\n\nRow1: Michael Tuck: No breaks.\nRow2: Kevin Bartlett: No breaks.\nRow3: Robert Harvey: No breaks.\nRow4: Dustin Fletcher: No breaks.\nRow5: Simon Madden: No breaks.\nRow6: Craig Bradley: No breaks.\nRow7: Brad Johnson: No breaks.\nRow8: Brent Harvey: Ongoing, no break.\nRow9: Andrew McLeod: No breaks.\nRow10: Kevin Murray: Two-year break.\nRow11: Adam Goodes: Ongoing.\nRow12: Ian Nankervis: No breaks.\nRow13: Simon Black: Ongoing.\nRow14: Tony Shaw: No breaks.\nRow15: David Neitz: No breaks.\nRow16: Matthew Pavlich: Ongoing.\nRow17: Glen Jakovich: No breaks.\nRow18: Kane Cornes: Ongoing.\nRow19: Roger Merrett: No breaks.\nRow20: Bert Hurrey: Old data, not relevant.\nRow21: Gary Ablett: No break.\n\nSo, from this, no other player has a three-year break. Kevin Murray only has a two-year break. Therefore, the claim that he is the only one with a three-year break is incorrect because he doesn't have such a break. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Kevin Murray is the only player with a three-year break in his career is false. Upon reviewing the table, Kevin Murray's break was two years, not three. No other players have reported a three-year break.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"condition\": \"Kevin Murray be the only player who have a 3 year break in between.\",\n  \"result\": {\n    \"type\": \"false\",\n    \"details\": \"Kevin Murray has a two-year break in his career, not three years.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim states: \"Michael Tuck's career span be 3 years longer than Brad Johnson's.\" \n\nFirst, I'll locate Michael Tuck in the table. Looking at Row 1, it has rank 1, games 426, player Michael Tuck, club Hawthorn, and career span from 1972 to 1991. So his career span is from 1972 to 1991, which is 19 years (1991 - 1972 + 1 = 20? Wait, let me calculate correctly: 1991 minus 1972 is 19, so it's 19 years, but sometimes people count the starting year as part of the first season. Hmm, maybe I should just take the difference between the start and end years.\n\nNext, Brad Johnson is in Row 7. His career span starts in 1994 and goes to 2010. So from 1994 to 2010, that's 16 years (2010 - 1994 = 16). \n\nWait, let me double-check. Michael Tuck: start year 1972, end year 1991. The duration is 1991 minus 1972, which equals 19 years. Brad Johnson: 2010 minus 1994 equals 16 years.\n\nThe claim says that Michael's career span is 3 years longer than Brad's. So 19 vs 16: the difference is indeed 3 years (19 - 16 = 3). Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on their career spans.\n\nNow, I need to mark which cells are relevant. Michael Tuck is in Row 1, and his career span is given as 1972 - 1991. Brad Johnson is in Row 7, with a career span of 1994 - 2010. So the relevant columns for both players are their rank (probably not needed) and their career spans.\n\nTherefore, I'll include cells from Row 1 for Michael Tuck's career span and Row 7 for Brad Johnson's career span.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"career span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"career span\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Essendon be the club when Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden be the player.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Essendon is a club associated with both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden as players. So, I need to check the table to see if both of these players are linked to Essendon.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their rank, games played, their name, their club, career span, etc. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Michael Tuck, Hawthorn. Not relevant.\n- Row 2: Kevin Bartlett, Richmond. No.\n- Row 3: Robert Harvey, St Kilda. No.\n- Row 4: Dustin Fletcher, Essendon. Yes, he is at Essendon.\n- Row 5: Simon Madden, Essendon. Yes, another player for Essendon.\n- Row 6: Craig Bradley, Carlton. Not relevant.\n- And so on, the other rows don't mention Essendon again except for Rows 4 and 5.\n\nSo both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden are listed as players of Essendon. That would support the claim that Essendon is their club. \n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need to identify which rows have these two players. Looking at Row 4, Dustin Fletcher is rank 4 and in Essendon. So row_index is 3 (since it's zero-based), column_name is \"club\". Then for Row 5, Simon Madden is also in Essendon, so same row_index 4, but the same club name.\n\nWait, no, actually the rows are from 0 to 21. So Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc. Let me count:\n\nRow 1: index 0\nRow 2: index 1\n...\nRow 4 (Dustin Fletcher): index 3\nRow 5 (Simon Madden): index 4\n\nBut wait, in the table, Row 4 is Dustin Fletcher at Essendon, and Row 5 is Simon Madden also at Essendon. So their row indices are 3 and 4 respectively.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Dustin Fletcher: row_index=3, column_name=\"club\"\n\nFor Simon Madden: row_index=4, column_name=\"club\"\n\nBut wait, each of these rows have other columns like \"games\", \"player\", etc. But the claim mentions the club and the player. So for Dustin Fletcher, we need to check the club he is in, which is Essendon, so that's Row 3, column: club.\n\nSimilarly, Simon Madden is also in Essendon, so Row 4, same column.\n\nSo both of these cells are relevant because they show that Essendon is the club for both players mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Kevin Murray be 1 of the player who have a 3 year break in between.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate Kevin Murray in the table. Looking through each row, I see that Row 10 is about Kevin Murray. His details are rank: 9, games: 333, club: Fitzroy, career span: 1955 - 1964, then 1967 - 1974. \n\nNow, the claim mentions a \"3 year break in between.\" That makes me think that there's a gap of three years in Kevin Murray's career. Looking at his career span, it's listed as two periods: 1955-1964 and 1967-1974. Between these two periods, there's a gap from 1965 to 1966. The duration of this break is two years (from the end of 1964 to the start of 1967). \n\nA three-year break would imply that between two career periods, there's a three-year absence. However, in Kevin Murray's case, there's only a two-year gap. So, does this mean his career doesn't have a three-year break? \n\nI need to check if any other players in the table have a three-year break. For example, looking at Row 5, Dustin Fletcher has a career span from 1993 - present, so he is still playing. Simon Madden (Row 5) also plays for Essendon from 1974-1992. Wait, no, Row 5 shows two players with the same rank and games? Wait, no, looking again: Rank 4 includes both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden. So both have 378 games each. Dustin's career is from 1993 to present, so he's still active, meaning his break hasn't occurred yet. Simon Madden's career ended in 1992, so perhaps there's a three-year break after that? \n\nBut the claim specifically mentions Kevin Murray, not others. So even if others have breaks, the key point is whether Kevin Murray has a three-year break. Since he only has a two-year gap, his case doesn't support the claim.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the relevant information for both players in the table. Starting with Michael Tuck: looking at Row 1, his name is listed, and he has a games column value of 426. So Michael Tuck played 426 games in his career.\n\nNext, Kevin Bartlett is mentioned in Row 2, where it says he played 403 games. The claim states that Kevin Bartlett played 23 more games than Michael Tuck. To check this, I subtract Michael's games from Kevin's: 403 (Kevin) - 426 (Michael). Wait, that gives a negative number, which means Kevin actually played fewer games.\n\nHold on, the claim says \"23 more,\" so it implies that Kevin's total should be higher than Michael's by 23. But since Kevin has only 403 and Michael has 426, the difference is 403 - 426 = -23. This indicates that Michael played 23 more games than Kevin, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect. It looks like Michael Tuck actually played more games than Kevin Bartlett by 23, which contradicts the statement. So the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to compare the number of games each player played in their careers.\n\n1. **Michael Tuck**: Found in Row 1 with games: 426.\n2. **Kevin Bartlett**: Found in Row 2 with games: 403.\n\nThe difference is calculated as:\n- Kevin's games (403) - Michael's games (426) = -23.\n\nSince the result is negative, Michael played more than Kevin by 23 games, not the other way around.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So I need to calculate the length of each career span.\n\nMichael Tuck's career started in 1972 and ended in 1991. To find the duration, subtract the start year from the end year: 1991 - 1972 = 19 years.\n\nBrad Johnson played from 1994 to 2010. Calculating that: 2010 - 1994 = 16 years.\n\nNow, let's compare the two durations. Michael Tuck's career is 19 years, and Brad Johnson's is 16 years. The difference between them is 19 minus 16, which equals 3 years. So yes, Michael Tuck's career was indeed three years shorter than Brad Johnson's.\n\nLooking at the table again to make sure I'm not missing anything. Both players' careers are listed correctly with their respective ranks and other details. No discrepancies in the years provided. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by calculating the career spans of Michael Tuck and Brad Johnson. Michael's career was 19 years (1972-1991), while Brad's was 16 years (1994-2010), differing by exactly three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career span\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"career span\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"as of the September 2013 source, 8 players on the list be retired.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and see which ones have a career span that would make them retired by September 2013. The player's career span is given as years from their starting year to present or until they retired. \n\nLooking at Row 1: Michael Tuck played from 1972-1991. So, he retired in 1991. Since September 2013 is after that, he is definitely retired.\n\nRow 2: Kevin Bartlett from 1965-1983. Retired in 1983, so yes, by 2013, he's retired.\n\nRow 3: Robert Harvey played until 2008. That's after 2013, so he's still active.\n\nRow 4 and Row 5 both have Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden with career spans ending in 1992 or 1993. So both are retired by 2013.\n\nRow 6: Craig Bradley from 1986-2002. Retired in 2002, which is before 2013.\n\nRow 7: Brad Johnson until 2010, still active.\n\nRow 8: Brent Harvey's career is ongoing as of present. So he's not retired yet.\n\nRow 9: Andrew McLeod retired in 2010, so yes.\n\nRow 10: Kevin Murray played from 1955-1964 and again 1967-1974. His last retirement was in 1974, which is before 2013, so he's retired.\n\nRow 11: Adam Goodes is still playing as of present, so not retired.\n\nRow 12: Ian Nankervis retired in 1983, so yes.\n\nRow 13: Simon Black is still active.\n\nRow 14: Tony Shaw retired in 1994, so yes.\n\nRow 15: David Neitz until 2008, which is before 2013.\n\nRow 16: Matthew Pavlich playing now.\n\nRow 17: Glen Jakovich until 2004, so retired.\n\nRow 18: Kane Cornes still active.\n\nRow 19: Roger Merrett until 1996, retired.\n\nRow 20: Bert Hurrey last played in 1913, way before, so he's definitely retired.\n\nRow 21 and 22 are playing as of present.\n\nNow, counting the retirees:\n\nRows 1,2,4,5,6,9,10,12,14,17,19,20. Wait, that seems more than 8.\n\nWait, let me recount properly because I might have overcounted. Let's go step by step.\n\n1: Retired\n2: Retired\n3: Not\n4: Retired\n5: Retired\n6: Retired\n7: Not\n8: Not\n9: Retired\n10: Retired\n11: Not\n12: Retired\n13: Not\n14: Retired\n15: Retired\n16: Not\n17: Retired\n18: Not\n19: Retired\n20: Retired\n21: Not\n22: Not\n\nSo the retirees are rows 1,2,4,5,6,9,10,12,14,15,17,19,20.\n\nThat's 13 players retired as of 2013. But the claim says 8 players. So the claim is false because more than 8 have retired by that time.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n1. Michael Tuck - Retired\n2. Kevin Bartlett - Retired\n4. Dustin Fletcher - Retired\n5. Simon Madden - Retired\n6. Craig Bradley - Retired\n9. Andrew McLeod - Retired\n10. Kevin Murray - Retired\n12. Ian Nankervis - Retired\n14. Tony Shaw - Retired\n15. David Neitz - Retired\n17. Glen Jakovich - Retired\n19. Roger Merrett - Retired\n20. Bert Hurrey - Retired\n\nThat's 13 players retired by September 2013, not 8.
