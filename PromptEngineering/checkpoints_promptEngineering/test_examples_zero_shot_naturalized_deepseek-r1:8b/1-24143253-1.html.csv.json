Scanning through the rows, I find her at row index 9. Her entry says she died on February 17, 1990, from breast cancer. That's not 2003, so she doesn't fit the claim.\n\nNext up is Judy Garland, found at row index 8. Her death date is March 27, 1966, due to a ruptured appendix and encephalomyelitis. She definitely didn't die in 2003.\n\nNow, Walter Matthau is next. He's at row index 35. His cause of death was listed as natural causes on August 23, 1993.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"Charles Aden Black died on August 4, 2005 (aged 86), 10 years older than Arthur Sheekman who died at 76.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the table provided to find the relevant information about both Charles Aden Black and Arthur Sheekman. Let me look through each row carefully.\n\nStarting with Charles Aden Black, I see he's mentioned in Row 38. His cause of death is bone marrow disease on August 4, 2005, and he was 86 years old at that time. So his age at death is 86. \n\nNext, looking for Arthur Sheekman, I go through each row until I find him. He's in Row 37, where it says he died from Alzheimer's disease on January 12, 1978, aged 76. Wait, but the claim says Arthur Sheekman died at 76, which matches this information. \n\nNow, the age difference. Charles Aden Black was born in 1919 (since he was 86 in 2005) and Arthur Sheekman was born in 1902 (died in 1978 at 76, so 1902 + 76 = 1978). The difference between their birth years is 17 years. But the claim says Charles was 10 years older, which doesn't add up because 86 - 76 is 10 years of age difference, but when considering birth years, it's actually 17 years.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If Charles died at 86 and Arthur at 76, their ages differ by 10 years. But the claim says he's 10 years older than Arthur Sheekman who died at 76. So the age difference is correct\u201410 years. However, their birth years are 17 apart because Arthur was born in 1902 and Charles in 1919.\n\nBut wait, the claim doesn't specify the year Arthur died relative to Charles's death, only that Charles was 10 years older when he died. Since both dates are in 2005, but Arthur died earlier in 1978, which is 27 years before Charles. So maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nThe key point is whether Charles was indeed 10 years older than Arthur at the time of his death. According to the table, Charles was 86 when he died, and Arthur was 76 when he died, so yes, that's a 10-year age difference. Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"age\"}, {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"age\"}]}",

The claim says that John Wayne and Gilda Radner both died of cancer, specifically stomach cancer for John and ovarian cancer for Gilda.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row to find their entries. Let me start by identifying which rows correspond to John Wayne and Gilda Radner.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that Pilar Wayne is listed as the spouse of John Wayne in Row 41. So, John Wayne must be the deceased spouse in that row. Then, Gene Wilder's spouse is Gilda Radner, so she would be in Row 42.\n\nNow, let me check the cause of death for each. For John Wayne (Row 41), the cause of death is stomach cancer. That matches part of the claim. But what about Gilda Radner? She's Gene Wilder's spouse, and her cause of death is ovarian cancer. That also aligns with the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up rows. Sometimes, it can be confusing since there are a lot of names. So, Row 41 is Pilar Wayne, spouse of John Wayne, who died of stomach cancer.

First, I'll look at the table provided to find the rows related to Mona Graham and Karl Malden.\n\nI start by scanning through each row's \"Deceased Spouse\" column to see if either Mona or Karl is listed there. Upon checking, I find that Row 0 mentions John Wayne as the deceased spouse of Pilar Wayne, which doesn't relate directly. Continuing, Row 1 refers to Gilda Radner's spouse, Gene Wilder.

Not the right pair.\n\nI continue until I find a row where either Mona or Karl is listed as the deceased spouse. Upon reviewing all rows, none of them mention Mona Graham or Karl Malden in the \"Deceased Spouse\" column. This suggests that the longest marriage isn't attributed to them based on this data.\n\nNext, I check for any other relevant columns.

Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the table, I see Jill Ireland isn't listed. So that's a red flag because if she's not there, we can't confirm anything about her death date.\n\nNext, Judy Garland.

First, I need to verify each part of this statement using the provided table.\n\nStarting with Arthur Sheekman, I'll look for his row in the table. Scanning through the list, I find him at Row 37. His cause of death is listed as Alzheimer's disease, and he died on January 12, 1978, at the age of 76. That's one part.\n\nNow, checking Charles Aden Black, I'll search for his row. He's at Row 38. His cause of death is bone marrow disease, and he passed away on August 4, 2005, which matches the claim's date. The age given for him is 86, as he was 86 when he died.\n\nNext, I need to confirm both ages are mentioned in their respective rows. For Arthur Sheekman, Row 37 states he was 76. For Charles Aden Black, Row 38 mentions he was 86. Since the claim states they both died at the same age on August 4, 2005, it's important to check if their ages match when considering that information.\n\nHowever, looking closely, Arthur Sheekman's death is in 1978, and Charles Aden Black's is in 2005. They can't both be 76 in 2005 unless there's a mistake. Wait, but the claim specifically mentions August 4, 2005 as their shared death date. So perhaps it's referring to the fact that they both died on that date, regardless of age? Or maybe the claim is that they were both the same age when they died.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the claim: \"Arthur Sheekman and Charles Aden Black both die at the same age on August 4, 2005.\" So it's about their ages being the same when they passed away. From the table, Arthur was 76 in 1978, and Charles was 86 in 2005. These are different ages, so the claim might be false.\n\nHowever, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the claim is that both died on August 4, 2005, regardless of their age. The ages would then differ, but they died on the same date. Let me check the table again. Charles Aden Black died on August 4, 2005, at age 86. Arthur Sheekman died earlier in 1978. So the claim might be incorrect because they didn't die at the same time; their ages are different.\n\nWait, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the row indices or data? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 37: Arthur Sheekman died on Jan 12, 1978, age 76.\n- Row 38: Charles Aden Black died on Aug 4, 2005, age 86.\n\nSo both dates are correct, but ages differ. Therefore, the claim that they both die at the same age is false because their ages were different when they passed away.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's not about their ages being the same numerically, but something else? Alternatively, perhaps the user meant that they both died on August 4, regardless of age, which would make part of the claim true for Charles and false for Arthur, as he didn't die on that date.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me re-examine the instructions: I need to check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim has two parts: both died at the same age and on August 4, 2005.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Arthur Sheekman's death date is Jan 12, 1978.\n- Charles Aden Black's death date is Aug 4, 2005.\n\nSo the dates are different. Therefore, they didn't die on the same day, making part of the claim false.\n\nAs for their ages: Arthur was 76 when he died in 1978, and Charles was 86 in 2005. So they were of different ages when they passed away.\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are false because they didn't die on the same date (August 4, 2005), nor did they die at the same age (76 vs. 86).\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the death dates. Let me check again:\n\n- Row 37: Arthur Sheekman died on Jan 12, 1978.\n- Row 38: Charles Aden Black died on Aug 4, 2005.\n\nYes, different dates.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because they didn't die on the same date and at the same age. Their ages were also different.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" since both conditions in the claim are incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Arthur Sheekman and Charles Aden Black both died at the same age on August 4, 2005, is false. \n\n1. **Arthur Sheekman**: Died on January 12, 1978, at the age of 76.\n2. **Charles Aden Black**: Died on August 4, 2005, at the age of 86.\n\nBoth individuals did not die on the same date or at the same age.
