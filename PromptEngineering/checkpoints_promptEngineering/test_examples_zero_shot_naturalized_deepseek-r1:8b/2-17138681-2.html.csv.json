    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"there be more than 12.42 million viewer for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table provided. Let me break down the claim:\n\n1. **More than 12.42 million viewers**: This refers to the \"viewers (millions)\" column in the table.\n2. **For the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8**: This is looking for a row where the \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" column equals 3.2 divided by 8.\n\nSo, I need to find in the table which rows have \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" as exactly 3.2/8 and then check if their \"viewers (millions)\" is more than 12.42.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: 2.6/7 \u2013 too low.\n- **Row 2**: 2.6/6 \u2013 too low.\n- **Row 3**: 3.0/8 \u2013 close but not exactly 3.2/8.\n- **Row 4**: 3.1/8 \u2013 slightly higher than 3.2/8? Wait, 3.1 divided by 8 is 0.3875, and 3.2/8 is 0.4. So, no, it's not equal. Maybe the claim meant exactly 3.2/8.\n- **Row 5**: Same as Row 4, 3.1/8 \u2013 nope.\n- **Row 6**: 3.2/8 \u2013 yes! That matches the rating/share in the claim.\n- **Row 7**: 3.8/10 \u2013 higher but not equal to 3.2/8.\n- **Rows 8-12**: Most have 'n/a' or other values that don't match.\n\nSo, Row 6 has \"rating / share (18 - 49)\" as exactly 3.2/8. Now, let's check the viewers for this row: 12.42 million.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 12.42 million.\" However, in the table, Row 6's viewers are exactly 12.42 million. It doesn't say more than, so does that count? Or is it equal to?\n\nWait, the exact wording of the claim is \"more than 12.42 million.\" So if the viewers are exactly 12.42, then it's not more than, just equal. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. Let me look again at Row 6:\n\n- rating:7.2\n- share:11\n- rating / share:3.2/8=0.4\n- viewers:12.42 million\n- rank:15\n\nYes, exactly 12.42 million. So the claim says more than that, which isn't true because it's equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended \"equal to\" but wrote \"more than.\" Either way, based on the exact wording, it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are more than 12.42 million viewers for an entry with a rating/share of 3.2/8. In the table, Row 6 has exactly 12.42 million viewers and a rating/share of 3.2/8. Since 12.42 is not more than itself, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
