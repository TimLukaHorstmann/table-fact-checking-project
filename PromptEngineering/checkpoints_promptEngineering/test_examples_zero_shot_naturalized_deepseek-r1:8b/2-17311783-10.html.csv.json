    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"washington have a record of 41 - 36 and play at the verizon center 20173 people in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Record of 41 - 36.\n2. Playing at Verizon Center with 20,173 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game for different teams on specific dates. I need to find rows related to the Washington team and check both aspects mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting with the record: I'll search through the rows for any entry where the team is Washington. From the table, Row 3 has the team as Washington. In that row, under \"record,\" it's listed as 41 - 36. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, checking the location and attendance: The same row (Row 3) mentions the location as Verizon Center with 20,173 attendees. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by data in Row 3, the entire statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table's Row 3, which confirms Washington's record and attendance details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Charlotte improve to 40 - 36 with a win of 97 - 92 in OT.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. The key points here are:\n\n1. Charlotte improved their record to 40-36.\n2. They won the game with a score of 97-92 in overtime.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game played by various teams on specific dates. I need to check if any row matches both aspects of the claim: Charlotte as the team and a win against someone with that specific score.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: April 1, Dallas, score L96-98 (OT). This is a loss for Dallas, so not relevant for Charlotte's improvement.\nRow 2: April 3, Charlotte. The score is W97-92 (OT). That matches the game outcome mentioned in the claim. Let me check the record here. Before this game, what was Charlotte's record? Looking at row 1 and 2: before row 2, their record was probably 39-36 because row 2 shows a win making it 40-36. So yes, after this game, Charlotte's record would be 40-36.\n\nRow 3 onwards don't pertain to Charlotte, so they can be ignored for this check.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in Row 2: specifically the 'team', 'score', and 'record' columns.\n\nWait, but I think the 'record' column is updated after each game, right? So before row 2, Charlotte was at 39-36. After their win, it's 40-36. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant row for Charlotte's game with a specific score and record improvement.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"verizon center 20173 for the location and attendance when the record be 49 - 36%.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two specific columns: \"location\" and \"attendance.\" It also refers to a \"record\" being 49-36%. From the table, which has rows with game numbers from 1 to 8, each row includes details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and overall record.\n\nI need to look for a row that matches all parts of the claim. The location specified is \"verizon center\" with an attendance number of 20173. Additionally, the record should be 49-36%.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Location is American Airlines Center, attendance 20021, record 39-36.\n- Row 2: Time Warner Cable Arena, attendance 19568, record 40-36.\n- Row 3: Verizon Center, attendance 20173, record 41-36.\n- Row 4: American Airlines Arena, attendance 19600, record 41-37.\n- Row 5: TD Banknorth Garden, attendance 18624, record 41-38.\n- Row 6: American Airlines Arena, attendance 19600, record 42-38.\n- Row 7: Philips Arena, attendance not specified, record 42-39.\n- Row 8: American Airlines Arena, attendance same as row 4, record 43-39.\n\nI'm looking for a game where the location is Verizon Center with attendance 20173 and a record of 49-36. From the table, only Row 3 has Verizon Center and attendance 20173, but its record is 41-36. None of the rows have a record of 49-36. The highest record in the table is 43-39.\n\nSo the claim's assertion about the record being 49-36 doesn't match any row in the table. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to check if there's a game at Verizon Center with attendance 20173 and a record of 49-36%. From the table:\n\n- **Row 3**: Location is Verizon Center (attendance 20173), but the record is 41-36.\n\nNo row matches both the location, attendance, and record specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim is: \"when michael beade be the highest scorer , the score be w 97 - 92 (ot).\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions two things: Michael Beade being the highest scorer and the game resulting in a score of W 97-92 (OT). I need to check if there's any row in the table where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Game 75, April 1. The high points are Dwyane Wade with 23. Michael Beade isn't listed here.\n\nRow 2: Game 76, April 3. High points are Dwyane Wade with 27. Michael Beade isn't mentioned.\n\nRow 3: Game 77, April 4. High points are Dwyane Wade with 33. No mention of Michael Beade.\n\nRow 4: Game 78, April 7. High points are Dwyane Wade with 32. No Michael Beade here either.\n\nRow 5: Game 79, April 10. High rebounds go to Michael Beasley (13), but high points are still Wade with 31. So, no, Michael Beade isn't the highest scorer.\n\nRow 6: Game 80, April 12. High points are Dwyane Wade with 55. Michael Beade is listed for rebounds and assists, but not as the highest scorer.\n\nRow 7: Game 81, April 14. High points are Michael Beasley with 23. So here, Michael Beade (I think it's a typo; likely Michael Beasley) is the highest scorer, and the score is L 79-81 (OT). That doesn't match the required W 97-92.\n\nRow 8: Game 82, April 15. High points are Chris Quinn with 26. No mention of Michael Beade.\n\nSo, in none of the rows does Michael Beade have the highest scorer title and result in a score of W 97-92 (OT). Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
