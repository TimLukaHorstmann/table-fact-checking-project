    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the show \"Remember Me\" having 20 episodes in its series is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let me read through the claim again: \"the show, remember me, have 20 episode in it's series.\" So, the claim is stating that the show \"Remember Me\" has exactly 20 episodes in its series. My task is to check each relevant cell in the table to verify this.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists various details for each episode of a series. Each row represents an individual episode with information like the no in series number, title, director, writer, original air date, production code, and US viewers count.\n\nI need to find which rows are relevant to verifying whether \"Remember Me\" has 20 episodes. So, I should look for the row where the title is \"remember me.\" Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Title is \"we don't need another hero\"\nRow 2: Title is \"living proof\"\n...\nContinuing until Row 10: The title here is \"remember me.\" That's the one we're interested in.\n\nLooking at Row 10, the details include:\n- no in series: 20\n- no in season: 10 (which might refer to the season number)\n- title: remember me\n\nSo, according to this row, the show \"Remember Me\" is the 20th episode in its series. Therefore, it seems like the claim is correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are more episodes beyond Row 10. Let's see:\n\nRow 11 onwards: The titles don't include \"remember me,\" so those are for other shows. Thus, only Row 10 corresponds to \"Remember Me.\"\n\nThe relevant column here is \"no in series\" because that indicates the episode number within the series. So, the row index is 10 (since it's zero-indexed) and the column name is \"no in series.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim about the original air date for an episode called \"Go Daddy Go\" directed by Fred Toye is September 5, 2011. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. Each row represents a different episode with various details like title, director, writer, original air date, etc. The claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the episode title \"Go Daddy Go\" and the director Fred Toye.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see if any match these criteria. The table has 13 rows, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Title is \"we don't need another hero.\" No match.\nRow 2: Title is \"living proof.\" Not a match.\nRow 3: Title is \"sailor man.\" Nope.\nRow 4: Title is \"brown eyed girl.\" Still no.\nRow 5: \"don't hate the player.\" Not it.\nRow 6: \"rebel without a pause.\" No.\nRow 7: \"bloodlines.\" Doesn't match.\nRow 8: \"my own worst enemy.\" No.\nRow 9: Title is \"gone daddy gone.\" Wait, that's close. It has \"daddy\" in the title, but the claim says \"Go Daddy Go.\" Maybe it's a different episode.\n\nLooking at Row 9 more carefully, the title is \"gone daddy gone,\" directed by Fred Toye. The original air date is September 5, 2011, which matches part of the claim. However, the episode titles don't exactly match\u2014\"gone daddy gone\" vs. \"Go Daddy Go.\" So there might be a slight difference in the title.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"gone daddy gone\" and \"Go Daddy Go\" are alternative titles or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, they could be different episodes with similar themes. Since Row 9 matches the director and air date but not the exact title, I need to check if there's another row that fits better.\n\nContinuing down:\n\nRow 10: Title is \"remember me.\" Not matching.\nRow 11: \"can i get a witness.\" No.\nRow 12: \"he ain't heavy, he's my brother.\" Doesn't fit.\nRow 13: \"seventeen ain't so sweet.\" Nope.\n\nSo only Row 9 has the director Fred Toye and the air date September 5, 2011. The title doesn't exactly match \"Go Daddy Go,\" but it's close. I'm not sure if \"gone daddy gone\" is an alternate name for \"Go Daddy Go\" or a different episode entirely.\n\nThe claim specifies both the original air date and the director correctly, so even though the exact title might be slightly different, the other parts of the claim are accurate. Therefore, the claim as a whole seems to be correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Of all of the series that list the lowest number of episodes in a single series be 11.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about \"series\" and \"lowest number of episodes in a single series.\" Looking at the table, each row seems to represent an episode with details like title, director, writer, air date, production code, and US viewers. So, each row is an individual episode.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"series\" and \"episodes.\" Maybe I'm mixing terms here. Let me check the table again. The first column says \"no in series: 11,\" which probably refers to the number of episodes in that particular series. For example, row 1 has \"no in series: 11,\" so does that mean the series number is 11? Or maybe it's indicating something else.\n\nWait, looking closer, each row starts with \"no in series: X.\" So for row 1, it's 11; row 2 is 12, and so on up to 23. So these numbers are probably the series number or maybe the episode count per series. The claim says, \"Of all of the series that list the lowest number of episodes in a single series be 11.\" So we're looking for series where their minimum number of episodes is 11.\n\nBut wait, each row seems to represent an individual episode with its own details. So perhaps the first column indicates something else, like maybe the production number or some identifier. Let me see: \"no in series\" might refer to the production number or perhaps the order in the season. Hmm, but the claim is about the lowest number of episodes per series.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each row is an episode, and \"no in series\" is a unique identifier for each episode. So if we group all episodes by their series, which might be determined by other columns, we can see the minimum number of episodes in each series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"series\" here refers to season numbers. For example, row 1 has no in series:11, and it's in season 1, so perhaps that means season 1, episode 11? But then the claim is about the lowest number of episodes per series being 11.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The claim says that among all series with the lowest number of episodes, they should be 11. So we need to find for each series (maybe determined by \"no in series\" or another column) what is the minimum number of episodes and check if it's 11.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column has numbers from 11 to 22. Maybe those are unique identifiers for each episode across all series. So each row is an individual episode with its own identifier. Then \"no in series\" could be a series number or perhaps the production code.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how \"series\" and \"no in series\" relate here. Alternatively, maybe \"no in series: X\" refers to the episode count in that particular series. So if a series has multiple episodes, each with their own \"no in series\" number, but the claim is about which series has the lowest episode count being 11.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the minimum number of episodes per series. Each series would have multiple episodes, and we need to find the series that has the fewest episodes, specifically if that minimum is 11.\n\nBut how do I determine which series corresponds to which group? The first column seems to be incrementing from 11 to 22, so maybe each \"no in series\" number corresponds to a unique episode. So each series would have multiple \"no in series\" numbers assigned, and we need to see if any series has only one episode (since the claim is about the lowest number being 11).\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row seems to be an individual episode with its own \"no in series\" identifier. So perhaps a \"series\" is determined by other columns or maybe by the \"no in series\" number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"no in series: X\" refers to the production order within the series, like season 1, episode 11, and so on. If that's the case, then each row could be part of a series, and we need to group them by their series.\n\nBut without more information about how the series are defined, it's hard to tell. Maybe I should look at the \"no in series\" column for each episode and see if any of those correspond to series that have only 11 episodes as their minimum.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: For each unique value in the \"no in series\" column, count how many times it appears across all rows. The claim is about the series (maybe determined by this \"no in series\") having a low number of episodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first column is the episode number within the series. So for example, if \"no in series: 11\" refers to the 11th episode of that particular series, and then each row is part of a larger series.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. The claim says that the lowest number of episodes per series is 11. So we need to find if there's any series where the minimum number of episodes is exactly 11.\n\nIn other words, for each series (determined by some criteria), what is the smallest number of episodes it has? If for at least one series this minimum is 11, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking back at the table, I don't see any indication of how the series are grouped. So maybe \"no in series\" refers to something else, like the production order within a season. For example, if each row represents an episode, and \"no in series: X\" is the production number for that season.\n\nBut without knowing how seasons or series are structured, it's challenging. Alternatively, perhaps \"no in series\" is just a unique identifier for each episode, not tied to the series count.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the claim again: \"Of all of the series that list the lowest number of episodes in a single series be 11.\" So it's saying among all series, the ones with the least number of episodes (the minimum) are 11. So we need to check if any series has its minimum episode count as 11.\n\nBut how do I determine which series have the minimum of 11? Each row is an episode, so perhaps each \"no in series\" identifier corresponds to a unique episode, but not necessarily tied to a single series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each \"no in series: X\" refers to a particular episode's number within its series. So if all episodes with \"no in series: 11\" are the only ones in their respective series, then that would mean those series have exactly one episode (since 11 is their identifier).\n\nWait, but in that case, if a series has multiple episodes, each would have different \"no in series\" numbers. So for example, a series with two episodes would have \"no in series: 12\" and \"no in series: 13,\" or something like that.\n\nBut the claim is about the lowest number of episodes per series being 11. If a series has only one episode, then its minimum (and only) episode count is 1, not 11.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to look for any series that only has one episode, which would mean their lowest (and only) episode count is 1. So the claim says that the lowest number of episodes per series is 11, but if any series exists with a lower minimum than 11, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to be an individual episode, so each \"no in series\" identifier could correspond to one episode. Therefore, perhaps all series have only one episode, making their minimum (and only) episode count 1. If that's the case, then the claim that the lowest number is 11 would be FALSE because the actual minimum across all series is 1.\n\nAlternatively, if some series have multiple episodes and others have just one, then the lowest minimum across all series would still be 1, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe \"no in series\" refers to something else. If it's an identifier per season or per episode within a larger structure, perhaps the minimum number of episodes per series is being considered differently.\n\nI think I'm not getting anywhere with this line of thought. Let me try another approach: perhaps the claim is saying that the lowest (minimum) number of episodes any single series has is 11. So we need to check if there's a series where all its episodes have \"no in series\" numbers starting from 11 and going upwards, meaning each series with \"no in series\" >=11 has at least 1 episode.\n\nBut without knowing how the series are structured or what criteria define them, it's impossible to know for sure. Therefore, I might need to make an assumption that each \"no in series\" identifier corresponds to a unique series with only one episode, making the minimum episode count 1. Thus, the claim would be incorrect, and the answer is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"no in series\" refers to something else, like the number of episodes produced so far in that series, but again, without more information, it's unclear.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps I should conclude that the statement is not accurate because each row represents a single episode, and thus each series (as determined by \"no in series\") has only one episode, making their minimum 1, not 11.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that among all series, the lowest number of episodes per series is 11. However, based on the information provided, each \"no in series\" identifier likely corresponds to a single episode within its respective series. This implies that every series has only one episode, making their minimum (and only) count 1. Therefore, the claim that the lowest number of episodes per series is 11 is incorrect; it should be 1.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because each \"no in series\" identifier corresponds to a single episode, resulting in every series having a minimum (and only) episode count of 1.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the number of episodes in series air on august 1, 2011 written by dee johnson have the lowest number of episode.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is asking. It wants to know if among all the episodes that aired on August 1, 2011 and were written by Dee Johnson, this group has the smallest number of episodes compared to others in their respective series.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like title, director, writer, original air date, production number, and US viewers. The claim is specifically about August 1, 2011, so I should focus on rows where the original air date is that date.\n\nFrom the table, let's identify which episodes aired on August 1, 2011. Scanning through the \"original air date\" column:\n\n- Row 4: august 1 , 2011\n\nSo only Row 4 matches the air date in question.\n\nNow, within this row, who wrote it? The writer is listed as julie h\u00e3bert for Row 4. But the claim mentions Dee Johnson as the writer. Since Row 4 was written by julie h\u00e3bert, not Dee Johnson, there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. In Row 4, the writer is \"julie h\u00e3bert\". Is that possibly \"Dee Johnson\"? Maybe I misread it. Let me see: the name is written as julie followed by a special character and then hbart. Hmm, that doesn't look like \"Johnson\" to me. So no, Row 4 wasn't written by Dee Johnson.\n\nNow, since only one episode aired on August 1, 2011, and it's not written by Dee Johnson, maybe the claim is trying to compare this group (which in this case has zero episodes) with others. But if there are no episodes by Dee Johnson on that date, then their count is zero.\n\nBut the claim says \"have the lowest number of episode.\" If all other groups have higher counts, even one, then having zero would be lower than any positive number. However, in this case, since only one episode aired on August 1, and it wasn't written by Dee Johnson, maybe there's no competition, but perhaps the claim is suggesting that among all episodes written by Dee Johnson across dates, August 1 had the least.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider all episodes in the series, not just those on August 1. Let me see which episodes are written by Dee Johnson and when they aired.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 2: Writer is dee johnson. Air date: July 18, 2011.\nRow 7: Writer is elizabeth benjamin & dee johnson. Air date: August 22, 2011.\nRow 8: Writer is joel fields & emilia serrano. Not Dee Johnson.\nRow 12: Writer is david gould & dee johnson. Air date: December 5, 2011.\n\nSo, episodes written by Dee Johnson are in rows 2,7, and 12, aired on July 18, August 22, and December 5 respectively.\n\nThe claim is about the number of episodes in series air on august 1, 2011 written by Dee Johnson. So only Row 4 was on August 1, but it wasn't written by her.\n\nTherefore, in terms of August 1, there were zero episodes written by Dee Johnson, and the next closest dates have one episode each (July 18 has one, August 22 has one, December 5 also one). So August 1 had zero, which is lower than one. But wait, maybe we need to see if any other dates have more.\n\nLooking at all episodes written by Dee Johnson: there are three in total. August 1 has none, but July and December each have one. So the lowest number of episodes written by Dee Johnson on a single date would be zero.\n\nBut the claim says that the number on August 1 is the lowest among their series. Since only one episode per other dates, August 1 having zero is indeed lower than the others. However, if all other dates have at least one episode, then yes, August 1 has the lowest with zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is implying that August 1's count is lower compared to other episodes in their series, not across all dates. That might complicate it further, but I think the correct interpretation is that among all episodes written by Dee Johnson, August 1 had the fewest (zero), which is lower than any other date (which each have one).\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim would be TRUE because August 1, 2011, had zero episodes written by Dee Johnson, which is indeed the lowest count compared to other dates where she wrote one episode.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Writer\"}]}",

The claim says: \"the series remember me directed by andy wolk and air on august 29, 2011 have episode number 20.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts. It mentions three main things:\n1. The series is \"remember me.\"\n2. The director's name is andy wolk.\n3. The original air date is august 29, 2011.\n4. The episode number is 20.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row corresponds to an episode with various attributes like title, director, writers, air date, production number, and US viewers. \n\nStarting with the series title: \"remember me\" appears in Row 10. The title cell in Row 10 is \"remember me,\" so that matches.\n\nNext, the director's name is andy wolk. Scanning through the directors column, I see that Row 11 has andy wolk as the director for the episode titled \"can i get a witness.\" So that also matches.\n\nThe original air date is august 29, 2011. Looking at Row 8, the original air date is august 29, 2011 for the episode \"my own worst enemy.\" Wait, but the claim says \"remember me\" aired on that date. Hmm, there's a conflict here because \"remember me\" is in Row 10 and aired on september 12, 2011. So if the air date in the claim is august 29, that would be incorrect for \"remember me.\" Instead, the episode with director andy wolk is in Row 11, which aired on november 28, 2011.\n\nWait, no, the claim mentions august 29, 2011 as the air date. Looking back at the table, Row 8: my own worst enemy, directed by terrence o'hara, aired on august 29, 2011. So that doesn't match \"remember me.\" Therefore, there's a discrepancy here\u2014either the claim is misattributing the air date or the episode.\n\nAlso, the episode number in the claim is 20. Checking Row 10: no in series: 20, which matches the episode number. So if I'm looking for \"remember me,\" it should be episode 20.\n\nPutting this together: The claim states that \"remember me\" directed by andy wolk aired on august 29, 2011, and is episode 20. But from the table, \"remember me\" is in Row 10, which is no in series: 20, but it's directed by randy zisk, not andy wolk. The director andy wolk is in Row 11 for a different episode.\n\nSo the claim has two issues:\n1. The director is incorrect (andy wolk vs. randy zisk).\n2. The air date is incorrect (august 29 vs. september 12).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because both the director and the air date provided don't match the correct data for \"remember me.\" \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I misread something. Let's check Row 11: no in series:21, title: can i get a witness, directed by andy wolk, written by janet tamaro & elizabeth benjamin, original air date: november 28, 2011, production:2 m5611, us viewers:4.78.\n\nSo the episode with director andy wolk is episode 21, not 20, and it aired on november 28. Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes both the episode number and the air date to \"remember me.\"\n\nSo yes, the claim is definitely FALSE because none of the details match correctly for \"remember me.\" The correct details for \"remember me\" are in Row 10: no in series:20, directed by randy zisk, aired on september 12, 2011.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to check would be the row for \"remember me,\" which is Row 10, and the columns for director (to confirm it's not andy wolk) and air date (to confirm it's not august 29). Also, the episode number column to ensure it's 20.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"director\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"original_air_date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"no_in_series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
