    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a football match is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"On March 13, 1990, be play against Dundee and result in 3 - 1.\" So, the key points here are the date, the opponent, and the scoreline.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. Each row has several columns: date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, scorers. I need to check each of these elements against the claim.\n\nStarting with the date. The claim says March 13, 1990. Let's look through the table rows. Row 4 is date: 13 march 1990. That matches the date in the claim, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, the opponent. The claim mentions playing against Dundee. Looking at row 4, the opponent is indeed Dundee. So that's another match.\n\nNow, the result. The claim states a 3-1 result. In row 4, the result column shows \"3 - 1.\" That matches exactly as well.\n\nI should also consider other possible rows to ensure there isn't another match on March 13, 1990 against Dundee with a different score. Looking through all the rows:\n\n- Row 1: January 26\n- Row 2: January 29\n- Row 3: February 23\n- Row 4: March 13 (Dundee, 3-1)\n- Rows 5 and 6 are in April and May 1991, so after March.\n\nSo there's only one match on March 13 against Dundee with a 3-1 result. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about a football match is true or false based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see which ones have Dundee as the opponent and what their results were.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is East Fife, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Opponent is East Fife again, no match here.\nRow 3: Opponent is Airdrieonians, moving on.\nRow 4: Opponent is Dundee against whom? Wait, the venue is h (home), result is 3-1. But does this mean Dundee is the opponent or the home team? The table shows each row as date, opponent, venue, etc. So in Row 4, the home team scored 3 goals against Dundee, making the result 3-1.\nRow 5: Opponent is St Johnstone, so no.\nRow 6: Opponent is Motherwell.\n\nWait, in Row 4, it says \"opponent: dundee\". So Dundee is the opponent. The home team (probably the team playing at venue h) scored 3 goals against Dundee, resulting in a 3-1 win. But the claim is about a result of 3-4 when Dundee is the opponent.\n\nI need to check if any row has Dundee as the opponent and ends with a 3-4 scoreline. Looking through all rows, only Row 4 has Dundee as the opponent, but it resulted in 3-1. There's no row where the result is 3-4 against Dundee.\n\nSo the claim is false because there's no match where Dundee was the opponent and the result was 3-4.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\", I examined each row in the table for matches involving Dundee. Only Row 4 shows Dundee as the opponent, with a result of 3-1, not 3-4. Since no such match exists, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
