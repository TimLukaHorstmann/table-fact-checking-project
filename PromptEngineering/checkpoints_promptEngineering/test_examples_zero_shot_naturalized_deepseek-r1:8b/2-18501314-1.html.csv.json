    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false. The claim is: \"mark lillis have the most total goal of anyone in the season.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and find the relevant information related to Mark Lillis.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see that Mark Lillis is in row 12. Let me check what his data says. His position is mf, which stands for midfielder. The columns that matter here are \"total goals.\" \n\nIn row 12, under total goals, it says 20. So Mark Lillis has a total of 20 goals.\n\nNow, I need to compare this number with all other players in the table to see if anyone else has more than 20 goals. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Terry Austin, total goals 0.\nRow 2: Malcolm Brown, total goals 11.\nRow 3: David Burke, total goals 1.\nRow 4: David Cowling, total goals 8.\nRow 5: Brian Cox, total goals 0.\nRow 6: Maurice Cox, total goals 1.\nRow 7: Steve Doyle, total goals 2.\nRow 8: Roy Greenwood, total goals 0.\nRow 9: Keith Hanvey, total goals 4.\nRow 10: Timothy Hotte, total goals 0.\nRow 11: Mick Laverick, total goals 0.\nRow 12: Mark Lillis, total goals 20.\nRow 13: Keith Mason, total goals 0.\nRow 14: Daral Pugh, total goals 2. Wait, the numbers here are a bit confusing. The total apps for row 14 is written as 9 (19), which probably means 19 appearances. But the total goals are 2, so that's lower than Mark Lillis.\n\nRow 15: Colin Russell, total goals 17.\nRow 16: Brian Stanton, total goals 17.\nRow 17: Kevin Stonehouse, total goals 0.\nRow 18: Dave Sutton, total goals 2.\nRow 19: Peter Valentine, total goals 0.\nRow 20: Phil Wilson, total goals 6.\n\nAfter checking all rows, I see that Mark Lillis has the highest total goal count of 20. No one else in the table exceeds this number. \n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Mark Lillis indeed has the most total goals among all players listed.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check Mark Lillis's total goals against all other players.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Mark Lillis in the table**: He is found in row 12 with 20 total goals.\n2. **Compare his total goals to others**: \n   - Malcolm Brown has 11, Steve Doyle has 2, and others have lower totals.\n3. **Conclusion**: No other player has more than 20 total goals.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim that \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 - 82 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about the number of forwards in a specific season, which is referred to as \"1982 - 82.\" I assume that refers to the 1982-83 season because usually, seasons are labeled with the starting year. But I should keep this in mind as it could affect the result.\n\nNext, I need to look at each row of the table and identify who plays the forward position. The column named \"position\" will tell me if a player is a forward (fw). So my task is to count how many players have their position listed as \"fw.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Terry Austin, position: fw \u2192 counts as 1.\n2. **Row 6**: Maurice Cox, position: mf \u2192 Not a forward.\n3. **Row 7**: Steve Doyle, position: mf \u2192 Not a forward.\n4. **Row 10**: Timothy Hotte, position: fw \u2192 counts as 2.\n5. **Row 15**: Colin Russell, position: fw \u2192 counts as 3.\n6. **Row 17**: Kevin Stonehouse, position: fw \u2192 counts as 4.\n\nWait, that's four forwards so far, but let me check the rest to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\n- The other rows have positions like df (defender), gk (goalkeeper), or mf (midfielder), none of which are forwards. So, only Rows 1, 10, 15, and 17 have forwards.\n\nThat makes a total of four forwards: Terry Austin, Timothy Hotte, Colin Russell, and Kevin Stonehouse. \n\nNow, I need to verify if the claim is that exactly four people played forward in that season. Based on my count, that's correct. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982 - 82 season\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze each row in the table to identify players who occupy the forward (fw) position.\n\n- **Row 1**: Terry Austin is a forward.\n- **Row 10**: Timothy Hotte is a forward.\n- **Row 15**: Colin Russell is a forward.\n- **Row 17**: Kevin Stonehouse is a forward.\n\nThese four individuals play the forward position, supporting the claim. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"Brian Stanton be 1 of 2 people who have more than 0 FA Cup goals.\" So, first, I should locate Brian Stanton in the table and check his FA Cup goals.\n\nLooking through each row, I find Brian Stanton in Row 16. His position is mf (midfielder). Now, focusing on the FA Cup-related data for him: fa cup apps are 4 and fa cup goals are 2. Both of these numbers are greater than zero.\n\nNext, I need to identify whether there's only one other person with more than 0 FA Cup goals. To do this, I'll go through each row and check the FA Cup goals column:\n\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 1 (Malcolm Brown)\n- Row 3: 0\n- Row 4: 0\n- Row 5: 0\n- Row 6: 0\n- Row 7: 0\n- Row 8: 0\n- Row 9: 0\n- Row 10: 0\n- Row 11: 0\n- Row 12: 0\n- Row 13: 0\n- Row 14: 0 (Daral Pugh)\n- Row 15: 0\n- Row 16: 2 (Brian Stanton)\n- Row 17: 0\n- Row 18: 0\n- Row 19: 0\n- Row 20: 0\n\nSo, only Malcolm Brown and Brian Stanton have FA Cup goals.

Then, I need to find their respective data in the table to see if the number of league apps matches what's stated.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various stats.

So, my task is to check if all other players listed in the table have zero FA Cup goals, while Brian Stanton has at least one.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row represents a player with various statistics. The relevant column for this claim is \"fa cup goals\" because that's what the claim is about\u2014scoring FA Cup goals.\n\nI'll need to go through each row and specifically check the value under \"fa cup goals.\" Let me start by identifying where Brian Stanton is located in the table. Scanning through the names, I find Brian Stanton in Row 16. Looking at his stats: fa cup apps are 4, which means he appeared in four FA Cup matches, but his fa cup goals are 2. So, he has scored two FA Cup goals.\n\nNow, I need to check all other players to ensure none of them have a non-zero value in their \"fa cup goals\" column.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson both have 44 league apps. \n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant rows in the table where each of their names appears. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 18: name: dave sutton\n- Row 20: name: phil wilson\n\nNext, I need to check the number of \"league apps\" for each of them.\n\nFor Dave Sutton (Row 18), looking at the 'league apps' column, it says 41. Wait, that's not 44. That might be a problem because if his league apps are 41, then he doesn't have 44.\n\nNow, checking Phil Wilson (Row 20), his 'league apps' are listed as 45. Hmm, that's higher than 44. So both of them don't have exactly 44 league apps. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the numbers. Let me double-check. For Dave Sutton: under 'league apps', it says 41. For Phil Wilson: 45. So neither has 44. Therefore, the claim is false because both don't have 44. \n\nI should also note the relevant cells for each person. For Dave Sutton, the cell is in row_index 18 and column_name \"league apps\". For Phil Wilson, it's row_index 20 and same column.\n\nSo, putting this together, since neither has 44 league apps, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that both Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson have 44 league apps is incorrect because their respective league app counts are 41 and 45. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
