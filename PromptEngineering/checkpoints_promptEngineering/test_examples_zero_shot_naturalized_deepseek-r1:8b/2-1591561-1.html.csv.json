The claim is: \"the number of fatalities be unknown for aircraft ju - 52\". \n\nFirst, I should look through the table row by row to find where the mention of \"ju - 52\" appears. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: location Quelimane, aircraft Lockheed L-14... Doesn't have ju-52.\nRow 2: location Lagoa P\u00e1ti, aircraft Ju-52. Oh, here we go. So this is the row related to Ju-52.\n\nNow, I need to check the relevant columns for this row. The claim is about fatalities being unknown. Looking at the columns:\n\n- Row 2: location, aircraft, tail number (unknown), damage (w/o), and fatalities (unknown). \n\nSo, in this row, the number of fatalities is listed as 'unknown'. Therefore, the claim matches this data point.\n\nI should make sure there's no other occurrence of Ju-52 elsewhere. Checking Row 3: F27-200, not Ju-52. Similarly, Rows 4,5,6 don't have Ju-52 either. So only Row 2 is relevant.\n\nThus, the claim is true because in the table, the Ju-52 incident at Lagoa P\u00e1ti has an unknown number of fatalities.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the corresponding row where \"ju - 52\" is mentioned, confirming that the fatalities are listed as unknown.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"aircraft f27 - 200's tail number be cr - aib and have 3 / 3 fatalities.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to find any that match the aircraft type f27 - 200. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 1: location Quelimane, aircraft Lockheed L-14. Doesn't match.\nRow 2: location Lagoa P\u00e1ti, aircraft Ju-52. Nope.\nRow 3: location Louren\u00e7o Marques, aircraft F27-200. This looks promising. Let me check the details here.\nTail number is CR-AIB. That matches the first part of the claim about the tail number being CR-AIB.\n\nNow, checking fatalities for this row: it says 3 / 3. The claim mentions \"have 3 / 3 fatalities.\" So that seems to match too.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other rows with F27-200. Let's check all the rows again. Rows 4 and 5 have Boeing 737-200s, row 6 has a Boeing 747SP, so none of them mention F27-200. So row 3 is the only one that fits.\n\nLooking at row 3: tail number CR-AIB and fatalities 3 / 3.

The claim is: \"it be not know if there be fatalities on ju - 52\". \n\nFirst, I should understand each part of the claim. It's saying that it's unclear or unknown whether there were any fatalities related to a specific aircraft, which is \"ju - 52\". So, my task is to check the table for any entries involving this aircraft and see if the number of fatalities is marked as unknown.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an incident with details like location, aircraft type, tail number, damage, and fatalities. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Location Quelimane, Aircraft Lockheed L-14, Tail Number CR-AAV, Damage W/O, Fatalities Unknown.\nHere, the aircraft is a Lockheed L-14, so that's not the \"ju -52\". Fatalities are unknown. But since the claim is about ju-52, this row doesn't seem relevant.\n\nRow 2: Location Lagoa P\u00e1ti, Aircraft Ju-52, Tail Number Unknown, Damage W/O, Fatalities Unknown.\nWait, here the aircraft is indeed \"Ju-52\", which matches part of the claim. The tail number is unknown, but that's okay because the claim doesn't specify it. The important thing is whether fatalities are unknown.\n\nIn Row 2, the column for fatalities says \"unknown\". So this row directly relates to the claim because it's about ju-52 and shows that fatalities are unknown.\n\nRow 3: Location Louren\u00e7o Marques, Aircraft F27-200, Tail Number CR-AIB, Damage W/O, Fatalities 3/3.\nThis is a different aircraft (F27-200), so not relevant for the claim.\n\nRows 4-6 involve Boeing 737-200s and other planes like Boeing 747SP, which don't match \"ju-52\". Therefore, only Row 2 is relevant.\n\nSince Row 2 confirms that for ju-52, fatalities are unknown, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because in row 2, where the aircraft is \"ju -52\", the number of fatalities is listed as unknown.

The claim states: \"lagoa p\u00e1ti be the location with an unknown number of fatalities for the ju - 52 aircraft.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. It mentions two things:\n1. The location is lagoa p\u00e1ti.\n2. The aircraft is a ju-52.\n3. The number of fatalities is unknown.\n\nSo, I need to find in the table if there's an entry where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: Location: Quelimane, Aircraft: Lockheed L-14, Tail Number: CR-AAV, Damage: W/O, Fatalities: Unknown.\n- Doesn't match ju-52, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 2: Location: Lagoa p\u00e1ti, Aircraft: Ju-52, Tail Number: Unknown, Damage: W/O, Fatalities: Unknown.\n- This seems relevant because the location is lagoa p\u00e1ti and the aircraft is ju-52. The number of fatalities here is listed as Unknown, which matches the claim.\n\nRow 3: Location: Louren\u00e7o Marques, Aircraft: F27-200, Tail Number: CR-AIB, Damage: W/O, Fatalities: 3/3.\n- Doesn't match ju-52 or lagoa p\u00e1ti.\n\nRow 4: Location: Quelimane, Aircraft: Boeing 737-200, Tail Number: C9-BAB, Damage: W/O, Fatalities: 0/110.\n- Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Location: Lichinga, Aircraft: Boeing 737-200, Tail Number: C9-BAD, Damage: W/O, Fatalities: 0/108.\n- Doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: Location: Off Maputo, Aircraft: Boeing 747SP, Tail Number: ZS-SPF, Damage: W/O, Fatalities: 0/66.\n- Not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Row 2 matches all the criteria in the claim.

The tail number here is ZS-SPF. That's the one we're looking for.\n\nSo, in row 6 of the table, location is off Maputo and the tail number is zs - spf.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\" as the location. Looking at the table, I see that Row 2 has a location column with \"lagoa p\u00e1ti\". So that's one relevant cell: row_index 1 and column_name \"location\".\n\nNext, it says \"ju - 52 aircraft\". In Row 2, the aircraft column is listed as \"ju - 52\", which matches this part of the claim.

The claim is: \"the number of fatalities that occur for an unknown tail number be 0 / 66.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. There are six rows, each representing a different incident with details like location, aircraft type, tail number, damage, and fatalities. Each row has these five columns.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"fatalities that occur for an unknown tail number be 0 / 66.\" So I'm looking for any row where the tail number is marked as \"unknown\" and the fatalities are exactly 0 out of 66.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Tail number is cr - aav (known)\nRow 2: Tail number is unknown\nRow 3: Tail number is cr - aib (known)\nRow 4: Tail number is c9 - bab (known)\nRow 5: Tail number is c9 - bad (known)\nRow 6: Tail number is zs - spf (known)\n\nSo only Row 2 has an unknown tail number. Now, check the fatalities for Row 2. The table says \"fatalities: unknown.\" That means we don't know how many fatalities occurred in that incident.\n\nThe claim states that for this unknown tail number, the fatalities are exactly 0/66.

So, the task is to determine whether a claim about the given table is true or false and identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"cr - aib be the tail number with 0 / 110 fatalities.\" Breaking this down, it's saying that there's a specific tail number \"cr - aib\" associated with 0 fatalities out of a total of 110. So, I'm looking for a row in the table where the tail number is exactly \"cr - aib,\" and under the \"fatalities\" column, it should be \"0 / 110.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Tail number is cr-aav. Doesn't match cr-aib, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Tail number is unknown. Not matching, so skip.\n\nRow 3: Tail number is cr-aib. Wait a minute, this matches the tail number in question. But looking at the \"fatalities\" column here, it's 3/3. So that doesn't match the claim of 0 / 110. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nRow 4: Tail number is c9-bab. Not matching cr-aib.\n\nRow 5: Tail number is c9-bad. Also not matching.\n\nRow 6: Tail number is zs-spf. Doesn't match either.\n\nWait, so the only row with tail number \"cr - aib\" is Row 3, but it doesn't have 0 / 110 fatalities. So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim says \"cr - aib be the tail number with 0 / 110 fatalities.\" So they're saying in some row, the tail number is cr-aib and the fatalities are 0/110.\n\nLooking at Row 3: Tail number is cr-aib, but fatalities are 3/3. So it doesn't fit. Is there another row where tail number is cr-aib? No, only Row 3 has that. So does that mean the claim is false because there's no matching row with 0 / 110?\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the columns. Let me make sure. The table columns are: location, aircraft, tail number, aircraft damage, fatalities.\n\nYes, so for each row, those are the columns. So in Row 3, we have tail number cr-aib, but the fatalities are 3/3, not 0/110.\n\nSo the claim is saying that \"cr - aib\" is the tail number with 0 / 110 fatalities. Since there's no such row where tail number is cr-aib and fatalities are 0/110, the claim must be false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" But wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the user made a typo in the table? Or perhaps I misread the row numbers. Let's count the rows again starting from 0:\n\nRow 1: Quelimane\n\nRow 2: Lagoa P\u00e1ti\n\nRow 3: Louren\u00e7o Marques\n\nRow 4: Quelimane\n\nRow 5: Lichinga\n\nRow 6: Off Maputo\n\nYes, so only Row 3 has tail number cr-aib.

The claim says, \"the number of fatalities that occur for the ju - 52 aircraft be 3 / 3.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each row in the table to see if any mention the Ju-52 aircraft and its fatalities. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1 talks about Quelimane with a Lockheed L-14, so that's not it. Row 2 mentions Lagoa P\u00e1ti with a Ju-52 but the tail number is unknown. The fatalities are also unknown here, so maybe this is relevant because the claim is about Ju-52, but since the exact count isn't given, it might not fully support the claim.\n\nRow 3 is about Louren\u00e7o Marques with an F27-200, which isn't a Ju-52, so that's irrelevant. Row 4 and Row 5 both discuss Boeing 737-200s in Quelimane and Lichinga, respectively. Again, not Ju-52s.\n\nRow 6 is about a Boeing 747SP off Maputo, which also doesn't match the Ju-52. So the only relevant row seems to be Row 2 because it mentions the Ju-52, but the fatalities are unknown there. The claim says \"3 / 3\" for Ju-52, but since we don't know if that's accurate from the table, especially since another Ju-52 in Row 2 doesn't provide a specific number, I think the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is specifically about the Ju-52 having 3/3 fatalities.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"the ju - 52 aircraft have a location of off maputo and 0 / 108 fatalities.\" \n\nI'll start by identifying which parts of this claim need to be checked against the table. The claim mentions two specific things: the location and the number of fatalities for the Ju-52 aircraft.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an incident with details like location, aircraft, tail number, damage, and fatalities. I need to find the row where the aircraft is a Ju-52 and see what information it provides about location and fatalities.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Aircraft is Lockheed L-14.\nRow 2: Aircraft is Ju-52. This seems relevant because the claim mentions Ju-52.\n\nSo, let's focus on Row 2. The details for Row 2 are:\n- Location: Lagoa P\u00e1ti\n- Aircraft: Ju-52\n- Tail number: unknown\n- Damage: w / o (which I think means 'without damage' or 'unknown')\n- Fatalities: unknown\n\nNow, checking the location part of the claim. The claim says \"off maputo,\" but Row 2 lists the location as \"Lagoa P\u00e1ti.\" I need to see if these are the same or different. If they're different locations, then the claim's location is incorrect.\n\nNext, looking at fatalities. The claim states \"0 / 108 fatalities.\" In Row 2, the fatalities column is marked as 'unknown.' So there's no information here that confirms 0 or 108 fatalities for the Ju-52 in Lagoa P\u00e1ti.\n\nSince the claim specifies both location and fatalities, but neither of these details match what's in Row 2, it seems like the claim is incorrect. However, I should double-check if there are any other rows with Ju-52 to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nOnly Row 2 has a Ju-52 aircraft. The rest have different models. Therefore, my initial assessment stands.\n\nSo, the claim about the location being \"off Maputo\" and having 0/108 fatalities for the Ju-52 doesn't align with the data in Row 2. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked if there's a Ju-52 aircraft located off Maputo with 0/108 fatalities. The table shows a Ju-52 in Lagoa P\u00e1ti, not off Maputo, and unknown fatalities. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fatalities\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Wait, that's similar but ends with BAB instead of BAD. So maybe a typo or different? Not the same as c9-bad.\nRow 5: Tail number is C9-BAD. Oh, this matches exactly what the claim refers to.\n\nNow, for row 5, let's check the fatalities column. It says 0 / 108. The format seems like two numbers separated by a slash, possibly indicating something like \"0 deaths out of 108 total.\" So the first number represents fatalities, which is 0. Since 0 isn't considered unknown, this doesn't match the claim.\n\nIs there any other row with tail number C9-BAD? Let me double-check all rows again quickly. Only row 5 has that exact tail number.\n\nSo based on this, in the table, the aircraft with tail number c9-bad (which is row 5) has 0 fatalities. The claim says it's unknown, which isn't correct here. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, I analyzed each row of the table to find the aircraft with the specified tail number. The only matching entry is in row 5, where the number of fatalities is explicitly stated as 0. Since this contradicts the claim that the fatalities are unknown, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tail number\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
