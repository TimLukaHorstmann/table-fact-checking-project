    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"player gil morgan represent the united state tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and break it down into parts:\n\n1. **Player**: Gil Morgan\n2. **Action**: Represent (which I think means participated in or is part of)\n3. **Country**: United States\n4. **Placement**: Tie for 7th place\n5. **Score**: -2 to par\n\nNow, I'll refer to the table provided to check if all these points are accurate.\n\nLooking at Row 11: It has player Gil Morgan from the United States. His score is calculated as 73 + 67 + 71 = 211, and his to-par is -2. That matches the claim's mention of a tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\n\nI need to check if he is indeed tied for 7th. Looking at the table:\n\n- Rows 7 through 11 all have players with a score of 211 and a to-par of -2.\n- So, multiple players are tied at 7th place, including Gil Morgan.\n\nTherefore, each part of the claim checks out: Gil Morgan is a United States player who ties for 7th with a score of 211 (-2 to par). \n\nI don't see any discrepancies in the information provided. The relevant row is Row 11, and the columns involved are place, player, country, and to-par.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
