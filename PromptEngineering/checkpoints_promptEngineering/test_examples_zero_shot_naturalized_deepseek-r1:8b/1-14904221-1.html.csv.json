    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"in 1994, there be no competition in men, woman or mixed double.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the row corresponding to 1994. Let me check Row 1 of the table. In Row 1, under the year 1994, the data shows that there's no competition in both mens doubles and womens doubles, but it also mentions no competition for mixed doubles as well. So, all three categories\u2014mens singles, womens singles, and the various doubles\u2014are either having specific players or stated as \"no competition.\" \n\nWait, actually, looking again, the columns are \"men's singles,\" \"women's singles,\" \"men's doubles,\" \"women's doubles,\" and \"mixed doubles.\" The claim is about 1994 having no competition in all of these. From Row 1, I see that for men's doubles, it says \"no competition,\" same with women's doubles and mixed doubles. However, the men's singles and women's singles have specific players mentioned: Ivan \u0110uri\u0107 for men's singles and Nata\u0161a Ostoji\u0107 for women's singles. \n\nSo, in 1994, while there were no competitions in doubles events (mens, womens, mixed), there were singles competitions happening. The claim states that there was no competition in \"men,\" which likely refers to men's singles and possibly all categories. But since the men's singles did have a competition with Ivan \u0110uri\u0107, that contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim is false because in 1994, there was a men's singles competition and no competitions in doubles.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm interpreting \"no competition\" correctly. The term \"competition\" here refers to whether there were any players participating or if it was held. If \"no competition\" means that the event didn't occur at all, then for 1994, the men's singles did have a competition with Ivan \u0110uri\u0107, so the claim is incorrect because it claims no competition in men, which isn't true.\n\nSo, to summarize: The relevant cells are in Row 1 for all columns except women's singles. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"men's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the winner of the womens single in 2001 be jelena obri\u0107.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim relate to the table. The key elements here are \"womens singles,\" \"winner,\" and the specific year \"2001.\" \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 1994 to 2001. Each row has columns for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, etc. So I need to check the women's singles column for the year 2001.\n\nI'll go through each row until I find the one that matches the year 2001. Scanning the rows, row 8 is year 2001. Now, looking at the women's singles column in that row: the entry is \"jelena obri\u0107.\" That's exactly what the claim states\u2014the winner of the women's singles in 2001 is jelena obri\u0107.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other relevant cells. The claim only mentions the women's singles, so I don't need to check other columns like men's singles or doubles for this specific claim. Therefore, the only relevant cell is row 8 under \"women's singles.\"\n\nPutting it all together, since the table confirms that in 2001, jelena obri\u0107 won the women's singles, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the women's singles column for the year 2001, which confirms that jelena obri\u0107 was the winner.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107 win the men's single in 1978\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the table contains and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the table: each row represents a year from 1994 to 2001. For each year, there are entries for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Each of these categories lists the participants who won or competed that year.\n\nNow, the claim is about \"ivan \u0111uri\u0107 winning the men's single in 1978.\" So I need to check if there's any information in the table about a men's singles event where ivan \u0111uri\u0107 was the winner in 1978. \n\nLooking at the table, all the years it covers start from 1994 onwards. The earliest year mentioned is 1994, and it goes up to 2001. There's no mention of 1978 anywhere in the table. That means that if ivan \u0111uri\u0107 did win a men's singles event in 1978, that information isn't provided here.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Could the data be incomplete? Or perhaps the table doesn't include all the years, so 1978 might not be covered. Since the table starts in 1994, any events before that aren't included. Therefore, there's no way to verify if ivan \u0111uri\u0107 won in 1978 based on this information.\n\nSo, considering that the table doesn't have data for 1978, the claim can't be fully supported. That would make the answer \"FALSE.\"\n</think>\n\nThe table only covers years from 1994 to 2001 and does not include any information about 1978. Since there's no relevant data in the provided rows to confirm ivan \u0111uri\u0107's victory in 1978, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"jelena obri\u0107 go on to win woman's single in 1997\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Jelena Obri\u0107 won the women's singles in 1997.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1994 to 2001. Each row has several columns: mens singles, womens singles, mens doubles, womens doubles, and mixed doubles. My task is to check if there's any relevant data for Jelena Obri\u0107 in the women's singles column for the year 1997.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. The claim mentions the year 1997, so I should focus on that specific row. Let's look at Row 4 (since years start from 1994 as Row 1, 1995 is Row 2, and so on, so 1997 would be Row 4).\n\nIn Row 4, the womens singles column has \"jovanka kne\u017eevi\u0107\". Hmm, that's not Jelena Obri\u0107. So there's no mention of her winning in 1997 based on this row.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if she won in a different category or another year? But the claim specifically mentions women's singles in 1997, so I need to focus only on that specific column and year.\n\nLet me double-check other years to see if Jelena Obri\u0107 ever won the womens singles. Looking at Row 5 (1998), the womens singles is \"jelena obri\u0107\", but that's not for 1997. Similarly, in Row 6 (1999) and Row 7 (2000), she wins again, but those are after 1997.\n\nIn Row 4, it's definitely Jovanka Kne\u017eevi\u0107 who won the womens singles in 1997. So there's no support for the claim that Jelena Obri\u0107 won that year. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jelena Obri\u0107 won the women's singles in 1997. However, upon checking Row 4 of the table (which corresponds to 1997), the womens singles winner is listed as \"jovanka kne\u017eevi\u0107,\" not Jelena Obri\u0107. Thus, there is no evidence supporting the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
