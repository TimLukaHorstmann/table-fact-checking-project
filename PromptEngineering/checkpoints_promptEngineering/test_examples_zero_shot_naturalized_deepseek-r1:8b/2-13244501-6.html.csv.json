The claim says: \"parent have the decision when the attendance be 3069 in a game on february 14.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n\n1. The decision was made by \"parent.\"\n2. The attendance at that game was 3069.\n3. It happened on February 14.\n\nSo, I need to find in the table a row where the date is February 14, the attendance is 3069, and the decision is by someone named parent.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n- Row 1: Feb 1, California visitor, attendance 6386.\n- Row 2: Feb 3, Chicago, attendance 14646.\n- Row 3: Feb 4, Toronto, attendance 14646.\n- Row 4: Feb 7, Montreal vs. Philadelphia, attendance 14026.\n- Row 5: Feb 10, St Louis, attendance 13112.\n- Row 6: Feb 11, Minnesota, attendance 15154.\n- Row 7: Feb 14, California visitor, home is Philadelphia.

The claim says: \"the highest score be 3 - 7 in a game against minnesota on february 22 and the lowest be 1 - 1 in a game against pittsburgh on february 21.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts to check separately.\n\nThe first part is about the highest score being 3-7 against Minnesota on February 22. Looking at the table, each row has a 'visitor' and 'home' team, along with the game's details. So I need to find the row where the home team is Philadelphia and the visitor is Minnesota on that specific date.\n\nRow 11: date: february 22, visitor: minnesota, score: 3 - 7, home: philadelphia... Yes, that matches exactly. The score is 3-7, which is the highest so far because looking at other games, like row 12 where it's 2-1, and others have lower scores.\n\nNow the second part of the claim is about the lowest score being 1-1 against Pittsburgh on February 21. So I'm looking for a game where the home team is Philadelphia and the visitor is Pittsburgh on that date.\n\nLooking at row 10: date: february 21, visitor: philadelphia, score: 1 - 1, home: pittsburgh... Wait, here the visitor is Philadelphia, but the home is Pittsburgh. That means the game was in Pittsburgh, so the perspective is from Pittsburgh's side. The score is 1-1.\n\nI need to confirm if this is indeed the lowest score. Checking other games against Pittsburgh, like row 12: date feb 25, visitor pittsburgh, score 2-1; and row 13: 3-1. So the 1-1 seems lower than those. However, I should check if there are any other games where the score is even lower.\n\nLooking through all rows, the scores against Pittsburgh are:\nRow 10: 1-1 (visitor Philadelphia at Pittsburgh)\nRow 12: 2-1 (visitor pittsburgh at Philadelphia)\nRow 13: 3-1 (visitor los angeles at Philadelphia)\n\nSo row 10's score is 1-1, which would be the lowest because 1 is less than 2 and 3.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about attendance and records in the table is true or false. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the lowest attendance be 3069 when the record go to 25 - 21 - 8 and highest attendance be 15154 when the record go to 25 - 20 - 8.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if there are any rows where the attendance is 3069 when the record is exactly 25-21-8, and another row where attendance is 15154 with a record of 25-20-8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. I need to scan through these rows and identify which ones match the conditions in the claim.\n\nStarting from Row 1 to Row 13:\n\nRow 1: date is Feb 1, attendance is 6386, record 21-19-8.\nRow 2: Feb 3, attendance 14646, record 22-19-8.\nRow 3: Feb 4, attendance 14646, record 23-19-8.\nRow 4: Feb 7, attendance 14026, record 23-20-8.\nRow 5: Feb 10, attendance 13112, record 24-20-8.\nRow 6: Feb 11, attendance 15154, record 25-20-8. Oh, this looks promising because the attendance is 15154 and the record is 25-20-8.\nRow 7: Feb 14, attendance 3069, record 25-21-8. That also matches the first part of the claim.\nRow 8: Feb 16, attendance 9867, record 25-22-8.\nRow 9: Feb 18, attendance 17250, record 25-23-8.\nRow 10: Feb 21, attendance 9198, record 25-23-9.\nRow 11: Feb 22, attendance 14392, record 26-23-9.\nRow 12: Feb 25, attendance 14418, record 26-24-9.\nRow 13: Feb 29, attendance 9115, record 26-25-9.\n\nSo, from this, Row 7 has the lowest attendance (3069) when the record is 25-21-8. That's one condition met.\n\nRow 6 has the highest attendance (15154) when the record is 25-20-8.

The claim says: \"there be 2 games against California with the score of 0 - 4 and 3 - 3.\"\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row in the table to find any games where the visitor is California and their scores are either 0-4 or 3-3.\n\nLooking at Row 1: date is February 1. Visitor is California with a score of 3-3. That's one game that fits part of the claim.\n\nRow 7: date is February 14. Visitor is Philadelphia, so that doesn't fit. The home team is California, but the visitor isn't California here.\n\nI need to check if there are two games where the visitor is California with scores 0-4 and 3-3. From the table, only one game fits: Row 1 (3-3) and none for 0-4. So, the claim might be false because there's only one game against California with a score of 3-3 and no game with 0-4.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The visitor is California in Row 1 and another time? Looking at other rows, visitors are Chicago, Toronto, Philadelphia, Montreal, St Louis, Minnesota, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh. Only Row 1 has California as the visitor. So no, there's only one game against California with score 3-3 and none with 0-4.

Check if any of these have scores 0-4 or 3-3.\n3. Only Row 1 (February 1) has a score of 3-3, and no row has 0-4 as the score for California visitors.\n4.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be a game on feburary 25 with a score of 1 - 2 and a game on february 29 with a score of 2 - 1.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if there are two games in the table. One on February 25 with a score of 1-2, and another on February 29 with a score of 2-1.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a date. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Feb 1 - No.\nRow 2: Feb 3 - No.\nRow 3: Feb 4 - No.\nRow 4: Feb 7 - No.\nRow 5: Feb 10 - No.\nRow 6: Feb 11 - No.\nRow 7: Feb 14 - No.\nRow 8: Feb 16 - No.\nRow 9: Feb 18 - No.\nRow 10: Feb 21 - No.\nRow 11: Feb 22 - Visitor is Minnesota, home is Philadelphia. Score is 3-7. Doesn't match either score mentioned in the claim.\nRow 12: Feb 25 - Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is 2-1. Wait, that's a score of 2-1. But the claim says February 25 should have a score of 1-2. So this doesn't match.\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me check row 12 again. Date: Feb 25, visitor: Pittsburgh, score: 2 - 1. So home team is Philadelphia, and the score is 2-1 for the home team? Or is it away versus home?\n\nLooking at the table structure, \"score\" is probably in the format of home vs away. So if the home is Philadelphia, then a score of 2-1 would mean Philadelphia won by 2 points over the visitor.\n\nBut the claim says a game on Feb 25 with a score of 1-2. That would imply that the home team scored 1 and the visitor scored 2, resulting in a loss for the home team (Philadelphia). But in row 12, it's 2-1, so Philadelphia won by 2 points.\n\nSo that doesn't match. Let me check if there's another game on Feb 25 with 1-2.\n\nWait, no, only one game per date. So row 12 is the only one for Feb 25, and it's 2-1.\n\nThen looking at row 13: Date: Feb 29. Visitor is Los Angeles, score: 3 - 1. So that doesn't match 2-1 either. Wait, no, the claim says a game on Feb 29 with a score of 2-1.\n\nBut in row 13, it's 3-1, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all dates again.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 12: Feb 25, visitor Pittsburgh, score 2-1 (so home is Philadelphia, which would mean Philadelphia scored 2 and visitor scored 1? Or is it the other way around?)\n\nWait, actually, in the table, \"score\" is probably structured as home team's score minus visitor's score. So if the home is Philadelphia, then a score of 2-1 means Philly won by 2 points.\n\nBut the claim says there's a game on Feb 25 with a score of 1-2. That would mean the visitor scored 1 and home scored 2? Or perhaps it's reversed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused about which team is home or away. Let me clarify: for each row, \"visitor\" is the team coming to play against the \"home\" team.\n\nSo the score is likely structured as home team's points minus visitor's points. So if the score is 2-1, that means home (Philadelphia) scored 2 and visitor scored 1, so Philadelphia won.\n\nBut the claim says a game on Feb 25 with a score of 1-2, which would mean home scored 1, visitor scored 2, making the visitor win. So that's different from what's in row 12.\n\nSo for the first part of the claim (Feb 25, 1-2), there is no such game because row 12 has a score of 2-1 for Philadelphia.\n\nThen looking for Feb 29: the claim says 2-1. In row 13, date is Feb 29, visitor Los Angeles, score 3-1, which doesn't match 2-1.\n\nSo neither of these games exist in the table as per the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check all dates again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, row 12: Feb 25, score 2-1 (home: Philadelphia). So that's one game on Feb 25 with a different score than claimed.\n\nRow 13: Feb 29, score 3-1. No match for 2-1.\n\nSo the claim is making two assertions: both games exist as described, but neither does in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The attendance is 9867 on February 14.\n\nI need to look through the table for any row that matches both conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. \n\nStarting with February 14, I check each row's date to see if it's February 14.

Then, I'll do the same for when the record is \"25 - 20 - 8\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 13 has a record of \"26 - 25 - 9\", so that's not it.\n- Let me go back to the earlier rows. Hmm, looking at Row 7: date: february 14, visitor: philadelphia, score: 0 - 4, home: california, decision: parent, attendance: 3069, record: 25 - 21 - 8. That's one row with record \"25 - 21 - 8\" and attendance 3069.\n\nWait, but the claim says the lowest attendance should be 9115 for this record.

Let me go through each row again.\n\nWait, in Row 10, the date is february 21, and the attendance is 9198 with a record of \"25 - 23 - 9\". Not matching.\n\nRow 5: february 10, visitor philadelphia, score 2-1. Attendance is 13112, but the record is \"24 - 20 - 8\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check Row 6: date february 11, visitor philadelphia, score 3-2. Record is \"25 - 20 - 8\" and attendance is 15154.\n\nSo that's one row where the record is \"25 - 20 - 8\" with an attendance of 15154.\n\nBut does any other row have the same record? Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking at Row 6: yes, that's 25-20-8 and 15154. Any others?\n\nRow 7: 25-21-8\nRow 13: 26-25-9\nSo I think only Row 6 matches \"25 - 20 - 8\" with attendance 15154.\n\nWait, the claim says that the highest attendance is 15154 when the record goes to 25-20-8. But in Row 6, the attendance is indeed 15154 for that record. However, I also need to check if there are other rows with \"25 - 20 - 8\" and see their attendances.\n\nLooking through all rows again, only Row 6 has \"25 - 20 - 8\". So its attendance is 15154, which would be the highest for that record. Now, what's the lowest attendance when the record is 25-21-8?\n\nIn Row 7: attendance is 3069. Are there any other rows with 25-21-8? Let me check:\n\nRow 1: february 1 \u2013 record 21-19-8\nRow 2: same home and visitor, but different date and score.\nWait, no. Looking at all rows, only Row 7 has \"25 - 21 - 8\".\n\nSo for that record, the attendance is 3069, which would be the lowest.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are met:\n- When record is 25-21-8, the lowest attendance is 9115? Wait, no. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the claim says: \"lowest attendance be 9115 when the record go 25 - 21 - 8\". But in the table, Row 7 has attendance 3069 for that record, which is lower than 9115.\n\nSo that means the claim's assertion about the lowest attendance being 9115 is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the actual lowest attendance for 25-21-8 is 3069, not 9115.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at all rows with \"25 - 21 - 8\":\n\nOnly Row 7: february 14, visitor philadelphia, score 0-4, attendance 3069, record 25-21-8.\n\nSo the lowest attendance for that record is 3069, which is lower than 9115. Therefore, the claim's statement about the lowest attendance being 9115 when the record is 25-21-8 is false because it's actually 3069.\n\nThus, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check for two conditions:\n1. The lowest attendance of 9115 when the record is \"25 - 21 - 8\".\n2. The highest attendance of 15154 when the record is \"25 - 20 - 8\".\n\nUpon reviewing the data:\n- For the record \"25 - 21 - 8\", Row 7 has an attendance of 3069, which is lower than 9115.\n- For the record \"25 - 20 - 8\", Row 6 has an attendance of 15154.\n\nSince the first condition (lowest attendance) does not hold true for 9115, the overall claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.  \nThe lowest attendance for the record \"25 - 21 - 8\" is actually 3069, not 9115.",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the highest score be 2 - 7 in a game against minnesota on february 22 and the lowest be 1 - 1 in a game against pittsburgh on february 21.\"\n\nAlright, so I need to check two specific scores from the table. First, the highest score of 2-7 when playing against Minnesota on February 22. Second, the lowest score of 1-1 against Pittsburgh on February 21.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has a date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. I should focus on the \"score\" column for both parts of the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row to find the relevant ones.\n\nFirst part: highest score of 2-7 against Minnesota on Feb 22.\n\nI need to look for a game where the date is February 22, visitor is Minnesota, and the score is 2-7. Let's check Row 11: Date is February 22, Visitor is Minnesota. The score there is 3-7, not 2-7. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Row 11: date: february 22, visitor: minnesota, score: 3 - 7. So the score is 3-7, not 2-7. Therefore, there's no game with a score of 2-7 against Minnesota on February 22.\n\nSo that part of the claim doesn't hold true. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"highest\" and \"lowest.\" Maybe it's about the highest recorded score in those games, but no, the wording says \"the highest score be 2 - 7,\" implying that specific game had a 2-7 score.\n\nSince Row 11 shows a 3-7 against Minnesota on Feb 22, the claim about 2-7 there is false. So even if other rows have higher or lower scores, this specific part of the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nNow for the second part: lowest score of 1-1 against Pittsburgh on February 21.\n\nLooking for a game where date is Feb 21, visitor is Pittsburgh, and score is 1-1. Let's check Row 10: Date is Feb 21, Visitor is Philadelphia? Wait, no. Let me look again.\n\nRow 10: date: february 21, visitor: philadelphia, score: 1 - 1, home: pittsburgh... So the home team is Pittsburgh, and the visitor is Philadelphia. The score is 1-1.\n\nBut the claim says it's against Pittsburgh as the visitor. Wait, in Row 10, it's Philadelphia visiting Pittsburgh. So if we're considering the game where Pittsburgh is the home, then the score is 1-1. However, the claim specifies that the lowest score is against Pittsburgh as the visitor. So does this row qualify?\n\nWait, the claim says \"against pittsburgh,\" which could mean Pittsburgh is either the home or visitor. In Row 10, Philadelphia is visiting Pittsburgh (so Pittsburgh is the home). The score is 1-1 for the game where Pittsburgh is the home team.\n\nBut if we're looking for a game against Pittsburgh as the visitor, that would be when Pittsburgh is visiting another city. Looking through the table, I don't see any row where Pittsburgh is the visitor. For example, in Row 12: visitor is pittsburgh? No, it's always Philadelphia or other cities visiting.\n\nWait, no, looking at Row 11: visitor is Minnesota, Row 12: visitor is Pittsburgh. Wait, no, in Row 12, date is February 25, visitor is pittsburgh. So the game is against Philadelphia (home), score 2-1. That's not the 1-1.\n\nWait, so looking through all rows:\n\nRow 10: Feb 21, visitor is Philadelphia, home is Pittsburgh, score 1-1.\n\nIs there any row where the visitor is Pittsburgh? Let me check each row.\n\nRow 3: visitor Toronto\n\nRow 4: visitor Philadelphia\n\nRow 5: visitor Philadelphia\n\nRow 6: visitor Philadelphia\n\nRow 7: visitor Philadelphia\n\nRow 8: visitor Los Angeles\n\nRow 9: visitor New York\n\nRow 10: visitor Philadelphia\n\nRow 11: visitor Minnesota\n\nRow 12: visitor Pittsburgh\n\nWait, Row 12: date february 25, visitor pittsburgh. So on Feb 25, Pittsburgh is visiting Philadelphia (home), score 2-1.\n\nSo in the table, there's no game where the visitor is Pittsburgh except for Row 12, which isn't a 1-1 game. Therefore, the claim about the lowest score being 1-1 against Pittsburgh as the visitor might not be supported because such a game doesn't exist in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim considers that the home team is Pittsburgh and the score is 1-1, regardless of who the visitor is. But then, the row would be Row 10 where Pittsburgh is the home with a 1-1 score. However, the claim specifies \"against pittsburgh,\" which could imply against as the visitor or regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"the lowest be 1 - 1 against Pittsburgh.\" If the game is on Feb 21 and it's 1-1, but in that case, Pittsburgh is the home team, not the visitor. So maybe the wording is ambiguous.\n\nBut since the table doesn't show a game where Pittsburgh is the visitor with a score of 1-1, I think the claim isn't supported for both parts.\n\nTherefore, overall, the claim is incorrect because there's no game on Feb 22 against Minnesota with a score of 2-7 and no game against Pittsburgh as the visitor with a 1-1 score. Wait, but actually, in Row 10, it's a 1-1 game where Pittsburgh is the home team. So if the claim refers to the lowest score when playing against Pittsburgh, regardless of being the home or away, then Row 10 would support that part.\n\nBut I'm not sure because the wording says \"against pittsburgh,\" which might mean as the visitor. Since there's no game where Pittsburgh is the visitor with a 1-1 score, maybe it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim just refers to any game against Pittsburgh, whether home or away, but since only Row 10 has a 1-1 game involving Pittsburgh (as home), then that part might still be true. However, the first part about 2-7 against Minnesota on Feb 22 is definitely not supported.\n\nSo overall, since both parts of the claim don't hold, the entire statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the task is factually incorrect based on the provided data. \n\n1. **Highest Score Against Minneapolis**: There is no game recorded with a score of 2-7 against Minnesota on February 22nd. The table shows a game on that date where Minnesota was the visitor and the score was 3-7.\n\n2. **Lowest Score Against Pittsburgh**: While there is a game involving Pittsburgh (on February 21st) with a score of 1-1, it is when Pittsburgh was the home team against Philadelphia. There are no games in the provided data where Pittsburgh is the visitor with a score of 1-1.\n\nSince both parts of the claim do not align with the recorded scores, the assertion is incorrect. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect as there is no evidence of a game on February 22nd against Minnesota with a score of 2-7 and no game against Pittsburgh as the visitor with a 1-1 score.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"there be 2 games against california with the score of 0 - 2 and 2 - 3.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's looking for two specific games where California is the visitor (since it's about games against them), and the scores are either 0-2 or 2-3.\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table to see if any match these criteria. \n\nLooking at the table, I can see that each row has a \"visitor\" column and a \"score\" column. So for each row where the visitor is California, I need to check the score.\n\nLet me scan through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Visitor is California, score is 3-3. That doesn't match 0-2 or 2-3.\nRow 7: Visitor is California, score is 0-4. Close, but not 0-2.\nRow 14? Wait, looking back, the table only goes up to row 13. So maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the rows go from 1 to 13. So let's list out all rows where the visitor is California:\n\nLooking at each row's \"visitor\" column:\n\nRow 1: visitor = california\nRow 7: visitor = california\n\nAre there any others? Let me see:\n\nRow 14 doesn't exist; only up to row 13.\n\nSo in the table, only two rows have California as the visitor: Row 1 and Row 7.\n\nNow, checking their scores:\n\nRow 1: score is 3-3\nRow 7: score is 0-4\n\nNeither of these matches either 0-2 or 2-3. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed some rows. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: visitor = california, score = 3-3 \u2192 no.\nRow 2: visitor = chicago\nRow 3: visitor = toronto\nRow 4: visitor = philadelphia\nRow 5: visitor = philadelphia\nRow 6: visitor = philadelphia\nRow 7: visitor = california, score=0-4 \u2192 no.\nRow 8: visitor = los angeles\nRow 9: visitor = new york\nRow 10: visitor = pittsburgh\nRow 11: visitor = minnesota\nRow 12: visitor = pittsburgh\nRow 13: visitor = los angeles\n\nSo only Row 1 and Row 7 have California as the visitor. Neither has a score of 0-2 or 2-3.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the scores:\n\nRow 1: 3-3 \u2192 not matching\nRow 7: 0-4 \u2192 close but no.\n\nSo there are zero games against California with the specified scores. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that there are two games against California with scores of 0-2 and 2-3. After reviewing the table, only two rows have California as the visitor: Row 1 (score 3-3) and Row 7 (score 0-4). Neither score matches the claim, so it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
