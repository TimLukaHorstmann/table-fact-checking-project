    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"In the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League season, Juventus FC have a 1st leg of 0-1 while in the 2011-12 season, FC Flora Tallinn have a 1st leg of 1-0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with Juventus FC in the 2010-11 season. Looking through the table rows, I need to find any row where the club is Juventus and the season is 2010-11. But scanning through the table, I don't see any entries for Juventus or the years around that period. The closest I see are other clubs like Manchester United in 1957-58, but nothing matching Juventus in 2010-11.\n\nNext, checking FC Flora Tallinn in the 2011-12 season. Looking through the table, I find row 25: season 2011-12, competition UEFA Champions League, round second qualifying round, club FC Flora Tallinn, first leg 1-0. So that matches the second part of the claim.\n\nBut since there's no data for Juventus in 2010-11, the first part isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is only partially correct. Since one part is missing information, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes two specific match results: one for Juventus FC in the 2010-11 season and another for FC Flora Tallinn in the 2011-12 season. The table contains data for FC Flora Tallinn's first leg as 1-0 during the 2011-12 Champions League second qualifying round (row 25). However, there is no corresponding entry in the table for Juventus FC in the 2010-11 Europa League season. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when the 1st leg be 1 - 2 the club be paok fc in the 2011 - 12 uefa europa league.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that if there's a match where the first leg score is 1-2 and it's part of the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League, then the club involved is PAOK FC.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any row that matches these conditions: season is 2011-12, competition is UEFA Europa League, round is the first leg (though the table doesn't specify a 'first leg' column explicitly), and the score is 1-2. Then check if the club in such a row is PAOK FC.\n\nI'll go through each row related to the 2011-12 season and the Europa League. Let me start from the top:\n\nRows 25-34 are for 2011-12, but I need to see which ones have a competition of UEFA Europa League.\n\nRow 25: Champions League, so not relevant.\nRow 26: Champions League again.\nRow 27: Europa League, playoff round. Score is 1-1. Not matching 1-2.\nRow 28: Group stages, score 0-3. Not relevant.\nRow 29: Group stages, score 1-3. No.\nRow 30: Group stages, score 1-2. Here we go, row 30 has a score of 1-2 in the group stages for PAOK FC.\n\nSo, row 30 is for the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League, group stages, and the club is PAOK FC with a score of 1-2. This matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other rows that also fit this condition to make sure it's not contradicted. Let's see:\n\nRow 31: Same as row 30, but score is 1-3. So no match for 1-2 here.\nRow 32: Different score, same club.\nRow 33: Score 0-4, different.\n\nSo only row 30 matches the criteria. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a row where the first leg score is 1-2 and the club is PAOK FC in the 2011-12 Europa League.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the largest first leg be 0 - 7 for team g\u00f3rnik zabrze in the 1994 - 95 season.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions a \"first leg,\" which refers to the initial match of a two-legged competition. The score is 0-7 in favor of G\u00f3rnik Zabrze. The season mentioned is 1994-95.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find any rows that match these specifics. Each row in the table has several columns: season, competition, round, club, and first leg score.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the season \"1994 - 95.\" Scrolling through the list, I notice that Row 18 is the only one with season: 1994 - 95. \n\nRow 18 details:\n- Competition: uefa cup\n- Round: preliminary round\n- Club: g\u00f3rnik zabrze\n- 1st leg score: 0 - 7.\n\nThis row exactly matches all parts of the claim: it's the 1994-95 season, the first leg score is 0-7 for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze. \n\nI don't see any other rows that fit this combination. The competition is uefa cup, but the claim doesn't specify which competition, so that part isn't a point of contention. The round is preliminary, which aligns with typical initial stages in a two-legged tournament.\n\nTherefore, since all details of the claim are present and correctly matched in Row 18, the claim must be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"first leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The year is 2003.\n2. The competition is the uefa intertoto cup.\n3. There are two rounds mentioned: first round and second round.\n4. The scores for the first leg are 2-1 and 0-2.\n\nMy task is to check if there's any data in the table that matches these conditions.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row of the table to find entries from 2003 related to the uefa intertoto cup.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 21: season: 2003, competition: uefa intertoto cup, round: first round, score: 2-1.\n- Row 22: season: 2003, competition: uefa intertoto cup, round: second round, score: 0-2.\n\nThese two rows seem to match the conditions described in the claim.

Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is asserting that PAOK FC did not participate in the 2011-12 Europa League. To verify this, I should look through the table for any entries related to PAOK FC and the 2011-12 season in the context of the Europa League.\n\nLooking at the table, I see rows from Row 23 onwards because earlier rows are from other years. Let's go through them one by one:\n\nRow 23: Season is 2010-11, competition is uefa europa league, round: second qualifying round, club: bnei yehuda tel aviv fc. No mention of PAOK here.\n\nRow 24: Same season 2010-11, competition: uefa europa league, round: third qualifying round, club: juventus fc. Still not PAOK.\n\nRows 25-26: These are for the 2011-12 season in the champions league, so not relevant to the Europa League.\n\nRow 27: Season is 2011-12, competition: uefa europa league, round: playoff round, club: fk partizan. Not PAOK.\n\nRows 28-31: These are group stages for the 2011-12 Europa League with clubs Rubin Kazan, Tottenham Hotspur, and PAOK. Wait, rows 30 and 31 mention PAOK. Let me check:\n\nRow 30: Season: 2011-12 uefa europa league, competition: uefa europa league, round: group stages, club: paok fc, score: 1-2.\n\nRow 31: Same season, same competition, same round and club: paok fc with a score of 1-3.\n\nSo PAOK FC is indeed playing in the 2011-12 Europa League. This directly contradicts the claim that they do not play in it. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant rows are 30 and 31 where PAOK's participation is confirmed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether \"paok fc do not play in the 2011 - 12 europa league\" is TRUE or FALSE, we look for their involvement in that season.\n\n**Verification:**\n- **Rows 30 and 31:** Both entries refer to PAOK FC competing in the 2011-12 uefa europa league group stages.\n  \nBased on this evidence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Celtic and AC Omonia is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what the claim is saying. It states: \"Celtic be the club when the 1st leg be 0 - 1 and ac omonia be the club when the 1st leg be also 0 - 1.\" Breaking this down, it's saying two things:\n1. There exists a row where Celtic is the club and the first leg score was 0-1.\n2. There exists another row where AC Omonia is the club and the first leg score was also 0-1.\n\nSo, I need to scan through each row of the table to find any instances where either Celtic or AC Omonia are listed as the club with a 0-1 score in the first leg. \n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Manchester United, preliminary round, 0-6.\nRow 2: OG C Nice, preliminary round, 2-3.\nRow 3: Botev Plovdiv, second round, 0-4.\nRow 4: Valencia, first round, 0-1. Here, the club is Valencia, so not relevant for our claim.\nRow 5: ... Wait, the table provided only up to row 34, with some repeated entries.\n\nWait, I should clarify that the table has a lot of rows, but perhaps it's better to list them out systematically. Let me try to identify each occurrence where the first leg score is 0-1 and the club is either Celtic or AC Omonia.\n\nI'll start by looking for the phrase \"1st leg be 0 - 1\" in each row:\n\nLooking through each row, I need to check if any of them have a club named Celtic with a first leg score of 0-1. Similarly, I need to look for rows where AC Omonia is the club with a 0-1 first leg.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nRow 4: Club: Valencia, 1st leg: 0-1. Not relevant.\nRow 16: Club: Celtic, round: second qualifying round, score: 0-1. Bingo! This matches the first part of the claim.\nRow 28: Club: Rubin Kazan, group stages, 0-3. Not relevant.\nRow 34: Club: Ekranas, second qualifying round, 0-0. Not relevant.\n\nWait, let me check again. I might have missed some rows. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has details like club name, competition, round, and first leg score. So, for each row, I'll extract these fields.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Row 4: Club: Valencia, Competition: uefa europa league, Round: group stages, First Leg Score: 0-3.\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me check the exact data:\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parse each row as follows:\n\nLooking at rows 1 through 34:\n\nRow 4: season: (unknown), competition: uefa champions league? Wait, looking back, the table seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for any occurrence where club is Celtic with first leg score 0-1.\n\nFrom the data provided, in row 16: \"season: 2011 - 12, competition: uefa champions league, round: second qualifying round, club: fc flora tallinn, 1st leg: 1 - 0.\" So that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misnumbering. Let me recount the rows properly:\n\nThe table starts at row 0? Or does it start at row 1? The user provided the data as a list from row 0 to row 34. Wait, no, in the initial problem statement, it's numbered as row 1 to row 30-something, but the exact structure isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the specific clubs mentioned:\n\n- Looking for any rows where Club is Celtic and First Leg Score is 0-1.\n\nIn row 16: \"season: 2011 - 12, competition: uefa champions league, round: second qualifying round, club: fc flora tallinn, 1st leg: 1 - 0.\" So no, that's a different club with a 1-0 score.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all rows where the first leg score is 0-1 and see if any of those clubs are Celtic or AC Omonia.\n\nSo, going through each row:\n\nRow 4: Club: Valencia, Score: 0-1. Not relevant.\nRow 16: FC Flora Tallinn, 1-0. No.\nRow 24: Juventus FC, 0-1. Club is Juventus, not Celtic or AC Omonia.\nRow 25: FC Flora Tallinn, 1-0. No.\nRow 26: FC Copenhagen, 0-1. Club is Copenhagen, not relevant.\nRow 27: FK Partizan, 1-1. No.\nRow 28: Rubin Kazan, 0-3. No.\nRow 29: Tottenham Hotspur, 1-3. No.\nRow 30: PAOK FC, 1-2. No.\nRow 31: PAOK FC, 1-3. No.\nRow 32: Rubin Kazan, 1-4. No.\nRow 33: Tottenham Hotspur, 0-4. No.\nRow 34: FK Ekranas, 0-0. No.\n\nWait, that's only up to row 34, but the user might have provided more rows beyond that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, looking for AC Omonia with first leg score 0-1:\n\nLooking through the rows again, I need to find any where the club is AC Omonia and first leg score is 0-1.\n\nFrom the table, in row 16: Club: FC Flora Tallinn. Not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all occurrences where the first leg score is 0-1:\n\nLooking for \"0 - 1\" in each row's first leg score:\n\nRow 4: 0 - 3. No.\nRow ... Wait, perhaps I need to count again.\n\nWait, let me try to parse each row properly:\n\nI think it's best to list the rows where the first leg score is 0-1 and see if any of those are for Celtic or AC Omonia.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 4: Club: Valencia, 1st leg score: 0 - 3. Not relevant.\n- ... Continue until I find a match.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to search for \"club: celtic\" and see if any have first leg score of 0-1.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 16: Club: FC Flora Tallinn.

Each row has multiple fields, but it's better to extract them clearly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in numbering the rows, and it's better to look for exact matches.\n\nIn any case, based on the initial scan:\n\n- There's at least one row where the club is FC Flora Tallinn with first leg score 1-0 (row 16).\n- Row 26: Club: FC Copenhagen, first leg score 0-1. Not relevant.\n- Looking for AC Omonia: I don't see any rows where the club is AC Omonia.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that there's at least one match where a club (FC Flora Tallinn) had a first leg score of 0-1 against Celtic, but not necessarily. Wait, no\u2014row 16 is about FC Flora Tallinn vs someone with a 1-0 score. Not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe user's task is to determine if there exists at least one instance where the first leg score was 0-1 and the club involved is either Celtic or AC Omonia.\n\nFrom the table provided:\n\nLooking for \"club: celtic\" with first leg score 0-1:\n\nNo, I don't see any such row. The closest is row 26 where Club: FC Copenhagen scored 0-1 against someone, but that's not Celtic.\n\nSimilarly, looking for \"club: a.c. omonia\" or simply \"omonia\" with first leg score 0-1: I don't see any such rows.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, it seems there are no matches where either Celtic or AC Omonia had a first leg score of 0-1.\n\nHowever, in row 16, the club is FC Flora Tallinn with a 1-0 score against someone (probably not Celtic), but that's irrelevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for any occurrence where first leg score is 0-1 and club is either celtic or omonia.\n\nFrom the table provided up to row 34, I don't see such an instance.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there are no such matches in the data provided.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully examining each row of the provided data, it becomes evident that there are no instances where either Celtic or AC Omonia had a first leg score of 0-1.

That means one team did score more than 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's a team (G\u00f3rnik Zabrze) that scored 7 goals in the first leg of the 1994-95 season.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if any team scored more than 6 goals in the first leg during the 1994-95 season.\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: Only Row 18 matches the season 1994-95.\n2. **Check goals scored**: In Row 18, G\u00f3rnik Zabrze scored 7 goals.\n\nSince a team scored more than 6 goals in the first leg, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"in 2003 at the uefa intertoto cup the first and second round be tie in the first leg.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for entries related to the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2003. Scanning through the rows, I notice that rows 21, 22, and 23 mention the UEFA Intertoto Cup.\n\nLooking at row 21: season is 2003, competition is UEFA Intertoto Cup, round is first round, club is Odra Wodzis\u0142aw, score is 2-1. This doesn't directly relate to a tie in either the first or second round.\n\nRow 22: same competition and year, but it's the second round for club Slovan Liberec with a score of 0-2. No mention of a tie here.\n\nRow 23: Also in 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup, but this time in the third qualifying round? Wait, no, let me check again. Oh, row 23 says \"2010 - 11 uefa europa league,\" so that's a different year and competition.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me go back. Row 21: 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup, first round. Row 22: same competition, second round. So, rows 21 and 22 are for the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup, in different rounds. \n\nNow, checking if either of these rounds had a tie in the first leg. The claim mentions \"first and second round be tie in the first leg.\" So, both rounds would have ties in their respective first legs.\n\nLooking at row 21 (first round): Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs. Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv FC with a score of 2-1. That's not a tie. \n\nRow 22: Second round for Slovan Liberec, but the score is 0-2. Again, no tie.\n\nTherefore, there are no ties in either the first or second round of the 2003 UEFA Intertoto Cup according to the table provided. So, the claim's statement isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says, \"celtic and omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1.\" So my task is to check each relevant cell in the table to see if there's any instance where Celtic or Omonia had a first leg score of 0-1.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one and look for the clubs Celtic and Omonia. \n\nLooking at Row 16: season 1986-87, competition European Cup, round first round, club Celtic, 1st leg 0-1. That's a match where Celtic scored 0-1 in their first leg. So this directly contradicts the claim.\n\nAlso, checking for Omonia: In Row 17: season 1987-88, competition European Cup, round first round, club AC Omonia, 1st leg 0-1. Here again, Omonia had a first leg of 0-1 against Celtic if I'm not mistaken.\n\nWait, actually in Row 16, it's Celtic vs someone? Or is the opponent not specified here. Let me check: The table lists the club on each row as the one playing, so for Row 16, club is Celtic, score is 0-1. So that's a home game where they lost 0-1. Similarly, in Row 17, Omonia is the club with the same score.\n\nSo both Celtic and Omonia have at least one first leg of 0-1. Therefore, the claim is false because both clubs have such instances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
