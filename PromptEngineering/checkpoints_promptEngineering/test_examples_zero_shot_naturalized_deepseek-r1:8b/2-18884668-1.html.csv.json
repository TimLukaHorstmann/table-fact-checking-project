    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"bosone's cardinalatial order and title be cardinal - priest of s anastasia and be elevate circa 1116.\" So, breaking this down, I need to verify two things about bosone:\n\n1. His cardinalatial order and title are \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\"\n2. He was elevated (became a cardinal) around the year 1116.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different elector, so I should look for the row where the elector is bosone.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one until I find bosone.\n\nRow 1: Elector is kuno von urach. Not bosone.\nRow 2: Lamberto scannabecchi. Not bosone.\nRow 3: John of crema. No.\nRow 4: Guido galli. Nope.\nRow 5: Bosone. Yes, this must be the row.\n\nSo, bosone is in row 5. Now, let's check his details.\n\nIn row 5, the elector is bosone. Nationality is Italy. Cardinalatial order and title is \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" Elevated around 1116. Elevator is Paschal II.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are satisfied:\n\n- His cardinalatial title matches.\n- He was elevated around 1116.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant cells would be the row where bosone is listed and the specific columns for his title and elevation year.\n\nSo, looking at the structure of each row, the relevant columns are:\n\n- elector (to find the correct row)\n- cardinalatial order and title\n- elevated\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Row 5, column \"cardinalatial order and title\" because it confirms his title.\n2. Row 5, column \"elevated\" to check the year.\n\nWait, but in the claim, both parts need verification. So, I should include all cells that directly support either part of the claim.\n\nAlternatively, since each row has the necessary info, perhaps just noting the specific columns for cardinalatial title and elevation date is enough.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would be:\n\n- Row 5, column \"cardinalatial order and title\"\n- Row 5, column \"elevated\"\n\nThat's two cells. So, in JSON format, I need to list these as objects with row_index and column_name.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we checked the table for bosone's details and found that both parts of the claim are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim is: \"the pisa elector be elevate in 1117.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. \"Pisa elector\" refers to someone from Pisa who was an elector. An elector is someone who helps elect a pope, so they're probably cardinals.\n\nThe term \"elevate\" likely means when they were elevated to their position as cardinal. So I'm looking for a cardinal from Pisa who became a cardinal in 1117.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table row by row to find any with nationality \"Pisa.\" Scanning each row:\n\nRow 1: Germany\nRow 2: Fagnano\nRow 3: Crema\nRow 4: Italy\nRow 5: Italy\nRow 6: Rome\nRow 7: Rome\nRow 8: Rome\nRow 9: Pisa\nRow 10: Marsica\n\nSo Row 9 is from Pisa. Now, check the \"elevated\" year for this row. It says 1117. The claim is about being elevated in 1117, so that matches.\n\nNext, I need to make sure there's only one relevant cell. Since Row 9 is the only Pisa elector and their elevation year is 1117, that's the only relevant cell.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because this row fits all parts of the claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bosone's cardinalatial order and title is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the cardinalatial order and title of bosone be cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" So I'm looking for information about Bosone in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different elector. The key columns here are 'Elector', 'Nationality', 'Cardinalatial Order and Title', 'Elevated', and 'Elevator'. Since the claim is about the cardinalatial order and title, I should focus on that column specifically.\n\nNow, I'll scan each row to find Bosone. Let me go through them one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Elector is Kuno von Urach.\n- Row 2: Lamberto Scannabecchi.\n- Row 3: John of Crema.\n- Row 4: Guido Galli.\n- Row 5: Bosone. Okay, here we go.\n\nRow 5 has the elector as Bosone. Let's check his 'Cardinalatial Order and Title'. According to the table, it says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" That matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other entries for Bosone. There are 10 rows in total, and only Row 5 lists Bosone as the elector. So there's no duplication or another entry for Bosone that might contradict this.\n\nAlso, looking at the 'Elevated' column for Bosone: it says \"circa 1116.\" The claim doesn't mention anything about when he was elevated, just his title and order, so that part isn't relevant here. The same applies to the 'Elevator' field; since the claim is only about the title, I don't need to consider who elevated him unless the claim includes that information, which it doesn't.\n\nTherefore, all the data in Row 5 aligns perfectly with the claim made. There's no conflicting information elsewhere because Bosone appears only once and the details match.\n\nSo, after verifying each relevant part of the claim against the table, I can confidently say that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information provided in Row 5 of the table, where Bosone holds the title \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Cardinalatial Order and Title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the elector from Pisa was elevated in 1117 by Urban II (or Paschal II).\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table and see which ones are relevant. Let's go step by step.\n\nRow 1: Elector is Kuno von Urach from Germany. He was elevated around 1107 by Pascal II. Not relevant since he's not from Pisa and wasn't elevated in 1117.\n\nRow 2: Lamberto Scannabecchi from Fagnano, elevated in 1117 by Pascal II. Nationality isn't Pisa either. So nope.\n\nRow 3: John of Crema from Crema, elevated around 1117 by Pascal II. Not Pisa, so not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Guido Galli OSB from Italy, elevated around 1099 by Pascal II. Earlier than 1117, and nationality isn't Pisa.\n\nRow 5: Bosone from Italy, elevated around 1116 by Pascal II. Still not from Pisa or the right year.\n\nRow 6: Corrado de Surbura from Rome, elevated between 1111-1114 by Pascal II. Not Pisa.\n\nRow 7: Gregorio Papareschi from Rome, possibly elevated in 1088 or 1116. The claim mentions 1117, so not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Pietro Pierleoni from Rome, elevated around 1106-1116 by Pascal II. Not our guy.\n\nRow 9: Crisogono Malcondini from Pisa! His elevation year is listed as 1117. So this looks promising. He's the elector from Pisa and was elevated in 1117 by Paschal II, which matches the claim. \n\nWait, but the claim mentions Urban II or Pascal II. Looking at Row 9: his elevator is Paschal II, not Urban. But the claim allows for either Urban or Paschal. So this still fits.\n\nRow 10: Roscemanno Sanseverino from Marsica, elevated around 1106 by Pascal II. Not relevant.\n\nSo, only Row 9 matches the claim. The elector is Crisogono Malcondini from Pisa, elevated in 1117 by Paschal II. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"elector\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a specific claim about an elector is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the elector bosone be from rome and receive the cardinalatial order and title of the cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim to verify it against the table. Let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. **Nationality**: The claim states that Bosone is from Rome.\n2. **Cardinalatial Order and Title**: It says he received the title of Cardinal - Priest of S. Anastasia.\n\nI need to check both these aspects in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an elector with various details like nationality, cardinalatial order and title, the year they were elevated, and who the elevator (the pope who made them a cardinal) was. \n\nLet me go through each row until I find Bosone's entry.\n\n- **Row 1**: Elector is Kuno von Urach from Germany.\n- **Row 2**: Lamberto Scannabecchi from Fagnano.\n- **Row 3**: John of Crema from Crema.\n- **Row 4**: Guido Galli from Italy.\n- **Row 5**: Bosone from Italy. Wait, the claim says he's from Rome, but here it's listed as Italy. Hmm, that might be a discrepancy.\n\nBut before I jump to conclusions, let me check if there's another Bosone. Let's continue:\n\n- **Row 6**: Corrado de Surbura from Rome.\n- **Row 7**: Gregorio Papareschi from Rome.\n- **Row 8**: Pietro Pierleoni from Rome.\n- **Row 9**: Crisogono Malcondini from Pisa.\n- **Row 10**: Roscemanne Sanseverino from Marsica.\n\nWait, I only see one Bosone in Row 5. So the claim says he's from Rome, but according to the table, his nationality is Italy. That could mean the claim is false because it states \"from Rome\" instead of \"Italy.\"\n\nNext, checking the cardinalatial title. In Row 5, Bosone's title is \"cardinal - priest of S. Anastasia.\" The claim matches this exactly.\n\nSo the nationality part seems to be incorrect because the table lists Italy, not Rome. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Bosone is from Rome while the table lists his nationality as Italy. His cardinalatial title aligns with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"the cardinal - priest of s anastasia be the cardinal order and title that be elevated earlier than 1116.\" So, I need to check if there's a cardinal with the title \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\" whose elevation year is before 1116.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an elector with various details. I need to focus on the relevant columns: 'cardinalatial order and title' and 'elevated'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find any that match both criteria.\n\nRow 1: Elector is kuno von urach, nationality Germany. His title is cardinal - bishop of palestrina, elevated around 1107. So, his elevation is before 1116 but he's a bishop, not a priest. Since the claim refers to a \"cardinal - priest\", this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 2: Lamberto scannabecchi, nationality Fagnano. His title is cardinal - bishop of ostia and velletri, elevated in 1117. Again, a bishop, not a priest, so not relevant here.\n\nRow 3: John of crema, nationality Crema. Title is cardinal - priest of S Crisogono, elevated around 1117. This is a priest, but his elevation year is 1117, which is after 1116. So, it's after the cutoff mentioned in the claim, so doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: Guido galli, Italy. Title is cardinal - priest of S Balbina, elevated around 1099. This is a priest and his elevation is before 1116 (around 1099). This seems relevant because it meets both conditions: being a cardinal-priest and elevated earlier than 1116.\n\nWait, but the claim refers specifically to \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" So I need to check if any row has that exact title. Let's continue scanning.\n\nRow 5: Bosone, Italy. Title is cardinal - priest of S Anastasia, elevated around 1116. The elevation year is 1116, which is the cutoff. The claim says \"earlier than 1116,\" so 1116 doesn't count as earlier\u2014it's equal to the cutoff. So this might not fit because it's exactly 1116.\n\nRow 6: Corrado de suburra, Rome. Title is cardinal - priest of S Pudenziana, elevated between 1111-1114. So this is a priest, and his elevation is before 1116. But again, the title isn't S Anastasia.\n\nRow 7: Gregorio papareschi, Rome. Title is cardinal - deacon of S Angelo in Pescheria. Deacon, not priest, so doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8: Pietro pierleoni, Rome. Title is cardinal - deacon of SS Cosma e Damiano. Again, a deacon, not a priest.\n\nRow 9: Crisogono malcondini, Pisa. Title is cardinal - deacon of S Nicola in Carcere. Deacon again, so no.\n\nRow 10: Roscemanno sanseverino, Marsica. Title is cardinal - deacon of S Giorgio in Velabro. Deacon, not priest.\n\nWait, so from the table, only rows where the elector is a cardinal-priest and their elevation is before 1116 would be relevant. Let me list all such cases:\n\nRow 4: Guido galli, elevated ~1099 \u2013 yes.\nRow 5: Bosone, elevated ~1116 \u2013 equal to cutoff, so no.\nRow 3: John of Crema, elevated ~1117 \u2013 too late.\n\nSo, only Row 4 matches both conditions: being a cardinal-priest and elevated before 1116. However, the claim specifically mentions \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia.\" In the table, does any row have that exact title? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Bishop\n- Row 2: Bishop\n- Row 3: Priest\n- Row 4: Priest (S Balbina)\n- Row 5: Priest (S Anastasia)\n- Rows 6-10: Deacons.\n\nSo, the only cardinal-priests with specific titles are in rows 3,4,5. The claim mentions \"s anastasia,\" which is exactly what row 5 has. However, row 5's elevation is ~1116, which is not earlier than 1116\u2014it's equal to it.\n\nSo, does the claim consider 1116 as \"earlier\"? Probably not; earlier would mean before, so 1116 is not earlier but at the same time. Therefore, row 5 doesn't meet both conditions because although the title matches, the elevation year isn't before 1116.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the claim again: \"the cardinal - priest of s anastasia be the cardinal order and title that be elevate earlier than 1116.\" So it's asserting that this specific title was elevated before 1116.\n\nLooking at row 5: Bosone is a cardinal-priest of S Anastasia, elevated around 1116. Since 1116 isn't earlier, this doesn't support the claim.\n\nSo, in the table, is there any other cardinal-priest of S Anastasia? No, it seems only row 5 has that title.\n\nTherefore, there's no cardinal-priest of S Anastasia elevated before 1116. The closest is row 4, but he's of a different title. So the claim is false because there's no such cardinal meeting both criteria.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Let's see each row again:\n\nRow 1: Cardinal-Bishop\nRow 2: Cardinal-Bishop\nRow 3: Cardinal-Priest (S Crisogono), elevated ~1117\nRow 4: Cardinal-Priest (S Balbina), ~1099\nRow 5: Cardinal-Priest (S Anastasia), ~1116\nRows 6-10: Deacons.\n\nSo, only rows 3,4,5 are priests. Among these:\n\n- Row 3: S Crisogono, 1117\n- Row 4: S Balbina, 1099\n- Row 5: S Anastasia, 1116\n\nThe claim says \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia,\" which is row 5. But its elevation is in 1116, not earlier. So the claim's assertion that it was elevated before 1116 is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, the claim might be implying that this specific title was used before 1116 by a cardinal-priest. Since none of them (before row 5) have S Anastasia, and row 5 doesn't meet the earlier condition, the statement in the claim isn't true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there's no such cardinal-priest of S Anastasia who was elevated before 1116. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining whether a specific Cardinal-Priest (of the title \"S Anastasia\") was elevated to their position before the year 1116. After analyzing the provided data:\n\n- **Key Findings**:\n  - Only one Cardinal-Priest with the title \"S Anastasia\" is present in the records: Bosone, who was elevated around 1116.\n  - Since 1116 is not earlier than itself, this does not meet the criterion of being elevated before 1116.\n\n- **Conclusion**: No Cardinal-Priest holding the title \"S Anastasia\" was elevated before 1116. Therefore, the claim as stated is **false**.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

The claim is: \"paschal ii be the elevator for the elector from cream circa 1106.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two main things:\n1. The elevator (the one who elevated someone to a cardinal) is Paschal II.\n2. The elector in question comes from Cream and was elevated around 1106.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's an elector named from Cream who was elevated around 1106 with Paschal II as the elevator.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an elector with several details: their name, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, the year they were elevated, and who did the elevating (elevator).\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match these criteria.\n\nRow 1: Elector is Kuno von Urach from Germany. Elevated around 1107 by Paschal II. Doesn't match Cream or 1106.\n\nRow 2: Lamberto Scannabecchi from Fagnano. Elevated in 1117 by Paschal II. Not from Cream and not 1106.\n\nRow 3: John of Crema, nationality Crema. Elevated around 1117 by Paschal II. So, he's from Crema but elevated in 1117, not 1106.\n\nRow 4: Guido Galli OSB from Italy. Elevated around 1099 by Paschal II. Doesn't match Cream or 1106.\n\nRow 5: Bosone from Italy. Elevated around 1116 by Paschal II. Not from Crema and not 1106.\n\nRow 6: Corrado de Surbura from Rome. Elevated between 1111-1114 by Paschal II. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 7: Gregorio Papareschi from Rome. Elevated around 1088 or 1116, with Urban II or Paschal II as elevator. Doesn't match Cream.\n\nRow 8: Pietro Pierleoni from Rome. Elevated between 1106-1116 by Paschal II. So, this one is from Rome, not Cream, but the elevation period includes 1106.

Not relevant.\n\nRow 10: Roscemanno SansEVERINO OSBCAS from Marsica. Elevated around 1106 by Paschal II. Again, nationality is Marsica, not Cream.\n\nWait a second, so none of the rows directly mention an elector from Cream (Crema) being elevated around 1106 by Paschal II. Let me double-check each row again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking specifically for \"cream\" or \"crema\" in the nationality column: Only Row 3 has John of Crema as nationality. His elevation is around 1117, not 1106. So there's no elector from Cream elevated in 1106 by Paschal II.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because there's no such record in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Paschal II was the elevator for an elector from Crema around 1106.
