    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"joel houston compose 4 of the song on the album con todo.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table and see if Joel Houston is listed as a composer for four songs in the album called \"con todo.\" But wait, looking at the table, I don't see an album column that says \"con todo.\" Let me check again. The original albums are names like \"this is our god,\" \"saviour king,\" etc., but none mention \"con todo.\" So maybe the claim is about a specific album, and perhaps it's supposed to be \"con todo\" or another Spanish term I'm not getting correctly.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to see if Joel Houston is the composer of any songs. Let me list out the rows where Joel Houston is mentioned as a composer:\n\nRow 1: Composer is Joel Houston.\nRow 4: Composer is Joel Houston.\nRow 5: Composer is Brooke Fraser.\nWait, no, Row 5's original album is \"this is our god,\" and the composer is Brooke Fraser. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each row again:\n\nRow 1: Composer - Joel Houston\nRow 2: Composer - Joel Houston\nRow 3: Composer - Brooke Fraser\nRow 4: Composer - Joel Houston\nRow 5: Composer - Brooke Fraser\nRow 6: Composer - Darlene Zschech & Reuben Morgan\nRow 7: Composer - Marty Sampson & Mia Fields\nRow 8: Composer - Reuben Morgan & Ben Fielding\nRow 9: Composer - Joel Houston, Matt Crocker & Scott Ligertwood\nRow 10: Composer - Reuben Morgan & Ben Fielding\nRow 11: Composer - Brooke Fraser\nRow 12: Composer - Reuben Morgan\nRow 13: Composer - Reuben Morgan\n\nSo, how many times does Joel Houston compose a song? Let's count:\n\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: Yes (Wait, Row 2's original album is \"this is our god,\" and the composer is Joel Houston. So that's two so far.\nRow 4: Yes, that's three.\nRow 9: Yes, because it includes Joel Houston as a composer alongside others. So that's four.\n\nSo in total, Joel Houston is the composer for four songs: rows 1,2,4, and 9. Wait, but I thought Row 5 was Brooke Fraser, so that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"joel houston compose 4 of the song on the album con todo.\" Now, looking back at the table, none of the original albums are \"con todo.\" The closest is \"unidos permanecemos\" in Row 4 and Row 11. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check again. Each row has Unnamed:0, song name, english translation, original album, composer(s), etc. So the original album is \"con todo\"? No, none of them say that. The albums listed are \"this is our god,\" \"saviour king,\" \"unidos permanecemos,\" \"might to save.\" So perhaps the claim has a typo or mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"con todo\" refers to the number of songs Joel Houston composed across multiple albums. But the claim says \"on the album con todo,\" implying it's a single album. Since there's no such album in the table, that would make the claim false.\n\nWait, but if the claim is about multiple albums and four songs in total, then since Joel has composed four songs (rows 1,2,4,9), maybe the answer is TRUE because he composed four songs listed in the table, even though \"con todo\" isn't an album name. But I think the key point is that the claim specifies \"on the album con todo,\" which doesn't exist here.\n\nSo, since there's no album called \"con todo,\" the claim's premise is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to an album named \"con todo,\" which does not appear in any row of the table. While Joel Houston composed four songs (rows 1,2,4,9), the original albums for these songs are different from \"con todo.\" Therefore, the claim is based on incorrect information.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Darlene Zschech be the only support vocalist for the album con todo.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The main point is whether Darlene Zschech is the sole support vocalist for the album called \"con todo.\" Looking at the table, I see that it lists various songs with their details, including the original albums and supporting vocalists.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check if there's an album named \"con todo\" where Darlene Zschech is listed as the only support vocalist. Let me scan each row:\n\nRow 1: Album is \"this is our god.\" No match.\nRow 2: Same album, no.\nRow 3: \"Saviour king,\" nope.\nRow 4: \"Unidos permanecemos,\" not matching.\nRow 5: Again, \"this is our god.\"\nRow 6: \"Mighty to save,\" no.\nRow 7: \"Saviour king.\"\nRow 8: \"Mighty to save\" again.\nRow 9: Back to \"Saviour king.\"\nRow 10: \"This is our god.\"\nRow 11: \"Unidos permanecemos.\"\nRow 12: \"This is our god.\" \nRow 13: \"Saviour king.\"\n\nWait, I don't see any row where the album is \"con todo.\" That means the album in question isn't present in the table. So there's no data to confirm whether Darlene Zschech is or isn't the sole support vocalist for that album because it doesn't exist in the table.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check if \"con todo\" is another name for any of these albums? Let me think: \"con todo\" translates to \"all together,\" but looking at the original albums listed, none match that exact title. So it's a different album not included here.\n\nSince there's no row for \"con todo,\" the claim can't be verified as true from the information provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is about Darlene Zschech being the sole support vocalist for an album named \"con todo.\" However, upon reviewing the table, there's no entry for \"con todo\" as an original album. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"7 of the 13 songs on 'con todo' be over 5 minutes in length.\" First, I should figure out what exactly needs to be verified here.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song with various details like the original album, composer, duration, etc. The key here is the \"duration\" column because it directly relates to the claim about song lengths. The claim specifies that 7 out of 13 songs have durations over 5 minutes. \n\nSo, my task is to go through each row of the table and check the duration for each of the 13 songs to see if at least 7 have a duration exceeding 5 minutes.\n\nLet me start by listing all the songs with their respective durations:\n\n1. Row 0: 4:02 \u2192 4 minutes, which is less than 5.\n2. Row 1: 3:22 \u2192 Under 5.\n3. Row 2: 6:08 \u2192 Over 5.\n4. Row 3: 6:13 \u2192 Over 5.\n5. Row 4: 6:16 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back at the table, row 4's duration is 6:13? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the table shows row 4 as duration: 6:13. So that's correct.\nRow 5: 4:16 \u2192 Under 5.\nRow 6: 6:20 \u2192 Over 5.\nRow 7: 8:02 \u2192 Over 5.\nRow 8: 5:34 \u2192 5 minutes and 34 seconds, which is over 5 min.\nRow 9: 3:59 \u2192 Under 5.\nRow 10: 4:37 \u2192 Just under 5 minutes? Wait, 4:37 is less than 5? No, wait, 4:37 is actually 4 minutes and 37 seconds, so it's still under 5. Hmm, no, the claim says over 5 minutes, so 4:37 is under.\nRow 11: 7:07 \u2192 Over 5.\nRow 12: 6:10 \u2192 Over 5.\nRow 13: 4:53 \u2192 Under 5.\n\nNow, let's count how many are over 5 minutes:\n\nRows with duration over 5:\n- Row 2: 6:08\n- Row 3: 6:13\n- Row 4: 6:16? Wait, no, row 4 is 6:13. So correct.\nWait, the user's table shows row 4 as 6:13, so that's over.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 4: Yes\nRow 6: Yes\nRow 7: Yes\nRow 8: 5:34 \u2192 5 minutes and 34 seconds. Is this considered over? The claim is about being \"over 5 minute in length.\" So, technically, 5:34 is more than 5 minutes, so yes.\nRow 11: Yes\nRow 12: Yes\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRows where duration > 5 min:\n\n- Row 2: 6:08 \u2192 Yes (1)\n- Row 3: 6:13 \u2192 Yes (2)\n- Row 4: 6:16? No, the table says row 4 is 6:13. So that's correct.\nWait, no, in my earlier list, row 4 was 6:13, so that's correct.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 6: 6:20 \u2192 Yes (3)\nRow 7: 8:02 \u2192 Yes (4)\nRow 8: 5:34 \u2192 Yes (5)\nRow 11: 7:07 \u2192 Yes (6)\nRow 12: 6:10 \u2192 Yes (7)\n\nSo that's 7 rows where duration is over 5 minutes. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any or count incorrectly.\n\nRows:\n\n2:6:08 \u2192 yes\n3:6:13 \u2192 yes\n4:6:16? No, in the table it's row 4:6:13 \u2192 yes\n6:6:20 \u2192 yes\n7:8:02 \u2192 yes\n8:5:34 \u2192 yes\n11:7:07 \u2192 yes\n12:6:10 \u2192 yes\n\nThat's 7 rows.

It's saying that there are five songs in the list where their information comes from the original album titled \"This Is Our God\".

Let's list out all the worship leaders mentioned:\n\n- Row 1: Joel Houston\n- Row 2: Toni Romero\n- Row 3: Darlene Zschech\n- Row 4: Jad Gillies\n- Row 5: Annie Garratt\n- Row 6: Darlene Zschech\n- Row 7: Dave Ware\n- Row 8: Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech\n- Row 9: Matt Crocker\n- Row 10: Jad Gillies\n- Row 11: Brooke Fraser\n- Row 12: Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech\n- Row 13: Reuben Morgan\n\nNow, let's identify which worship leaders appear more than once.\n\nStarting with Reuben Morgan:\n\n- Row 8: Reuben Morgan is listed.\n- Row 12: Reuben Morgan is also here.\n- Row 13: Again, Reuben Morgan.\n\nSo, Reuben appears in at least three songs (Rows 8, 12, 13). That means he features on multiple songs.\n\nNext, Darlene Zschech:\n\n- Row 3: She's the worship leader.\n- Row 6: Another appearance.\n- Row 8: Mentioned alongside Reuben Morgan.\n- Row 12: Again with Reuben.\n\nSo, Darlene appears in four different songs (Rows 3, 6, 8, 12). Definitely multiple times.\n\nNow, checking if any other worship leaders appear more than once:\n\nLooking at the list, Joel Houston is only in Row 1. Toni Romero only in Row 2. Jad Gillies is in Rows 4 and 10, so that's two songs. Annie Garratt only in Row 5. Matt Crocker only in Row 9. Dave Ware only in Row 7. Brooke Fraser only in Row 11.\n\nSo, the only other worship leader appearing multiple times is Jad Gillies, appearing twice (Rows 4 and 10). Therefore, Reuben and Darlene are not the only ones; Jad also features on multiple songs.\n\nThis means the claim is false because there's another worship leader besides them who appears more than once.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech be the only worship leader who feature on multiple songs\" is false.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"joel houston compose 5 of the song on the album con todo.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"Con todo\" translates to \"all together,\" but in the context of an album, it might refer to a compilation or a specific collection of songs. The claim is stating that Joel Houston composed 5 songs from the album \"con todo.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several rows with information about each song. Each row has details like the song title, English translation, original album, composer, worship leader, supporting vocal, and duration.\n\nI need to find out how many songs on the album \"con todo\" (if that's even mentioned in the table) were composed by Joel Houston. Wait, scanning through the table, I notice the original albums vary: some are \"this is our god,\" others are \"saviour king,\" \"unidos permanecemos,\" and \"mighty to save.\" I don't see any row where the original album is \"con todo.\" That might be a problem because if the album doesn't exist in the table, then Joel can't have composed songs from it.\n\nBut perhaps \"con todo\" refers to an album that's not explicitly listed here. Maybe it's another compilation or a different collection. However, based solely on the given table, there is no row with original album \"con todo.\" Therefore, it's unclear if such an album exists in this dataset.\n\nAssuming that \"con todo\" is part of this table but just not mentioned, I should check for any rows where Joel Houston is listed as the composer. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Composer is Joel Houston\nRow 2: Composer is Joel Houston\nRow 3: Composer is Brooke Fraser\nRow 4: Composer is Joel Houston\nRow 5: Composer is Brooke Fraser\nRow 6: Composer is Darlene Zschech & Reuben Morgan\nRow 7: Composer is Marty Sampson & Mia Fields\nRow 8: Composer is Reuben Morgan & Ben Fielding\nRow 9: Composer is Joel Houston, Matt Crocker & Scott Ligertwood\nRow 10: Composer is Reuben Morgan & Ben Fielding\nRow 11: Composer is Brooke Fraser\nRow 12: Composer is Reuben Morgan\nRow 13: Composer is Reuben Morgan\n\nNow, count how many times Joel Houston is the sole or one of the composers:\n\n- Row 1: Yes (Joel only)\n- Row 2: Yes (Joel only)\n- Row 4: Yes (Joel only)\n- Row 9: Yes (Joel along with others)\n\nThat's four instances where Joel composed a song. But the claim says he composed five songs on the album \"con todo.\" Since there are no rows for \"con todo,\" and based solely on this table, Joel Houston doesn't have five songs in any single album listed here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check: does the original album \"this is our god\" have multiple Joel Houston compositions? Yes, rows 1,2,4,5,10 all have original album as \"this is our god.\" So how many of these are composed by Joel?\n\nLooking at those:\n\nRow 1: Joel\nRow 2: Joel\nRow 4: Joel\nRow 5: Brooke Fraser\nRow 10: Reuben Morgan & Ben Fielding\n\nSo in \"this is our god,\" Joel has three compositions. Then, row 9's original album is \"saviour king,\" and Joel is a composer there as well.\n\nIf the claim refers to all albums where Joel composed songs, it would be more than five. But the wording says \"on the album con todo,\" implying a specific album.\n\nSince \"con todo\" isn't in the table, there's no data to support that Joel composed five songs on that album. Therefore, the claim is likely FALSE because either the album doesn't exist here or Joel didn't compose five songs on it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Joel Houston composed 5 songs on the album \"con todo.\" However, upon examining the table, there's no row indicating an original album named \"con todo.\" Additionally, while Joel Houston does compose several songs in different albums listed (like \"this is our god\" and \"saviour king\"), he doesn't have five compositions in any single album from the provided data.

Each row seems to represent a different song from an album, with various attributes like original album, composer, worship leader, supporting vocal, etc. The key here is to find any cells related to Reuben Morgan as a support vocalist in the specific album \"con todo.\"\n\nWait, but looking through the table, I don't see any mention of \"con todo\" as an album name. All the original albums listed are \"this is our god,\" \"saviour king,\" \"unidos permanecemos,\" and \"mighty to save.\" There's no row that says the album is \"con todo.\" So maybe that's a red flag.\n\nBut let me not jump to conclusions yet. The claim mentions Reuben Morgan being the only support vocalist for \"con todo.\" So I need to check if any song in \"con todo\" has Reuben Morgan as the supporting vocalist and that he's the only one.\n\nSince \"con todo\" isn't listed in the table, perhaps it's a hypothetical album or maybe it's a mistake. Let me check all rows again for any mention of \"con todo.\" Nope, none of them. So if the album doesn't exist in the table, then Reuben can't be its support vocalist because there are no songs from that album.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the term. Is \"con todo\" a real album, or is it a translation? The original albums listed in Spanish, like \"unidos permanecemos,\" which translates to \"we remain united.\" So perhaps \"con todo\" isn't an album name here. Therefore, Reuben can't be the support vocalist for any song under that album because such a collection doesn't exist.\n\nAlso, looking at the supporting vocal column, in all the rows provided, supporting vocal is either 'none' or sometimes includes another person like Darlene Zschech. I don't see any row where Reuben Morgan is listed as the support vocalist. So even if \"con todo\" were an album, he isn't listed there.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the claim refers to a specific song within one of the existing albums that's part of \"con todo.\" But again, since the album isn't in the table, it doesn't make sense. Also, Reuben is involved in some original albums like \"mighty to save,\" but not as a support vocalist; he's usually the worship leader or composer.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, the claim seems false because there's no evidence of an album named \"con todo\" and Reuben Morgan isn't listed as a support vocalist for any song. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"7 of the 13 songs on 'con todo be over 7 minutes in length.\" Hmm, first off, I should check if there's a table provided that lists all these songs with their durations. Yes, looking at the table, each row represents a song with details like song name, original album, composer, worship leader, etc., and importantly, the duration.\n\nNow, to verify this claim, I need to count how many songs have a duration over 7 minutes. Each row has an \"duration\" column, so I'll go through each one by one and note which ones are longer than 7 minutes.\n\nLet me list out all the durations:\n\nRow 1: 4:02\nRow 2: 3:22\nRow 3: 6:08\nRow 4: 6:13\nRow 5: 4:16\nRow 6: 6:20\nRow 7: 8:02\nRow 8: 5:34\nRow 9: 3:59\nRow 10: 4:37\nRow 11: 7:07\nRow 12: 6:10\nRow 13: 4:53\n\nNow, comparing each duration to 7 minutes. Remember that \"over 7 minutes\" means more than 7:00.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Rows 1,2,5,9,10,13: All have durations under 7 minutes.\n- Row 3: 6:08 is just under 7.\n- Row 4: 6:13 is also under 7.\n- Row 6: 6:20 is still under 7.\n- Row 8: 5:34, definitely under.\n- Row 11: 7:07. Wait, exactly 7 minutes and 7 seconds. The claim says \"over 7 minutes,\" so does that include exactly 7? I think \"over\" usually means more than, so 7:07 would not be over 7 minutes; it's equal. So maybe Row 11 is at the cutoff.\n- Row 7: 8:02 is definitely over 7 minutes.\n- Row 12: 6:10 is under.\n\nSo from the list above, only Row 7 has a duration over 7 minutes (8:02). That's just one song. The claim says seven songs are over seven minutes, but I'm counting only one. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me double-check:\n\nRow 11 is exactly 7:07. If \"over\" includes equal to or more than 7 minutes, then Row 11 would add another, making it two songs. But usually, over implies strictly greater than. So only Row 7 is definitely over.\n\nThus, the claim that seven songs are over seven minutes in length is incorrect because there's only one song (Row 7) meeting that criterion.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check each row of the table for a duration exceeding 7 minutes. Only one song (\"rey salvador\" at Row 7) meets this criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"duration\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"only 1 of the songs on con todo come from an original album called this is our god.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what \"con todo\" refers to. Looking at the table, it seems like each row represents a song with various attributes like song name, translation, original album, composer, etc. So \"con todo\" might be referring to all the songs listed in the table.\n\nThe claim is specifically about how many of these songs come from an original album named \"this is our god.\" I need to check each row and count how many have their \"original album\" field as \"this is our god.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: original album is \"this is our god\"\nRow 2: same\nRow 4: no, it's \"unidos permanecemos\"\nRow 5: yes\nRow 6: no, it's \"mighty to save\"\nRow 7: no, it's \"saviour king\"\nRow 8: no, it's \"mighty to save\"\nRow 9: no, it's \"saviour king\"\nRow 10: yes\nRow 11: no, it's \"unidos permanecemos\"\nRow 12: yes\nRow 13: no, it's \"saviour king\"\n\nSo rows 1,2,5,10,12 have their original album as \"this is our god.\" That's five songs. The claim says only 1 comes from that album, so the statement is false.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells. Each row where the song's original album is \"this is our god\" would be relevant because each of these contributes to the count.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a certain claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has information about songs from an album, including details like the song name, English translation, original album, composer, worship leader, supporting vocal, and duration.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillie, and Darlene Zschech be the only worship leaders featured on multiple songs.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. The claim is stating that these three individuals are the sole worship leaders who appear in more than one song. So, my goal is to check each of their names against all the rows in the table and see if they each have at least two entries as worship leaders.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the relevant columns from the table. Each row has a \"Unnamed: 0\" which seems to be an index, but I think that's just for identification. The key column here is \"worship leader,\" so I should focus on that.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row and note down the worship leaders:\n\nRow 1: Joel Houston\nRow 2: Toni Romero\nRow 3: Darlene Zschech\nRow 4: Jad Gillies\nRow 5: Annie Garratt\nRow 6: Darlene Zschech\nRow 7: Dave Ware\nRow 8: Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech\nRow 9: Matt Crocker\nRow 10: Jad Gillies\nRow 11: Brooke Fraser\nRow 12: Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech\nRow 13: Reuben Morgan\n\nNow, let's identify which worship leaders are mentioned more than once. \n\nStarting with Reuben Morgan:\n- Row 8: Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech (so Reuben is here)\n- Row 12: Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech\n- Row 13: Reuben Morgan\n\nSo Reuben appears in rows 8, 12, and 13. That's three times.\n\nNext, Jad Gillies:\n- Row 4: Jad Gullies\n- Row 10: Jad Gillies\nSo that's two times.\n\nNow Darlene Zschech:\n- Row 3: Darlene Zschech\n- Row 6: Darlene Zschech\n- Row 8: Darlene Zschech and Reuben Morgan (so she's here)\n- Row 12: Darlene Zschech and Reuben Morgan\n\nThat makes four appearances.\n\nNow, the claim says \"Reuben Morgan, Jad Gille, and Darlene Zschech be the only worship leader who be feature on multiple songs.\" Wait, in the original claim, I think it's a typo for \"Jad Gille\" instead of \"Gillie.\" But looking at the table, Jad Gillies is spelled as such. So maybe the claim intended to refer to Jad Gillies.\n\nBut in any case, let's check if there are other worship leaders who appear multiple times.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Joel Houston: appears in rows 1 and possibly others? Let me check. Row 1: Joel Houston, Row 4: Jad Gullies, so no, Joel only once.\n- Toni Romero: only row 2.\n- Darlene Zschech: as above, four times.\n- Jad Gillies: twice.\n- Annie Garratt: once.\n- Dave Ware: once.\n- Matt Crocker: once.\n- Brooke Fraser: once.\n- Reuben Morgan: three times.\n\nWait, I also need to check if any other worship leaders are featured more than once. From the list above, only Darlene Zschech and Jad Gillies have multiple entries. So if the claim says \"Reuben Morgan, Jad Gille, and Darlene Zschech\" are the only ones with multiple features, that's not accurate because Darlene is definitely appearing more than once, but wait\u2014no, actually, I think I miscounted.\n\nWait no, Reuben appears three times, Jad twice, Darlene four times. So they all have multiple appearances.\n\nBut are there any others? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\nRow 1: Joel\nRow 2: Toni\nRow 3: Darlene\nRow 4: Jad\nRow 5: Annie\nRow 6: Darlene\nRow 7: Dave\nRow 8: Reuben and Darlene\nRow 9: Matt\nRow 10: Jad\nRow 11: Brooke\nRow 12: Reuben and Darlene\nRow 13: Reuben\n\nSo, besides the three mentioned (Reuben, Jad, Darlene), are there any others? Let me see:\n\n- In row 8 and 12, it's Reuben and Darlene. So no one else there.\n- Row 3,6: only Darlene\n- Rows 4,10: Jad\n- Row 13: Reuben\n\nSo the only worship leaders with multiple entries are Reuben (three times), Jad (twice), and Darlene (four times). \n\nBut wait, is that accurate? Let me count again.\n\nReuben:\nRow 8: yes\nRow 12: yes\nRow 13: yes \u2192 three times.\n\nJad:\nRow 4: yes\nRow 10: yes \u2192 two times.\n\nDarlene:\nRow 3: yes\nRow 6: yes\nRow 8: yes\nRow 12: yes \u2192 four times.\n\nSo all three have multiple entries. Now, the claim says they are the only ones. Are there any other worship leaders with multiple entries?\n\nLooking at the list again:\n\n- Joel Houston: once\n- Toni Romero: once\n- Darlene Zschech: four times\n- Jad Gillies: twice\n- Reuben Morgan: three times\n\nThat's it. So no one else besides these three has multiple appearances. Therefore, the claim is saying that only these three are featured on multiple songs, which seems to be correct based on the table.\n\nWait a second, but I think I might have missed someone. Let me check each row again for other worship leaders.\n\nRow 1: Joel\nRow 2: Toni\nRow 3: Darlene\nRow 4: Jad\nRow 5: Annie\nRow 6: Darlene\nRow 7: Dave\nRow 8: Reuben and Darlene\nRow 9: Matt\nRow 10: Jad\nRow 11: Brooke\nRow 12: Reuben and Darlene\nRow 13: Reuben\n\nNo, I think that's all. So the claim is correct\u2014only these three have multiple appearances.\n\nBut wait, in the original table, row 8 has \"Reuben Morgan and Darlene Zschech,\" so both are there. Similarly, row 12 also lists both. So each of them appears more than once.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Reuben, Jad, and Darlene are the only ones with multiple features seems to be accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\"worship leader\": [\"Joel Houston\", \"Toni Romero\", \"Darlene Zschech\", \"Jad Gillies\", \"Annie Garratt\", \"Dave Ware\", \"Matt Crocker\", \"Brooke Fraser\", \"Reuben Morgan\"]}",
