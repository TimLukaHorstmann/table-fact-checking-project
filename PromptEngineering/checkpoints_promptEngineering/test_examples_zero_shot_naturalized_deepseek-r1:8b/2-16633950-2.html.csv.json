    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim is: \"south sydney rabbitohs be the premier team that play in the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\" So I need to check if South Sydney Rabbitohs were the premiers in the 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different year's grand final. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: points: 42, score: 42 - 14, premiers: south sydney rabbitohs, runners up: manly - warringah sea eagles, details: 1951 nswrfl grand final.\n\nHmm, here in Row 1, the year is 1951, and the premiers are South Sydney Rabbitohs. That seems to match exactly with the claim. So this row directly supports the claim.\n\nRow 2: points: 40, score: 40 - 0, premiers: manly - warringah sea eagles, runners up: melbourne storm, details: 2008 nrl grand final.\n\nThis is for 2008, which is much later than 1951. Also, the premiers here are Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, not South Sydney Rabbitohs. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 3: points: 38, score: 38 - 0, premiers: eastern suburbs, runners up: st george dragons, details: 1975 nswrfl grand final.\n\nThis is for 1975, again not 1951. Premiers are Eastern Suburbs, so no match here.\n\nRow 4: points: 38, score: 38 - 12, premiers: brisbane broncos, runners up: canterbury - bankstown bulldogs, details: 1998 nrl grand final.\n\nThis is for 1998, and the premiers are Brisbane Broncos. Not related to 1951 or South Sydney Rabbitohs.\n\nRow 5: points: 36, score: 36 - 12, premiers: canberra raiders, runners up: canterbury - bankstown bulldogs, details: 1994 nswrl grand final.\n\nAgain, not relevant. Year is 1994, and premiers are Canberra Raiders.\n\nSo the only row that matches both the year (1951) and the premiers (South Sydney Rabbitohs) is Row 1. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by this row.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if South Sydney Rabbitohs were the premiers in the 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final. From the table:\n\n- **Row 1** matches both criteria: year and premiers.\n\nBased on this, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"premiers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the brisbane bronco score 38 point in the 1998 nrl grand final.\" So, I need to check if there's a row in the table that matches all these details.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Points:42, Score:42-14, Premiers: South Sydney Rabbitohs, Runners up: Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Details:1951 NSWRL Grand Final.\nRow 2: Points:40, Score:40-0, Premiers:Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Runners up:Melbourne Storm, Details:2008 NRL Grand Final.\nRow 3: Points:38, Score:38-0, Premiers:Eastern Suburbs, Runners up:St George Dragons, Details:1975 NSWRFL Grand Final.\nRow 4: Points:38, Score:38-12, Premiers:Brisbane Broncos, Runners up:Cantebury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details:1998 NRL Grand Final.\nRow 5: Points:36, Score:36-12, Premiers:Canberra Raiders, Runners up:Cantebury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details:1994 NSWRL Grand Final.\n\nNow, I need to check each row for Brisbaen Broncos scoring 38 points in the 1998 NRL Grand Final.\n\nStarting with Row 4:\nPremiers: Brisbane Broncos \u2013 this matches the team in the claim.\nPoints:38 \u2013 this is the score.\nScore breakdown:38-12. Wait, the claim says \"score 38 point\", which might mean the total points scored by the Broncos, not necessarily how they scored against their opponent. So that part checks out as 38 points.\nDetails:1998 NRL Grand Final \u2013 matches the year and competition.\n\nSo all details in Row 4 match the claim.\n\nNow, checking other rows to ensure no others could be relevant:\nRow 1: Points 42, not 38. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Points 40. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Premiers Eastern Suburbs, not Brisbane Broncos. So no.\nRow 5: Points 36, so no.\n\nTherefore, only Row 4 is relevant. The columns to check are Points and Details, as they directly relate to the numbers and event in question.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE with Row 4's Points and Details cells being relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"details\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"the eastern suburb score 38 point , and win 38 - 0\". So, breaking this down, it mentions an Eastern Suburb team that scored 38 points in a game where they won with a score of 38-0. Now, I'll need to check the table provided for any row that matches these details.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Points: 42, Score: 42 -14, Premiers: South Sydney Rabbitohs, Runners-up: Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Details: 1951 NSWRFL Grand Final.\nRow 2: Points: 40, Score: 40-0, Premiers: Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Runners-up: Melbourne Storm, Details: 2008 NRL Grand Final.\nRow 3: Points: 38, Score: 38-0, Premiers: Eastern Suburbs, Runners-up: St. George Dragons, Details: 1975 NSWRFL Grand Final.\nRow 4: Points: 38, Score: 38-12, Premiers: Brisbane Broncos, Runners-up: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details: 1998 NRL Grand Final.\nRow 5: Points: 36, Score: 36-12, Premiers: Canberra Raiders, Runners-up: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Details: 1994 NSWRL Grand Final.\n\nFirst, I notice that the claim mentions \"eastern suburb\" as the team. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 3's premiers are Eastern Suburbs with points and score matching the claim (38 points, 38-0). So this seems to directly match the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any other rows that might fit. Row 4 also has 38 points but a different score (38-12), so it doesn't match the 38-0 part. Similarly, row 3 is the only one with both points and score as 38-0 for Eastern Suburbs.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be supported by Row 3. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row_index 3, column_name \"score\" because that's where the 38-0 comes from.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"south sydney rabbitohs score 42 point but lose the game during the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\"\n\nI should break this down into parts. The claim mentions two specific points: the team's score and their result in that particular game.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows. I'm interested in any row where the premiers (winners) are the South Sydney Rabbitohs because the claim is about them losing, so they should be the runners-up or have a loss.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n- Row 1: Premiers are South Sydney Rabbitohs with 42 points. The score is 42 - 14 and details mention the 1951 NSWRFL grand final. Wait, but the claim says they lost the game. So I need to check if in that year, did they win or lose.\n\nLooking at Row 1 again: Score is 42-14, so South Sydney scored more points than their opponents. If they won with a high score, then the claim stating they lost would be incorrect. But wait, maybe there's another interpretation. Maybe losing here refers to not winning the premiership? No, because in this row, they are listed as premiers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"lose the game.\" In the context of a grand final, if they won the game but lost the premiership or something else. But usually, if you win the game, you don't lose it. Alternatively, maybe the claim is that their score was 42 points but they still lost the game, meaning they didn't win despite scoring.\n\nBut in Row 1, South Sydney scored 42-14, so they won the game with a high score. Therefore, the claim that they lost would be false because they actually won. So this row might not support the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the claim is saying they lost despite scoring 42 points. If in Row 1, they scored 42 but lost, then it's TRUE. But according to Row 1, they are premiers with that score, implying they won. So maybe this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if there was a game where they scored 42 points but lost. Let me see all the rows again.\n\nRow 1: South Sydney Rabbitohs as premiers, 42-14, 1951 NSWRFL grand final. So they won with 42 points.\n\nRow 4: Brisbane Broncos, 38-12, 1998 NRL grand final. Not related.\n\nRow 5: Canberra Raiders, 36-12, 1994 NSWRL grand final. Not relevant.\n\nRows 2 and 3 are about other teams, so not relevant here.\n\nSo only Row 1 is about South Sydney Rabbitohs. In that row, they scored 42 points but were the winners, not losers. Therefore, the claim that they lost would be FALSE because they actually won with that score.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"lose the game.\" Maybe it refers to losing in the grand final, i.e., not winning the premiership. But in Row 1, they are listed as premiers, so they did win the grand final.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is mixing up points and result. They scored 42 points but lost the game, meaning they didn't win. But in this row, they won with that score. So the claim's statement would be incorrect for Row 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if there was another game where they scored 42 points but lost. For example, maybe a different grand final. But looking at all rows, only Row 1 mentions South Sydney Rabbitohs with 42 points, and they won that game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because in the 1951 NSWRFL grand final, they did not lose; they scored 42-14 and won.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"south sydney rabbitohs score 42 point but lose the game during the 1951 nswrfl grand final.\" So if in that year's grand final, their score was 42 points, but they lost, then it's TRUE.\n\nBut according to Row 1, they are premiers with a score of 42-14. That implies they won with that score. So the claim is saying they scored 42 but lost, which contradicts the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because in reality, they scored 42 and won, not lost.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:\n\n1. Did South Sydney Rabbitohs score 42 points in the 1951 NSWRFL grand final? Yes, according to Row 1.\n\n2. Did they lose that game? No, because they were the premiers, meaning they won.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they didn't lose; they scored 42 and won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Sydney Rabbitohs scored 42 points but lost the 1951 NSWRFL grand final. Checking the table, Row 1 confirms they scored 42 points and were premiers in that game, indicating they won. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"details\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the brisbane bronco score a total of 12 point against canterbury - bankstown bulldog.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see where Brisbane Broncos and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are mentioned. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 1: Premiers are South Sydney Rabbitohs, runners-up are Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. No mention of Brisbane or Canterbury here.\n\nRow 2: Premiers are Manly-Warringah, runners-up are Melbourne Storm. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Eastern Suburbs as premiers, runners-up St George Dragons. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Here, the premiers are Brisbane Broncos, and their score is 38 -12. The opponents are Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs with a points of 38-0 because they scored zero? Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, the row shows points for Brisbane as 38 and score is 38-12. So, the score difference is 12 points. But wait, in the details, it's the 1998 NRL grand final. So this row directly relates to the claim because it mentions Brisbane Broncos scoring against Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs with a 12-point margin.\n\nRow 5: Canberra Raiders are premiers, runners-up Bulldogs again, but their score is 36-12. So here, Canberra scored 36 points and Bulldogs scored 24 (since 36-12 implies they lost by 12). Wait, no\u2014the score is 36 -12, so maybe the Bulldogs scored 12? Or is it that the Raiders scored 36-12 against them, meaning Bulldogs scored zero? Hmm, but the details say 1994 NSWRL grand final. So this is a different competition and year.\n\nNow, focusing on Row 4: It directly mentions Brisbane Broncos as premiers with a score of 38-12 against Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the 1998 NRL grand final. The claim is about the Broncos scoring 12 points against the Bulldogs, which matches exactly what's in Row 4.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in row 4, specifically the column where the score is listed, which is \"score\" and \"runners up\". Wait, but the claim is about the score being 12 points. So I think we need to look at both the premiers (Brisbane Broncos) and their score.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index:4\n  - column_name:\"score\"\n  - column_name:\"runners up\" because it shows who they played against.\n\nWait, no. The claim is about the score being 12 points by Brisbane against Bulldogs. So \"premiers\" would be Brisbane and \"details\" have the game result. But actually, looking at Row4: details are the specific final name. Hmm, perhaps \"score\" column is the key because it shows how many points they scored.\n\nSo in row 4, both \"premiers\" (Brisbane) and \"score\" (12) are relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"premiers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to support my conclusion.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying: \"Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs scored 36 points at the 1994 NSWRL Grand Final.\" So, I need to check if there's any row in the table that matches this information exactly or partially.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: points, score, premiers, runners up, and details. The claim mentions two specific things: the team name \"Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs\" scoring 36 points in a particular final.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Points are 42, but the team is South Sydney Rabbitohs. Runners up are Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. The details are from 1951. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Points are 40, team is Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, runners up Melbourne Storm, details 2008 NRL GF. Not matching the claim.\n\nRow 3: Points 38, team Eastern Suburbs, runners up St George Dragons, 1975 NSWRFL GF. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: Points 38, team Brisbane Broncos, runners up Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, details 1998 NRL GF. Hmm, points are 38, which is close but not 36. The team is Brisbane, not Canterbury. So no match here either.\n\nRow 5: Points 36, team Canberra Raiders, runners up Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, details 1994 NSWRL GF. Okay, so the score here is 36 points by Canberra Raiders. The claim mentions Canterbury scoring 36, which doesn't align because it's Canberra who scored that.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 5, the team that won (premiers) is Canberra Raiders with 36 points against Bulldogs. So, in this case, Bulldogs are runners up with 38-12, but their score isn't 36. The claim says Bulldogs scored 36, which would be incorrect because it's Canberra who did.\n\nSo, there's no row where Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs scored 36 points in the 1994 NSWRL Grand Final. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to find relevant cells. Since the claim mentions \"Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs\" and the year 1994, I should check which rows have these details.\n\nLooking at Row 5: It's about Canberra Raiders scoring 36 points in 1994 NSWRL GF. But Bulldogs are runners up here, not the scorers. So, the relevant cells would be Row 5 because it's the only one mentioning 1994 and Bulldogs. The column for team name is \"premiers\" or \"runners up\"? Since Bulldogs are runners up, maybe both columns are relevant.\n\nWait, but in Row 5, \"Canterbury - Bankstown Bulldogs\" is under \"runners up\". So, to check their score, we need to look at the opponents' points. Wait, does the table provide points for both teams? Let me see:\n\nRow 1: points:42, and details include who they played against? Not sure. Maybe I should assume that the points column is the team's own points.\n\nSo in Row 5, Canberra scored 36-12 against Bulldogs. So Bulldogs didn't score 36; they scored 12. Therefore, the claim is definitely false because it's Canberra who scored 36, not Bulldogs.\n\nTherefore, relevant cells are Row 5 for both \"runners up\" and possibly \"score\" to check Bulldogs' points. But since the table only shows the team's own points, maybe just looking at the runners up part isn't enough. Wait, perhaps I need to see if there's any row where Bulldogs are premiers with 36 points. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking through all rows, in Row 4, Bulldogs are runners up but their score is not 36. In Row 5, they're runners up again but their own points aren't 36. So no row where Bulldogs have 36 points as either premiers or runners up.\n\nThus, the only relevant cell would be to check the 1994 NSWRL GF, which is Row 5. But since in that row, Bulldogs scored 12, not 36, it's a false claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5 (row_index:5)\n- Column for runners up (since Bulldogs were runners up there), and maybe points column to check their score.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row has \"runners up\" as another team. So, in Row 5, the runner-up is Bulldogs. The claim says Bulldogs scored 36. To verify that, we need to see if any row has Bulldogs with 36 points. Since none do, it's false.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5 (row_index:5) for \"runners up\" and possibly \"score\" to check Bulldogs' points. But since the table only shows their opponents' score as 12, maybe just checking who they played against isn't enough.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at all possible cells that could relate to Bulldogs scoring in 1994. That would include:\n\n- In Row 5: \"runners up\" is Bulldogs, so check their points (which are 12) and the score column which is 36-12.\n- So the relevant columns are \"runners up\" and \"score\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are Row 5's \"runners up\" and \"score\" columns.\n\nI think that's it. So I'll list those as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runners up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by reading the claim again: \"the brisbane bronco score 38 point and win 38 - 0.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if any match the information in the claim. The table has five rows, each with points, score, premiers, runners up, and details.\n\nLooking at Row 4: It says points: 38, score: 38 -12, premiers: Brisbane Broncos, runners up: Canterbury Bulldogs, details: 1998 NRL grand final. Hmm, the points and premiers match the claim's mention of Brisbane Broncos scoring 38 points. However, the score in the table is 38-12, not 38-0. So that might be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, let me double-check if there's any other row with Brisbane Broncos as premiers. From the table, only Row 4 mentions Brisbane Broncos as the premiers. So, I should focus on this row.\n\nThe claim says they scored 38 points and won 38-0. But in Row 4, their score is 38-12, not 38-0. That means there's a difference between what the table states and what the claim is asserting. \n\nSo, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because the score doesn't match. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, about the relevant cells: since Row 4 has the Brisbane Broncos as premiers with points 38, both the 'points' and 'score' columns are relevant here. \n\nI think that's it. The claim is false because the score isn't 38-0 as stated; instead, it's 38-12. So the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are row index 4 for points and score.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim about the Brisbane Broncos scoring 38 points and winning 38-0 is true, we need to check each relevant cell in the table.\n\n1. **Premiers**: The claim specifies that the Brisbane Broncos won, so we look for rows where the premiers are listed as Brisbane Broncos.\n2. **Points**: The claim mentions they scored 38 points, so we check if any row has 38 points and lists Brisbane Broncos as premiers.\n3. **Score**: The claim states a score of 38-0, so we need to verify if the score for that particular game is indeed 38-0.\n\nLooking at Row 4:\n- Points: 38\n- Score: 38 -12\n- Premiers: Brisbane Broncos\n\nThe points match, but the score does not.
