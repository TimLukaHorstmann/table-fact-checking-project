    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of riders and their times across different days. The claim is saying that on Friday 26th August, rider David Lumsden showed a time of 19'52.05 at 113.945 mph, and when Monday 22nd August was checked, it was - no time. I need to check if this claim is true based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to find where David Lumsden is listed. Scanning the riders: Row 1 is Jamie Coward, Row 2 Michael Sweeney, Row 3 Grant Wagstaff, Row 4 Stephen McKnight, Row 5 Andrew Brady, Row 6 Paul Smyth, Row 7 David Lumsden, and so on.\n\nSo, David Lumsden is in Row 7. Now, I'll check each day for his times.\n\nOn Saturday 20 Aug, it says 'cancelled no time' \u2013 that's fine. Then Monday 22 Aug: looking at the data, under \"mon 22 aug\", the entry is \"-- no time\". That matches what the claim says about Monday 22nd being no time.\n\nNext, Tuesday 23 Aug is also '-- no time', so nothing there. Wednesday 24 Aug: again, it's \"-- no time\". Thursday 25 Aug: he has a time of 22'57.97 at 98.571 mph, which isn't relevant here. Finally, Friday 26 Aug: the entry is 19'52.05 at 113.945 mph.\n\nSo, putting this together: On Fri 26 Aug, he did have that time. On Mon 22 Aug, it's no time. That means the claim's statement checks out with the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"mon 22 aug\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"fri 26 aug show 19'30.70 116.023 mph when 20 aug be cancel no time.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that on Friday, August 26th, there was a time shown of 19 minutes and 30.70 seconds at 116.023 mph, but on Saturday, August 20th, it was canceled with \"no time.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a rider and their performance across several days: Sat 20 Aug, Mon 22 Aug, Tues 23 Aug, Wed 24 Aug, Thurs 25 Aug, and Fri 26 Aug. For each day, they have either a time or \"cancelled no time.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if there's any row where on Friday, August 26th, the time is exactly 19'30.70 at 116.023 mph, and on Saturday, August 20th, it was canceled.\n\nLet me go through each rider one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Jamie Coward. On Fri 26 Aug, his time is 19'25.34 at 116.556 mph. Doesn't match the claim's time or mph.\n2. **Row 2**: Michael Sweeney. His Fri 26 Aug time is 19'26.86 at 116.405 mph. Not matching.\n3. **Row 3**: Grant Wagstaff. Fri 26 Aug: 19'30.70 at 116.023 mph. Oh, this matches the exact time and speed from the claim!\n4. **Row 4**: Stephen McKnight. His Fri time is 19'45.19 mph. Doesn't match.\n5. **Row 5**: Andrew Brady. His Fri time is 20'12.29 at 112.043. No match.\n6. **Row 6**: Paul Smyth. Fri: 19'49.75 at 114.165. Nope.\n7. **Row 7**: David Lumsden. Fri: 19'52.05 at 113.945. Not matching.\n8. **Row 8**: Andy Fenton. No Fri time; his last entry is Fri with dashes, so no data.\n9. **Row 9**: Dan Sayle. Fri: 20'05.48 at 112.676. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, only Row 3 (Grant Wagstaff) has the exact time and speed mentioned in the claim for Friday, August 26th. And checking his Saturday entry, it's also canceled with \"no time,\" which aligns with the condition of the claim that 20 Aug was canceled.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this data, so the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Fri 26 aug\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

On Monday, August 22 (Mon 22 Aug), the rider should have a time of 20'22.05 at 111.148 mph.\n2. On Wednesday, August 24 (Wed 24 Aug), the rider should have a time of 19'56.16 at 113.553 mph.\n\nI'll need to check both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: Jamie Coward (Suzuki 600cc). Mon 22 has 20'25.35, which is higher than 20'22.05, so this doesn't match.\nRow 2: Michael Sweeney (Yamaha 600cc). His Mon 22 time is 30'08.59, which is way over 20 minutes, so no match.\nRow 3: Grant Wagstaff (Yamaha 599cc). He has 20'20.54 on Mon 22, which is close but not exactly 20'22.05.\nRow 4: Stephen McKnight (Yamaha 599cc). His Mon 22 time is 20'39.32, so that's slower than needed.\nRow 5: Andrew Brady (Honda 599cc). He has 20'35.58 on Mon 22, which doesn't match the claim.\nRow 6: Paul Smyth (Yamaha 600cc). His Mon 22 time is 20'07.69, so that's earlier than needed.\nRow 7: David Lumsden (Honda 600cc). He doesn't have a time for Mon 22; it's marked as no time.\nRow 8: Andy Fenton (Yamaha 600cc). His Mon 22 is 19'52.86, which doesn't match the claim of 20'22.05.\nRow 9: Dan Sayle (Yamaha 600cc). He has 20'22.05 on Mon 22, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nSo, for the first part of the claim, only Row 9 meets the criteria.\n\nNow checking the second part of the claim: On Wed 24 Aug, the rider should have 19'56.16 at 113.553 mph.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Jamie Coward's Wed time is 19'41.41, which doesn't match.\nRow 2: Michael Sweeney has 19'58.63 on Wed 24, which is close but not exactly the claimed 19'56.16.\nRow 3: Grant Wagstaff's Wed time is 20'07.24, which doesn't match.\nRow 4: Stephen McKnight's Wed time is 20'12.61, also no match.\nRow 5: Andrew Brady has a Wed time of 19'52.95, which is less than the claimed 19'56.16.\nRow 6: Paul Smyth's Wed time is 19'59.73, which is close but not exact.\nRow 7: David Lumsden doesn't have a time for Wed 24; it's marked as no time.\nRow 8: Andy Fenton has no time on Wed 24.\nRow 9: Dan Sayle's Wed time is 19'56.16, which matches exactly.\n\nSo only Row 9 meets both parts of the claim.

The rider is listed as Grant Wagstaff, rank:3, and he rides a 599cc Yamaha. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 3 corresponds to him.\n\nNow, I need to check the specific dates mentioned in the claim. The first date is Thursday 25 Aug.

Again, in Row 3, the entry for Friday 26 Aug shows a time of 19'30.70 and a speed of 116.023 mph.

On Thursday 25 August, there's a speed of \"19'52.02 113.945 mph.\"\n2. On Monday 22 August, the entry is \"-- no time.\"\n\nI need to locate these specific entries in the table.\n\nStarting with Monday 22 August (\"mon 22 aug: -- no time\"). I'll look through each row to find where this occurs. Checking Row 1 (Jamie Coward) doesn't have it; same for Rows 2-4. In Row 5 (Andrew Brady), there's a \"-- no time\" on Thursday, but not Monday. Then in Row 7 (David Lumsden), there are \"-- no time\" entries on Wednesday and Thursday, but again, no mention of Monday. Row 8 (Andy Fenton) has all days after Monday as \"-- no time.\" \n\nWait, looking at Row 5, it's Andrew Brady with a \"-- no time\" on Friday. Wait, actually, checking each row: \n\n- Jamie Coward (Row1): No --no time on Monday.\n- Michael Sweeney (Row2): No --no time on Monday.\n- Grant Wagstaff (Row3): No --no time on Monday.\n- Stephen McKnight (Row4): No --no time on Monday.\n- Andrew Brady (Row5): Mon 22 Aug: 20'35.58... So no, it's a time, not --no time.\n- Paul Smyth (Row6): No --no time on Monday.\n- David Lumsden (Row7): Mon 22 Aug is --no time. Yes! Found that in Row7.\nWait, yes, in Row7, rider: David Lumsden, mon 22 aug: -- no time.\n\nSo the claim says \"Mon 22 Aug be --no time,\" which matches what's in Row7. Now, checking if on Thurs 25 Aug, there is a speed of \"19'52.02 113.945 mph.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow1 (Jamie Coward): Thur 25 Aug: 21'37.14... mph.\nRow2 (Michael Sweeney): Thur 25 Aug: 25'46.46... mph.\nRow3 (Grant Wagstaff): Thur 25 Aug: 20'23.64... mph.\nRow4 (Stephen McKnight): Thur 25 Aug: 21'25.68... mph.\nRow5 (Andrew Brady): Thur 25 Aug: --no time.

So no match here either.\n\nWait, none of the rows have \"19'52.02 113.945 mph\" on Thursday 25 August. The closest I see is Row7's David Lumsden with 22'57.97 mph and Row5 has --no time. None have the exact time mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo the first part of the claim checks out (Monday is --no time), but the second part doesn't. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check two specific entries:\n1. **Monday 22 August** should be marked as \"-- no time.\"\n2. **Thursday 25 August** should have a speed of \"19'52.02 113.945 mph.\"\n\nChecking each row for Monday 22 August:\n- Only **Row7 (David Lumsden)** has \"-- no time\" on that day.\n\nChecking each row for Thursday 25 August:\n- No rider achieves exactly \"19'52.02 113.945 mph.\" \n\nSince the second condition isn't met, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mon_22_aug\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"thu_25_aug\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is true or false. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"20'23.64 112.511 mph show for thurs 25 aug when mon 22 aug be 19'30.70 116.023 mph.\" \n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Let me break it down. It looks like the claim is stating a relationship between two different days and two specific times for two different riders.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the relevant data points from the table. The claim mentions \"20'23.64 112.511 mph\" for Thursday, August 25th. And on Monday, August 22nd, it's referring to \"19'30.70 116.023 mph\".\n\nSo, I should look for these specific times and dates in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 3: rank 3, rider Grant Wagstaff. His Thursday time is 20'23.64 at 112.511 mph. That matches exactly with the first part of the claim. So that's one relevant cell.\n\nNow, the second part mentions Monday, August 22nd for rider Grant Wagstaff. Wait, but in Row 3, Grant Wagstaff has a Monday time of 20'20.54 at 111.285 mph, not 19'30.70 and 116.023. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rider.\n\nWait, let's check each row for Monday, August 22nd times. \n\nRow 1: Jamie Coward on Mon 22 Aug has 20'25.35 at 110.849 mph.\nRow 2: Michael Sweeney on Mon 22 Aug has 30'08.59 at 75.102 mph.\nRow 3: Grant Wagstaff on Mon 22 Aug has 20'20.54 at 111.285 mph.\nRow 4: Stephen McKnight on Mon 22 Aug is cancelled.\nRow 5: Andrew Brady on Mon 22 Aug has 20'35.58 at 109.930 mph.\nRow 6: Paul Smyth on Mon 22 Aug has 20'07.69 at 112.470 mph.\nRow 7: David Lumsden on Mon 22 Aug is cancelled.\nRow 8: Andy Fenton on Mon 22 Aug has 19'52.86 at 113.868 mph.\nRow 9: Dan Sayle on Mon 22 Aug has 20'22.05 at 111.148 mph.\n\nWait, none of the Monday times match \"19'30.70 116.023 mph\". So that seems to be a problem because the claim says when Monday's time is that, but in reality, no rider on Monday August 22nd has those exact times. \n\nBut hold on, maybe the claim is about comparing two different riders? Let me see.\n\nThe claim mentions \"when mon 22 aug be 19'30.70 116.023 mph.\" So it's referring to that specific time on Monday for some rider. But in our table, no rider has exactly 19:30.70 at 116.023 on August 22nd. \n\nWait, let me double-check each row again because maybe I missed one.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Jamie Coward - Mon 22 Aug: 20'25.35 mph.\n- Row 2: Michael Sweeney - 30'08.59 mph on Monday.\n- Row 3: Grant Wagstaff - 20'20.54 mph.\n- Row 4: Stephen McKnight - cancelled.\n- Row 5: Andrew Brady - 20'35.58 mph.\n- Row 6: Paul Smyth - 20'07.69 mph.\n- Row 7: David Lumsden - cancelled.\n- Row 8: Andy Fenton - 19'52.86 mph at 113.868, which is close but not the same as 116.023.\n- Row 9: Dan Sayle - 20'22.05 mph.\n\nSo none of them have 19'30.70 and 116.023 on Monday, August 22nd. \n\nTherefore, the claim's second part seems to be incorrect because there is no rider who had that exact time on Monday. However, the first part about Thursday, August 25th for Grant Wagstaff is correct.\n\nWait, but the way the claim is phrased is a bit confusing. It says \"20'23.64 112.511 mph show for thurs 25 aug when mon 22 aug be...\" So it's saying that on Thursday, that time was achieved when on Monday, another time occurred. But since no rider had the Monday time mentioned, perhaps the claim is trying to link two different riders or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpreted which rider the claim is referring to for the Thursday time. The Thursday entry is under Grant Wagstaff in Row 3, and that matches exactly with the first part of the claim. So that's correct.\n\nBut since no rider on Monday August 22nd had the time stated, perhaps the claim is incorrectly connecting two different events or times.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is not about linking two riders but just stating that on Thursday, a certain time was achieved, and on Monday, another time was achieved. But it's phrased as \"when mon 22 aug be...\", which suggests a condition. So perhaps it's implying that when (if) on Monday someone had a certain time, then on Thursday they would have that other time.\n\nBut since no rider had the Monday time mentioned, this might mean that the claim is incorrect because the premise of the condition isn't met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misphrased and actually refers to two different riders. Let me see if any other rider had 19'30.70 on August 22nd.\n\nLooking back at Row 8: Andy Fenton has 19'52.86 mph on Monday, which is close but not exact. No one else has that time. So the claim's second part seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, since the second part of the claim (about Monday) doesn't match any data in the table, the overall claim would be false because it includes an inaccurate statement about Monday's times.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe the claim is saying that on Thursday, a certain time was achieved by someone when (as in at the same point in time) on Monday, another time was achieved. But since no one had 19'30.70 on Monday, that part is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's trying to say that on Thursday, a rider achieved a time, and on Monday, another rider achieved a different time, but I don't think that's how the claim is phrased. It seems to be saying that when (if) someone did something on Monday, then someone else did something on Thursday.\n\nIn any case, since no rider had 19'30.70 on August 22nd, and Grant Wagstaff did have 20'23.64 on August 25th, perhaps the claim is partially correct but the condition isn't met, making the overall claim false.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the claim is correctly referencing the same rider for both times. Let me see: The Thursday time is for Grant Wagstaff (Row 3), and the Monday time would need to be for the same rider or someone else?\n\nLooking at Row 3 again, Grant Wagstaff's Monday time was 20'20.54 mph, not the 19'30.70 mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is trying to say that on Thursday, a certain time was achieved by a rider when (meaning during) on Monday, another time was achieved by someone else. But since no one had that exact Monday time, it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrectly pairing two different times from different riders, which doesn't make sense because the claim refers to \"when mon 22 aug be...\", implying a condition for the same rider.\n\nTherefore, I think the claim is false because there's no matching Monday time mentioned in the claim for any rider on August 22nd. So even though Grant Wagstaff did achieve the Thursday time, the claim incorrectly states that this happens when someone else achieved a specific Monday time which didn't occur.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" with relevant cells pointing to Thursday and Monday's times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim includes two parts: one accurate about Grant Wagstaff's Thursday performance and another incorrect about a Monday time. Since no rider had the specified Monday time, the overall claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Thursday Time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Monday Time\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Cancel no time be show for sat 20 aug when fri 26 aug be 19'41.41 114.971 mph.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It seems to have two main parts:\n\n1. For Saturday, August 20th (sat 20 aug), there should be a \"cancel no time\" status.\n2. On Friday, August 26th (fri 26 aug), the rider's speed should be exactly 19'41.41 114.971 mph.\n\nI'll need to check both parts against the table to verify the claim.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\n- Row 1: Jamie Coward on Monday (22 Aug) has a time of 20'25.35 and a speed of 110.849 mph.\n- Row 2: Michael Sweeney on Tuesday (23 Aug) is cancelled, but others have times. On Friday, he has 19'26.86 with 116.405 mph.\n- Row 3: Grant Wagstaff's Friday time is 19'30.70 and speed is 116.023 mph.\n- Row 4: Stephen McKnight on Friday has 19'45.19 and 114.604 mph.\n- Row 5: Andrew Brady on Friday is 20'12.29 and 112.043 mph.\n- Row 6: Paul Smyth's Friday time is 19'49.75 and speed is 114.165 mph.\n- Row 7: David Lumsden on Friday has 19'52.05 and 113.945 mph.\n- Row 8: Andy Fenton doesn't have any times after Monday, so Fri 26th is -- no time.\n- Row 9: Dan Sayle on Friday is 20'05.48 and speed is 112.676 mph.\n\nLooking for the specific time on Friday, none of the riders have exactly 19'41.41 at 114.971 mph. The closest is Michael Sweeney with 19'26.86 and 116.405 mph, which doesn't match. So the speed part of the claim doesn't hold.\n\nNow, checking for Saturday, August 20th: All entries mention \"cancelled no time.\" So that condition is met by all riders on Sat 20 aug. However, the speed isn't matching for Friday as required. Since both parts need to be true for the claim to hold, but only one part (the cancellation) is correct and the other (speed) isn't, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"sat 20 aug\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fri 26 aug\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"20'22.05 111.148 mph show for wed 24 aug when mon 22 aug be 19'56.16.113.553 mph.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means and how it relates to the data in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific time periods: Wednesday (wed) 24 Aug and Monday (mon) 22 Aug. For each of these days, there are corresponding speed values given. The structure of the claim seems to be saying that on Wednesday 24th August, a certain rider achieved 20'22.05 mph, while on the preceding Monday (22nd August), another rider had 19'56.16 mph.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different rider with their performance data across various days. The key columns are \"rank\", \"rider\", and \"sat 20 aug: cancelled no time\", \"mon 22 aug:\", etc. Each day has a specific speed value recorded.\n\nI need to identify which riders were active on these two dates and see if the speeds match as per the claim. \n\nStarting with Wednesday 24 Aug, the claim says 20'22.05 mph. I'll go through each rider's row:\n\n- Row 1: Jamie Coward - On wed 24 aug, his time is 19'41.41 mph.\n- Row 2: Michael Sweeney - His wed 24 aug speed is 19'58.63 mph.\n- Row 3: Grant Wagstaff - 20'07.24 mph on wed 24 aug.\n- Row 4: Stephen McKnight - 20'12.61 mph.\n- Row 5: Andrew Brady - 19'52.95 mph.\n- Row 6: Paul Smyth - 19'59.73 mph.\n- Row 7: David Lumsden - No time recorded on wed 24 aug.\n- Row 8: Andy Fenton - No time recorded on wed 24 aug.\n- Row 9: Dan Sayle - 20'05.48 mph.\n\nWait, the claim mentions 20'22.05 mph on wed 24 Aug. Looking through each rider's data:\n\nNone of the riders have exactly 20'22.05 mph on wed 24 aug. The closest is Dan Sayle at 20'05.48 mph, but that's not matching the time given in the claim.\n\nNow, checking Monday 22 Aug: The claim says 19'56.16 mph. Let's look at each rider's data for mon 22 aug:\n\n- Row 1: Jamie Coward - 20'25.35 mph.\n- Row 2: Michael Sweeney - 30'08.59 mph, which is much slower.\n- Row 3: Grant Wagstaff - 20'20.54 mph.\n- Row 4: Stephen McKnight - 20'39.32 mph.\n- Row 5: Andrew Brady - 20'35.58 mph.\n- Row 6: Paul Smyth - 20'07.69 mph.\n- Row 7: David Lumsden - No time recorded on mon 22 aug.\n- Row 8: Andy Fenton - 19'52.86 mph.\n- Row 9: Dan Sayle - 20'22.05 mph.\n\nSo, the claim says that on mon 22 aug, someone had 19'56.16 mph. Looking through the data, none of the riders have exactly this time. The closest is Andy Fenton at 19'52.86 mph, which is a bit slower than 19'56.16.\n\nPutting this together: The claim states that on wed 24 aug, a rider achieved 20'22.05 mph and that on mon 22 aug, another rider had 19'56.16 mph. However, in the table, neither of these exact speeds are recorded for those respective dates. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility I'm missing something, like a different interpretation or perhaps a miscalculation. But given how the times are listed, it seems clear that the specific numbers in the claim don't match any rider's performance on those dates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Speed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"20.45.61 110.055 mph be the thurs 25 aug when wed 24 aug be 19'59.73 113.216 mph.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what's being claimed.\n\nThe claim has two main points:\n\n1. On Thursday, August 25th (Thurs 25 Aug), the time was 20.45.61 110.055 mph.\n2. This time is supposed to be when on Wednesday, August 24th (Wed 24 Aug), the rider achieved 19'59.73 113.216 mph.\n\nSo, I need to check if in the table, the Thursday entry for each rider matches 20:45.61 at 110.055 mph on that day, and also verify that this particular rider had 19:59.73 113.216 mph on Wednesday.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRows are numbered from 1 to 9. Each row has a rank, rider name, and times for each day from Sat 20 Aug to Fri 26 Aug.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific days and times: Thurs 25 Aug and Wed 24 Aug.\n\nI need to find in the table which riders have entries for these days.\n\nFirst, let's look for riders who have data on both Wednesday (Aug 24) and Thursday (Aug 25). Because the claim links their performance on Wednesday to Thursday.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Jamie Coward\n- Wed 24 Aug: 19'41.41 114.971 mph\n\nRow 2: Michael Sweeney\n- Wed 24 Aug: 19'58.63 113.320 mph\n\nRow 3: Grant Wagstaff\n- Wed 24 Aug: 20'07.24 112.511 mph\n\nRow 4: Stephen McKnight\n- Wed 24 Aug: 20'12.61 112.013 mph\n\nRow 5: Andrew Brady\n- Wed 24 Aug: 19'52.95 113.859 mph (then Thu 25 Aug is no time, then Fri)\n\nRow 6: Paul Smyth\n- Wed 24 Aug: 19'59.73 113.216 mph (which matches the claim's Wed figure)\n\nRow 7: David Lumsden\n- No times on Mon and Wed, but has Thu and Fri.\n\nRow 8: Andy Fenton\n- No times on Wed or Thu.\n\nRow 9: Dan Sayle\n- Wed 24 Aug: 19'56.16 113.553 mph\n\nSo, looking at each rider, I need to check if any of them have the exact time of 20.45.61 110.055 mph on Thursday and that this particular rider also had 19:59.73 113.216 mph on Wednesday.\n\nLooking at Row 6: Paul Smyth\n- On Thu 25 Aug, his time is 20'45.61 109.046 mph. That's close but the speed is different (109 vs 110.055), so it doesn't match.\n\nRow 7: David Lumsden\n- Thu 25 Aug: 22'57.97 98.571 mph \u2013 nowhere near 20.45.61 and 110 mph.\n\nRow others don't have times for both days with the exact numbers mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the times. Let me check again.\n\nThe claim says \"20.45.61 110.055 mph\" on Thu 25 Aug. Looking at each rider's Thursday times:\n\n- Jamie Coward: 21'37.14 mph\n- Michael Sweeney: 25'46.46 mph\n- Grant Wagstaff: 20'23.64 mph\n- Stephen McKnight: 21'25.68 mph\n- Andrew Brady: no time\n- Paul Smyth: 20'45.61 mph (but speed is 109.046, not 110.055)\n- David Lumsden: 22'57.97 mph\n- Andy Fenton: no time\n- Dan Sayle: no Thursday entry.\n\nSo none of them have exactly 20:45.61 and 110.055 on Thu 25 Aug except maybe Paul Smyth, but the speed doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers in the claim are different. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe claim says \"20.45.61 110.055 mph\" on Thurs 25 Aug and that this is when Wed 24 Aug was 19'59.73 113.216 mph.\n\nLooking at Wed 24 Aug times:\n\nOnly Paul Smyth has exactly 19:59.73 with 113.216 mph.\n\nSo, if the claim is saying that on Thu 25 Aug, someone had 20:45.61 and 110.055, but looking for which rider had both those days matching those times.\n\nBut in the table, no rider matches the Thursday time as per the claim except perhaps none. Because none have exactly 20:45.61 and 110.055 on Thu.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the times. Let me look again.\n\nThe times are written as e.g., \"19'59.73 113.216 mph\". So, it's minutes:seconds.millis? Or is it something else? Or perhaps the format is seconds.minutes.millis?\n\nWait, in row 6, Paul Smyth on Thu 25 Aug has 20'45.61 and speed 109.046. The claim says 20.45.61 with 110.055 mph.\n\nHmm, maybe the time format is different. For example, 20:45:61, but that's unlikely because hours would be after 24.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding. Maybe it's 20 minutes and 45.61 seconds, which is 20:45.61 as in row 6, Paul Smyth.\n\nBut the speed is different (109 vs 110), so it doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim refers to the same rider on Thu? So, if on Wed, a rider had 19:59.73 and 113.216, then on Thu they have 20:45.61 and 110.055.\n\nLooking at the table, which rider has both these times?\n\nLooking for a rider who on Wed 24 Aug has 19'59.73 113.216 mph, and on Thu 25 Aug has 20'45.61 110.055 mph.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nOnly Paul Smyth has 19:59.73 on Wed, but his Thu time is 20:45.61 at 109.046 mph, which doesn't match the speed in the claim.\n\nSo, none of the riders have both exact times as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that \"20.45.61 110.055 mph be the thurs 25 aug when wed 24 aug be 19'59.73 113.216 mph\" is false because there's no rider in the table who has those exact times on both days.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Wednesday\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Thursday\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
