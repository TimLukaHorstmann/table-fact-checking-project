    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"jim obradovich pick before round 2 but pick 183 , play tight end position\". \n\nI'll start by identifying each part of the claim and see how it relates to the table columns.\n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim mentions \"jim obradovich\". Looking at the table, I need to find a row where the player is Jim Obradovich. Scanning through the rows, Row 4 has \"player: jim obradovich\", so that's relevant. So, the row index is 4.\n\n2. **Pick Round and Position**: The claim says \"pick before round 2\" and also mentions pick 183 and position tight end. Wait, that seems conflicting because a player can't be picked both before round 2 and at pick 183 in another round. Let me check the table columns for each relevant row.\n\nLooking back at Row 4: it has \"round: 7\", \"pick: 158\", so the player was picked in Round 7, not before Round 2. The claim says \"before round 2\" which would be Rounds 1 or maybe a late Round 0 if such existed, but typically in drafting, rounds are numbered starting from 1. So picking before Round 2 would be either Round 1 or earlier. However, the player in question was picked in Round 7.\n\nThen there's \"pick: 183\". Let me see which row has pick 183. Looking at Row 5: \"pick: 183\", and the player is John Tate, position linebacker. So that doesn't match Jim Obradovich. Therefore, the claim's second part about pick 183 seems incorrect.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- The player Jim Obradovich is indeed in the table (Row 4), but he was picked in Round 7, not before Round 2.\n- There's a different player with pick 183 (John Tate) who is not Jim Obradovich and plays linebacker, not tight end.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues: incorrect round for Jim Obradovich and incorrect position and player for pick 183. So the entire claim doesn't hold true based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim makes two inaccuracies regarding Jim Obradovich and John Tate. Jim was picked in Round 7, not before Round 2, and the player with pick 183 is John Tate, not Jim, playing linebacker.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - \"jim obradovich\" appears in Row 4.\n   - \"pick 183\" appears in Row 5, but it's a different player (John Tate).\n\n2. **Check Round for Jim Obradovich:**\n   - His round is 7, not before 2.\n\n3. **Check Position for John Tate:**\n   - He plays linebacker, not tight end.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is false because both parts are incorrect based on the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the given claim about Jim Obradovich is true based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"jim obradovich pick after round 2 but before pick 183 , play tight end position.\" So, the claim has a few parts. I need to check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the name: Jim Obradovich. From the table, looking at row 4: player is Jim Obradovich. So that's correct. His position is tight end, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, the rounds and picks. The claim says he was picked after round 2 but before pick 183. Let's see the table again. Round 2 would be after pick 27 (row1) and before pick 62 (row2). So round 3 is next. Wait, no, wait: actually, in the NFL draft, each round has its own picks. So round 1 starts at pick 1, round 2 at pick 32, round 3 at pick 64, etc.\n\nWait, but according to the table:\n\nRow1: Round2, Pick27\nRow2: Round3, Pick62\nRow3: Round4, Pick79\nRow4: Round7, Pick158\nRow5: Round8, Pick183\n\nSo Jim Obradovich is in round7, pick158. The claim says he was picked after round2 but before pick183.\n\nWait, let's clarify the rounds and picks:\n\n- Round1: 32 picks (pick32 to pick63)\n- Round2: next 32 picks (64-95)\n- Wait, no, actually, the draft has 7 rounds, with each round having varying numbers of picks. But in this table, each row corresponds to a specific pick number.\n\nSo, the first row is pick27, which would be in Round2, since Round1 ends at pick32? Hmm, maybe not, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key here is the order of picks: 27 comes before 62, which is correct for Round2 followed by Round3.\n\nSo Jim Obradovich is picked in Round7, Pick158. Now, the claim says he was picked after round2 but before pick183. Let's check where 158 falls in relation to round2 and pick183.\n\nRound2 is the second round, so any picks after that would be in later rounds. So Round7 is definitely after Round2. Also, pick158 is before pick183 (since Round8 starts at pick128 or something? Wait, actually, I might need to check how the picks progress.\n\nWait, the picks go like this:\n\nRound1: 32 picks (1-32)\nRound2: next 32 picks (33-64)\nRound3: next 32 picks (65-96)\nRound4: next 32 picks (97-128)\nRound5: next 32 picks (129-160)\nRound6: next 32 picks (161-192)\nRound7: next 32 picks (193-224)\n\nWait, but according to the table:\n\nRow1: Round2, Pick27\nRow2: Round3, Pick62\nRow3: Round4, Pick79\nRow4: Round7, Pick158\nRow5: Round8, Pick183\n\nSo Round7 is from 193-224. So pick158 would be in Round6, because Round6 ends at 192? Wait, no:\n\nWait, perhaps the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound1: 32 picks (1-32)\nRound2: next 32 (33-64)\nRound3: next 32 (65-96)\nRound4: next 32 (97-128)\nRound5: next 32 (129-160)\nRound6: next 32 (161-192)\nRound7: next 32 (193-224)\n\nSo, pick158 would be in Round6 because 161-192 is Round6. But according to the table, Jim Obradovich is picked at round7, pick158. So that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the table is not following the standard draft rounds but just assigning numbers as per their order. Let me check again:\n\nRow1: Round2, Pick27 \u2192 probably correct for Round2\nRow2: Round3, Pick62 \u2192 Round3 starts at 64? So 62 would be in Round3\nWait, no, perhaps the table is a naturalized version where each row corresponds to a specific pick number, regardless of the actual draft rounds. For example:\n\nPick27 is Round2\nPick62 is Round3\nPick79 is Round4\nPick158 is Round7\nPick183 is Round8\n\nSo in this context, Jim Obradovich is picked at round7 (which would be much later than round2) and before pick183, which is round8. So the claim says he was picked after round2 but before round8.\n\nLooking at the table, Row4 has round7, pick158, which is indeed after round2 (Row1: round2). And Round7 comes before Round8, so pick158 is before pick183. Therefore, the claim is accurate in that Jim was picked after round2 and before round183.\n\nAdditionally, his position is tight end, as per row4.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
