    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"all of the Boston Celtic's draft pick in 1985 come from the United State\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about the Boston Celtics' draft picks in 1985. It says all their picks that year came from the United States. To verify this, I should look at each row corresponding to round and pick numbers for 1985 and check where each player comes from.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Round 1, Pick 20, Player Sam Vincent, Nationality US, School Michigan State.\nRow 2: Round 3, Pick 70, Player Andre Battle, US, Loyola (IL).\nRow 3: Round 4, Pick 93, Cliff Webber, US, Liberty Baptist.\nRow 4: Round 5, Pick 116, Albert Butts, US, La Salle.\nRow 5: Round 6, Pick 139, Ralph Lewis, US, La Salle.\nRow 6: Round 7, Pick 162, Chris Remly, US, Rutgers.\n\nWait, all these players are from the United States. So at first glance, it seems like the claim is true because all draft picks listed here are US citizens.\n\nBut hold on\u2014did the Celtics pick all their draft selections in 1985 from the US? I should consider that maybe not all rounds might be covered or perhaps there were more picks beyond what's listed here. However, based solely on the table provided, every player listed has a nationality of United States. So according to this data, yes, all the picks come from the US.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about 1985 specifically. Let me make sure that these are indeed part of the 1985 draft. I recall Sam Vincent was picked by the Celtics in 1985, and so were others like Andre Battle, Cliff Webber, etc. So it seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, since all relevant cells (all rows) indicate nationality as United States, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data provided, as all draft picks listed for the Boston Celtics in 1985 come from the United States.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the boston celtic draft 2 player from la salle in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Boston Celtics drafted two players from La Salle in 1985. So, I need to check if there are any such draft picks in the provided table related to La Salle and the year 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: round, pick, player name, nationality, and school/club team. The years mentioned in the table are Round 1 through Round 7 with specific pick numbers. I don't see any explicit mention of the year 1985 here, so that's a red flag. But maybe the players were drafted in 1985 even if the rounds and picks are listed as, say, round 6 or something.\n\nWait, no. The table doesn't have the years associated with each row; it only lists the round number and pick number. So, perhaps I need to assume that the year is 1985 because the claim mentions that specific year. But without explicit data on the year in the table, this might be tricky.\n\nLooking at the players from La Salle: in Row 4, the player is Albert Butts, and Row 5 is Ralph Lewis. Both are from La Salle. So there's two players drafted from La Salle. Now, I need to check if they were drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1985.\n\nWait, the table doesn't specify which team each player was drafted into. It only lists their school/club team as La Salle. That might mean that they could have been drafted by any team, not necessarily the Celtics. So unless it's explicitly stated, I can't assume they were drafted by the Celtics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is supposed to represent drafts for a specific team, but since the claim is about the Celtics, I need to verify if La Salle players were indeed drafted by them in 1985.\n\nBut looking at the table again, there's no information about the team each player was drafted into. So even though they are from La Salle, it's unclear whether they were picked by the Celtics or another team. Therefore, without knowing which team each player was selected by, I can't confirm that the Celtics drafted them.\n\nAlso, the table doesn't mention 1985 explicitly, so if the rounds and picks correspond to 1985, maybe it does. But without knowing for sure, there's uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because the table doesn't provide the necessary information about the team (Boston Celtics) or the year (1985), even though two players from La Salle are listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"albert butt be draft 23 pick after cliff webber in 1985.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions two players: Albert Butts and Cliff Webber. The claim states that Albert was drafted at pick number 23 after Cliff in 1985. So I need to check if this is supported by the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: round, pick, player name, nationality, and school/club team. \n\nI'll start by identifying which rows are relevant to both players mentioned. \n\nStarting with Cliff Webber, I need to find his row in the table. Let me scan through the player names: Row 3 is Cliff Webber. So, his details are:\n- Round: 4\n- Pick: 93\n- Player: cliff webber\n\nNext, Albert Butts should be in a different row. Scanning again, I see that Row 4 is Albert Butts:\n- Round: 5\n- Pick: 116\n- Player: albert butts\n\nNow, the claim says Albert was drafted at pick 23 after Cliff in 1985. However, looking at their respective picks from the table, Cliff Webber was picked 93rd overall, and Albert Butts was picked 116th. The numbers here don't match the claim of 23.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. In some sports drafts, like the NBA, picks can be in different rounds or orders. However, in this table, each pick is sequential within each round. Round 4's last pick would be pick 93, and Round 5's first pick is 116.\n\nThe claim mentions \"23 pick,\" which seems to refer to a low pick number, but in the table, both players were picked much later. Since 23 isn't present for either player, the claim doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim is FALSE because Albert Butts was not drafted at pick 23 after Cliff Webber.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Albert Butts was drafted as the 23rd pick after Cliff Webber in 1985. However, examining the table, both players were picked much later (Cliff at 93 and Albert at 116) and there's no mention of a 23rd pick in the given context.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table lists draft picks with details like round, pick number, player name, nationality, and their school or club team. Each row corresponds to a specific pick in the draft. \n\nThe claim is about the Boston Celtics not having a 2nd round draft pick in 1985. So I need to check if there's any entry in the table for the Boston Celtics in the 2nd round of the 1985 draft.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Round 1, Pick 20, Player Sam Vincent, School Michigan State.\n- Row 2: Round 3, Pick 70, Player Andre Battle, School Loyola (IL).\n- Row 3: Round 4, Pick 93, Player Cliff Webber, School Liberty Baptist.\n- Row 4: Round 5, Pick 116, Player Albert Butts, School La Salle.\n- Row 5: Round 6, Pick 139, Player Ralph Lewis, School La Salle.\n- Row 6: Round 7, Pick 162, Player Chris Remly, School Rutgers.\n\nNone of these rows mention the Boston Celtics. The schools listed are Michigan State, Loyola (IL), Liberty Baptist, La Salle, and Rutgers\u2014none are related to the Celtics. Additionally, all the rounds here go up to 7, but there's no 2nd round pick for the Celtics in 1985.\n\nSo, based on this table, it seems like the Boston Celtics do not have a 2nd round draft pick in 1985. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table provided does not list any draft picks for the Boston Celtics in the 2nd round of 1985.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support this decision. The claim is: \"Andrew Battle be draft 90 pick before Chris Remly.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim to see which parts can be verified from the table.\n\nStarting with \"Andrew Battle,\" I'll search through the players in the table. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 1: sam vincent\n- Row 2: andre battle\n- Row 3: cliff webber\n- Row 4: albert butts\n- Row 5: ralph lewis\n- Row 6: chris remly\n\nSo, Andrew Battle is Andre Battle in row 2. That's the first part.\n\nNext, \"be draft 90 pick.\" Looking at the table, I need to find who was picked 90th. The table lists picks as 20,70,93,116,139,162. None of these are 90. So, there might be a problem here because if the pick number isn't in the table, then maybe the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row has \"round\" and \"pick.\" Maybe the overall draft order? Let me list out all picks:\n\nRound 1: 20\nRound 3:70\nRound4:93\nRound5:116\nRound6:139\nRound7:162\n\nSo the total pick numbers are 20,70,93,116,139,162. There's no 90 in here. That means that Andrew Battle was picked at round 3, pick 70. So the claim says he was drafted at pick 90 before Chris Remly.\n\nBut since there's no pick 90 for Andrew Battle, maybe the claim is referring to another player? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting something. Wait, maybe the table only shows certain rounds, and pick 90 could be in an earlier round not listed here?\n\nNo, because the first row is round1, then round3, etc., so round2 isn't present, which means the 90th overall pick might be in another table or perhaps it's inferred from the order. But based on the given data, there's no pick 90 for Andre Battle.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because while Andrew Battle is indeed a player (Andre Battle), he wasn't picked at 90. Instead, his pick number was 70 in round3, and Chris Remly is in round7 with pick162, which would logically come after 90. So, even though 90 isn't in the table, if we assume that the picks are in order, then Chris Remly's overall position (162) comes after 90, so Andrew Battle being at 70 doesn't make sense as \"before\" 90 because 70 is earlier than 90.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The claim says Andrew Battle was picked at 90 before Chris Remly. So if the pick numbers are in order, then 70 (Andrew's pick) is before 162 (Chris'). But 90 isn't a real pick here, so maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no such pick number for Andrew.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only shows certain rounds, and the overall pick could be calculated by adding the round numbers? For example, Round1:20, Round3:70, which would be total picks 20+70=90? But that seems unlikely. Or maybe each row represents a specific round, so the first player was picked at round1, pick20; the second at round3, pick70, etc., but their overall positions would be 20th overall in round1, then next is round2 (unlisted), then round3:70th overall? No, because the picks are per round.\n\nWait, no. In reality, draft order is based on overall picks across all rounds. So Round1 has pick20, Round3 has pick70, so if we add them as cumulative, but that's not how it works. Each pick in a higher round comes after lower rounds. So Round1, then Round2 (unlisted here), then Round3:70 would be 70th overall. But the table doesn't have round2, so maybe the total picks up to each row are:\n\n- After row1:20\n- After row2:20+70=90\n- After row3:90+93=183\n- Etc.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it works. Alternatively, perhaps the table lists all the rounds, and the overall pick number is the position in which they were drafted. For example, if a player was picked 20th overall, then 70th would be higher than 20th.\n\nWait, no, in the NFL draft, each round's picks are sequential, so Round1 starts at 1, Round2 at next available, etc. But the table seems to list only certain rounds with their pick numbers, not the overall position. So perhaps the pick number refers to their position within that round, not overall.\n\nIn that case, if Andrew Battle was picked at 70 in Round3, and Chris Remly at 162 in Round7, then both are after Round1's 20th pick. But the claim says \"Andrew Battle be draft 90 pick before Chris Remly.\" Since 90 isn't a real pick number here, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no player picked at 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists the overall picks, but the numbers don't add up. For example, Round1:20, then Round3:70 (so total of 20+70=90), making Andrew Battle the 90th pick. Then Chris Remly is 162, which would be after 90. So that interpretation would make the claim correct because Andrew was picked before Chris.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it works. The table seems to list each round and their corresponding picks, so Round3 pick70 would mean he was picked in the third round at position70, making him the 70th player picked in his round. But overall, considering all rounds, his position would be higher than 20 but lower than 162.\n\nI think the confusion is whether \"pick\" refers to the overall draft position or just the position within their own round. If it's within their round, then both Andrew and Chris are after Round1 pick20. So the claim that Andrew was picked at90 before Chris is incorrect because there's no such overall pick number as90 in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no player with a pick of90, so Andrew Battle wasn't drafted at pick90.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the boston celtic draft 2 player from rutgers in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that the Boston Celtics drafted a player from Rutgers in 1985, specifically as their second pick. So I need to check if there's any row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: round: 1, pick: 20, player: sam vincent, nationality: united states, school / club team: michigan state.\nRow 2: round: 3, pick: 70, player: andre battle, nationality: united states, school / club team: loyola (il).\nRow 3: round: 4, pick: 93, player: cliff webber, nationality: united states, school / club team: liberty baptist.\nRow 4: round: 5, pick: 116, player: albert butts, nationality: united states, school / club team: la salle.\nRow 5: round: 6, pick: 139, player: ralph lewis, nationality: united states, school / club team: la salle.\nRow 6: round: 7, pick: 162, player: chris remly, nationality: united states, school / club team: rutgers.\n\nNow, let's parse the claim again. The key points are:\n\n- Drafted by Boston Celtics\n- In 1985\n- As their second pick (pick number 2)\n- From Rutgers\n\nLooking at each row for round and pick numbers:\n\nThe table lists rounds from 1 to 7 and corresponding picks. However, the claim specifies it's in 1985. The year isn't directly mentioned in the table, so I need to check if any of these players were indeed drafted by the Celtics in that year.\n\nLet me look at each player:\n\nRow 1: Sam Vincent was picked 20th overall, round 1. He played for Michigan State.\nRow 2: Andre Battle was pick 70, round 3 from Loyola (IL).\nRow 3: Cliff Webber was pick 93, round 4 from Liberty Baptist. I think Cliff Webber is a real person, but not sure about his connection to Celtics in 1985.\nRow 4: Albert Butts, round 5, pick 116 from La Salle.\nRow 5: Ralph Lewis, round 6, pick 139 from La Salle.\nRow 6: Chris Remly, round 7, pick 162 from Rutgers.\n\nWait, so Chris Remly is the only one from Rutgers. Now, I need to check if he was drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1985 as their second pick. Let's think about the draft order for 1985. The Celtics had several picks: round 1, pick 7 (with a compensation pick due to the Celtics drafting Bernard King, but that might not be relevant here). Then their next picks were round 2, which is pick 46, but that's separate from the main draft. However, in the regular draft, the Celtics' second overall pick would be pick number 2.\n\nWait, no, the rounds are based on when the draft was conducted. The first round is round 1, then round 2, etc., but the actual pick numbers can vary. For example, in some drafts, teams have multiple picks in a round because of trades or compensation.\n\nBut looking at the table, the picks go up to 162, which suggests this might be the third round or beyond, but I'm not entirely sure without more context. The key point is that Chris Remly is from Rutgers and was picked as round 7, pick 162. So, the claim says it's the second pick in 1985. But looking at the table, none of the players were picked in round 1 or pick number 2.\n\nSo, Sam Vincent is round 1, pick 20 (which would be their first pick). Then their next picks are round 3, pick 70; round 4, pick 93; etc. So none of these players are from Rutgers except Chris Remly in round 7, pick 162.\n\nWait, but the claim is about drafting a player from Rutgers as their second pick in 1985. The table shows that the Celtics didn't draft anyone from Rutgers except Chris Remly in round 7, which would be much later than the second overall pick.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the Celtics didn't draft from Rutgers at all in 1985 as their second pick. They actually drafted Sam Vincent as their first-round pick, and then other players from different schools, but not Chris Remly until later rounds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Boston Celtics drafted a player from Rutgers as their second pick in 1985 is incorrect based on the provided table. The only player from Rutgers listed is Chris Remly, who was picked in round 7 and not as the second overall pick.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"albert butt be draft 4 pick after cliff webber in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions two players: Albert Butts and Cliff Webber. The claim states that Albert was drafted as the 4th pick after Cliff in 1985. So, I need to check the table to see if this is accurate.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: round: 1, pick: 20, player: sam vincent...\nWait, no, row 1 is Sam Vincent, but that's not relevant here. Row 2 is Andre Battle, row 3 is Cliff Webber. Oh, here we go. So, in row 3, the pick number is 93, which is round 4. That means Cliff Webber was picked 93rd overall in the 4th round.\n\nNow, Albert Butts is in row 4: round 5, pick 116. So he was picked in the 5th round, 116th overall. The claim says Albert was drafted as pick 4 after Cliff, but according to the table, Albert's pick is much later\u2014116th in round 5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"pick\". Is it by round or overall? Let me check the column names: Each row has 'round', 'pick'. So for example, Sam Vincent was picked 20th in round 1. So the overall pick number would be 20 in that case.\n\nSo for Cliff Webber, his overall pick is 93 (round 4, pick 93). Albert Butts is picked 116 overall (round 5, pick 116). The claim says Albert was drafted as pick 4 after Cliff. Pick 4 in what sense? Maybe within the round? So in the same round, if Cliff was pick 93 in round 4, then maybe Albert is pick 4 in his round, which is round 5. But that doesn't make sense because they are different rounds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is saying that Albert's draft position (116) comes after Cliff's (93), which would be true since 116 > 93. However, the wording says \"draft 4 pick after cliff webber\", so it might mean that Albert was picked in the 4th round after Cliff. But looking at the table, both are in different rounds: Cliff is round 4, Albert is round 5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim could be implying that within their respective rounds, but that doesn't fit either because they're not in the same draft year or round. Alternatively, perhaps it's about being picked after each other in the overall draft order. But in the table, Albert was picked later (116) than Cliff (93), so yes, he was drafted after.\n\nBut the wording is a bit confusing: \"albert butt be draft 4 pick after cliff webber\". Maybe it means that in round 4, Albert was picked after Cliff. Let me check: In round 4, pick 93 is Cliff Webber, but Albert Butts is in round 5, so he wasn't drafted in the same round as Cliff.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's list out all the picks:\n\n- Round 1: Sam Vincent (pick 20)\n- Round 2: Andre Battle (70)\n- Round 3: Cliff Webber (93)\n- Round 4: Albert Butts (116)\n- Round 5: Ralph Lewis (139)\n- Round 6: Chris Remly (162)\n\nWait, no, the table shows that in round 4, it's pick 93 (Cliff), and round 5 is pick 116 (Albert). So yes, Albert was picked later than Cliff. Therefore, the claim says he was draft 4 pick after cliff webber. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that in the 1985 draft, Albert was drafted as the 4th pick after Cliff. But looking at the overall picks:\n\nCliff Webber is pick 93 (round 4), and Albert is pick 116 (round 5). So yes, Albert's pick number is higher than Cliff's, meaning he was drafted later. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because Albert was indeed picked after Cliff in the same draft year.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about how the picks are structured. If the draft is ordered by round and then pick within the round, then overall order is round 1 first, then round 2, etc. So pick number 93 comes before 116, so yes, Albert was picked after Cliff.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states that Albert Butts was drafted as pick 4 after Cliff Webber in 1985. From the table, Albert's overall pick is 116 (round 5), and Cliff's is 93 (round 4). Since 116 > 93, Albert was indeed picked later. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the column names. Let me check: The columns are 'round', 'pick', etc. So for example, row 3: round=4, pick=93, player=Cliff Webber. Row 4: round=5, pick=116, player=Albert Butts.\n\nSo yes, Albert was picked after Cliff in the overall draft order.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Albert Butts was drafted after Cliff Webber in the same year, as evidenced by their respective pick numbers in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the boston celtic have a 2nd round draft pick in 1985",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the boston celtic have a 2nd round draft pick in 1985\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-reference that with the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions the Boston Celtics having a 2nd round draft pick in 1985. So I'm looking for information about the Celtics' draft picks in that specific year. The table given lists several rows with details about draft picks, but it doesn't mention anything about the Boston Celtics specifically. Each row has columns like round, pick number, player name, nationality, and school or club team.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Round 1, Pick 20, Player Sam Vincent, Nationality United States, School/Club Team Michigan State. This is about the first round, so not relevant for a second round pick in 1985.\n\nRow 2: Round 3, Pick 70, Player Andre Battle, Nationality US, School/Club Loyola (IL). Again, this is third round, so not second round.\n\nRow 3: Round 4, Pick 93, Player Cliff Webber, nationality US, school Liberty Baptist. Fourth round, still not second round.\n\nRow 4: Round 5, Pick 116, Player Albert Butts, US, La Salle. Fifth round, nope.\n\nRow 5: Round 6, Pick 139, Player Ralph Lewis, US, La Salle. Sixth round, not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Round 7, Pick 162, Player Chris Remly, US, Rutgers. Seventh round, so definitely not second round.\n\nNow, looking at all the players in these rows, I don't see any associated with the Boston Celtics. The schools mentioned are Michigan State, Loyola (IL), Liberty Baptist, La Salle, and Rutgers. None of these are connected to the Celtics as far as I know. \n\nAlso, considering that the table seems to be listing draft picks for a particular year\u2014maybe 1985? Let me check the pick numbers. The highest pick in the first round is usually around 1-15, but here it's Pick 20 in Round 1, which might align with an early 80s draft where higher numbers were possible. However, without knowing exactly when these picks occurred, I can't be certain.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the Celtics had a second-round pick in 1985 that isn't listed here. The table only has six rows, but the draft usually has rounds beyond that, especially in later rounds. So it's possible that the Celtics did have a second-round pick in 1985 that's not included in this table.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"have,\" implying they still hold the pick or that they selected someone. If the table doesn't mention them, maybe they didn't make a pick at that time. But I'm not sure because I don't have complete data on all draft picks from 1985.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Boston Celtics' second-round pick in 1985 wasn't successful or didn't result in any notable player, so it's not listed here. Or maybe they didn't select anyone that year in the second round, making the claim false.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the table doesn't provide information about which team each draft pick was for. Without knowing that, I can't confirm if any of these picks were for the Celtics. So even though the rounds and picks could be relevant, without the specific team association, it's hard to verify.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the claim might not be fully supported by the table because the table doesn't mention anything about the Boston Celtics having a second-round pick in 1985.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"andrew battle be draft 80 pick before chris remly\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two players: Andrew Battle and Chris Remly. It's saying that Andrew was drafted as the 80th pick before Chris. So I need to check their draft positions in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns like round, pick, player name, nationality, and school/club team. The rows are numbered from 0 to 5 (since there are six rows).\n\nStarting with Andrew Battle: I'll scan through each row for his name. I see that Row 1 is Sam Vincent, Row 2 is Andre Battle. So Andre Battle is in Row 2, Column \"pick\" which has the value 70.\n\nNext, Chris Remly is in Row 6. His pick number is 162.\n\nThe claim states that Andrew (Andre) was picked at 80 before Chris at 162. However, looking at the table, Andre was picked at 70, and Chris at 162. Since 70 is earlier than 162, but the claim says he was drafted at 80, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The user wrote \"andrew battle\" in lowercase, but in the table it's spelled as \"andre battle.\" Does that matter? Probably not; the names might be variants, but in this context, they refer to the same person. So, regardless of spelling, the key point is that Andrew was picked at 70 and Chris at 162.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Andrew was drafted at pick 80 before Chris is false because he was actually picked earlier (70th) but not at 80.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
