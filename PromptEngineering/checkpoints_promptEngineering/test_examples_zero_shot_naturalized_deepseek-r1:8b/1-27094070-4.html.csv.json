    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the Omaha Nighthawks' overall total is correct based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"the overall total for the omaha nighthawk be 144169.\" Hmm, that number stands out. So, I'm looking for the overall total specifically for the Omaha Nighthawks in the table.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to check where the Omaha Nighthawks are mentioned. \n\nRow 1 is about the Omaha Nighthawks. The columns here include team name, home gms, home total, etc. So, their overall total is listed as 144169 in this row. That's exactly the number mentioned in the claim.\n\nI should make sure there are no other entries for the Omaha Nighthawks elsewhere, but looking at the table, each row seems to represent a different team: Sacramento Mountain Lions, Hartford Colonials, Las Vegas Locomotives, and Florida Tuskers. So, only Row 1 is about Omaha.\n\nTherefore, the overall total for the Omaha Nighthawks in the table is indeed 144169, which matches the claim exactly. There's no conflicting information elsewhere because each row corresponds to a unique team.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked the table and found that the overall total for the Omaha Nighthawks is listed as 144169 in Row 1 under \"overall total.\" This directly supports the claim.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall total\"}\n  ]\n}",

The claim says they have a home average of 18125. \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to find where Sacramento Mountain Lions are mentioned. From the table, there's Row 2 which corresponds to them. In that row, under \"home avg\" it shows 18125. So their home average is indeed listed as 18,125.\n\nI should also check other rows just in case, but since only Row 2 has Sacramento Mountain Lions and the number matches exactly what the claim states, I don't need to look elsewhere. \n\nSo the relevant cells are from Row 2 where \"home avg\" is mentioned. That's it.\n</think>\n\nThe Sacramento Mountain Lions have a home average of 18125 as per the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home avg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"there be only 1 team that have an overall average of 12796.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table and find the overall average for each team. The overall avg column seems relevant here. Let me go through each team:\n\nRow 1: Omaha Nighthawks - Overall Avg: 18021\nRow 2: Sacramento Mountain Lions - Overall Avg: 16749\nRow 3: Hartford Colonials - Overall Avg: 14015\nRow 4: Las Vegas Locomotives - Overall Avg: 13388\nRow 5: Florida Tuskers - Overall Avg: 12796\n\nSo, only the Florida Tuskers have an overall average of exactly 12796. None of the other teams have this number. Therefore, there's only one team meeting the condition mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to verify which cells are relevant. The relevant column is \"overall avg,\" and we're looking for rows where this value equals 12796. That would be row index 5 (since row indices start at 0), so the row_index is 5 and column_name is \"overall avg.\"\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I checked each team's overall average.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the highest home total be 91143\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"highest home total.\" Looking at the table, each row represents a different team's home game statistics. The columns related to home games are \"home gms,\" \"home total,\" \"home avg,\" and \"top home crowd.\"\n\nNext, the number given in the claim is 91143. I need to check which team has this as their home total. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Team Omaha Nighthawks have a home total of 91143.\nRow 2: Sacramento Mountain Lions have a home total of 72500.\nRow 3: Hartford Colonials have a home total of 57462.\nRow 4: Las Vegas Locomotives have a home total of 40943.\nRow 5: Florida Tuskers have a home total of 37689.\n\nSo, the highest home total is indeed 91143 for the Omaha Nighthawks. Now, I need to check if this aligns with the claim. The claim says \"the highest home total be 91143.\" Since that's exactly what the table shows, it should be TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The \"home total\" column is key here. For each row, the home total is in the third position after \"home gms.\" So, for Row 1 (Omaha Nighthawks), the cell at row index 0 and column_name \"home total\" has the value 91143.\n\nI should list all rows' home totals as relevant because the claim doesn't specify which team. But wait, the claim refers to \"the highest,\" so only the Omaha Nighthawks have that. However, since the instruction is to check each condition against the table and determine which cells are relevant, I think I need to include all cells for \"home total\" across rows to verify that 91143 is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the cell where 91143 is found needs to be included. But the claim doesn't specify a team, so perhaps all \"home total\" columns should be considered to confirm that none have a higher value than 91143. But since in this case, it's the highest, maybe just the Omaha Nighthawks' cell suffices.\n\nWait, the user instruction says: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, 'FALSE'.\" Since 91143 is the maximum, it's TRUE. The relevant cells would be all \"home total\" columns because without checking all, we can't confirm it's the highest. So I should include all rows where \"home total\" exists.\n\nBut looking back at the table, each row has a \"home total,\" so all five teams have home totals. Therefore, to verify that 91143 is indeed the highest, we need to check all these cells and see that none exceed it.\n\nSo in the relevant_cells, I'll include each team's \"home total\" cell because collectively they show that Omaha Nighthawks have the highest.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"the highest home total be 91143\" is TRUE or FALSE, we first identify which teams' home totals are present in the table and verify if any exceed 91143.\n\n- **Row 1:** Team: Omaha Nighthawks, Home Total: 91143\n- **Row 2:** Team: Sacramento Mountain Lions, Home Total: 72500\n- **Row 3:** Team: Hartford Colonials, Home Total: 57462\n- **Row 4:** Team: Las Vegas Locomotives, Home Total: 40943\n- **Row 5:** Team: Florida Tuskers, Home Total: 37689\n\nSince all other home totals are lower than 91143, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning Row 4: team is Las Vegas Locomotives.\n\nNext, I need to check what their overall total is. In Row 4, under \"overall total\" it says 107104.

For example, Row 1 has \"home gms: 4\", \"home total: 91143\", \"home avg: 22785\". Similarly, other rows have similar breakdowns.\n\nFor the Florida Tuskers (Row 5), I'll look at their home average. The relevant column is \"home avg\". In Row 5, under home avg, it says 9422. That doesn't match 18,125. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim.

The overall avg for Florida Tuskers is 12,796, which is also not 18,125.\n\nI think I've checked all relevant cells. The home avg for Florida Tuskers is indeed 9422, and the overall avg is lower.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instruction about the highest home total being greater than 91143.0. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that \"the highest home total be greater than 91143.0.\" So I'm looking for the maximum value in the 'home total' column across all rows and checking if it's more than 91,143.0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are five teams: Omaha Nighthawks, Sacramento Mountain Lions, Hartford Colonials, Las Vegas Locomotives, and Florida Tuskers. Each team has a home gms (games), home total, home avg, top home crowd, etc., as well as road games, totals, averages, and overall stats.\n\nMy focus is on the 'home total' for each team because the claim is about the highest home total. I'll list out all the home totals from each row:\n\n1. Omaha Nighthawks: 91,143\n2. Sacramento Mountain Lions: 72,500\n3. Hartford Colonials: 57,462\n4. Las Vegas Locomotives: 40,943\n5. Florida Tuskers: 37,689\n\nNow, I need to find the highest home total among these. The first row has 91,143, which is the highest number in that column. So if the claim is about whether the highest home total is greater than 91,143.0, then it's directly comparing this value against itself.\n\nThe claim states that the highest home total is greater than 91,143.0. But since the highest home total is exactly 91,143.0 (as per Omaha Nighthawks' row), it doesn't exceed or go beyond that number. Therefore, the statement isn't true because 91,143 is not greater than itself; it's equal.\n\nHowever, I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed any other rows. The next highest is Sacramento with 72,500, which is significantly less. So yes, the highest is indeed 91,143, and that doesn't satisfy being greater than 91,143.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is false because the maximum home total isn't higher than 91,143; it's exactly equal.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with five rows, each representing a different team and their home and road game statistics. The claim is saying that there's more than one game with an average of 12796. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table and find all the 'home avg' and 'road avg' columns because those are the averages for each type of game. \n\nLooking at Row 1: Home avg is 22785, Road avg is 13256.\nRow 2: Home avg is 18125, Road avg is 15372.\nRow 3: Home avg is 14366, Road avg is 13664.\nRow 4: Home avg is 10236, Road avg is 16540.\nRow 5: Home avg is 9422, Road avg is 16169.\n\nNow I need to see how many of these averages are equal to or above 12796. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Both home and road avg are below 12796 (22785 is higher than 12796? Wait, no, 22k is higher than 12k. So home avg is over. Road avg is 13k, which is lower. So for this team, the home games have an average above 12k, but road doesn't.\n\n- Row 2: Home avg is 18k, which is above. Road avg is 15k, below.\n\n- Row 3: Both averages are below 12796? Let me check. Home avg 14k and road 13k. So both are below.\n\n- Row 4: Home avg is 10k, way below. Road avg is 16k, still below 12k?\n\nWait, no. 16k is higher than 12k. Wait, 12796 is the target. 16k is above that. So for Row 4, their road games have an average of 16540, which is more than 12796.\n\nRow 5: Home avg 9k, road avg 16k again. So Road avg in Row 5 is 16169, which is above 12k.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The claim is about games with an average of 12796. I need to see if any team has more than one game (either home or road) averaging at least 12796.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 1: Home avg 22785 >12796. So one game (all their home games, but each game's avg is considered individually? Or per row, as they have 4 home games with that average). Wait, the way it's structured, for each team, home gms and road gms are both 4, so four games each.\n\nBut the averages: For Row 1, home games have an average of 22785. Since 22785 is greater than 12796, that means all four home games for Omaha have an average above 12k. So each home game has a high attendance, but per the table, the 'home avg' is 22785, which is the average per home game. So for this team, their home games all contribute to that number.\n\nSimilarly, Row 2's home avg is 18125, which is above 12796. So each of their four home games has an average higher than 12k.\n\nRow 3: Home avg is 14366, which is less than 12796? Wait, no. 14k is more than 12k. So 14366 >12796. Therefore, Row 3's home games also have an average above the claimed threshold.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: Home avg 22785 (yes, >12796), Road avg 13256 (>12796? No, 13k is less than 12.8k? Wait no, 13k is higher than 12k. So 13256 is above 12796.\n\nWait, hold on. 13256 is 13 thousand, which is more than 12 thousand. So both home and road averages in Row1 are above 12k.\n\nRow2: Home avg 18125 (above), Road avg 15372 (also above).\n\nSo for each row:\n\n- Row1: Both home and road have averages above 12796.\n- Row2: Same, both above.\n- Row3: Home is 14366 (>12k). Road is 13664, which is also >12796. So both are above.\nWait, no. 13664 is 13k, so yes, it's above 12k. Wait, but the claim says \"average of 12796\". So if a game's average is 13664 or higher, that's over.\n\nBut wait, let me check each team:\n\nRow1: Home avg 22785 (over), Road avg 13256 (over).\nRow2: Home 18125, Road 15372.\nRow3: Home 14366, Road 13664. So both above 12k.\nWait no, 14366 is 14k and 13664 is 13k, so both are over 12k.\n\nSo for each team, their home and road games have averages higher than 12796? Let me check:\n\nRow1: Both >12796\nRow2: Both >12796\nRow3: Both >12796\nRow4: Home 10236 (<), Road 16540 (>)\nRow5: Home 9422 (<), Road 16169 (>\n\nSo Rows 1,2,3 have both home and road averages above 12796. That means each of these teams has multiple games with high attendance.\n\nBut the claim is about \"more than 1 game that have an average of 12796\". So do any individual games meet this? Or does it mean per team?\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted. The 'overall avg' for each row is given as well, but that's total points or something else. Wait no, in the table, columns are home gms, home total, home avg, etc. So each row represents a different team.\n\nThe claim is stating that there exists more than one game (either home or road) with an average of 12796.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any individual game where the average per game is at least 12,796.\n\nBut in the table, each row has 'home avg' and 'road avg', which are the averages across all their home games and all their road games, respectively.\n\nSo for example, Omaha has 4 home games, each with an average of 22,785. So that's four games, each averaging over 12k. Similarly, their road games have four games, each averaging over 12k.\n\nSo does this mean that the individual games meet the threshold?\n\nWait, perhaps the way it's worded is that there are multiple games (i.e., more than one game) across all teams where each such game has an average of at least 12796.\n\nAlternatively, for any given team, if they have four home games each averaging over 12k, then those four games are all above the threshold. So in Row1, there's four games, each with avg 22k. Similarly, in Row2 and Row3.\n\nSo across all teams, how many such games are there?\n\nEach of Rows 1-3 have four home games and four road games, each averaging over 12k. So that's for Rows1-3: 4+4=8 games (Row1), same for Row2 and Row3. So total of 24 games? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the question is whether there are more than one game(s) that have an average of at least 12796. So yes, in each team with home and road games above 12k, their individual games count as multiple games meeting the threshold.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- Row1: Four home games (each avg ~22k)\n- Row2: Four home games (~18k), four road games (~15k)\n- Row3: Four home games (~14k), four road games (~13k)\n\nEach of these has multiple games above 12,796. So total across all teams is a lot more than one.\n\nBut perhaps the question is whether any individual team has more than one game meeting this average. For Rows1-3, yes, each has eight games (four home and four road) averaging over 12k. So definitely more than one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about per team: does a team have multiple games (more than one) with the same average? But I think the question is about any game having an average of at least 12796.\n\nBut regardless, given that each of Rows1-3 has eight games above 12k, and perhaps Row4's road games also meet it, as well as Row5's road games, then yes, there are multiple games (more than one) meeting the criteria.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The 'home avg' for a team is the average of their home games, and similarly for road. So each game within those is contributing to that average. Therefore, if the team's home avg is over 12k, each individual home game has an average of at least 12k.\n\nWait no, not necessarily. Suppose a team has four home games with total attendance of 4 times (let's say) some number, and their home avg is 22,785. So each home game contributes to that. So each game would have an average of around ~5-6k per game? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait no: if a team has four home games, and the total attendance across those four games is, say, 4 x something, then their home avg is that number divided by 4. So for Row1, the 'home total' isn't given, only 'home avg'. Wait, wait the table structure:\n\nFor each row (team), it lists:\n\n- Home gms: Number of home games\n- Home total: Total attendance across all home games\n- Home avg: Average per home game\n\nSame for road.\n\nSo for Row1, let's say they have four home games. Their 'home total' is the sum of attendances across these four games. The 'home avg' is that total divided by 4.\n\nSo if their home avg is 22,785, then each home game has an average attendance of 22,785 per game? That doesn't make sense because attendances usually can't be higher than that for individual games unless they are multiple games with high attendance. Wait, no: the 'home avg' is a per-game average.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. The 'home total' is likely the sum of all home game attendances, and the 'home avg' is that divided by the number of home games. So for Row1, if home avg is 22,785, then (sum of home game attendances)/4 = 22,785. So each home game must have had attendance around 5-6k, but wait, how can that sum to a higher average? Wait no, if you have four games with high attendance, their total would be 4 times that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is: the 'home avg' and 'road avg' are per-game averages for those categories. So each home game has an average of home_avg attendees.\n\nThus, if a team's home_avg is 22,785, then each of their four home games had on average 22,785 attendees.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because each game would be attended by that many people, but it's more likely that total attendance across all home games is (home_avg x home_gms). So for Row1, if home_gms=4 and home_avg=22,785, then total home_attendance = 4 * 22,785 = 91,140. Similarly for road.\n\nBut the point is, each individual home game would have had an average of 22,785 attendees per game. That's a lot, but that's just how the data is presented.\n\nSo in any case, if a team has four home games, each with an average of over 12k attendees, then those four games are all above the threshold. So for Rows1-3, their home and road games meet this.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple games (more than one) meeting the criteria, so the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nYes, there are more than one game(s) with an average attendance of at least 12795 attendees across all teams. Specifically, each of the first three teams has eight games (four home and four away) that meet this criterion.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, there are multiple games meeting the criteria.",
