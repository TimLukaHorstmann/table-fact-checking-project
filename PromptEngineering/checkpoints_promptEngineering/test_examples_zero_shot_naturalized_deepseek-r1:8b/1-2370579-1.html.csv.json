Looking at the column named \"originalairdate,\" row 7 says \"9 november 1966.\" That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't any other relevant cells. The title is correct, and the air date matches.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"jeremy summer direct the episode written by tony o'grady (pseudonym of brian clemens).\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Jeremy Summer directed an episode that was written by Tony O'Grady, who is a pseudonym for Brian Clemens.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, production number, title, director, writer(s), original air date, and filming dates. My task is to find if there's any episode where Jeremy Summer is listed as the director and the writer is either Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for the directors named Jeremy Summer. From a quick look, I see that in rows 19, 20, and others, the directors are different people like Don Chaffey, Robert Asher, etc. But specifically, I remember seeing \"Jeremy summer\" (with a lowercase 's') as a director in some episodes.\n\nLooking through the table more carefully, row 28: episode 29 is directed by Jeremy Summer, and written by Terry Nation. Hmm, but that's not the writer we're looking for; we need Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens.\n\nWait, I might have misread something. Let me check each occurrence where Jeremy Summer is the director.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n- Row 19: Episode 19, directed by Don Chaffey.\n- Row 20: Directed by Robert Asher.\n- ...\n- Row 28: Directed by Roy Baker.\n- Row 29: Directed by Robert Asher.\n- Wait, no. I think I might have missed where Jeremy Summer is the director.\n\nWait, let me go row by row again.\n\nRow 0: Episode 0, directed by someone else.\n...\nRow 12: Directed by Robert Asher.\nRow 15: Don Chaffey.\nRow 16: Robert Asher.\nRow 17: Roy Baker.\nRow 18: Don Chaffey.\nRow 19: Robert Asher.\nRow 20: Robert Asher.\nRow 21: Robert Asher.\nRow 22: Roy Baker.\nRow 23: Quentin Lawrence.\nRow 24: Robert Asher.\nRow 25: Robert Tronson.\nRow 26: Roy Baker.\nRow 27: Robert Tronson.\nRow 28: Roy Baker.\nRow 29: Robert Ascher.\n\nWait, maybe I was confused earlier. It seems Jeremy Summer isn't listed as a director in the table provided. Or perhaps I need to check again.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table, in row 0, the directors are listed as \"Don chaffey\", \"don chaffey\", etc., but I don't see any rows where the director is Jeremy Summer. So maybe the claim is incorrect because there's no episode directed by Jeremy Summer written by Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens.\n\nBut wait, in row 28: Episode 29, the title is \"the man outside,\" directed by Roy Baker, and written by Terry Nation. No match there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed an entry. Let me check each director:\n\n- Don Chaffey\n- Robert Asher\n- Robert Tronson\n- Quentin Lawrence\n- Roy Baker\n- Robert asher (same as above)\n- others: Donald Chaffey, Robert Ascher, etc.\n\nNo Jeremy Summer listed as a director in the table. Therefore, the claim is likely FALSE because there's no evidence in the table that Jeremy Summer directed any episode written by Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The claim says \"jeremy summer\" with a lowercase 's'. Maybe it's a typo for \"Jeremy Summer\" (with an uppercase 'S'). But even then, from the table, there's no such director listed as Jeremy Summer. So regardless of the name, the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jeremy Summer directed an episode written by Tony O'Grady (a pseudonym for Brian Clemens). Upon reviewing the table, there is no entry where Jeremy Summer is listed as a director and Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens as a writer. Therefore, the claim is unsupported.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:** The relevant columns are \"director\" because we need to check if Jeremy Summer directed any episode, and the writers column to see if Brian Clemens wrote an episode under a pseudonym.\n\n2. **Scan Each Row for Matches:**\n   - For each row, check if the director is Jeremy Summer.\n   - Check the writer(s) field to see if Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens are listed.\n\n3. **Find No Matches:**\n   - None of the rows indicate that Jeremy Summer directed any episode.\n   - No episode is written by Tony O'Grady or Brian Clemens in conjunction with a Jeremy Summer directing.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since no such episodes exist in the table, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\nNo cells are relevant because there's no matching data in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"during jul / aug 1966 , storm warn (part one) be film.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim correctly. It seems to say that in July/August 1966, there was a film titled \"Storm Warn (Part One).\" Looking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like production number, title, director, writer, airdate, and filming period.\n\nI'll need to check if any episode matches both the title and the date range. The claim specifies July/August 1966 as the timeframe for the filming or airing of \"Storm Warn (Part One).\"\n\nLooking through the table, I should scan each row's originalairdate and filmed columns to see if there's a match.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Title is \"Countdown,\" not matching. Filming in Oct 1966, so date doesn't fit either.\n\nRow 2: Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Airing on Jan 25, 1967.

The claim states: \"On 30 November 1966, the episode 'the kill (part two)' originally aired.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be verified. The claim refers to an episode titled \"the kill (part two)\" airing on 30 November 1966. So, I should look for this specific episode in the table and check if its original air date matches that of 30 November 1966.\n\nLooking through each row of the table, I'll search for any mention of the episode \"the kill (part two)\". Scanning down, I notice that Row 7 has the title \"the killing (part two)\" directed by Cyril Frankel and written by Terry Nation, with an original air date on 29 March 1967. That's not the episode we're looking for.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's another row? Let me double-check. Row 8 is about \"roundabout,\" Row 9 is \"the man outside,\" Row 10 is \"countdown,\" and so on. Hmm, it seems like I might have missed an entry. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nContinuing the search, I reach Row 12: \"you can't win them all.\" No, that's not it either. Wait, maybe I skipped a row. Let me count again. \n\nWait, upon reviewing, I realize I might have overlooked some rows. For example, Row 6 is about \"the high terrace,\" Row 7 is \"the seven eyes of night,\" and so on. Actually, when I initially went through the table, I didn't find an episode titled \"the kill (part two).\" Maybe there's no such entry, which would mean that the claim is false because the specified episode doesn't exist in the provided data.\n\nBut hold on, perhaps the title was spelled slightly differently? The claim says \"the kill,\" while in the table, I see Row 7 has \"the killing.\" Is there a possibility of a misspelling or another part where it's written differently?\n\nLooking back, the closest match is Row 7: \"the killing (part two).\" The titles are similar but not identical. The claim refers to \"the kill,\" which might be a different episode or possibly a typo. Therefore, since there's no exact match in the table for \"the kill (part two)\" on 30 November 1966, the claim is likely false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any other row has an air date of 30 November 1966 and matches the episode title. Scanning through, I see that Row 29 refers to \"countdown\" airing on 12 April 1967. No match there either.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since there's no evidence in the table supporting the claim, the answer must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The episode was written by Tony O'Grady, who is a pseudonym for Brian Clemens.\n\nI need to check each part against the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part: looking for episodes directed by John Moxey. I'll scan through each row's \"directed by\" column. \n\n- Row 2: Directed by John Moxey.\n- Row 4: Directed by John Moxey.\n- Row 13: Directed by John Moxey.\n\nSo, there are multiple episodes where John Moxey was the director.\n\nNow, for the second part: checking if any of these episodes were written by Brian Clemens under the pseudonym Tony O'Grady.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions a specific episode titled \"'There's Somebody Close Behind You,\" which was supposed to have been filmed during July or August 1966 and aired on that same date in November 1966 according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find an episode with the exact title \"there 's somebody close behind you.\" Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 14: The title matches exactly.
