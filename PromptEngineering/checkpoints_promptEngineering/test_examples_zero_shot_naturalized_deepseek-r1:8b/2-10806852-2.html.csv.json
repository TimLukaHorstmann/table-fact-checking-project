Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"April 1939, Hawthorn destroyed North Melbourne, 17 to 11.\" So, breaking this down, it mentions two teams, Hawthorn (home) and North Melbourne (away), with scores of 17 and 11 respectively. The date is April 1939.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see each row represents a different game on that specific date. Each row includes home team, their score, away team, away's score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the relevant information.\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 17.13 (115) against North Melbourne who scored 11.11 (77). The date is 29 April 1939. This matches the claim's teams, scores, and date.\n\nRows 2-6 don't have Hawthorn or North Melbourne playing each other, so they can be ignored for this check.\n\nNext, I'll identify which cells are relevant. The key points to verify are:\n\n1. Home team is Hawthorn.\n2. Away team is North Melbourne.\n3. Score is Hawthorn 17 vs North Melbourne 11.\n4. Date is April 1939.\n\nFrom the table:\n- In Row 1, home team is Hawthorn and away is North Melbourne.\n- The scores are exactly 17.13 (115) for Hawthorn and 11.11 (77) for North Melbourne.\n- The date matches as 29 April 1939.\n\nTherefore, all the claim's points are supported by Row 1 of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the largest crowd to attend a VFL game was at the Richmond versus Footscray game.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find information about each game's crowd size. Each row in the table represents a different game, listing details like home team, scores, venue, crowd number, and date.\n\nI'll start by examining each row:\n\nRow 1: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne had a crowd of 11,000.\nRow 2: Fitzroy vs St Kilda had 15,000 attendees.\nRow 3: Essendon vs Melbourne saw 20,000 people.\nRow 4: Richmond vs Footscray attracted 26,000 fans.\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs Collingwood had 17,000 spectators.\nRow 6: Geelong vs Carlton drew in 15,000.\n\nFrom this, I can see that the Richmond game (Row 4) has the highest crowd number of 26,000. The claim mentions that this was the largest, so I need to verify if all other games had smaller crowds. \n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- Hawthorn: 11k\n- Fitzroy: 15k\n- Essendon: 20k\n- Richmond: 26k\n- South Melbourne: 17k\n- Geelong: 15k\n\nAll of these are indeed less than 26,000. Therefore, the claim that Richmond vs Footscray had the largest crowd is correct.\n\nNow, to identify which cells in the table support this claim. The relevant information is in Row 4, specifically under the \"crowd\" column. So, I'll need to include row_index=4 and column_name=\"crowd\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data, as Richmond's game had the highest crowd.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false by looking at the table provided. The claim says: \"the lowest attended game be hawthorn versus north melbourne , with 11000 in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows and columns are relevant. The key elements here are \"lowest attended game,\" \"hawthorn versus north melbourne,\" and the attendance figure \"11000.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Each row has home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date.\n- So, I should focus on the 'crowd' column for each relevant game.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones involve Hawthorn as the home team against North Melbourne.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Hawthorn, away is North Melbourne. The crowd is 11000. That's exactly the game mentioned in the claim. But I need to check if this is indeed the lowest attendance across all games on that date.\n\nWait, but there are multiple rows with different attendances:\n- Row 1: 11,000\n- Row 2: 15,000\n- Row 3: 20,000\n- Row 4: 26,000\n- Row 5: 17,000\n- Row 6: 15,000\n\nSo the lowest attendance is indeed in Row 1, which matches the claim's crowd number. But I need to make sure that no other game has a lower attendance. Since all others are higher or equal, 11,000 is the smallest.\n\nHowever, wait\u2014the claim says \"the lowest attended game be hawthorn versus north melbourne.\" So not only does their game have low attendance, but it's the lowest overall. The claim doesn't specify if it's the absolute lowest or just that Hawthorn vs North Melbourne had 11k. But from the data, since 11k is lower than all others, including other games, then yes, it's the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because in their game, the attendance was 11,000 and that's indeed the lowest across all games listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the provided table. The attendance for Hawthorn versus North Melbourne is 11,000, which is the lowest among all games listed. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest scoring game be when richmond play footscary , richmond score 20.19.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of this claim and verify it against the table.\n\nLet me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It mentions that there's a game where Richmond plays Footscray, and in that game, Richmond scores 20.19 points. The word \"highest scoring game\" suggests that this might be the highest-scoring game overall in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has six rows, each representing a different match on April 29, 1939. Each row includes information about both home and away teams, their scores, the venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nI need to check if there's a match where Richmond plays Footscray and Richmond scores exactly 20.19. Also, I should see if this score is indeed the highest among all games listed in the table.\n\nFirst, let's find the row where Richmond is the home team and Footscray is the away team. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Hawthorn (home) vs North Melbourne (away)\nRow 2: Fitzroy (home) vs St Kilda (away)\nRow 3: Essendon (home) vs Melbourne (away)\nRow 4: Richmond (home) vs Footscray (away)\nRow 5: South Melbourne (home) vs Collingwood (away)\nRow 6: Geelong (home) vs Carlton (away)\n\nYes, Row 4 is the match between Richmond and Footscray. Now, checking their scores. Richmond's score is listed as 20.19 (139), which matches part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to see if this is the highest-scoring game in the table. To do that, I'll compare all the home and away team scores across all rows.\n\nLet me list out all the scores:\n\n- Row 1: Hawthorn 17.13 (115), North Melbourne 11.11 (77)\n- Row 2: Fitzroy 14.18 (102), St Kilda 20.14 (134)\n- Row 3: Essendon 19.21 (135), Melbourne 21.15 (141)\n- Row 4: Richmond 20.19 (139), Footscray 17.8 (110)\n- Row 5: South Melbourne 15.17 (107), Collingwood 21.20 (146)\n- Row 6: Geelong 14.8 (92), Carlton 11.13 (79)\n\nNow, the highest score would be the highest total points from any team in any game. Let's see:\n\nIn Row 2, St Kilda scores 134.\nIn Row 3, Melbourne scores 141.\nRow 4: Richmond 139.\nRow 5: Collingwood 146.\nRow 6 doesn't have a higher score.\n\nSo the highest score is 146 by Collingwood against South Melbourne in Row 5. That's higher than Richmond's 20.19 (139).\n\nTherefore, while the claim correctly identifies that Richmond scored 20.19 against Footscray, it incorrectly states this as the highest-scoring game when actually Collingwood scored more.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the score mentioned isn't the highest in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the highest score was achieved by Collingwood, not Richmond. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"All the VFL game play on April 29, 1939 have more than 10,000 crowd in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each row of the table to check the crowd numbers. The relevant information here is the 'crowd' column for each game on that specific date.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. Row 1: Crowd is 11,000.\n2. Row 2: Crowd is 15,000.\n3. Row 3: Crowd is 20,000.\n4. Row 4: Crowd is 26,000.\n5. Row 5: Crowd is 17,000.\n6. Row 6: Crowd is 15,000.\n\nThe claim states that all games have more than 10,000 attendees. Now, let's check each crowd number against this:\n\n- Row 1 has 11,000, which is more than 10,000.\n- Row 2 has 15,000, also above 10,000.\n- Row 3: 20,000 \u2013 yes.\n- Row 4: 26,000 \u2013 definitely above.\n- Row 5: 17,000 \u2013 that's above 10k as well.\n- Row 6: 15,000 \u2013 again above.\n\nWait a minute, all of them are over 10,000. But the claim says \"more than 10,000.\" So does 11,000 count? Yes, because it's more than 10,000. \n\nHowever, I should double-check if there's any row where the crowd is 10,000 or less. From the table provided, all the crowds are above 10k. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any rows. There are six games listed for April 29, 1939.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. Let's break down the claim first: \"April 29, 1939, Essendon destroy North Melbourne, 17 to 11.\"\n\nLooking at the claim, I see it mentions a date (April 29, 1939), two teams (Essendon and North Melbourne), and the scores (17 to 11). My goal is to find cells in the table that match these criteria.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row of the table to locate Essendon as the home team. In Row 3, I see that Essendon is listed with a score of 19.21 (135). Hmm, but the claim mentions 17.11, which doesn't match this. Wait, perhaps North Melbourne is the away team in another row.\n\nNext, checking each row for North Melbourne as the away team. In Row 1, the home team is Hawthorn, and the away team is North Melbourne with a score of 11.11 (77). That's 11 goals, but the claim says \"17 to 11.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be implying that Essendon scored 17 and North Melbourne scored 11, but looking at Row 3 again, Essendon actually scored 19.21, which is higher than 17.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to check if any row has Essendon as the home team and North Melbourne as the away team with scores around 17 and 11 respectively. Let's look through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Hawthorn (home) vs North Melbourne (away) \u2013 scores are Hawthorn 17.13, North Melbourne 11.11.\n- Row 2: Fitzroy (home) vs St Kilda (away).\n- Row 3: Essendon (home) vs Melbourne (away). Doesn't match the teams in the claim.\n- Row 4: Richmond (home) vs Footscray (away).\n- Row 5: South Melbourne (home) vs Collingwood (away).\n- Row 6: Geelong (home) vs Carlton (away).\n\nSo, only Row 1 has North Melbourne as the away team. The home team in that row is Hawthorn, which doesn't match Essendon from the claim. Therefore, there's no match where Essendon plays North Melbourne on April 29, 1939 with those scores.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. In Row 1: Hawthorn (17.13) vs North Melbourne (11.11). The claim is about Essendon destroying North Melbourne, but the only game involving North Melbourne is this one where Hawthorn scored higher. So the teams don't match.\n\nAlso, in the claim, the scores are 17 to 11. In Row 1, Hawthorn scored 17 and North Melbourne scored 11, which fits that part. But since the home team isn't Essendon, the overall claim doesn't hold because it's about Essendon, not Hawthorn.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no match in the table where Essendon plays North Melbourne on April 29, 1939 with those scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific match involving Essendon and North Melbourne with given scores. Upon reviewing the table, the only game matching the score (17-11) occurs between Hawthorn and North Melbourne, not Essendon.

The claim says, \"the largest crowd to attend a VFL game was at the Richmond versus Collingwood game.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The VFL (Victorian Football League) had several games on April 29, 1939, as shown in the table. Each row represents a different match between two teams, with details like home team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe key points to verify are:\n1. Did a Richmond vs Collingwood game happen?\n2. Was this game the one with the largest crowd?\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the home team is Richmond and the away team is Collingwood. Let me scan each row:\n\n- Row 1: Hawthorn (home) vs North Melbourne\n- Row 2: Fitzroy vs St Kilda\n- Row 3: Essendon vs Melbourne\n- Row 4: Richmond (home) vs Footscray\n- Row 5: South Melbourne vs Collingwood\n- Row 6: Geelong vs Carlton\n\nWait, in row 5, the home team is South Melbourne and away is Collingwood. That's not Richmond vs Collingwood. So, does a Richmond vs Collingwood game exist in this table? It seems like row 4 has Richmond as home against Footscray, so no match between Richmond and Collingwood here.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"Richmond versus Collingwood,\" but looking at the table, there's only one game involving Richmond: against Footscray (row 4), with a crowd of 26,000. Meanwhile, in row 5, South Melbourne plays Collingwood, with a crowd of 17,000.\n\nBut wait, I might have misread. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 1: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne\nRow 2: Fitzroy vs St Kilda\nRow 3: Essendon vs Melbourne\nRow 4: Richmond vs Footscray\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs Collingwood\nRow 6: Geelong vs Carlton\n\nSo, yes, only row 5 has Collingwood as the away team, but it's against South Melbourne. There's no match between Richmond and Collingwood in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there isn't a Richmond vs Collingwood game on that date with the crowd data provided. Also, even if there were, we need to check which had the largest crowd.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the largest crowd,\" so maybe I should check all games' crowd sizes:\n\nRow 1: 11,000\nRow 2: 15,000\nRow 3: 20,000\nRow 4: 26,000\nRow 5: 17,000\nRow 6: 15,000\n\nSo the largest crowd is in row 4, Richmond vs Footscray with 26,000. But the claim says the largest was Richmond vs Collingwood, which isn't even in the table as a game. So the claim is definitely false because that specific match didn't happen on this date, and also, the largest crowd wasn't for that particular matchup.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there is no Richmond vs Collingwood game listed in the table, and the largest crowd attended a different game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the lowest attended game be essendon versus north melbourne , with 15000 in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems to say that Essendon vs North Melbourne had the lowest attendance, specifically 15,000 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different match. Each row has the following columns: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd (attendance), and date.\n\nI need to identify which rows are Essendon vs North Melbourne matches and check their attendance numbers.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 1: Hawthorn (home) vs North Melbourne (away).

Attendance is 15,000.\n\nNow, looking for Essendon vs North Melbourne. From the table, I don't see a row where Essendon is home against North Melbourne. Essendon's match in Row 3 is against Melbourne, and North Melbourne plays Hawthorn in Row 1.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check both home and away scenarios because the claim doesn't specify who was the home team. So perhaps the match could be either way. But in the table, there's no Essendon vs North Melbourne game on April 29, 1939. The closest is Hawthorn vs North Melbourne (Row 1) with attendance 11,000.\n\nSo, if I consider all possible matchups:\n\n- Home team: Essendon, Opponent: North Melbourne. But in the table, there's no such match on that date.\n- Alternatively, maybe it's North Melbourne as home against Essendon? But again, looking at the rows, there's no such match on April 29, 1939.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim says \"the lowest attended game be essendon versus north melbourne.\" It doesn't specify which team was home or away, but in the table, Essendon is only listed as playing Melbourne at Row 3. So there's no match between Essendon and North Melbourne on that date.\n\nBut also, the claim mentions that the attendance was 15,000. From the table, I see two matches with 15,000 attendees: Fitzroy vs St Kilda (Row 2) and Geelong vs Carlton (Row 6). Neither of these are Essendon vs North Melbourne.\n\nSo, the claim is stating that the lowest attended game was Essendon vs North Melbourne with 15,000 attendees. However, from the table:\n\n- There's no Essendon vs North Melbourne match on April 29, 1939.\n- The attendance numbers don't show 15,000 for a match between Essendon and North Melbourne.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no such game in the table, and even if we assume it exists, the 15,000 figure doesn't align with any such game on that date.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is suggesting that the lowest attendance across all games was 15,000 for Essendon vs North Melbourne. But looking at the crowd numbers:\n\n- Hawthorn vs North Melbourne: 11,000\n- Fitzroy vs St Kilda: 15,000\n- Essendon vs Melbourne: 20,000\n- Richmond vs Footscray: 26,000\n- South Melbourne vs Collingwood: 17,000\n- Geelong vs Carlton: 15,000\n\nThe lowest attendance is 11,000 (Row 1). So the claim's assertion about Essendon vs North Melbourne having 15,000 attendees isn't correct because that's not even the lowest. The actual lowest was 11,000.\n\nSo, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there was a match between Essendon and North Melbourne with an attendance of 15,000 on April 29, 1939. From the table:\n\n- **Essendon** played against **Melbourne** (Row 3) with 20,000 attendees.\n- **North Melbourne** played against **Hawthorn** (Row 1) with 11,000 attendees.\n\nNo match between Essendon and North Melbourne exists in the table. Additionally, the lowest attendance was 11,000, not 15,000 for such a game. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a sports game is true or false based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the highest scoring game be when richmond play footscary , richmond score 19.21.\" So, the claim is making two assertions here. The first part says that this is the highest-scoring game when Richmond plays Footscray. The second part mentions that Richmond scored 19.21 points in that game.\n\nNow, I need to verify both parts using the table provided. Let me go through each row of the table to find any matches with Richmond playing Footscray and check their scores.\n\nLooking at Row 4: Home team is Richmond with a score of 20.19 (139), and the away team is Footscray with 17.8 (110). That's one potential match, but in this game, Richmond scored 20.19, not 19.21 as claimed. So that doesn't align with the claim.\n\nI'll continue checking other rows to see if there are any other games involving Richmond and Footscray. Skimming through Rows 1 through 6, I don't see another instance where Richmond plays Footscray. Each row seems to have different home and away teams. For example, Row 2 has Fitzroy vs. St Kilda, Row 3 Essendon vs. Melbourne, and so on.\n\nSince there's only one game in the table where Richmond faces Footscray, and in that game, their score was higher than what's claimed (20.19 vs. 19.21), the claim doesn't hold up. Additionally, I should check if any other rows have a score of 19.21 to see if maybe another team scored that, but from the table, no such score exists.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The highest-scoring game involving Richmond and Footscray had Richmond scoring more than 19.21, and there's no evidence of a game where Richmond scored exactly 19.21.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify that Richmond played against Footscray and that Richmond scored 19.21 in that game.\n\n1. **Finding the relevant row:**\n   - Check each row for \"richmond\" as the home team and \"footscray\" as the away team.\n   - Found in Row 4: Home team is Richmond, score 20.19 (139), away team Footscray, score 17.8 (110).\n\n2. **Verifying the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Richmond scored 19.21. However, in the found row, Richmond's score was 20.19 (139).\n   - Therefore, the claimed score does not match the actual score.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the claimed score is incorrect and no other relevant game matches the claim, the statement is FALSE.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "claim": "all the vfl game play on april 29 1939 have more than 17000 crowd in attendance",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about the VFL games on April 29, 1939 is true or false based on the given table. The claim states that \"all the VFL game play on April 29 1939 have more than 17000 crowd in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being claimed here. It's saying that every single game played by the VFL teams on that specific date had a crowd size exceeding 17,000 spectators. My job is to check each row of the table provided and see if all the games meet this criterion.\n\nLooking at the structure of the table, each row represents a different game with details such as home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd number, and date. The key piece of information I need is the \"crowd\" number for each game because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Hawthorn (home) vs North Melbourne (away). The crowd was 11,000. Wait, that's below 17,000. So this game doesn't meet the criteria. But since the claim says \"all\" games must have more than 17k, even if just one doesn't, the entire statement is false.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Fitzroy (home) vs St Kilda (away). Crowd was 15,000. Again, this is below 17,000. So another game not meeting the claim's condition.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Essendon (home) vs Melbourne (away). Crowd was 20,000, which is above 17k. This one meets the condition.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Richmond (home) vs Footscray (away). Crowd was 26,000, well over 17k.\n\n5. **Row 5**: South Melbourne (home) vs Collingwood (away). Crowd was 17,000 exactly. Hmm, does \"more than\" include equal to or not? The claim says \"more than,\" so 17k is not more than 17k. Therefore, this also doesn't meet the condition.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Geelong (home) vs Carlton (away). Crowd was 15,000, which is below 17k.\n\nSo out of the six games, only two had crowds above 17,000: Essendon and Melbourne's game, Richmond and Footscray's game. The other four had crowds equal to or less than 17,000. Therefore, not all games meet the claim's condition.\n\nWait a second, but I need to double-check if any row might have been misread or if there's an error in my calculation. Let me verify each crowd number again:\n\n- Row1: 11k \u2192 <17k\n- Row2:15k\u2192<17k\n- Row3:20k\u2192>17k\n- Row4:26k\u2192>17k\n- Row5:17k\u2192not >17k\n- Row6:15k\u2192<17k\n\nYes, that's correct. So only two out of six games meet the 17k+ requirement.\n\nTherefore, since not all games had more than 17000 crowd in attendance, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that every game on April 29, 1939, had a crowd exceeding 17,000. By examining each row, it's clear that multiple games did not meet this threshold. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
