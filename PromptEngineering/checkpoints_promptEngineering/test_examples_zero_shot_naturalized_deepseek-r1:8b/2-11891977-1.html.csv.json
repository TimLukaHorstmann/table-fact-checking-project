The claim is: \"aracely ar\u00e1mbula be the nominee for best lead actress.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if any mention Aracely \u00c1rambula as a nominee in the category of Best Lead Actress.\n\nLooking at Row 2: It says the ceremony is TVyNovelas Awards, year 2001. The category is Best Lead Actress, the nominee is Aracely \u00c1rambula, and the result is nominated. So this row directly relates to the claim because it mentions her as a nominee in the specific category.\n\nI don't see any other rows where Aracely is mentioned or where the Best Lead Actress category has different nominees. So only Row 2 is relevant here.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check if Aracely \u00c1rambula was nominated for Best Lead Actress in 2001. From Row 2, she is indeed a nominee in that category.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nominee\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"in 2001 there be a category of best support actress.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. It has rows from 1 to 10, each with details about a ceremony called \"tvynovelas awards\" happening in 2001. Each row includes the year (which is 2001), the ceremony name, a category, a nominee, and whether they won or were nominated.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"best support actress.\" I need to check if this category exists in the table. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: best telenovela\nRow 2: best lead actress\nRow 3: best lead actor\nRow 4: best female villain\nRow 5: best male villain\nRow 6: best supporting actress\nRow 7: best supporting actor\nRow 8: best first actress\nRow 9: best first actor\nRow 10: best song for a telenovela\n\nYes, I see that there's a category called \"best supporting actress\" in Row 6. That means the table does include this category.\n\nNow, I should check what the claim is saying. It states that \"there be a category of best support actress.\" The wording is slightly different\u2014\"support\" versus \"supporting\"\u2014but it's pretty much the same thing. So since the table has \"best supporting actress,\" the claim is referring to an existing category.\n\nAlso, looking at Row 6, the nominee is Carmen Salinas and her result is \"nominated.\" But that doesn't matter for this claim because we're just checking if the category exists, not whether she won or was nominated.\n\nSo, all in all, the table confirms that there's a category called \"best supporting actress\" in 2001. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table includes a row (Row 6) with the category \"best supporting actress,\" confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"best supporting actress\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"Nailea Norvind be the nominee who won for best male villain.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see if Nailea Norvind is a nominee in the category of best male villain and whether she won.\n\nRow 1: year 2001, ceremony TVyNovelas Awards, category best telenovela, nominee Abr\u00e1zame muy fuerte, result won. No, that's about the telenovela itself, not acting categories.\n\nRows 2-9: I'll quickly scan through these to see if Nailea Norvind is mentioned anywhere else as a nominee in any other category. \n\nRow 4 mentions Nailea Norvind as the nominee for best female villain and she won. So that's about being a female villain, not male.\n\nNow, looking specifically at the best male villain category (Row 5), the nominee is C\u00e9sar \u00c9vora, who won. There's no mention of Nailea Norvind here. \n\nSo the claim says she was the nominee for best male villain and won. But according to the table, she's only in the female villain category. Therefore, the claim is false because she didn't win as a male villain.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Nailea Norvind won for best male villain, but she actually won for best female villain. She isn't listed as a nominee in the best male villain category.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"best female villain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"best male villain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the best support actress in 2001 had a tie.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to see if there's any information related to the best supporting actress category for 2001. Scanning through the rows, I notice that Row 6 corresponds to the best supporting actress. Let me check Row 6 details: year is 2001, ceremony is TVyNovelas Awards, category is best supporting actress, nominee is Carmen Salinas, and the result is nominated.\n\nWait, so in this row, the result is 'nominated', not that there was a tie. There's no mention of a tie anywhere else either. The claim says \"a tie,\" but according to the table, it just says she was nominated. No winners or runners-up are indicated except for the result as 'won' or 'nominated.' \n\nSince the table doesn't show any other nominee tied with her for that category, I can conclude that there wasn't a tie in 2001 for the best supporting actress award at the TVyNovelas Awards. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there was a tie for the best supporting actress in 2001. However, checking the table shows that Carmen Salinas was only nominated and didn't win or have any mention of a tie.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
