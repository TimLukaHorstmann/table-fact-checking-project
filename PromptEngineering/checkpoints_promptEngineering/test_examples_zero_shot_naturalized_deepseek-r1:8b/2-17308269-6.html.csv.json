    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is \"ann strother (g) be from connecticut.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find Ann Strother in the table. Looking at each row, Row 5 has a player named Ann Strother with position (g). So her data is in Row 5.\n\nNext, I need to check where she's from. In the table, there's a column called \"college / country / team.\" For Ann Strother, this column says \"connecticut.\" Wait, that's a state in the US. But sometimes \"Connecticut\" could refer to her college team or her nationality.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The table has another column called \"nationality,\" which might be more directly related to her country of origin. For Row 5, Ann Strother's nationality is listed as \"united states.\" So she's from the United States, not specifically Connecticut.\n\nBut in the \"college / country / team\" column, it says \"connecticut.\" That likely refers to her college because she played for the University of Connecticut's team. However, the claim is about her being from Connecticut, which would imply her nationality or birthplace.\n\nSo, the claim states that Ann Strother is from Connecticut, but according to the table, her nationality is United States, and she went to Connecticut State for college. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because her nationality isn't specifically Connecticut.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"ann strother (g) be from connecticut\" is based on the \"college / country / team\" column which mentions \"connecticut.\" However, Ann Strother's nationality is listed as \"united states,\" not Connecticut. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"Ann Strother (G) player be from Connecticut and be never play on Indiana Fever.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Ann Strother is from Connecticut.\n2. She has never played for the Indiana Fever.\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table to see if both conditions hold true or not.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row where the player's name is Ann Strother. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 5: pick: 5, player: ann strother (g), nationality: united states, new wnba team: atlanta dream, former wnba team: indiana fever, college / country / team: connecticut.\n\nSo, Ann Strother is in row 5. Now, check her nationality: it's United States, but the claim mentions Connecticut, which is a state in the U.S., so that part is correct. The \"college/country/team\" column lists Connecticut, which is likely referring to her college, so she's from there. So condition one is satisfied.\n\nNext, check if she has ever played for the Indiana Fever. Looking at the former WNBA team for Ann Strother: it says \"indiana fever.\" That means she did play for them in the past. Therefore, the second part of the claim that she \"never play[sic] on Indiana Fever\" is incorrect.\n\nSince both parts need to be true for the overall claim to be TRUE, and one condition fails, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
