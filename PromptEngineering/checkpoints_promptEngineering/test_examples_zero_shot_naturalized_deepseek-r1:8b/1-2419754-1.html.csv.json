    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. \n\nThe claim says: \"3 of the members of the Great Midwest Conference can be found before 1860.\" So, I need to check which institutions in the Great Midwest Conference were founded before 1860.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- **Row 1**: University of Cincinnati was founded in 1819.\n- **Row 2**: University of Dayton was founded in 1850.\n- **Row 3**: DePaul University was founded in 1898.\n- **Row 4**: Marquette University was founded in 1881.\n- **Row 5**: University of Memphis was founded in 1912.\n- **Row 6**: Saint Louis University was founded in 1818.\n\nWait, but the user didn't mention the Great Midwest Conference. I think that's a mistake because none of these institutions are part of the Big Ten or any conference known as \"Great Midwest.\" Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about another conference, which isn't specified here. \n\nGiven that, without knowing the actual members of the Great Midwest Conference, I can't accurately verify the claim. All the rows provided are for universities in various locations and founded at different times, but none of them seem to be part of a group where three were founded before 1860.\n\nWait, let me check each row's founding year:\n\n- Cincinnati: 1819 (before 1860)\n- Dayton: 1850 (before 1860)\n- DePaul: 1898 (after 1860)\n- Marquette: 1881 (after 1860)\n- Memphis: 1912 (after 1860)\n- Saint Louis: 1818 (before 1860)\n\nSo, among these six, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Saint Louis were founded before 1860. That's three institutions. However, if the claim is about a specific conference like the Great Midwest Conference, which I think might not exist or be a misnomer, then it's unclear.\n\nBut assuming that the table lists all the members of the Great Midwest Conference (which seems unlikely as most universities here are from different conferences), but based on the information given, three of them were founded before 1860. Therefore, if the claim is referring to these specific universities, it would be TRUE with relevant cells being the first three rows.\n\nHowever, without knowing whether these institutions are part of the same conference, it's a bit ambiguous. But since the user provided this table and didn't specify another one, I'll proceed under the assumption that these are the members in question.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated based on the founding years of the universities listed in the table. Among them, three (University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, and Saint Louis University) were founded before 1860. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Saint Louis University (Row 6) has an enrollment number of 13,785.\n\nTo find out if UC has 27,572 more students than SLU, I should subtract SLU's enrollment from UC's enrollment.\n\nCalculating that: 41,357 - 13,785 = 27,572.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems to refer to a group of institutions that are part of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC) and claims that five of these six joined the conference in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with details like nickname, location, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment, and the years they joined and left the GMC. The key columns here are \"joined\" and \"left.\"\n\nThe claim mentions \"the great midwest conference,\" but in the table, all institutions have their own nicknames and locations, but I don't see a specific column for conference affiliations. However, since the claim refers to the GMC, perhaps it's an assumed conference, so we'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nNow, I need to check each institution to see when they joined the GMC. According to the table:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: Joined in 1991.\n- University of Dayton: Joined in 1993.\n- DePaul University: Joined in 1991.\n- Marquette University: Joined in 1991.\n- University of Memphis: Joined in 1991.\n- Saint Louis University: Joined in 1991.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" So let's count how many joined in 1991.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Cincinnati: 1991\n- Dayton: 1993 (left in 1995)\n- DePaul: 1991\n- Marquette: 1991\n- Memphis: 1991\n- Saint Louis: 1991\n\nWait, all six joined by 1991 except Dayton, which joined in 1993. So that's five institutions (Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, Saint Louis) and one (Dayton) joined later.\n\nTherefore, the claim is that five of these six (excluding Dayton) joined in 1991. But according to the table, it's actually five out of six, since only Dayton didn't join until 1993. So the claim is correct: five institutions joined in 1991.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"5 out of the 6 institution that be in the great midwest conference join the conference in 1991.\" The wording might be a bit off, but the essence is that five joined in 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, yes, five did: Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, Saint Louis. Dayton joined in 1993, so not part of the five in 1991.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check when each institution joined the conference. Five institutions (University of Cincinnati, DePaul University, Marquette University, University of Memphis, and Saint Louis University) joined in 1991. The sixth, University of Dayton, joined in 1993.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Identify the six institutions in the table.\n2. Check each institution's \"joined\" year.\n3. Five have \"joined: 1991\", one (Dayton) has \"joined: 1993\".\n4.

It's stating that there are two public universities which are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So, my task is to check how many public institutions from the table are part of the GMC.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with details like nickname, location, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment, and joining and leaving years. The key columns for this claim are \"type\" and possibly others related to conferences, but since the table doesn't explicitly mention conference memberships beyond the years they joined and left, I might need to infer based on the \"joined\" column if applicable.\n\nThe claim is about public institutions that are members of GMC. So I need to identify which institutions in the table are public (type: public) AND were members of GMC during their time, but since the table only shows the years they joined and left, perhaps indicating that they were part of the conference at some point.\n\nWait, let me re-read the claim again: \"there be 2 public institution that be member of the great midwest conference.\" The key here is to find two public institutions in the table that are members of GMC. \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: type is public. When did it join and leave? Joined in 1991, left in 1995. So during those years, it was a member.\n2. University of Dayton: private, so irrelevant for this claim.\n3. DePaul University: private, same as above.\n4. Marquette University: private.\n5. University of Memphis: public. Joined 1991, left 1995. So, member.\n6. Saint Louis University: private.\n\nSo from the table, there are two public institutions: Cincinnati and Memphis.

The claim says, \"There be 2 institutions located within the state of Ohio that are members of the Great Midwest Conference.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It looks like it's listing various universities with details like their institution name, nickname, location, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment numbers, and when they joined and left a conference called \"Great Midwest Conference,\" probably.\n\nWait, but looking at the columns: the columns are institution, nickname, location, founded, type, enrollment, joined, left. So each row is an institution with its details.\n\nThe claim is about two institutions in Ohio that are members of the Great Midwest Conference. I need to check how many schools from Ohio are in this conference based on when they \"joined\" and \"left.\" But wait, the 'left' column is also 1995 for most, so maybe they rejoined later? Or perhaps the conference was disbanded and then reformed.\n\nWait, no, looking at the data: For example, University of Cincinnati (row 1) joined in 1991, left in 1995. Similarly, other schools like Dayton, DePaul, Marquette, Memphis, St. Louis all joined around 1991 but left by 1995. So perhaps the Great Midwest Conference was a short-lived entity or maybe it's a rebranding.\n\nBut wait, maybe the conference is something else. I'm not sure if the term \"Great Midwest Conference\" refers to an actual existing conference today because some of these schools are now in different conferences like the AAC, Big East, etc. So perhaps the data reflects their membership at some point in the past.\n\nHowever, focusing on the claim: it's about how many institutions in Ohio are currently members (or were members) of the Great Midwest Conference. From the table, I see two Ohio schools: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton. Both joined in 1991 but left in 1995. So they were part of the conference from 1991 to 1995.\n\nSo, are there exactly two institutions in Ohio that were members of the Great Midwest Conference? According to the table, yes\u2014Cincinnati and Dayton both joined.

The claim is: \"only 1 institution in the state of ohio be a member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the table provides. It lists six institutions with details like their nicknames, locations, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment numbers, and the years they joined and left the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nI should focus on Ohio because the claim is about Ohio. Looking at the table, I see that the University of Cincinnati is in Cincinnati, Ohio (Row 1). The other rows are for institutions in other states: Dayton (Ohio again but another row), Chicago (IL), Milwaukee (WI), Memphis (TN), and St. Louis (MO).\n\nWait, no, Row 2 is the University of Dayton, which is also in Ohio. So there are two institutions from Ohio in this table: UC and UD.\n\nBut the claim says only one institution from Ohio is a member of the Great Midwest Conference. Looking at the 'joined' and 'left' years, both UC and UD joined in 1991 and left in 1995. That means both were members during that time.\n\nSo, if both are from Ohio and were part of the conference, then the claim that only one is a member would be false. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells: I need the row indices for both UC and UD. Row 1 (UC) has columns like nickname, location, etc., but specifically the type, which might not matter. The key here is to identify their membership status in the conference.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the instructions, the table seems to list when they joined and left the conference. So for each institution, we need to see if they were members during 1991-1995, as both joined in '91 and left in '95. So any row where 'joined' is 1991 and 'left' is 1995 would be a member during that period.\n\nSo UC (Row 1) and UD (Row 2) both fit this. Therefore, both are members from Ohio in the conference during the specified time.\n\nHence, the claim that only one institution is a member from Ohio is false because there are two: UC and UD.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"only private institution be member of the great midwest conference.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that only private institutions are members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). So, my task is to check if all the institutions in the table that are part of the GMC are private and none of them are public.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an institution with various attributes like nickname, location, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment numbers, joined and left years. The key columns here for this claim would be the \"type\" column because it indicates whether the institution is public or private.\n\nNext, I need to identify which institutions are part of the GMC. From the data, each row has a \"joined\" year and a \"left\" year. It looks like all the rows have the same \"left\" year of 1995 except for the University of Cincinnati, which doesn't specify a left year but shows that it joined in 1991. Wait, no, looking again: actually, each row has a \"joined\" year and \"left\" year. So, for example, the University of Cincinnati joined in 1991 and didn't leave until 1995. Similarly, other institutions like Depaul University, Marquette University, University of Memphis, and Saint Louis University all left the conference in 1995.\n\nWait a second, so if they all left in 1995, does that mean they were part of the GMC during their joining years? I think so. So, the key is to check each institution's type (public or private) for those that joined around 1991 and 1993, etc., and see if all of them are private.\n\nNow, let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: University of Cincinnati - type: public. Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\nRow 2: University of Dayton - type: private. Joined in 1993, left in 1995.\nRow 3: Depaul University - type: private. Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\nRow 4: Marquette University - type: private. Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\nRow 5: University of Memphis - type: public. Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\nRow 6: Saint Louis University - type: private. Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\n\nSo, the claim says that only private institutions are members of the GMC. But looking at the table, there are two public institutions: University of Cincinnati and University of Memphis. Both joined the GMC in 1991 but didn't leave until 1995. So, according to this, both public institutions were part of the GMC during their time as members.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"only private institution be member of the great midwest conference\" is FALSE because there are also public institutions (public type) that were members.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because both University of Cincinnati and University of Memphis are public institutions that were members of the Great Midwest Conference during their tenures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Looking at the table, each row lists an institution with details like nickname, location, founding year, etc. The table has six rows, so there are six institutions in total.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"members,\" which implies more than one. So the conference likely includes multiple universities. But from the table, it seems only these six are part of it? Or maybe more? Hmm, perhaps I should assume that all six listed institutions are part of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nIf so, each of these six schools was founded at different times:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: 1819\n- University of Dayton: 1850\n- DePaul University: 1898\n- Marquette University: 1881\n- University of Memphis: 1912\n- Saint Louis University: 1818\n\nNow, the claim is about more than half (so at least three) being founded before 1860.\n\nLooking at their founding years:\n\n- Cincinnati: 1819 (before 1860)\n- Dayton: 1850 (before 1860, since 1860 is included in \"before\"? Wait, no. The claim says \"before 1860,\" so does 1850 count as before? Yes, because it's before the year 1860.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If a school was founded in 1850, that's before 1860, right? So both Cincinnati (1819) and Dayton (1850) are before 1860. Then DePaul is 1898, which is after; Marquette is 1881, also after; Memphis is 1912, after; Saint Louis is 1818, which is before.\n\nSo how many schools were founded before 1860?\n\n- Cincinnati: yes\n- Dayton: yes (1850)\n- Saint Louis: 1818, yes\n\nThat's three schools. Are there more? No, because DePaul, Marquette, and Memphis are all after 1860. So three out of six.\n\nMore than half would mean more than 3, since half of 6 is 3. So three is not more than half. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting \"more than half\" correctly. Half of six is 3, so more than half would be four or more. But we only have three schools before 1860. So the claim is FALSE because it's not true that more than half (i.e., at least four) were founded before 1860.\n\nBut wait, does \"members\" include all these six? Maybe I should check if there are more members in the conference beyond those listed here, but based on the table, it seems only these six. So yes, three out of six is exactly half, not more than half.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
