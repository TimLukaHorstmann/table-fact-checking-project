The claim says, \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be the only player to score 8 goals in the league.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which cells are relevant to verify this claim. The key elements here are \"player name\" and \"goals scored in the league.\" So, I'm looking for rows where the name is bok\u0161i\u0107 and the league column has a value of 8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective stats. Let me scan through each row to see if there's a match.\n\nRow 1: name is bok\u0161i\u0107, and league is 8. That matches exactly what we're looking for. So, this row is definitely relevant.\n\nNow, I should check if any other players have 8 goals in the league. If another player also has 8 or more, then bok\u0161i\u0107 wouldn't be the only one, making the claim false. Otherwise, if no one else has 8, it's true.\n\nLooking at the rest of the rows:\n\nRow 2: whelan has 4.\nRow 3: n\u00e9meth with 3.\nRow 4: ince has 2.\nRows 5-7 (queudrue, marinelli, mustoe) each have 2.\nRows 8-13 (deane, johnston, etc.) all have 1.\nRows 14-17 have 1 as well.\nRows 18-20: murphy and cambell have 0 or 1 in different cups but not league.\nRow 21: own goals have 1 in the league.\n\nSo, no other player besides bok\u0161i\u0107 has a league score of 8. Therefore, the claim is fully supported as TRUE because he's the only one with that number.\n\nI should list the relevant cells as per instructions.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in the fa cup\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's stating that Whelan is the sole player who scored exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup. So, my task is to check if any other players have scored 3 or more FA Cup goals according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with various stats: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The 'fa cup' column seems directly related to the claim since it tracks how many goals each player scored in the FA Cup.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check the 'fa cup' value for each player:\n\n- Row 1: Whelan has fa cup: 3.\n- Row 2: The next players have varying numbers. For example, N\u00e9meth has 1, Ince and Cooper have 1 each, Queudrue and Marinelli also 0, Mustoe same, Deane, Johnston, etc., all have 0 or 1. Then there are some with 0 in FA Cup.\n- Moving down, Windass, Southgate, Carbone, Ehiogu all have 0 in FA Cup.\n- Murphy has 0, Wilson and Cambell also 0 each.\n- The last row is \"own goals\" with fa cup:1.\n\nSo from this, Whelan is the only player with a value of 3 in the 'fa cup' column. None of the other players have scored 3 or more in FA Cup.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Whelan is the only one to score 3 goals in the FA Cup holds true based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as Whelan is uniquely listed with 3 FA Cup goals, and no other player shares this number. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"marinelli score 1 more total goal than johnston.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify where Marinelli and Johnston are listed. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 7 has the name marinelli.\n- Looking further, row 10 is johnston.\n\nNow, for each of these names, I need to check their total goals. According to the claim, Marinelli's total should be one more than Johnston's.\n\nLooking at Row 7: marinelli has a total of 2 goals (league: 2, fa cup:0, league cup:0).\nRow 10: johnston also has a total of 1 goal (league:1, fa cup:0, league cup:0).\n\nWait, no. Wait, row 10 shows johnston with total 1, while marinelli has total 2. So marinelli's total is indeed one more than johnston's.\n\nBut wait, looking again, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check the rows:\n\nRow 7: name: marinelli, league:2, fa cup:0, league cup:0, total:2.\nRow 10: name: johnston, league:1, fa cup:0, league cup:0, total:1.\n\nSo yes, Marinelli has a total of 2 and Johnston has 1. So the claim is true.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in the table, there are multiple players with the same last name or similar names. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct rows. For example, Row 7 is marinelli, and row 10 is johnston. So their totals are 2 and 1 respectively.\n\nWait, but in the table, some of these names might be duplicates or similar. But according to the data provided, each row has a unique name, so that shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, Marinelli's total is indeed one more than Johnston's.

The claim is: \"cambell score 1 less goal than ehiogu in the league\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It's got multiple rows with various columns like name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total goals. My main focus here is on the 'league' column since the claim mentions scoring goals \"in the league.\" \n\nI need to find the relevant cells for both Cambell and Ehiogu. Let me scan through each row. \n\nRow 20 has name: cambell, and the league value is 0. Wait, that's interesting because the claim says Cambell scores 1 less than Ehiogu in the league. So I need to check where Ehiogu is in the table.\n\nLooking further, I find Row 17 with name: ehiogu, and the league value is 1. According to the claim, Cambell's goals in the league should be 0 (since it's 1 less than Ehiogu's 1). \n\nChecking Row 20 again, Cambell indeed has a league goal count of 0. Ehiogu has 1. So 0 is exactly 1 less than 1. That matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other relevant rows that might contradict this. Let me check all rows for both names to ensure they don't have other league goals. \n\nFor Cambell, only Row 20 has league:0. For Ehiogu, only Row 17 has league:1. No other entries for these two players in the 'league' column. So their counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cambell scores 1 less goal than Ehiogu in the league.

That checks out because the claim says they scored 2 total goals.\n\nNext up is Marinelli. In Row 7, the name is Marinelli, and again, the 'total' is 2. So that also matches the claim.\n\nThen there's Mustoe. Checking Row 8, name: mustoe, 'total' is 2 as well. That fits too.\n\nNow, Queudrue. In Row 6, name: queudrue, and the 'total' is 2 here as well. So all four of them have a total of 2 goals.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure there are no other columns involved. The claim mentions \"score 2 total goal,\" which seems to refer to their overall goal tally, so the 'total' column is the relevant one. \n\nI don't see any discrepancies in their totals.

The claim says, \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for Bok\u0161i\u0107's row in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 1 has the name bok\u0161i\u0107. So, row index is 0 if we start counting from zero.\n\nIn this row, there are several columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The claim mentions scoring 8 goals in the league, so the relevant column here would be \"league\" because it shows how many goals he scored in the league.\n\nLooking at the \"league\" value for Bok\u0161i\u0107, it's 8. That matches exactly what the claim is stating\u2014so that part checks out.\n\nNow, I need to verify if he is indeed one of three players who scored 8 goals in the league.

There are no other players with 8 in the league column. That means he's not one of three players; he's the sole player with that number.\n\nSo, even though his league score is correct, the claim about being one of three isn't true because only he scored 8 goals in the league.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who scored 8 goals in the league.

The claim says: \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in any competition.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for Whelan in the table. Scanning through the names, I see that Whelan is in Row 2. Now, I need to check what competitions he has participated in and how many goals he scored.\n\nLooking at his row (Row 2), the columns are: name, league, fa cup, league cup, total. The values for him are:\n- name: whelan\n- league: 4\n- fa cup: 3\n- league cup: 0\n- total: 7\n\nWait, so in the FA Cup, he scored 3 goals. That's three goals in one competition. Now, I need to check if any other player also scored at least three goals in any competition.\n\nI'll go through each row and see if any other player has 3 or more goals in their respective competitions.\n\nRow 1: bok\u0161i\u0107 has total 8. Looking at the columns:\n- league:8\n- fa cup:0\n- league cup:0\n\nSo he scored 8 goals in the league, which is one competition with 8 goals. That's definitely more than 3.\n\nRow 2: whelan as discussed, FA Cup has 3 goals.\n\nRow 3: n\u00e9meth:\n- league:3\n- fa cup:1\n- league cup:2\nTotal:6\n\nSo he scored 3 in the league.\n\nRow 4: ince:\n- league:2\n- fa cup:1\n- league cup:0\nTotal:3\n\nHe scored 2 in the league and 1 in FA Cup. So that's more than 3? Wait, no, because 2+1=3 total, but per competition, it's 2 in league and 1 in FA.\n\nWait, actually, the columns are for different competitions. The 'league' column is goals scored in the main league, 'fa cup' is goals in FA Cup, 'league cup' is goals in League Cup. So each of these represents a separate competition.\n\nSo, if a player scored 3 goals in one competition (FA Cup or League), that would count as scoring 3 in that particular competition.\n\nSo Whelan scored 3 in FA Cup. Now, I need to see if any other player has scored at least 3 goals in any of their competitions.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 1: Bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 in the league.\n- Row 2: Whelan scored 3 in FA Cup.\n- Row 3: N\u00e9meth scored 3 in league.\n- Row 4: Ince scored 2 in league, 1 in FA. So he didn't score 3 in any single competition.\n- Row 5 to 7: Cooper, Queudrue, Marinelli each have 2 in league and 0 elsewhere.\n- Rows 8-15: Each of these players (Mustoe, Deane, Johnston, etc.) have at most 1 in the league or other competitions. For example, Deane has 1 in league, but that's it.\n- Row 16: Carbone also 1 in league.\n- Row 17: Ehiogu same as above.\n- Rows 18-19: Murphy and Wilson have 0 in some and 1 in others.\n- Row 20: Cambell has 0 in League, but 1 in FA Cup. So no.\n- Row 21: Own goals have 1 each in League and FA Cup.\n\nSo the only players who scored more than 2 goals in any competition are Bok\u0161i\u0107 (8), Whelan (3 in FA Cup), N\u00e9meth (3 in league).\n\nTherefore, Whelan is not the only player to score 3 goals in a competition. Bok\u0161i\u0107 also scored 8 in the league.\n\nSo the claim is false because there's at least one other player (Bok\u0161i\u0107) who scored more than 3 goals in their competition.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check each player for scoring three or more goals in any competition. Whelan scored 3 in FA Cup, and Bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 in league, so others besides Whelan have also scored \u22653 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

That's two goals too.\n\nMustoe: Row 8 also shows league: 2, so that's two goals.\n\nQueudrue: His row (Row 6) has league: 2 as well, so two goals again.\n\nSo all four of them have scored 2 goals each.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players in the table have scored 2 or more goals. Let me scan through the rest of the rows quickly.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Bok\u0161i\u0107 has total 8\u2014definitely more than two.\nRow 2: Whelan with total 7.\nRow 3: N\u00e9meth with total 6.\nRow 4: Ince with total 3.\nRow 5: Cooper already covered as 2.\nRow 6: Queudrue covered.\nRow 7: Marinelli done.\nRow 8: Mustoe done.\nRow 9 to Row 16: Each has either 1 or 0 in the league, FA Cup, and League Cup. None of them have two or more except maybe Own Goals at the end.\n\nWait, the last row (Row 21) is \"Own goals\" with league:1, fa cup:1, so total:2. But the claim doesn't mention him, so that's someone else who scored two goals but isn't listed in the claim. \n\nSo, even though Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue are the only ones mentioned, there's another player (Own Goals) who also scored 2 or more. Therefore, the claim is false because not only those four but someone else also did so.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each player named and ensure no others have two or more goals.\n\n1. **Cooper**: Total 2 goals.\n2. **Marinelli**: Total 2 goals.\n3. **Mustoe**: Total 2 goals.\n4. **Queudrue**: Total 2 goals.\n\nAdditionally, \"Own Goals\" also scored 2 goals, which isn't mentioned in the claim, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
