    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"When Twickenham Stoop be the venue on 28 March 2009, the score be 22 - 12.\" So, it's asserting two things: the venue was Twickenham Stoop and the score for that game was 22-12. \n\nFirst, I should check if there's a match on 28 March 2009 at Twickenham Stoop with a score of 22-12. Looking through the table rows, each row has several pieces of information: date, venue, opponent, result, tournament, and scored.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if any match all three criteria: date is 28 March 2009, venue is Twickenham Stoop, and score is 22-12.\n\nRow 17 says the date is 28 March 2009. Let's check what the venue was for that row. It lists venue as Twickenham Stoop. The result there is 22 - 12. So this seems to match all parts of the claim: correct date, correct venue, and the score matches.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other rows that also fit these criteria on 28 March 2009 at Twickenham Stoop with a score of 22-12. Scanning through, Row 17 is the only one matching all three aspects. So the claim is supported by this row.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because there's a match in the table that satisfies all the conditions of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true as there is an entry in the table for 28 March 2009 at Twickenham Stoop with a score of 22-12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking a table of data. The claim is: \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007 , where the score be 22 - 12.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two specific facts:\n1. The venue was \"twickenham stoop.\"\n2. The date was \"6 april 2007.\"\n3. The score was \"22 - 12.\"\n\nI need to check if these three pieces of information align in any row of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, venue, opponent, result, tournament, and scored. Since the claim doesn't mention the tournament or the opponent, I can focus on the date, venue, and score.\n\nI'll start by searching for rows where the date is \"6 april 2007.\" Scanning through the rows:\n- Row 1: date is 6 april 2007.\nGreat, this row has the date we're looking for. Now, check if the venue matches.\n\nIn Row 1, the venue is \"twickenham stoop,\" which matches the first part of the claim. Next, let's verify the score. The result in Row 1 is listed as \"30 - 28.\" That doesn't match \"22 - 12\" from the claim. So, the score doesn't align.\n\nSince one of the facts (the venue) matches but another (the score) does not, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to structure the relevant cells for verification:\n- The row index for Row 1 is 0.\n- The columns that are relevant here are \"date\" and \"venue.\" The \"result\" column doesn't match, so it's not included as a supporting fact.\n\nSo, the JSON should reflect only the correct rows and columns where the claim holds true. Since the score doesn't match, those cells aren't part of the supporting evidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
