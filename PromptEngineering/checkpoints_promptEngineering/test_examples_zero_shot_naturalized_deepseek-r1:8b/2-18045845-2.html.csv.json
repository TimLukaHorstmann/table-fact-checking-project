    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says that on two specific dates\u201423 January 2010 and 22 August 2012\u2014the result for the competition was a draw (denoted as 'd'). \n\nFirst, I should locate the rows corresponding to these dates in the table. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting with 23 January 2010: looking at Row 1, it's date: 2 Jan 2010, result: w. Then Row 3 is 23 Jan 2010. Scanning further, yes, Row 3 has date: 23 January 2010, result: d. So that matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, for 22 August 2012. I'll need to look through the rows until I find a date matching this. Let's see: Rows go up to Row 38, so I should check each row carefully. \n\nRow 26 is 22 August 2012. Checking the result there: it says result: l. So that doesn't match because 'l' means loss, not draw. Wait, but wait\u2014the claim says both results are 'd'. So for 22 August 2012, the result isn't a draw, which would mean the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check Row 26. It's date: 22 August 2012, result: l. Yes, that's correct. So only one of the two dates matches the result being 'd'. The other doesn't, so the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both competitions on 23 January 2010 and 22 August 2012 were draws (result 'd'). \n\n- **23 January 2010**: Found in Row 3, with result 'd'.\n- **22 August 2012**: Found in Row 26, but the result is 'l' (loss), not a draw.\n\nSince only one of the two results matches the claim, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"On 3 March 2010, the venue of the match was Damascus, Syria with a result of W.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I should search for any row where the date is 3 March 2010. I'll go through each row one by one until I find that exact date.\n\nStarting from row 1 to row 9: none of these dates mention March 2010 except row 5 and row 15. Wait, row 5 is March 3rd, but let me check the year. Oh no, row 5 says date: 3 March 2010, venue: Damascus, Syria, competition: 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification, result: W, score: 4-0. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, the key points are the date being 3 March 2010, the venue is Damascus, Syria, and the result is a win (W). All these conditions are met in row 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in row 5 corresponding to date, venue, and result.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
