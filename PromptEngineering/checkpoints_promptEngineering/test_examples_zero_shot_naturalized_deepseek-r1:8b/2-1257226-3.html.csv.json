    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"Guillermo Franco have a lower goal on March 1 2006 than October 8 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim mentions two specific dates: March 1, 2006 and October 8, 2005. It also mentions \"goals,\" so I should look into the 'goal' column in the table for these dates.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- **Row 2** corresponds to the date March 1, 2006. The goal here is listed as 2.\n- **Row 1** corresponds to October 8, 2005. The goal here is listed as 1.\n\nThe claim states that Guillermo Franco had a lower goal on March 1, 2006 than on October 8, 2005. Comparing the two goals:\n\n- On October 8, 2005 (Row 1), the goal was 1.\n- On March 1, 2006 (Row 2), the goal was 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the goal increased from 1 to 2. Therefore, Guillermo Franco did NOT have a lower goal on March 1, 2006 compared to October 8, 2005.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that these are indeed the correct rows. Let me double-check:\n\n- **Row 1:** date: 8 october 2005\n- **Row 2:** date: 1 march 2006\n\nYes, those correspond correctly. So, the goal on October 8, 2005 was lower than on March 1, 2006. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because he had a higher goal later.\n\nI should also note which columns are relevant. Since the claim refers to 'goal' in both dates, the relevant column is 'goal'. Therefore, I need to include these two rows as relevant cells.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- The claim is based on comparing goals at specific dates.\n- The goal on March 1, 2006 (Row 2) was higher than on October 8, 2005 (Row 1).\n- Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n- Relevant columns: 'goal' for both rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Guillermo Franco have the same score on March 1, 2006 and June 10, 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if any relate to Guillermo Franco's matches on those dates.\n\nStarting with Row 2: date is March 1, 2006. The goal is 2, venue is Pizza Hut Park in Frisco, US. Score is 1-0, result is 1-0, competition is friendly. It doesn't mention Guillermo Franco specifically, but I know that sometimes the player's name might be implied if it's their match.\n\nRow 3: June 10, 2009. This date doesn't immediately jump out as related to Guillermo Franco unless there was a known match on that day involving him. The venue is Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, but without specific information linking it to Franco, I can't assume this is his match.\n\nRows 4 and 5 are about the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which took place in July 2009, so they don't relate to March or June dates. Row 6 is September 2009, also not matching the given dates. Row 7 is May 2010, which doesn't fit either.\n\nI need to find if there's a match for Guillermo Franco on both specified dates. Since only Row 2 mentions a match on March 1, 2006, and none on June 10, 2009, unless the June date is also a match for him elsewhere in the table. Looking at all rows, I don't see another match on June 10, 2009. So, perhaps Franco didn't have matches on both dates.\n\nWait, maybe Row 3 is his match? Let me think. The date is June 10, 2009, and venue is Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. If that was a friendly match, it's possible that Franco could be the player involved, but without explicit mention, I can't be certain. Alternatively, if there's another row that hasn't been provided or isn't highlighted, but based on what's given, only Row 2 directly refers to March 1, 2006.\n\nAssuming that Guillermo Franco scored 1-0 in the match on March 1, 2006 (from Row 2), and if there was a match on June 10, 2009 where he scored similarly, but since the score isn't given for June 10, I can't confirm it. Therefore, without evidence of both scores being present, the claim is likely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Guillermo Franco had the same score on March 1, 2006, and June 10, 2009. From the table, only Row 2 (March 1, 2006) provides a score, which is 1-0. There's no data for June 10, 2009, so the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"Guillermo Franco have the same type of competition on goal 2 and goal 7.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. Each row has several columns: goal number, date, venue, score, result, and competition. My focus here is on comparing the competitions for goals 2 and 7 because the claim says they're the same type.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row step by step.\n\nStarting with Goal 2 (Row 2), the details are:\n- Goal: 2\n- Date: 1 March 2006\n- Venue: Pizza Hut Park, Frisco, United States\n- Score: 1 - 0\n- Result: 1 - 0\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nNow for Goal 7 (Row 7):\n- Goal: 7\n- Date: 24 May 2010\n- Venue: Wembley Stadium, London, England\n- Score: 2 - 1\n- Result: 3 - 1\n- Competition: Friendly\n\nSo both goal 2 and goal 7 have the competition type as \"Friendly.\" That would mean the claim is true because their competitions match. \n\nWait, but I should double-check to ensure there are no other factors that might affect this conclusion. The claim specifically mentions \"Guillermo Franco,\" so I need to confirm if he's associated with both goals. However, looking at the table, there's no direct mention of Guillermo Franco in any row. This is a bit confusing because the user mentioned him in the claim, but he doesn't appear in the table.\n\nHmm, maybe the table doesn't list players but instead matches or events. So, perhaps \"Guillermo Franco\" refers to a competition or an event type that's consistent between these two goals. But since both competitions for goal 2 and goal 7 are labeled as \"Friendly,\" they do have the same type.\n\nWait another thought: The claim says \"competition on goal 2 and goal 7.\" So it's about the type of competition associated with each goal, not necessarily whether Franco is part of those competitions. Since both are friendly matches, the claim holds true regardless of who Franco is because it's about the competition type, not him being involved.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain because the user included \"Guillermo Franco\" in the claim, but he isn't present in the table data. Maybe that's just additional information or perhaps a distraction. My focus should be on the competitions' types for goals 2 and 7.\n\nSo to sum up:\n- Goal 2: Friendly\n- Goal 7: Friendly\n\nTherefore, the competition type is the same for both goals, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe competitions for goals 2 and 7 are both classified as \"Friendly,\" confirming that Guillermo Franco's associated competitions match in type.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Competition is 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualification. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Competition is friendly. This might be relevant since it's about a friendly match.\nRow 3: 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification. Not relevant.\nRow 4: 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Relevant for the comparison.\nRow 5: Also 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Also relevant.\nRow 6: 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification. Not relevant.\nRow 7: Friendly competition. Another possible relevant row.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"friendly competition,\" which refers to any friendly matches, not just specific ones. So I need to check all rows where the competition is friendly or in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 2: friendly\n- Row 4: 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n- Row 5: same as above\n- Row 7: friendly\n\nNow, I need to look at Guillermo Franco's goals in these rows. Wait, the table has a 'goal' column and a 'result' column. But does it specify who scored each goal? The 'goal' column just says \"1\", \"2\", etc., without indicating who scored them. So, I can't directly attribute which player scored which goal.\n\nThis is a problem because if the claim is about Guillermo Franco specifically, and the table doesn't specify his goals, then there's no way to verify it. Therefore, the relevant cells might not be sufficient to confirm the claim.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim refers to the same number of goals in both contexts. However, without knowing how many goals he scored in each category (friendly vs. 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup), we can't compare them.\n\nLooking back at the instructions: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, 'FALSE'.\" Since the table doesn't specify who scored the goals, including Guillermo Franco's contributions, the claim cannot be verified.

The claim says: \"Guillermo Franco scored goals 4 and 5 at the same 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup competition.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table row by row to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's about a goal by someone else, not Guillermo. So no relevance here.\n\nRow 2: Another different player scored, so nothing related.\n\nRow 3: Again, different player and date is 2009 but it's a World Cup qualifier. Not our competition yet.\n\nRow 4: This row mentions goals 4 and 5 in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The venue is Soldier Field, Chicago. So this seems relevant because it mentions Guillermo Franco scoring goals 4 and 5 in that competition.\n\nRow 5: Also part of the same 2009 Gold Cup but goal 5 was scored by someone else (0-5), so only relevant if he scored both 4 and 5. Since here he didn't score goal 5, it's less relevant unless I need to check all goals for that competition.\n\nRow 6: Different competition (2010 World Cup Qualification) so irrelevant.\n\nRow 7: Different date and competition, so not relevant.\n\nSo the key information is in Row 4. It shows that Guillermo Franco scored goal 4 with a score of 1-0, but wait, the result here is 5-3 (PSO). The claim says he scored goals 4 and 5. Wait, looking at Row 4: it's score 1-0, result 5-3. But Row 5 also mentions the same competition where they scored 0-5. Hmm, so maybe in that game, someone else scored all five goals. So did Guillermo actually score goal 4 and 5?\n\nWait, I need to check if the claim says he scored both goals 4 and 5 in the same competition. So, looking at Row 4: it's goal 4 with a score of 1-0, result 5-3 (PSO). Then Row 5 is another game where they won 0-5. But who scored those goals? The claim doesn't specify against whom or in which games.\n\nSo, from the table, I can see that Guillermo scored goal 4, but there's no mention of him scoring goal 5. In Row 5, someone else scored all five goals, so it's possible he didn't score goal 5.\n\nTherefore, even though he scored goal 4 in Row 4, the claim says he scored both 4 and 5. Since there's no evidence of him scoring goal 5, the claim might be false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that Guillermo Franco scored goals 4 and 5 at the same 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup competition, we need to examine the relevant rows in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 4:\n- **Goal**: 4\n- **Competition**: 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n\nThis directly shows that Guillermo Franco scored goal 4 in that competition. However, there's no information indicating he scored goal 5. In another match (Row 5) of the same competition, someone else scored all five goals.\n\nSince the claim states he scored both goals 4 and 5, but only goal 4 is confirmed, the claim is **FALSE**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The goal number for that row is 1. So, this cell is relevant because it shows the number of goals scored by Franco on that specific date.\n\nRow 2: Date is March 1, 2006. Goal number for that row is 2. This cell is also relevant as it shows the goals scored later in March 2006.\n\nOther rows don't have dates that match either October 8, 2005 or March 1, 2006. So, only Rows 1 and 2 are relevant here.\n\nNow, comparing the goal numbers: On October 8, 2005 (Row 1), Franco scored 1 goal. On March 1, 2006 (Row 2), he scored 2 goals. Since 1 is less than 2, the claim that he has a lower goal on October 8 compared to March 1 is TRUE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are Row 1 and Row 2, specifically looking at their \"goal\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true based on the data in rows 1 and 2 of the table.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I know that Guillermo Franco is a footballer, so when the claim mentions \"score,\" it's referring to the match scores for specific games he played on those dates. The claim says there are different scores on March 1, 2006 and June 10, 2009. So I need to find out what the scores were for these two dates in the table and see if they're different.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: goal: 1, date: 8 october 2005, venue: estadio alfonso lastras , san luis potos\u00ed , mexico, score: 1 - 1, result: 5 - 2, competition: 2006 fifa world cup qualification.\nRow 2: goal: 2, date: 1 march 2006, venue: pizza hut park , frisco , united states, score: 1 - 0, result: 1 - 0, competition: friendly.\nRow 3: goal: 3, date: 10 june 2009, venue: estadio azteca , mexico city , mexico, score: 1 - 0, result: 2 - 1, competition: 2010 fifa world cup qualification.\nRow 4: goal: 4, date: 23 july 2009, venue: soldier field , chicago , united states, score: 1 - 0, result: 5 - 3 ( pso ), competition: 2009 concacaf gold cup.\nRow 5: goal: 5, date: 26 july 2009, venue: giants stadium , east rutherford , united states, score: 0 - 5, result: 0 - 5, competition: 2009 concacaf gold cup.\nRow 6: goal: 6, date: 5 september 2009, venue: estadio ricardo saprissa , san jos\u00e9 , costa rica, score: 0 - 2, result: 3 - 0, competition: 2010 fifa world cup qualification.\nRow 7: goal: 7, date: 24 may 2010, venue: wembley stadium , london , england, score: 2 - 1, result: 3 - 1, competition: friendly.\n\nSo the claim mentions two dates: March 1, 2006 and June 10, 2009. I need to find the corresponding rows for these dates in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 2: date is 1 march 2006. That's the first part of the claim. The score there is 1 - 0, as per \"score: 1 - 0\".\n\nNow looking for June 10, 2009. Scanning through the rows, I see Row 3 has a date of 10 june 2009. So that's the second part. The score for this match is also listed as 1 - 0.\n\nWait, both scores are 1 - 0? That would mean they're the same, not different. So if the claim says Guillermo Franco had different scores on these two dates, but according to the table, both have a score of 1 - 0, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check the rows again to make sure I didn't mix up any details. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 2: March 1, 2006, score 1-0.\nRow 3: June 10, 2009, score 1-0.\n\nYes, both scores are the same. Therefore, the claim that he had different scores is incorrect because the scores are actually the same on both dates mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Guillermo Franco had different scores on March 1, 2006, and June 10, 2009. By checking the table:\n\n- On March 1, 2006 (Row 2), the score was 1 - 0.\n- On June 10, 2009 (Row 3), the score was also 1 - 0.\n\nSince both scores are identical, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim specifically mentions \"goal 1\" and \"goal 6,\" so I should look at Row 1 for goal 1 and Row 6 for goal 6.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It's about a match on October 8, 2005. The competition listed is \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" For goal 1, the score is 1-1, result is 5-2, venue in Mexico, etc. So the competition type for goal 1 is clearly the FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nNow, looking at Row 6: This is about a match on September 5, 2009. The competition here is also \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" The score is 0-2 and the result is 3-0 in favor of Costa Rica. So, both goal 1 and goal 6 are part of the same type of competition: FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's any other information that might affect this.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"Guillermo Franco scored goals 4 and 5 at the same 2010 CONCACAF Gold Cup competition.\" \n\nFirst, let me look through each row of the table to see if Guillermo Franco scored goals 4 and 5 in the same competition.\n\nRow 1: It's about goal 1 on October 8, 2005, for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. Doesn't mention Franco or goals 4/5.\n\nRow 2: Goal 2 on March 1, 2006, is a friendly match. No relevance here either.\n\nRow 3: Goal 3 on June 10, 2009, for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Still not the right competition or Franco's goals 4/5.\n\nRow 4: This is the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Guillermo Franco scored goal 4 on July 23, 2009. The result was a 5-3 win in a penalty shootout. So that's one of his goals mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 5: Another match in the same competition on July 26, 2009, where he scored goal 5 with a 0-5 loss. That's the second goal he scored in this tournament. \n\nRows 6 and 7 are about different competitions (2010 World Cup qualification and a friendly), so they don't apply here.\n\nSo both goals 4 and 5 by Guillermo Franco happened in the same 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are rows 4 and 5, specifically the 'goal' column for each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two entries in row 4 and row 5 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"Guillermo Franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2010 FIFA World Cup competition.\" So, essentially, the claim is saying that Franco scored a certain number of goals in friendly matches that was equal to the number he scored in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row where \"competition\" is either \"friendly\" or \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\" or \"2010 FIFA World Cup.\" Wait, but the 2010 FIFA World Cup itself might not be directly listed here. Let me see:\n\nRow 1: Competition - 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\nRow 2: Friendly\nRow 3: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\nRow 4: 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\nRow 5: 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup\nRow 6: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\nRow 7: Friendly\n\nSo, the claim mentions two types of competitions: friendly and 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the table, there are two rows labeled \"friendly\" (Rows 2 and 7). For each of these, I need to check how many goals Franco scored.\n\nLooking at Row 2:\n- Goal: 2\n- Competition: friendly\n\nRow 7:\n- Goal: 7\n- Competition: friendly\n\nSo in total, he scored 2 + 7 = 9 goals in friendly competitions.\n\nNow, looking for his goals in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The 2010 World Cup itself isn't directly listed in the table, but Row 3 and Row 6 mention \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" I'm not sure if those are part of the World Cup or just qualifiers leading up to it. Since the claim is about the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition, maybe we should look for that specific event.\n\nBut in the table, there's no row explicitly labeled as the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, Row 3 and 6 are qualifications, so perhaps those are part of the World Cup.\n\nAssuming that, let's see:\n\nRow 3: Goals scored - 3\nCompetition: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nRow 6: Goals scored - 6\nCompetition: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\nSo in total, during the qualifications, he scored 3 + 6 = 9 goals.\n\nIf we consider that the 2010 World Cup itself might have had matches as well, but they aren't listed here. However, based on what's provided, in both friendly competitions and World Cup qualifiers, Franco scored 9 goals each. Therefore, it seems he scored the same number of goals in friendly matches and in the World Cup qualification.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"friendly competition the same amount as at 2010 FIFA World Cup competition.\" If the World Cup competition isn't directly listed here, maybe I should only compare the given data. So in the table, friendly competitions have 9 goals total (from Rows 2 and 7), and the 2010 World Cup qualification has 9 goals (Rows 3 and 6). So they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because Guillermo Franco scored a total of 9 goals in friendly competitions and also 9 goals in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}",
