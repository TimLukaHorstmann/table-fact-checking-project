    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"corrado barazzutti be partner on november 15 , 1976\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two things: the person (Corrado Barazzutti) and the date (November 15, 1976). So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where Corrado Barazzutti is listed as the partner on November 15, 1976.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a tournament with details like outcome, date, tournament location, partner, and opponents. My task is to find any row that matches both the person (partner) and the date mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet me start by scanning through the rows one by one. \n\nRow 1: No, Corrado isn't mentioned here.\nRow 2: Partner is Fred McNair. Not him.\nRow 3: Vijay Amritraj again. Not Corrado.\nRow 4: Vijay Amritraj once more. Still no.\nRow 5: Vijay Amritraj again. Moving on.\nRow 6: Vijay. Not relevant.\nRow 7: Vijay. Nope.\nRow 8: Vijay.\nRow 9: Vijay.\nRow 10: Vijay.\nRow 11: Vijay.\nRow 12: Vijay.\nRow 13: Partner is Ilie N\u0103stase, not Corrado.\nRow 14: Now here we go! The partner listed is Corrado Barazzutti. And the date is November 15, 1976. That matches both parts of the claim.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Row 14 has outcome as \"runner-up,\" date is November 15, 1976, location is Los Angeles, California, USA, partner is Corrado Barazzutti, and opponents are Brian Teacher and Butch Walts. Yes, everything aligns with the claim.\n\nSo, this means that on November 15, 1976, Corrado Barazzutti was indeed a partner in the tournament. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. Each row has several columns: index, outcome, date, location, partner, opponents. The relevant columns here would be \"partner\" and \"date.\" So, I need to find the row indices where these columns have the values specified in the claim.\n\nIn this case, Row 14 is the one with Corrado Barazzutti as the partner on November 15, 1976. Therefore, the relevant cells are at row_index 14 for both \"partner\" and \"date.\" Wait, but each cell is a specific column. So, I think I need to list all columns that have values matching the claim.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should only include the specific cells that contain the information in question. Since the claim is about the partner being Corrado on a specific date, those two columns are \"partner\" and \"date.\" Therefore, for Row 14, both these columns match, so I need to list each of them as relevant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to list all cells that contain information related to the claim. In this case, since the claim refers to a specific partner on a specific date, any row where the partner is Corrado and the date is November 15, 1976 would be relevant. But in this table, only Row 14 fits both conditions.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include the row index (14) for both \"partner\" and \"date.\" Wait, no. Each cell is a specific column in a row. So, for Row 14, there are two cells that are relevant: one under \"partner\" which is Corrado Barazzutti, and one under \"date\" which is November 15, 1976.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list should include both of these columns from Row 14.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in Row 14 where Corrado Barazzutti was indeed the partner on November 15, 1976.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"corrado barazzutti partner with geoff master on november 15 , 1976.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table and find any rows that match this information. The table has a lot of rows, so I'll go one by one.\n\nI notice that the columns include 'outcome', 'date', 'tournament', 'partner', and 'opponents in the final'. So each row represents an event where someone was the partner or opponents.\n\nLooking at row 14: outcome is runner-up, date is November 15, 1976. The tournament is Manila, Philippines. Partner is Corrado Barazzutti. Opponents are Ross Case and Geoff Masters. \n\nWait, so in this row, Corrado Barazzutti was the partner, and one of the opponents is Geoff Masters. That means on November 15, 1976, Corrado Barazzutti partnered with someone else (probably his own partner) against Geoff Masters.\n\nThe claim says \"partner with\" which implies that both were partners in a tournament. But here, Corrado was the partner, and Geoff was an opponent. So that doesn't support the claim.\n\nNow, checking other rows for November 15, 1976: only row 14 matches that date and location. No other rows have Corrado Barazzutti as partner or opponent on that specific date.\n\nSo the claim is saying that on November 15, 1976, Corrado partnered with Geoff. But from the table, it's clear that on that date, Corrado was partnered in a different tournament where Geoff was an opponent. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"on august 8 , 1980 , tom gullikson and butch walts the opponent\". \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is saying. It mentions a specific date (August 8, 1980), two names (Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts), and their roles as opponents in a tournament.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an outcome of a tournament, with various details like the date, location, partners, and opponents. My task is to scan through each row and check if any match the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is runner-up on October 21, 1973, in New Delhi. Doesn't match August 8, 1980.\nRow 2: Winner on November 19, 1973. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Winner on November 16, 1974. Not our date.\nRow 4: Runner-up on August 19, 1974. Close but not August 8, 1980.\nRow 5: Winner on August 19, 1974. Same as above.\nRow 6: Runner-up on February 10, 1975. No match.\nRow 7: Runner-up on March 10, 1975. Not relevant.\nRow 8: Winner on March 24, 1975. No.\nRow 9: Runner-up on August 5, 1975. Close but different date and partners.\nRow 10: Runner-up on March 10, 1980. Not our date.\nRow 11: Runner-up on April 14, 1980. Different month.\nRow 12: Winner on April 28, 1980. Same as above.\nRow 13: Runner-up on August 8, 1980. Ah, here's the row! Let me check the details.\n\nLooking at Row 24 (assuming numbering starts from 0; if it's 1-based, I might need to adjust), the outcome is runner-up with the date August 8, 1980. The tournament location is Atlanta, Georgia. The partner is John Austin, and the opponents are Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts.\n\nSo, the claim mentions that on August 8, 1980, Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts were opponents. In Row 24, they are indeed listed as opponents with the correct date.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other row that matches this condition. Scanning the rest of the rows, none have both the same date (August 8, 1980) and the names Tom Gullikson and Butch Walts as opponents.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 24.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is fully supported by the table data in Row 24. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
