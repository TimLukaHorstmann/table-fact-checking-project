    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down what's being asked.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant to this claim. The claim is comparing two songs: \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire\". Each song has a points value in the table, so I'll need to find their respective points.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a song with various attributes like draw number, language, artist, song title, place, and points. My goal is to find where each of these songs appears in the table.\n\nStarting with \"vivo (ti scrivo)\": The song title is given as \"vivo (ti scrivo)\". I'll scan through the rows. \n\n- Row 1: draw:1, language:icelandic... No.\n- Row 2: Swedish...\n- Row3: Finnish... No.\n- Row4: English...\n- Row5: Turkish...\n- Row6: Spanish...\n- Row7: Dutch...\n- Row8: Hebrew...\n- Row9: French... No.\n- Row10: English...\n- Row11: German...\n- Row12: German...\n- Row13: Danish...\n- Row14: Greek...\n- Row15: Norwegian...\n- Row16: French... Hmm, \"laissez briller le soleil\" is here. Not it.\n- Row17: French again, \"croire\". Oh, wait, that's the other song.\n\nWait, so in row 17, the song is \"croire\". So \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" must be elsewhere. Let me keep checking.\n\nRow18: Italian... No.\nRow19: French... \"chanteur de charme\" not it.\nRow20: Portuguese...\nRow21: Croatian... No.\n\nWait, I might have missed a row where the song is \"vivo (ti scrivo)\". Let me check again. Oh, perhaps I skipped some rows. Wait, row 18 is Italian with \"vivo (ti scrivo)\"? No, row 18's song is \"vivo (ti scrivo)\", but let me confirm.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nRow17: draw:17, language: french, artist: lara fabian, song: croire, place:4, points:90.\nRow18: draw:18, language: italian, artist: luca barbarossa, song: vivo (ti scrivo), place:12, points:52.\n\nAh, so \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" is in row18. So that's where it is.\n\nNow, the claim says \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\". So I need to compare their points.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Vivo (ti scrivo): row18, points:52\n- Croire: row17, points:90\n\nSo 52 vs. 90. Clearly, croire has a higher points value. Therefore, the claim is false because \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" does not have higher points than \"croire\".\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm checking all relevant cells. The relevant cells would be the rows where these songs are found and their points column.\n\nSo for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\", row_index is 18, and the column is 'points'. For \"croire\", row_index is17, same column. So the relevant cells are both in column 'points', with their respective row indices.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]}",
