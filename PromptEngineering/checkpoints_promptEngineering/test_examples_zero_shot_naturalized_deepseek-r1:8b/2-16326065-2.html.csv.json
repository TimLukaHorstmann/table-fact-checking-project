    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Iowa being the team that Jam Vanderberg belongs to when his completion status is redshirt is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions \"Jam Vanderberg\" and \"completion have a status of redshirt.\" So, I'm looking for information related to Jam Vanderberg's completions in redshirt years.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists data from 2008 to 2012, along with college totals. Each row has year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. The term \"redshirt\" appears in some of these cells. For example, in Row 1 (2008), all stats are marked as redshirt. But I don't see any mention of a player named Jam Vanderberg here.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where the team is Iowa and the completion status is redshirt. The claim says \"when the completion have a status of redshirt,\" so I'm looking for a row where the completions column is redshirt and the team is Iowa.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: year 2008, all stats are redshirt. So, team is Iowa, attempts, completions, etc., are all redshirt.\n- Rows 2 to 6 have specific numbers, not redshirt.\n\nSo, in Row 1, for the year 2008, the team is Iowa and the completions status is redshirt. But I don't see Jam Vanderberg's name mentioned anywhere in the table.\n\nWait, maybe Jam Vanderberg isn't directly listed here. The claim doesn't specify a particular row or season but refers to when his completion is redshirt. If he played as a redshirt, then Iowa would be his team during that time. But since the table only goes up to 2012 and includes college totals, it's possible that in one of those years, especially Row 1 (2008), he was a redshirt.\n\nHowever, without seeing Jam Vanderberg's name in any row, I can't confirm he was part of Iowa during his redshirt year. The table only tells me the stats for each season but not the specific players unless they are named, which they aren't here.\n\nTherefore, while there is a redshirt status for completions in 2008 with team Iowa, the claim specifically mentions Jam Vanderberg, who isn't listed. So, I don't have enough information to confirm that Jam Vanderberg was part of Iowa's team during his redshirt completion status.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Jam Vanderberg's completion status as redshirt and Iowa as his team. While there is a redshirt entry for completions in 2008 with team Iowa, the table doesn't mention Jam Vanderberg by name. Without his inclusion, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completion %\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

They mention the year 2010, so I should look at row 3 because each row corresponds to a specific year (2008-2012). \n\nNext, they talk about \"the player with iowa.\" Since the team is Iowa in all rows, that part matches. So we're looking for stats from the Iowa team in 2010.\n\nThe claim says the player made 5 completions. Looking at row 3, under \"completions,\" it's listed as 5. That's a match. \n\nThen it mentions a total of 45 yards. Under \"yards\" in row 3, it says 45.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"team iowa have 42 completion.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It's got six rows, each representing different years from 2008 to 2012, and then a row for college totals. Each row has several columns: year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. \n\nThe claim mentions \"team iowa\" which is clearly listed in the 'team' column of every row except maybe the college totals row, but that row says \"college totals,\" so it's probably aggregating all previous years.\n\nNow, the key part of the claim is \"42 completions.\" So I need to find where in the table there are 42 completions. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: completions are redshirt, which isn't a number.\n- Row 2: completions are 42.\n- Rows 3-6 have different completion numbers.\n\nSo, the second row has completions as 42. That matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nWait, but I should also check if any other rows might have a relevance, like if \"completion\" was mentioned elsewhere, but no, each row's 'completions' column is specific to that year or total. So only Row 2 has 42 completions.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there is a row where team Iowa has 42 completions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with Row 2 having 42 completions for team Iowa in the year 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"there be 223 completion be record with there be 389 attempt.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify what the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that in a particular year, the team had 223 completions and attempted 389 passes. So I need to check if such a combination exists in any row of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2008 to 2012, along with some college totals. Each row includes 'attempts', 'completions', and 'completion %' for that specific year or total.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: 2008 - attempts: redshirt, completions: redshirt. Since these are not numerical values, I can skip this row as it doesn't provide numbers we can work with.\n\nRow 2: 2009 - attempts:87, completions:42, completion %:48.3%, yards:470. Here, the completions are 42, which is less than 223. So not matching.\n\nRow 3: 2010 - attempts:8, completions:5, etc. Again, completions here are only 5, way below 223.\n\nRow 4: 2011 - attempts:404, completions:237, completion %:58.7%, yards:3022. Here, completions are 237, which is still less than 223. Wait, no, wait\u2014237 is more than 223? No, 237 is higher. So this row shows that in 2011, the team had 404 attempts and 237 completions.\n\nRow 5: 2012 - attempts:389, completions:223, completion %:57.3%, yards:2249. Ah, here we go! The team had 389 attempts and 223 completions. So this row matches exactly what the claim is stating. That means the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might have these numbers. Since each year has unique data, it's unlikely another row would match both attempts and completions. But just to be thorough:\n\nRow 6: college totals - attempts:888, completions:507. These are much higher than the claim's numbers.\n\nSo the only matching row is Row 5 (2012), which has 389 attempts and 223 completions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from the year 2012, where the team had 389 attempts and 223 completions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"completions\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"from 2008 to 2012 , the number of attempt be 888\". Hmm, it seems like there might be a typo here because \"attempt\" should probably be \"attempts\", and I think the intended meaning is about the total attempts over those years. So, the user is claiming that from 2008 through 2012, the total number of attempts by Iowa's team is 888.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 2008 to 2012. Each row includes data like year, team, attempts, completions, completion percentage, and yards. The last row (Row 6) has \"college totals\" for each category, which likely aggregates the previous years' data.\n\nSo, to verify this claim, I need to check two things: \n\n1. Does the total number of attempts from 2008 to 2012 equal 888?\n2. Are these attempts specifically aggregated across all those years?\n\nI should look at Row 6 for \"attempts\" because it says \"college totals\". The value there is 888, which seems to be the cumulative total.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes in sports statistics, \"college totals\" can mean something else, but given the context and that Row 6 has higher numbers than the individual years, it's likely the sum of attempts from 2008-2012.\n\nSo, checking each year's attempts:\n\n- 2008: redshirt (probably not a number)\n- 2009: 87\n- 2010: 8\n- 2011: 404\n- 2012: 389\n\nAdding these up: 87 + 8 + 404 + 389. Let me calculate:\n\n87 + 8 = 95\n95 + 404 = 499\n499 + 389 = 888.\n\nYes, that adds up to 888. So the total attempts from 2008-2012 are indeed 888.\n\nNow, does this support the claim? The claim says \"the number of attempt be 888\", but I think they meant \"attempts\" and referring to the total over those years. Since Row 6's \"attempts\" column is 888 and it's the sum from 2008-2012, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, I should also check if there are any other interpretations. For example, does \"the number of attempt be 888\" refer to something else, like a single season? But the timeframe given is from 2008 to 2012, so it's about multiple years, not a single one.\n\nAlso, in Row 6, \"attempts\" is 888, which aligns with the sum of individual attempts. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that from 2008 to 2012, the total number of attempts is 888. By calculating each year's attempts and summing them up, we confirm that 87 + 8 + 404 + 389 equals 888. Additionally, Row 6 of the table lists \"attempts\" as 888 under \"college totals,\" which corresponds to these years. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the Iowa team is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"iowa record 389 attempt when they also record 2249 yard.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of the claim means. The term \"record 389 attempt\" refers to a specific number of attempts in a season, which should correspond to one row in the table. Similarly, \"record 2249 yard\" refers to a corresponding yards value for that same year.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: 2008, attempts: redshirt\n- Row 2: 2009, attempts: 87, completions: 42, completion %: 48.3%, yards: 470\n- Row 3: 2010, attempts: 8, completions: 5, completion %: 62.5%, yards: 45\n- Row 4: 2011, attempts: 404, completions: 237, completion %: 58.7%, yards: 3022\n- Row 5: 2012, attempts: 389, completions: 223, completion %: 57.3%, yards: 2249\n- Row 6: College totals, attempts: 888, completions: 507, completion %: 57.1%, yards: 5786\n\nThe claim mentions both \"attempts\" and \"yards.\" I need to find the row where attempts are 389 and yards are 2249.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- In Row 5 (2012), attempts are 389.\n- The same row also shows yards as 2249.\n\nSo, for the year 2012, Iowa had 389 attempts and 2249 yards. This directly matches the claim provided. \n\nI should also check if there's another year where this might be true, but since the table only goes up to 2012 with individual years and then includes college totals, it's clear that the relevant data points are in Row 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"iowa have 404 attempt in 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. Each row represents a year from 2008 to 2012 and some college totals. The columns include year, team, attempts, completions, completion %, and yards. \n\nThe claim mentions \"iowa have 404 attempt in 2012.\" So, I'm looking for the cell where the team is Iowa and the year is 2012 for the 'attempts' column.\n\nLooking at Row 6, it says college totals, not a specific year like 2012. So that's probably the total across all years, not just 2012. Therefore, it doesn't directly relate to 2012 attempts.\n\nNow, checking each row from 2008 to 2012:\n\n- **Row 1 (2008)**: Team is Iowa, but the 'attempts' are redshirt, which I assume means the data isn't available or specific.\n- **Row 2 (2009)**: Attempts are 87, not 404.\n- **Row 3 (2010)**: Attempts are 8, nope.\n- **Row 4 (2011)**: Here it is. Year 2011, attempts 404 for Iowa. But the claim is about 2012.\n- **Row 5 (2012)**: Attempts are 389, not 404.\n\nSo in 2012, Iowa's attempts were 389, not 404. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be:\n\n1. Row 4, column 'attempts' because it shows 404 for 2011.\n2. Row 5, column 'attempts' showing 389 for 2012.\n3. Possibly the claim itself mentions 2012, so including that as a row index might help clarify which year is being referred to.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 2012, so maybe only Row 5's attempts are relevant. However, since the user wants cells that verify the claim, and the claim is false because in 2012 it was 389, not 404, I need to check both the correct 2012 data (Row 5) and the incorrect data from 2011 (Row 4).\n\nSo the relevant_cells should include Row 4 (404 attempts in 2011) and Row 5 (389 attempts in 2012), as well as maybe identifying that it's not 2012. But since the table doesn't have a specific row for college totals in 2012, only up to 2012 as individual years.\n\nWait, actually, Row 6 is college totals, which would be cumulative. So in 2012, the attempts were 389 (Row 5), and the total up to that point was 888 (Row 6). Therefore, to confirm that 2012's attempt wasn't 404, I need to check both Row 4 (which is 2011) and Row 5 (2012).\n\nI think including both rows where attempts are mentioned will show that in 2012 it was indeed less than 404. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 4, 'attempts' for 2011\n- Row 5, 'attempts' for 2012\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE because in 2012, Iowa had 389 attempts, not 404.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"iowa have 404 attempt in 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyzed the table provided. The relevant data points are:\n\n1. **Row 4 (Year 2011)**: Attempts = 404 for Iowa.\n2. **Row 5 (Year 2012)**: Attempts = 389 for Iowa.\n\nSince the attempts in 2012 were 389, not 404, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"389 attempt be record when the completion be 237.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to find where the attempts and completions for 389 attempts and 237 completions are. \n\nLooking at Row 5: year 2012, team iowa has attempts: 389, completions: 223. Hmm, that's not matching because completions are 223, not 237.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all rows. Let me go through each one:\n\nRow 1: 2008 - no relevant numbers here.\nRow 2: 2009 - attempts 87, completions 42.\nRow 3: 2010 - attempts 8, completions 5.\nRow 4: 2011 - attempts 404, completions 237. Oh, here we go! In Row 4, the team has 404 attempts and 237 completions. So that's higher than 389 attempts but not matching the completion number given in the claim.\n\nWait, no, the claim is about 389 attempts and 237 completions being a record. But looking through all rows, only Row 5 has 389 attempts, and it's paired with 223 completions. None of the other years except Row 4 have 237 completions, but with much higher attempts (404). So there isn't a row where both 389 attempts and 237 completions are present.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the claim is trying to say that in some year, their attempt count reached 389 and completion was 237. But looking at Row 5, it's 389 attempts but only 223 completions. So that doesn't match. Therefore, the claim seems false because there's no row where both 389 attempts and 237 completions happen together.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where attempts=389 (Row 5) and completions=237 (Row 4).

It says: \"james vanderberg make 8 completion on iowa when his yard be 45.\" \n\nFirst, I need to figure out who James Vanderberg is in the context of the table. Looking at the team column, I see all entries are for the \"iowa\" team. So, it's likely that James Vanderberg is a quarterback or someone involved with the Iowa team, but I don't recognize the name immediately. That might be an issue because if he isn't in the table, then maybe the claim isn't verifiable.\n\nNext, let me break down the claim into parts. The key components are:\n1. He made 8 completions.\n2. His yardage was 45.\n\nI need to check if there's a row where his completions and yards match these numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 2008 to 2012 and then college totals. Each row has columns for attempts, completions, completion percentage, and yards. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1 (2008):** No relevant info since all cells are labeled as redshirt.\n- **Row 2 (2009):** Attempts:87, Completions:42, Yards:470. Doesn't match 8 completions or 45 yards.\n- **Row 3 (2010):** Attempts:8, Completions:5, Yards:45. Here, attempts and completions don't add up to 8 completions. Wait, in this row, attempts are 8 but completions are only 5. So maybe he threw 8 attempts but completed 5, which would mean 5 completions, not 8. But yards here are 45, which matches the claim.\n- **Row 4 (2011):** Attempts:404, Completions:237, Yards:3022. Way more completions and yards than claimed.\n- **Row 5 (2012):** Attempts:389, Completions:223, Yards:2249. Again, much higher numbers.\n- **Row 6 (College totals):** Attempts:888, Completions:507, Yards:5786. Even more completions and yards.\n\nFrom this, the only row where yards are 45 is Row 3. However, in that row, he had 5 completions, not 8. So the claim's assertion about 8 completions isn't supported here. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"make 8 completion on iowa when his yard be 45.\" Does this mean that in a single game or season where he had 45 yards, he made 8 completions? Or is it implying that whenever his yards were 45, he made 8 completions? \n\nIn Row 3 (2010), the yards are 45 but completions are only 5. There's no row where yards are 45 and completions are 8. The closest is Row 3, but completions don't match.\n\nAlso, I should check if there's a specific game or context where this happens, but since the table doesn't specify, it's hard to tell. It seems like in 2010, he had 5 completions and 45 yards, which isn't 8 completions. \n\nSo, the claim is making two claims: 8 completions and 45 yards. The yard figure does exist (Row 3), but the completions don't match for that year. Therefore, one part of the claim is true, but the other isn't, so overall it's not fully supported.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Could \"make 8 completion\" refer to a different context? Like, in 2010, he made 5 completions and had 45 yards. So perhaps there was another instance where he had 8 completions with 45 yards, but the table doesn't show that.\n\nGiven the data provided, the claim isn't fully accurate because while the yardage is correct for a row, the number of completions isn't matching.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that James Vanderberg made 8 completions when his yardage was 45. The table shows that in 2010, he had 5 completions and 45 yards, which doesn't match the claim's 8 completions.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** None, as the data doesn't support both parts of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about the Iowa team's passing attempts, completions, and yards from 2008 to 2012, plus college totals. The claim in question is: \"from 2008 to 2011, the number of attempts be 888.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions \"the number of attempts\" being 888 specifically from 2008 to 2011. So, I should look at the data provided in the table and check if there's a row that includes this information.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a year: 2008 through 2012. The last row is for college totals, which seems to be a cumulative measure across all years. Each row has columns for attempts, completions, completion percentage, and yards.\n\nNow, focusing on the time frame of 2008 to 2011, that would include rows 0 (2008), row 1 (2009), row 2 (2010), and row 3 (2011). The claim is about the number of attempts being 888 in this range. \n\nLooking at each relevant year:\n- Row 0 (2008): Attempts are listed as \"redshirt,\" which isn't a numerical value.\n- Row 1 (2009): Attempts are 87.\n- Row 2 (2010): Attempts are 8.\n- Row 3 (2011): Attempts are 404.\n\nNone of these specific years have an attempt count of 888. The closest higher number is in the college totals row, which is row 5. However, this row represents cumulative data from all years up to 2012 and includes a total attempts of 888. But the claim specifies the time frame as 2008 to 2011, not including 2012.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be row indices 0 to 3 (years 2008-2011), checking each for the \"attempts\" column. Since none of these rows have 888 in attempts, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa when the record yard be 2249\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim sentence by sentence. The first part is about a player named Vanderberg having 404 attempts in the year something (probably 2011 because I see a row with 404 attempts for Iowa in that year). Then it mentions \"when the record yard be 2249.\" That seems to refer to a year where the yards were 2249, which would correspond to 2012 as per the table.\n\nSo, looking at the table, let's check each part. The claim is about Vanderberg having 404 attempts in a specific year. From the table, row 4 (year: 2011) shows that Iowa had 404 attempts. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"when the record yard be 2249.\" Looking for yards equal to 2249, I see that's in row 5 (year: 2012). So it seems the claim is saying that Vanderberg had 404 attempts when Iowa had a yardage of 2249. But wait, does Vanderberg play in 2012? Or is the record yardage referring to a different player or context?\n\nWait, the table doesn't specify which team's yards are being referred to. It only lists yards for each year under \"iowa.\" So when the claim says \"record yard be 2249,\" it's talking about Iowa's total yards in that year, which is 2012.\n\nBut Vanderberg's attempts in 2011 (404) would not coincide with Iowa's yards of 2249 in 2012. They are separate years. Unless Vanderberg is still playing in 2012, but the table doesn't mention him after 2011.\n\nWait, looking at row 6, it's college totals, which might be cumulative or for a different player. But the claim specifically mentions Vanderberg, who I assume is playing for Iowa each year. So if Vanderberg had 404 attempts in 2011, and in that same year, Iowa's yards were lower than 2249 (in 2011, yards were 3022). Wait, no, row 4 shows yards as 3022 for 2011. So when the claim says \"when the record yard be 2249,\" that would be in 2012.\n\nBut does Vanderberg play in 2012? If so, his attempts would be different (like 389 in 2012). The claim specifically mentions 404 attempts with yards of 2249, but from the table, 2011 has 404 attempts and 3022 yards. So unless there's a specific year where both Vanderberg had 404 attempts and Iowa had 2249 yards, which doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is saying that in the year when Iowa's record yard was 2249 (2012), Vanderberg had 404 attempts. But from row 5, Iowa had 2249 yards in 2012, but Vanderberg's attempts were 389 that year. So unless Vanderberg is a different player or something's wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that in the same year as Vanderberg having 404 attempts (2011), Iowa had a record yard of 2249, which isn't accurate because in 2011, yards were 3022. Therefore, the two numbers don't match up correctly.\n\nSo, putting it together: The claim links Vanderberg's 404 attempts to a year when Iowa's yards were 2249. From the table, Vanderberg had 404 attempts in 2011, but that year Iowa had 3022 yards. In 2012, they had 2249 yards, but Vanderberg's attempts were 389. Therefore, there's no overlap where both 404 attempts and 2249 yards occurred for Vanderberg in the same year.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because the two data points (attempts and yards) don't happen together in the same context provided by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly links Vanderberg's 404 attempts to a year when Iowa had 2249 yards, which isn't accurate based on the table. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attempts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"yards\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
