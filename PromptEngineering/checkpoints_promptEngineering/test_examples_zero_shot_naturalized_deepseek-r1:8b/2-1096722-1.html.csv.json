    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 10.6 million viewer for episode part four that have a run time of 24:57.\"\n\nBreaking it down, the claim mentions two specific pieces of information related to Episode Part Four:\n1. The number of viewers is 10.6 million.\n2. The run time is 24:57.\n\nI'll need to check if these details match exactly with the data in the table for Episode Part Four.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an episode, with columns like episode (which part it is), broadcast date, run time, viewers (in millions), and archive type. So for Episode Part Four, I should focus on the corresponding row where the episode is \"part four.\"\n\nLet me locate that. The fourth row in the table has:\n- Episode: part four\n- Broadcast date: 5 January 1974\n- Run time: 24:57\n- Viewers (in millions): 10.6\n- Archive: pal 2 colour videotape.\n\nSo, checking each part of the claim:\n1. The viewers for Part Four are indeed listed as 10.6 million.\n2. The run time is also exactly 24:57 minutes.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for verification. Each row has four relevant columns: episode, broadcast date, run time, viewers (in millions), and archive. Since the claim only refers to two specific pieces of information related to Part Four, the relevant columns for that row would be \"run_time\" and \"viewers (in millions).\"\n\nSo, I'll list these two as relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"run_time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"viewers (in millions)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
