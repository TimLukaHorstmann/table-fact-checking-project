    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the power output for the 1972 engine isn't provided in horsepower or kilowatts. So, I need to check if the table indeed doesn't mention the power of the 1972 engine in those units.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several attributes: generation, years, engine type, power, torque, and induction. The power column is filled with a dash (-) or some numerical value like 'n/a'. For example, Row 1 shows power as '-', and similarly for others.\n\nNow, focusing on Row 3 (since the claim is about 1972), which has generation: i, years: 1972, engine: 455in cubic Oldsmobile V8. The power here is also a dash (-). So, it's not providing a numerical value, whether in hp or kw.\n\nThe claim says that the power isn't given in hp (kw). Since the table doesn't provide any numbers for power in Row 3 and uses '-', this aligns with the claim. However, I should check if there's another row for 1972 to make sure it's only about that specific engine and year.\n\nLooking through all rows, only Row 3 corresponds to 1972. All others are either different years or engines. So, there's no conflicting information where power is provided in hp or kw for the 1972 engine.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the claim holds true because it accurately states that the power isn't given in those units.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power\"}]}",
