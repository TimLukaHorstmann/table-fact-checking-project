    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the Maverick be the only team to join after 1970\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that the Mavericks are the sole team that joined the organization after the year 1970. So, I need to check each row in the table and see if any other teams joined after 1970 besides the Mavericks.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has 14 rows with various details about each team. Each row includes information like school name, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. \n\nThe key here is to look for teams where \"year joined\" is greater than 1970. According to the claim, only the Mavericks should have done this, but I need to verify if that's the case.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Joined in 1947, left in 1966.\n2. **Row 2**: Joined in 1947, left in 1992.\n3. **Row 3**: Joined in 1947, left in 1961.\n4. **Row 4**: Joined in 1947, left in 1949.\n5. **Row 5**: Joined in 1947, left in 1977.\n6. **Row 6**: Joined in 1947, left in 1972.\n7. **Row 7**: Joined in 1948 2000. Wait, that seems like a typo or formatting issue. Maybe it's 1948 and then 2000 as the year left? But regardless, joined before 1970.\n8. **Row 8**: Joined in 1958, left in 1966.\n9. **Row 9**: Joined in 1958, left in 1965.\n10. **Row 10**: Joined in 1961, left in 1977.\n11. **Row 11**: Joined in 1961, left in 1974.\n12. **Row 12**: Joined in 1970, left in 1993.\n13. **Row 13**: Joined in 1970, left in 1997.\n14. **Row 14**: Joined in 1975, left in 1997.\n\nNow, looking for teams that joined after 1970: \n\n- Row 12: Joined in 1970, which is the cutoff year mentioned in the claim. So, according to the claim, this should not count as joining \"after\" 1970.\n- Row 13: Joined in 1970 as well, same situation.\n- Row 14: Joined in 1975, which is after 1970.\n\nSo, besides the Mavericks (Row 14), are there any other teams that joined after 1970?\n\nWait, let me check each row again carefully:\n\nRows 12 and 13 have \"year joined\" as 1970. The claim says \"after 1970,\" so 1970 might be considered as the year of joining at or after 1970, depending on interpretation. If we consider \"after\" to mean strictly after 1970, then only Row 14 (Mavericks) and perhaps others joined in 1971 or later.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\n- The Mavericks are in Row 14, joined in 1975.\n- Any other teams? Let's check all rows again:\n\nLooking for \"year joined\" > 1970. \n\nOnly Row 14 has year joined as 1975, which is after 1970. So that's one team.\n\nWait, but Row 12: 1970 and Row 13: 1970. If the claim includes 1970 as part of \"after,\" then those two teams also joined in or after 1970, making more than just Mavericks.\n\nBut if we consider \"after\" to mean strictly after 1970 (i.e., 1971 and later), then only Mavericks fit. However, I think in common terms, \"after a certain year\" can include that year. So 1970 would be considered as joining after 1970.\n\nThus, the claim says Mavericks are the only team to join after 1970. But if Rows 12 and 13 also joined in 1970, then there's more than one team that joined after 1970, making the claim FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRows 1-11: All joined before 1970 except Row 14, which is Mavericks.\n\nWait, no. Rows 12 and 13 have \"year joined\" as 1970 and 1975 respectively.\n\nSo, in total, three teams joined after 1970: Rows 12 (Knights), 13 (Raiders), and 14 (Mavericks). If that's the case, then Mavericks are not the only ones, making the claim FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me look again:\n\nRow 7: Joined in 1948. That's before 1970.\n\nRows 12 and 13 joined in 1970, which is the cutoff year mentioned. So if \"after\" includes 1970, then those two teams also joined after 1970, making more than just Mavericks.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Mavericks are the only team to join after 1970 is FALSE because there are others (Knights and Raiders) that also joined in 1970 or later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"the Maverick be the only team to join after 1970.\" Upon examining each row, we find that teams other than the Mavericks also joined in or after the year 1970. Specifically, Rows 12 (Knights), 13 (Raiders), and 14 (Mavericks) have \"year joined\" as 1970 or later. Therefore, there are multiple teams that joined after 1970, making the claim incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because several teams, including the Mavericks, Knights, and Raiders, joined in or after 1970.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Look for rows where \"year joined\" is greater than or equal to 1970.\n2. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - Rows 12 (Knights) and 13 (Raiders) joined in 1970.\n   - Row 14 (Mavericks) joined in 1975.\n3. **Conclusion**: There are multiple teams that joined after or during 1970, contradicting the claim that Mavericks are the sole team.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement is false because multiple teams joined in or after 1970, including the Mavericks, Knights, and Raiders.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim says that Rossville School joined a conference and then left it exactly 30 years later. So, I should look for Rossville's joining and leaving years in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. Let me scan through them to find the one with \"rossville\" as the school name. \n\nRow 5: school: rossville, city: rossville, team name: hornets, county: 12 clinton, year joined: 1947, year left: 1977.\n\nOkay, so Rossville joined in 1947 and left in 1977. Let's calculate the difference between these two years to see if it's exactly 30 years. \n\n1977 minus 1947 is... let me do the math: 1977 - 1947 = 30. So that's a 30-year span.\n\nWait, but does \"leave the conference\" mean leaving after being part of the conference for 30 years? Or does it mean the total time from joining to leaving is exactly 30 years?\n\nIn this case, Rossville joined in 1947 and left in 1977, which is a duration of 30 years. So yes, they left 30 years after joining.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this. Are there any columns that could indicate the conference or related information? The table has columns like school, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. There's no column for conferences mentioned here, so I can't confirm the exact conference name or other details from the table.\n\nBut based on the given data, Rossville's tenure in the conference was exactly 30 years. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"rossville school leave the conference 30 year after join\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify Rossville's joining and leaving years from the table.\n\n1. **Rossville's Joining and Leaving Years**: \n   - Joined: 1947\n   - Left: 1977\n\n2. **Calculate Duration**:\n   - 1977 (Year Left) - 1947 (Year Joined) = 30 years\n\nSince Rossville left the conference exactly 30 years after joining, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year joined\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"year left\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the team from the city of attica leave before the team from the city of west lafayette join.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Let's break it down. There are two main points here:\n\n1. There is a team from the city of Attica.\n2. This team leaves (leaves the school or whatever context) before another team from the city of West Lafayette joins.\n\nSo, I need to find specific rows in the table that correspond to these two points and then check their year joined and year left data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several fields: school, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. \n\nStarting with Attica: I'll search through the rows for the city \"Attica\". Let's see:\n\n- Row 1: school: attica, city: attica... So that's our first team. Their team name is Red Ramblers. They joined in 1947 and left in 1966.\n\nNext, West Lafayette isn't explicitly listed as a separate row. However, looking at the list of schools, I see rows related to Lafayette. For example, Row 8: school: southwestern, city: lafayette... but that's not West Lafayette. Wait, there might be another one. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table, I don't see a row explicitly for West Lafayette as a city. However, in some rows like Row 13: school: harrison (west lafayette), city: west lafayette... So that's our target team. Their team name is Raiders. They joined in 1970 and left in 1997.\n\nNow, the claim says that Attica's team leaves before West Lafayette's team joins. Wait, actually, let me rephrase. The claim is about whether the Attica team leaves before the West Lafayette team joins. So I need to check if Attica's team left (year_left) is before West Lafayette's team joined (year_joined).\n\nAttica's team: year_left = 1966.\n\nWest Lafayette's team: year_joined = 1970.\n\nSo, did Attica leave before West Lafayette joined? Yes, because 1966 is earlier than 1970. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other teams from Attica or West Lafayette.\n\nLooking again at all rows, only Row 1 is Attica, and only Row 13 is West Lafayette (as harrison (west lafayette)). No other cities named Attica or West Lafayette in the table. So those are the two relevant teams.\n\nSo Attica's team left in 1966, West Lafayette's joined in 1970. Therefore, yes, Attica left before West Lafayette joined. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the team from Attica leaves before the team from West Lafayette joins. By checking the table, we find:\n\n- Attica's Red Ramblers left in 1966.\n- West Lafayette's Raiders joined in 1970.\n\nSince 1966 is before 1970, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year_left\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year_joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the hornet be not the only team from 12 clinton county.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"Hornet\" refers to a specific team, likely the Rossville Hornets since that's the name given in the table. The claim is saying that there are other teams from Clinton County, specifically those represented by the number 12. So, I need to check if there are multiple teams associated with Clinton County (county code 12) besides the Hornets.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school and their respective details, including team names and counties. My focus is on rows where the county is 12 Clinton. Let's go through each relevant row.\n\nRow 5: School: Rossville, city: Rossville, team name: Hornets, county: 12 Clinton, year joined: 1947, year left: 1977. So this is the Hornets from Clinton County.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other schools listed with a county of 12 Clinton. Let's scan through all the rows.\n\nRow 11: School: Clinton Prairie, city: Frankfort, team name: Gophers, county: 12 Clinton, year joined: 1961, year left: 1974. So here's another school from Clinton County with the code 12, and their team is the Gophers. That means there are at least two teams from Clinton County: Hornets and Gophers.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the Hornet be not the only team from 12 Clinton county\" is TRUE because there's at least one more team (Gophers) from the same county. So the answer should be TRUE with relevant cells pointing to both Row 5 and Row 11.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check for teams in Clinton County (12).

The details here are: school name is Rossville, city is Rossville, team name is Hornets, county is 12 Clinton, year joined is 1947, and year left is 1977.\n\nNext, looking for Clinton Prairie, I locate it in Row 11. This row has the school as Clinton Prairie, city Frankfort, team name Gophers, county 12 Clinton, year joined 1961, and year left 1974.\n\nNow, the claim says they \"leave 3 years apart.\" So I need to check the difference between their year_left values. \n\nRossville left in 1977, and Clinton Prairie left in 1974.

The claim is: \"rensselaer central in rossville , join in 1958 and leave in 1966.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things: the school name (\"rensselaer central\"), location (\"rossville\"), and the years they joined and left (\"join in 1958\" and \"leave in 1966\"). So I need to check each of these aspects against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with multiple rows, each representing a different school. Each row has several columns like school name, city, team name, county, year joined, and year left. \n\nI'll start by searching for \"rensselaer central\" in the school column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 4: school: rensselaer central. That's a match.\n\nNext, check if this school is located in \"rossville.\" Looking at the city column for Row 4, it says \"rensselaer,\" not \"rossville.\" So there's an inconsistency here. The claim states the location as rossville, but according to the table, rensselaer central is in rensselaer.\n\nMoving on to the joining and leaving years. The claim says they joined in 1958 and left in 1966. Checking Row 4: year joined is 1947, and year left is 1949. That doesn't match the claimed 1958 and 1966. \n\nWait, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check. No, according to the table, rensselaer central was there from 1947 to 1949.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"the team from carroll join in 1970 , before harrison (west lafayette) join\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the rows related to Carroll and Harrison (West Lafayette). \n\nStarting with Carroll: I'll scan through all rows to find where the school is Carroll. From the table, I see Row 10 has school: carroll. So that's our starting point.\n\nNow, looking at the year joined for Carroll's team. The row says \"year joined: 1961\". Wait, that doesn't match the claim which states they joined in 1970. Hmm, so maybe there's a mistake here. But I need to check if any other rows have Carroll as school, but from the table, Row 10 is the only one.\n\nNext, checking Harrison (West Lafayette). Let's find that row. It's Row 13: school: harrison (west lafayette), city: west lafayette. Their year joined is 1970 according to the table. So their team joined in 1970.\n\nThe claim says Carroll's team joined before Harrison's. But from the data, Carroll joined in 1961 and Harrison in 1970. Therefore, Carroll actually joined earlier than Harrison.\n\nWait, but the claim states that Carroll joined in 1970, which is incorrect because they joined in 1961. So does this mean the claim is false? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is comparing when both teams joined relative to each other. If the claim says Carroll joined in 1970, but according to the table, Carroll joined in 1961. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the year is wrong, making it a false statement.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the claimed year for Carroll doesn't match the actual data. As for relevant cells, I need to find which cells were checked. That would be Row 10 for Carroll and Row 13 for Harrison (West Lafayette). So their columns are \"year joined\".\n\nI think that's all.

It's saying that Winamac joined 10 years after Southwestern did. So my goal is to find out when both these schools joined the program and see if there's a 10-year difference between their joining years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes like team name, county, year joined, etc. I'll need to find the rows for Winamac and Southwestern.\n\nStarting with Winamac: Scanning through the rows, I find Row 6 is Winamac.

Yes, Row 8: school: southwestern, year joined: 1958.\n\nNow, calculating the difference between their joining years. Winamac joined in 1947 and Southwestern in 1958. So the time between is 1958 - 1947 = 11 years. Hmm, but the claim says \"10 years after.\" That's an 11-year gap, not 10.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me check again. Winamac joined in 1947, Southwestern in 1958. So from 1947 to 1958 is indeed 11 years apart. Therefore, the claim that it's a 10-year difference is incorrect.\n\nSo the claim should be FALSE because the actual gap is 11 years, not 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"only 1 team from 12 clinton county and 1 team from carroll county join.\" So, this means that in the table, there should be exactly one team with '12 Clinton' as their county and another team with 'Carroll' as their county. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row to identify which rows are relevant.\n\nStarting from Row 1: school: attica, city: attica, team name: red ramblers, county: 23 fountain, year joined: 1947, year left: 1966. The county here is 23 Fountain, so not relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 2: school: delphi community, city: delphi, team name: oracles, county: 08 carroll, year joined: 1947, year left: 1992. This has '08 Carroll', which is different from '12 Clinton' and 'Carroll'. So, not directly relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 3: school: flora, city: flora, team name: badgers, county: 08 carroll, year joined: 1947, year left: 1961. Again, '08 Carroll' is present, so this row isn't about either of the counties in question.\n\nRow 4: school: rensselaer central, city: rensselaer, team name: bombers, county: 37 jasper, year joined: 1947, year left: 1949. The county here is 37 Jasper, not relevant.\n\nRow 5: school: rossville, city: rossville, team name: hornets, county: 12 clinton, year joined: 1947, year left: 1977. This row has '12 Clinton', so it's relevant for the part of the claim about Clinton County. So, this is one team from 12 Clinton.\n\nRow 6: school: winamac, city: winamac, team name: warriors, county: 66 pulaski, year joined: 1947, year left: 1972. The county here is 66 Pulaski, so not relevant.\n\nRow 7: school: sheridan, city: sheridian, team name: blackhawks, county: 29 hamilton, year joined: 1948 2000, which seems odd\u2014maybe a typo or combined years? Anyway, the county isn't 12 Clinton or Carroll, so irrelevant for this claim.\n\nRow 8: school: southwestern, city: lafayette, team name: wildcats, county: 79 tippecanoe, year joined: 1958, year left: 1966. County is 79 Tippecanoe, not relevant.\n\nRow 9: school: western, city: russiaville, team name: panthers, county: 34 howard, year joined: 1958, year left: 1965. County 34 Howard isn't in question, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 10: school: carroll, city: flora, team name: cougars, county: 08 carroll, year joined: 1961, year left: 1977. This has 'Carroll' as the county, which is relevant for the part of the claim about Carroll County. So this is one team from Carroll.\n\nRow 11: school: clinton prairie, city: frankfort, team name: gophers, county: 12 clinton, year joined: 1961, year left: 1974. Again, '12 Clinton' is present, so another team from 12 Clinton. Wait, but the claim says \"only 1 team\" from each county. So if there's more than one, that would make the claim FALSE.\n\nContinuing to check:\n\nRow 12: school: central catholic, city: lafayette, team name: knights, county: 79 tippecanoe, year joined: 1970, year left: 1993. County not relevant.\n\nRow 13: school: harrison (west lafayette), city: west lafayette, team name: raiders, county: 79 tippecanoe, year joined: 1970, year left: 1997. Again, irrelevant county.\n\nRow 14: school: mccutcheon, city: lafayette, team name: mavericks, county: 79 tippecanoe, year joined: 1975, year left: 1997. County not relevant for the claim.\n\nSo, from the table:\n\n- Team from 12 Clinton: rossville (Row 5) and clinton prairie (Row 11). So two teams.\n- Teams from Carroll: delphi community (Row 2), flora badgers (Row 3), carroll cougars (Row 10). Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the claim, it's about \"1 team from 12 clinton county\" and \"1 team from carroll county.\" So for '12 Clinton', the relevant rows are Row5 and Row11\u2014so two teams. For 'Carroll', looking at the table, which schools have Carroll as their county?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow2: delphi community, city: delphi, team name: oracles, county: 08 carroll.\n\nRow3: flora, city:flora, team name:badgers, county:08 carroll.\n\nRow10: carroll, city:flora, team name:cougars, county:08 carroll.\n\nSo that's three teams from Carroll County. So the claim says \"only 1\" from each, but in reality there are more.\n\nTherefore, the original claim is incorrect because there are multiple teams from both counties mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that there is only one team from 12 Clinton County and one team from Carroll County is incorrect based on the provided data. There are:\n\n- **Two teams** from 12 Clinton County:\n  - Rossville Hornets (Row 5)\n  - Clinton Prairie Gophers (Row 11)\n\n- **Three teams** from Carroll County:\n  - Delphi Community Oracles (Row 2)\n  - Flora Badgers (Row 3)\n  - Carroll Cougars (Row 10)\n\nTherefore, the claim is false as there are multiple teams from both counties.",
