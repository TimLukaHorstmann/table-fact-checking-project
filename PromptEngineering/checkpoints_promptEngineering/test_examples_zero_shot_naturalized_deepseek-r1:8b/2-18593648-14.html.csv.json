    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"2 of the artist get a double digit percent vote.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what constitutes a \"double digit percent vote.\" Typically, this means that the percentage value is 10% or higher because percentages are usually represented with two decimal places (e.g., 10.00%, 11.74%, etc.), but in some cases, it could mean any number where both digits are non-zero, like 12.34% or 99.99%. However, given the context of televote/sms percentages in a competition, it's more likely that \"double digit\" refers to being at least 10%.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: 2.95% \u2192 This is just under 3%, so not double digit.\nRow 2: 0.37% \u2192 Less than 1%, not relevant.\nRow 3: 11.74% \u2192 Over 10%, counts as double digit.\nRow 4: 2.39% \u2192 Just over 2%, no.\nRow 5: 2.53% \u2192 Similar to row 4, no.\nRow 6: 3.91% \u2192 Under 4%, no.\nRow 7: 3.20% \u2192 Just over 3%, no.\nRow 8: 8.45% \u2192 Over 10%, counts as double digit.\nRow 9: 2.03% \u2192 No.\nRow 10: 1.16% \u2192 No.\nRow 11: 55.52% \u2192 Over 10%, definitely counts.\nRow 12: 5.75% \u2192 Just under 6%, no.\n\nNow, let's count the number of artists with percentages over 10%. \n\n- Row 3: 11.74%\n- Row 8: 8.45%\n- Row 11: 55.52%\n\nThat's three artists, not two. The claim says \"2,\" but we have three. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row that has a double digit percentage should be included. From the above analysis:\n\nRow indices (assuming rows start at 0) for entries with over 10% are row 2 (11.74%), row 7 (8.45%), and row 10 (55.52%). So the relevant cells are at row indices 2, 7, and 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 5 artists that only have one name.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It's saying there are exactly five artists in the table whose names consist of a single word, no middle or last names. So, each of these five artists should have just one part to their name.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist with various attributes like draw number, song title, and televote percentage. The key here is the \"artist\" column because that's where the names are listed. I need to go through each artist and check if they only have a single name.\n\nLet me list out all the artists from rows 1 to 12:\n\nRow 1: Stefan Ilchev\nRow 2: Moto\nRow 3: Poli Genova\nRow 4: Danny Milev\nRow 5: Ivelina\nRow 6: Grafa\nRow 7: Sahara\nRow 8: Mariana Popova\nRow 9: Jura Tone feat Lady B\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev\nRow 11: Krassimir Avramov\nRow 12: Nora\n\nNow, I'll check each artist's name to see if it's a single name.\n\n1. **Stefan Ilchev**: This looks like a full name with first and last names. So, more than one name.\n2. **Moto**: This is likely a stage name or a single name used by the artist. So, one name.\n3. **Poli Genova**: First and last name, so multiple names.\n4. **Danny Milev**: Full name with first and last names.\n5. **Ivelina**: Seems like a single name.\n6. **Grafa**: Single name, often used as a stage name.\n7. **Sahara**: Single name.\n8. **Mariana Popova**: Full name with first and last names.\n9. **Jura Tone feat Lady B**: This is a collaboration, but the artist's name here is \"Jura Tone\" and \"Lady B.\" Depending on context, it could be two names or part of a duo. I think it's treated as multiple names because there are two parts.\n10. **Stefan Dobrev**: Full name with first and last names.\n11. **Krassimir Avramov**: Full name, so multiple names.\n12. **Nora**: Single name.\n\nSo, the artists with single names seem to be Moto, Ivelina, Grafa, Sahara, and Nora. That's five artists. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly five artists that only have one name in their \"artist\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me first understand what the claim says: it states that \"first place gets 55.52 percent of the vote, and last place gets 0.37 percent of the vote.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a draw number, with columns for televote/sms percentage and placement. So, to check this claim, I should look for the rows corresponding to first place (row 1) and last place (last row, which is row 12). \n\nFor first place, in row 11, the artist Krassimir Avramov has a televote/sms of 55.52%. That matches the claim's percentage for first place.\n\nNow, for last place, I need to find the last row in the table. The highest draw number is 12, which corresponds to Nora with a placement of 4 and a televote/sms of 5.75%. Wait, that doesn't match the 0.37% mentioned in the claim. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"last place.\" \n\nWait, perhaps the term \"last place\" refers to the lowest ranking, which is the highest draw number. But looking at the placements, row 12 is placed 4th. So if first place gets 55%, and last place (i.e., the lowest rank) gets 0.37%, I should check for an artist with that percentage in the lowest placement. \n\nLooking through the table, the televote/sms percentages range from about 1% to 55%. The only row with a low percentage is row 2: 0.37%, but its placement is 12th, which is actually one of the higher draw numbers but not the last in placement since the highest number is 12 but placed at position 4. So maybe there's confusion here. \n\nWait, perhaps \"last place\" refers to the highest numerical draw number, regardless of placement. Let me check row 12: it's draw 12 and placed 4th with 5.75%. That doesn't match 0.37%. The only artist with 0.37% is in row 2 (draw 2), which is placed 12th but that's a high percentage for placement, not low. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the last place as per the table isn't getting 0.37%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"last place\" refers to the artist with the lowest placement number, i.e., 1st place is highest, so last place would be 12th place. In that case, looking for a 12th place entry. However, in row 11, Krassimir Avramov is 1st and has 55.52%. The last placement given in the table is 4th (row 12) with 5.75%. So there's no artist who got 0.37% and ended up last.\n\nWait, but looking again, row 2: draw 2, song razstoyaniya, televote/sms 0.37%, place 12. So that artist is placed 12th with 0.37%. But the claim says \"last place,\" which might mean the lowest placement number, i.e., 1st place being highest, so last place would be 12th. Therefore, row 2's artist is in last place with 0.37% televote.\n\nSo the claim states that first place (which is row 11) gets 55.52%, and last place (row 2) gets 0.37%. That seems to match. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because the artist in first place has the stated percentage, and the artist in last place also matches their percentage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"4 of the artist use a one name song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents an artist with their respective information: draw number, artist name, song title, and televote percentage along with their placement. The claim specifically mentions \"one name song,\" which suggests that the song's title is a single word or has only one name. My task is to check each artist's song to see if it fits this criterion.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Artist is Stefan Ilchev, song is \"get up.\" The song title is \"get up,\" which is a single word. So this counts as a one name song.\n2. **Row 2**: Moto's song is \"razstoyaniya.\" It's a two-word title, so it doesn't fit.\n3. **Row 3**: Poli Genova's song is \"one lifetime is not enough.\" This has multiple words, so no.\n4. **Row 4**: Danny Milev's song is \"nyama vreme.\" That's a two-word title as well, doesn't count.\n5. **Row 5**: Ivelina's song is \"ready for love.\" Also multi-word.\n6. **Row 6**: Grupa Grafa's song is \"vrag,\" which is one word. So that's another one name song.\n7. **Row 7**: Sahara's song is \"don't kiss for the money.\" Multi-word, so no.\n8. **Row 8**: Mariana Popova's song is \"crazy.\" Single word, counts as one name song.\n9. **Row 9**: Jura Tone feat Lady B's song is \"chance to love you.\" Multiple words.\n10. **Row 10**: Stefan Dobrev's song is \"everlasting.\" That's one word, so it counts.\n11. **Row 11**: Krassimir Avramov's song is \"illusion.\" Single word, that's another one name song.\n12. **Row 12**: Nora's song is \"it 's not right.\" The apostrophe might make it a single name, but the title seems to be a phrase rather than just one word.\n\nNow, I'll count how many artists have songs that are one name:\n\n- Stefan Ilchev (Row 1)\n- Grupa Grafa (Row 6)\n- Mariana Popova (Row 8)\n- Stefan Dobrev (Row 10)\n- Krassimir Avramov (Row 11)\n\nWait, that's five artists. The claim says \"4 of the artist use a one name song.\" Hmm, so according to my count, there are actually five, not four.\n\nBut let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miscount:\n\n1. Row 1: get up - yes\n6. Row 6: vrag - yes\n8. Row 8: crazy - yes\n10. Row 10: everlasting - yes\n11. Row 11: illusion - yes\n\nThat's five artists. So the claim says four, but there are actually five. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering \"vrag\" as one word. The song title is \"vrag,\" which is singular and likely a single name. Similarly, \"crazy\" is definitely a single word. \"Everlasting\" is one word. \"Illusion\" too. So yes, five artists.\n\nSo the correct answer should be that the claim is FALSE because there are five, not four, artists with one name songs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that four artists use a one-name song. Upon reviewing each artist's song title:\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev - \"get up\" (one word)\n2. Mariana Popova - \"crazy\" (one word)\n3. Stefan Dobrev - \"everlasting\" (one word)\n4. Krassimir Avramov - \"illusion\" (one word)\n5. Grupa Grafa - \"vrag\" (one word)\n\nThis totals five artists, not four as claimed.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\nRelevant cells are those where the song title is a single word:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the word love be use in a song 2 time.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It seems like it's saying that the word \"love\" appears in two different songs within the table. So, I should look through each row and check the \"song\" column to see if any of them contain the word \"love.\" If there are at least two songs with \"love\" in their titles, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Song is \"get up\" \u2014 doesn't have \"love.\"\nRow 2: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2014 nope.\nRow 3: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2014 that does include the word \"one\" and \"lifetime,\" but not \"love.\" Wait, actually, maybe it's implying that one lifetime isn't enough to love? Not sure if \"love\" is explicitly used here. Let me check again. No, it's more about time, not specifically love.\nRow 4: \"nyama vreme\" \u2014 doesn't have \"love.\"\nRow 5: \"ready for love\" \u2014 yes! This one definitely has \"love\" in the title.\nRow 6: \"vrag\" \u2014 nope.\nRow 7: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2014 no mention of love here.\nRow 8: \"crazy\" \u2014 nope.\nRow 9: \"chance to love you\" \u2014 yes, that's another one with \"love.\"\nRow 10: \"everlasting\" \u2014 maybe? It could relate to lasting love, but I'm not sure if it explicitly uses the word. Let me think. \"Everlasting\" often implies something enduring, which can be associated with love, but it might not directly use the word.\nRow 11: \"illusion\" \u2014 nope.\nRow 12: \"it's not right\" \u2014 nope.\n\nSo, from this, I found two songs that have \"love\" in their titles: Row 5 and Row 9.

Only Rows 2 and 10 are below. So yeah, only two artists, so the claim is definitely FALSE.\n\nI should make sure to list which rows have scores under 2% as relevant cells.

Therefore, the claim is false because there's a 55.15% point difference, not 70.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that there's a 70 percentage point difference between first and last place is false. The actual difference is 55.15%, which is less than 70.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the winner have the longest song title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim means. It says that the winner (the artist with the highest televote/sms percentage) has the longest song title. So I need to check two things: who the winner is and whether their song title is longer than others'.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist's performance. The columns relevant here are \"artist\" (which might not be needed directly), \"song\", \"televote / sms\" (which indicates the percentage), and \"place\". Wait, no, actually, I need to confirm which column has the song titles. In the table, each row lists 'song' as a separate column, so that's where I should look.\n\nNext, I need to identify who the winner is. The highest televote/sms percentage is key here. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: 2.95%\n- Row 2: 0.37%\n- Row 3: 11.74%\n- Row 4: 2.39%\n- Row 5: 2.53%\n- Row 6: 3.91%\n- Row 7: 3.20%\n- Row 8: 8.45%\n- Row 9: 2.03%\n- Row 10: 1.16%\n- Row 11: 55.52% (highest so far)\n- Row 12: 5.75%\n\nRow 11 has the highest televote/sms percentage of 55.52%, placing them at number 1. So, the winner is artist Krassimir Avramov with the song \"illusion\".\n\nNow, I need to compare the length of their song title (\"illusion\") with others. Let me list out all the song titles and note their lengths.\n\n- Row 1: get up (5 letters)\n- Row 2: razstoyaniya (14 letters)\n- Row 3: one lifetime is not enough (23 letters)\n- Row 4: nyama vreme (11 letters)\n- Row 5: ready for love (15 letters)\n- Row 6: vrag (4 letters)\n- Row 7: don't kiss for the money (21 letters)\n- Row 8: crazy (5 letters)\n- Row 9: chance to love you (19 letters)\n- Row 10: everlasting (11 letters)\n- Row 11: illusion (7 letters)\n- Row 12: it 's not right (14 letters, including the apostrophe)\n\nWait, but the claim is about the winner having the longest song title. The winner's song is \"illusion\" which is only 7 letters long. Looking at others, some have longer titles like \"one lifetime is not enough\" with 23 letters and \"razstoyaniya\" with 14.\n\nSo, Krassimir Avramov's song is much shorter than some others. Therefore, the claim that \"the winner have the longest song title\" seems to be FALSE because their song title isn't the longest.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting letters? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 3: one lifetime is not enough \u2192 count each word: \"one\" (3) + \"lifetime\" (8) + \"is\" (2) + \"not\" (3) + \"enough\" (6). Total: 3+8+2+3+6=22 letters. Wait, I thought it was 23 earlier; perhaps I included the space or a word incorrectly. Let me count again: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2192 each space counts as a character? Or just the letters in the title without spaces?\n\nHmm, the problem says to compare the song titles as given, so likely including all characters except the leading/trailing spaces. For example, \"razstoyaniya\" is spelled with an 'a' at the end, so it's 12 letters: r-a-z-s-t-o-y-a-n-i-y-a \u2192 wait, no, let me count R-A-Z-S-T-O-Y-A-N-I-Y-A: that's 13 letters. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no, \"razstoyaniya\" is spelled as R-A-Z-S-T-O-Y-A-N-I-Y-A, which is 12 letters? Or perhaps it's 13 because each 'y' is a letter. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this; the main point is that Krassimir's song is much shorter.\n\nSo, regardless of exact counts, the key fact is that \"illusion\" is not the longest title among all entries, especially since some have longer titles like \"one lifetime is not enough\" with 22 or 23 letters and \"razstoyaniya\" with 13 letters. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe winner is Krassimir Avramov with the song \"illusion,\" which has a shorter title compared to other entries. Thus, the claim that the winner has the longest song title is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim means. It says that there are two song titles listed in English. So I should look through each row of the table and check the \"song\" column to see which ones have English titles.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Song is \"get up\" \u2013 that's English.\nRow 2: Song is \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 doesn't look like it's in English, sounds Russian or another language.\nRow 3: Song is \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 definitely English.\nRow 4: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 seems non-English, maybe Bulgarian.\nRow 5: \"ready for love\" \u2013 English.\nRow 6: \"vrag\" \u2013 likely not English, possibly another language.\nRow 7: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 English with an apostrophe, so still English.\nRow 8: \"crazy\" \u2013 English.\nRow 9: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 English.\nRow 10: \"everlasting\" \u2013 English.\nRow 11: \"illusion\" \u2013 English.\nRow 12: \"it 's not right\" \u2013 English.\n\nNow, let's count how many are in English. Rows 1,3,5,7,8,9,10,11,12 have English song titles. That's nine out of twelve. So there are definitely more than two in English.\n\nThe claim says \"2 song title be in english.\" Does this mean exactly two or at least two? If it means at least two, then the statement is FALSE because there are actually many more. But if it's about exactly two, well, that's not the case either. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"2 song title be in english.\" Perhaps it's a translation issue and they mean two songs? Or does it refer to two instances where the song titles are in English?\n\nLooking back at the table, there are way more than two song titles in English. So regardless of whether it's exactly two or at least two, the claim is incorrect because there are multiple.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim states only two, but there are many more.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that there are two song titles in English. Upon reviewing each row, we find that there are actually nine song titles in English, not just two. This makes the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
