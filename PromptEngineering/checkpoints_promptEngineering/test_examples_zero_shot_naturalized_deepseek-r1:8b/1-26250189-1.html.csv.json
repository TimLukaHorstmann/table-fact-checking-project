    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"for the first solo performance they choose the song 'For Once in My Life', originally by Stevie Wonder.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The key elements are:\n1. It's a first solo performance.\n2. The song chosen is \"For Once in My Life.\"\n3. The original artist is Stevie Wonder.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week and contains information about the theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. I need to check if there's any row that matches all three aspects of the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Week: audition, Theme: auditioner's choice, Song: last, Artist: Glenn Miller, Result: advanced. Doesn't match.\n- Row 2: Week: Hollywood, Theme: first solo performance, Song: For Once in My Life, Artist: Stevie Wonder, Order: n/a, Result: advanced. This matches all three aspects of the claim.\n  \nSince Row 2 directly matches the song choice and original artist for a first solo performance, it fully supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is Row 2, Column \"song choice\" or maybe another column? Wait, the columns are week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, result. So the relevant cells would be row index (2) and column name as either \"theme\" or \"song choice\" but more accurately, all three elements: theme is first solo performance, song choice is For Once in My Life, original artist is Stevie Wonder. So perhaps I should include each relevant column.\n\nBut according to the instructions, relevant_cells should list which cells are checked. So for Row 2, columns \"theme\", \"song choice\", and \"original artist\" are relevant because they directly support the claim.\n\nWait, but the example given in the instructions only listed two cells. Maybe I need to include each column that is relevant. However, perhaps it's sufficient to list all three: theme, song choice, original artist for Row 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just \"song choice\" and \"original artist\", as those are the specific parts of the claim being verified. The theme might not be necessary unless it's part of what the claim is about. Hmm, but the claim specifically mentions a first solo performance, which corresponds to the theme in the table.\n\nSo, to accurately capture all relevant cells for verification, I should include:\n- Row 2 (row index: 2)\n- Columns: \"theme\", \"song choice\", and \"original artist\"\n\nBut looking back at the example provided, it only included two columns. Maybe it's acceptable to include all three or perhaps just the ones that directly correspond. Since the claim mentions both song choice and original artist, those would definitely be relevant. The theme is part of the context but not directly a claim element, so maybe including theme is optional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this task, only \"song choice\" and \"original artist\" are necessary to verify because they are explicitly stated in the claim.\n\nI think the most accurate approach is to include all three relevant columns: theme, song choice, and original artist. So each of these columns in Row 2 would be checked against the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2, where the first solo performance features \"For Once in My Life\" by Stevie Wonder.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"For the Rolling Stones theme, Katie be number 6 in order.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table and see what information is there. Let's go through each row.\n\nRow 1 mentions audition week with Glenn Miller and advanced result. Not relevant.\nRow 2 is Hollywood week with a solo performance by Stevie Wonder. No Rolling Stones here.\nRow 3 is Hollywood week group performance by Alicia Keys. Still not Rolling Stones.\nRow 4 is Hollywood week second solo by Adele. Not relevant.\n\nNow, starting from Row 5: it's about Top 24 (12 women) with billboard hits. Song is Feeling Good by Cy Grant. Order is 12 and result is safe. But no mention of Rolling Stones here.\n\nMoving to Row 8: Week top 12, theme is The Rolling Stones. Song choice is Wild Horses. Original artist is The Rolling Stones. Order is 6, result is safe. So this row has the Rolling Stones theme with order 6.\n\nBut the claim mentions Katie being number 6. Wait, in Row 8, the original artist is The Rolling Stones, not Katie. So Katie isn't mentioned here.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all rows again. Maybe another row has Rolling Stones and Katie in a different role.\n\nRow 9: Top 11 with Billboard 1 hits. Song Big Girls Don't Cry by Fergie. Order 8, result bottom 3. No Rolling Stones here.\n\nRow 10: Top 10 R&B/Soul. Chain of Fools by Aretha Franklin. Order 7, result bottom 3. Not Rolling Stones.\n\nRow 11: Top 9 Lennon-McCartney theme. Let It Be by The Beatles. Order 2, safe. No Rolling Stones.\n\nWait, so only Row 8 has Rolling Stones as the theme, but it's about the original artist being The Rolling Stones with order 6. There's no mention of Katie being in any position here. So Katie isn't listed in the table as part of the order for the Rolling Stones theme.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Katie be number 6 in order\" for the Rolling Stones theme is not supported by the table. It seems to be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the song chosen for the rolling stone theme was originally performed by the rolling stones.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several rows and columns like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. My focus is on finding any row where the theme is \"the rolling stones\" because that's what the claim is about.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Theme is 'audition', not relevant.\n- Row 2: 'first solo performance'\u2014no.\n- Row 3: 'group performance'\u2014no.\n- Row 4: 'second solo'\u2014no.\n- Row 5: 'billboard hot 100 hits'\u2014no.\n- Row 6: Same theme as 5, no.\n- Row 7: Same, no.\n- Row 8: Theme is 'the rolling stones'. This looks relevant because the claim mentions this specific theme.\n- Rows 9-11 have different themes.\n\nNow, for row 8, I see that the song choice is 'wild horses' and the original artist is listed as 'the rolling stones'. That matches exactly what the claim says. The claim states that the song chosen for the 'rolling stones' theme was originally performed by them. So, this row directly supports the claim.\n\nI don't find any other relevant rows because no other themes match \"the rolling stone.\" Therefore, only row 8 is relevant here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 8 where the theme is \"the rolling stones\" and the original artist is the Rolling Stones.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"9 be Katie's order number when the theme be the rolling stone.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"order number,\" which seems to refer to a position in some competition, likely related to the themes or songs being performed. The term \"Katie\" probably refers to a contestant named Katie. The key part is that this order number (9) should be associated with a theme called \"the rolling stone.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about different weeks and themes. I need to find rows where the theme matches \"the rolling stones.\" Wait, actually, in the claim it's written as \"rolling stone,\" but in the table, Row 8 says: week: top 12, theme: the rolling stones, song choice: wild horses, original artist: the rolling stones, order: 6. So the correct spelling is \"the rolling stones.\"\n\nNow, I check if any row has both the theme as \"the rolling stones\" and an order number of 9. From Row 8, the order is 6, which doesn't match. The other rows either don't mention \"the rolling stones\" or have different order numbers.\n\nI also need to ensure that this is Katie's performance. In the table, there are multiple contestants like Adele, Alicia Keys, etc., but I don't see a specific row for Katie. Maybe she didn't perform under the theme \"the rolling stones.\" Since there's no row with both theme \"the rolling stones\" and order number 9, the claim seems to be false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells that support my answer. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"big girl don't cry be the choice song where the original artist be stevie wonder.\" So I'm looking for a row in the table where two conditions are met: the song choice is \"big girl don't cry\" and the original artist is Stevie Wonder.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row one by one to check if any match both criteria. Let me look at Row 9. The song choice is \"big girls don't cry,\" which is a slight variation but likely the same as \"big girl don't cry.\" However, the original artist for this row is listed as Fergie, not Stevie Wonder. So that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking further down, I don't see any rows where the song choice is \"big girl don't cry\" and the original artist is Stevie Wonder. The only row with \"big girls don't cry\" is Row 9, but the artist there is Fergie. There's also a Row 8 where the song is \"wild horses\" by The Rolling Stones, and Row 7 has \"breakaway\" by Kelly Clarkson. None of these mention Stevie Wonder or \"big girl don't cry.\"\n\nWait, I should double-check if any other rows might have \"big girl don't cry.\" Scanning through, I see that Row 9 is the only one with that song choice. So there's no row where both conditions are met: song choice is \"big girl don't cry\" and original artist is Stevie Wonder.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table, so it must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by the provided table, as no row matches both conditions of the song choice and original artist. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the rolling stone be the original artist of the chosen song when the theme be r&b / soul.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means and check it against the table provided.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n\n1. \"the rolling stone be the original artist\" \u2013 so we're looking for any row where the original artist is The Rolling Stone.\n2. \"when the theme be r&b / soul\" \u2013 we need to find rows where the theme is R&B/Soul.\n\nSo, I should look through each row of the table and see if there's a match where both conditions are true: the original artist is The Rolling Stone AND the theme is R&B/Soul.\n\nLet me go through the table one by one.\n\nRow 1: Week audition, theme auditioner's choice, song last, original artist Glenn Miller and His Orchestra. Theme isn't R&B/Soul, so no.\n\nRow 2: Week Hollywood, theme first solo, song For Once in My Life, original artist Stevie Wonder. Theme is first solo, not R&B/Soul.\n\nRow 3: Week Hollywood, group performance, No One by Alicia Keys. Again, theme is group performance, not matching.\n\nRow 4: Week Hollywood, second solo, Chasing Pavements by Adele. Theme is second solo, no match.\n\nRow 5: Week top 24 (12 women), Billboard Hot 100 hits, Feeling Good by Cy Grant. Theme is Billboard Hot 100 hits, which isn't R&B/Soul.\n\nRow 6: Top 20 with theme Billboard Hot 100 hits, Put Your Records On by Corinne Bailey Rae. Same as above.\n\nRow 7: Top 16 with theme Billboard Hot 100 hits, Breakaway by Kelly Clarkson. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Week top 12, theme The Rolling Stones, Wild Horses by The Rolling Stone (wait, the original artist is The Rolling Stone here). But what's the theme? It says \"the rolling stones,\" which might be a typo, but in the table it's written as \"theme: the rolling stones.\" Wait, no, looking back, row 8 has \"theme: the rolling stones\" and song by the same name. So, original artist is The Rolling Stones, and theme is The Rolling Stones.\n\nWait, but the claim says when the theme is R&B/Soul. Is \"the rolling stones\" considered R&B/Soul? Well, The Rolling Stones are more rock, but sometimes their songs have soul elements. However, in this table, I think we need to go by the theme column's exact value. So if the theme is \"the rolling stones,\" that's not R&B/Soul.\n\nWait, no, row 8: week top 12, theme: the rolling stones, song: wild horses, original artist: the rolling stones. So the theme is \"the rolling stones.\" The claim says when the theme is R&B/Soul, so this doesn't match because the theme isn't R&B/Soul.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again. Maybe the theme in row 8 is \"r&b/soul\"? No, it's written as \"the rolling stones.\" So no match for R&B/Soul.\n\nMoving on to row 9: Week top 11, theme Billboard 1 hits, song Big Girls Don't Cry by Fergie. Theme isn't R&B/Soul.\n\nRow 10: Top 10 with r&b/soul theme, song Chain of Fools by Aretha Franklin. Oh, here we go! So the theme is \"r&b / soul,\" which matches the second part of the claim. The original artist here is Aretha Franklin, not The Rolling Stone. So even though the theme matches, the original artist doesn't.\n\nRow 11: Week top 9, theme Lennon-McCartney, song Let It Be by The Beatles. Not relevant.\n\nWait a minute, so in row 8, the theme was \"the rolling stones,\" which is not R&B/Soul, and in row 10, the theme is R&B/Soul but original artist isn't The Rolling Stone. So there's no row where both conditions are met: original artist is The Rolling Stone AND theme is R&B/Soul.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence in the table supporting it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires finding a row where the original artist is The Rolling Stones and the theme is R&B/Soul. After checking all rows, none satisfy both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
