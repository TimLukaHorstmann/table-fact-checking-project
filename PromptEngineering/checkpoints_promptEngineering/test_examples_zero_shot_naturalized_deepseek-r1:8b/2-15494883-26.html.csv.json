    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Vit\u00f3ria airport being the most crowded and running at 222.5% capacity is true based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see which one refers to Vit\u00f3ria. The table has rows from rank 1 to 15, and I remember that the last few rows are for smaller cities like Vit\u00f3ria. Let me scan down: yes, row 15 is for Vit\u00f3ria with total passengers 1,246,222, annual change of 6.1%, and capacity in use of 222.5%. That's exactly what the claim mentions.\n\nNow, to verify if it's the most crowded airport, I need to check other airports' passenger numbers. The higher the total passengers, the more crowded it is. Let me look at the highest-ranked cities. Row 1 is S\u00e3o Paulo with over 13 million passengers, row 2 also S\u00e3o Paulo but a bit less. Then Bras\u00edlia has almost 10 million, Rio de Janeiro has around 6 million each, Salvador and Porto Alegre have about 4 million, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Curitiba, Fortaleza all have over 2 million. Florian\u00f3polis, Manaus, Bel\u00e9m, and Vit\u00f3ria are lower.\n\nComparing these, the highest total passengers are in S\u00e3o Paulo at row 1 (13,611,227) and row 2 (12,940,193). So Vit\u00f3ria's 1,246,222 is much lower. Therefore, Vit\u00f3ria isn't the most crowded; it's actually one of the least.\n\nThe claim says it's \"the most crowded,\" which is false because others have way more passengers. But the second part about capacity in use being 222.5% is accurate as per row 15.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Vit\u00f3ria airport is the most crowded and operating at 222.5% capacity. The table shows that Vit\u00f3ria's total passengers are indeed 1,246,222 with a 222.5% capacity. However, it's not the most crowded as other airports in S\u00e3o Paulo have much higher passenger counts.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Row 15 for Vit\u00f3ria's capacity in use.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"none of the airports on the list have seen a decrease in use\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim suggests that for every airport listed, the 'annual change' is positive, meaning passenger numbers increased compared to the previous year. So, if any row shows a negative annual change, that would make the claim false.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I should go through each row and check the 'annual change' value. Each row has a rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. The 'annual change' is given as a percentage, so positive values indicate an increase, and negative would mean a decrease.\n\nStarting with Row 1: annual change is 12.8% \u2013 that's positive.\nRow 2: 11.7% \u2013 also positive.\nRow 3: 45.1% \u2013 definitely increasing.\nRow 4: 30.4% \u2013 up.\nRow 5: 9.2% \u2013 still an increase.\nRow 6: 20.0% \u2013 up.\nRow 7: 11.6% \u2013 positive.\nRow 8: 7.5% \u2013 yes.\nRow 9: 16.1% \u2013 increasing.\nRow 10: 13.0% \u2013 up.\nRow 11: 24.0% \u2013 higher.\nRow 12: 7.8% \u2013 positive.\nRow 13: 10.3% \u2013 increase.\nRow 14: 13.5% \u2013 up.\nRow 15: 6.1% \u2013 still an increase.\n\nWait, all the annual changes here are positive percentages. I don't see any negative numbers indicating a decrease in use. So, according to this table, every airport's passenger count increased from the previous year.\n\nTherefore, since none of them have seen a decrease, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"annual change\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the most over capacity airport, Vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that has seen the least annual growth.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first part mentions \"the most over capacity airport, Vit\u00f3ria.\" Looking at the table, I should find which row corresponds to Vit\u00f3ria. Scanning through the locations, I see that Row 15 is for Vit\u00f3ria. So, I need to check its capacity in use. From the table, Vit\u00f3ria's capacity in use is 222.5%. That's pretty high compared to others like Recife at 63.5% or Bel\u00e9m at 49.3%.\n\nNext, the claim says that this airport (Vit\u00f3ria) also has \"the least annual growth.\" So I need to check two things for Vit\u00f3ria: its total passengers and their annual change. From Row 15, total passengers are 1,246,222 and the annual change is 6.1%. \n\nNow, I need to compare both aspects: capacity in use and annual growth across all airports listed in the table. The highest capacity in use would be Vit\u00f3ria at 222.5%, which is higher than other airports like Manaus (75.4%) and Bel\u00e9m (49.3%). So that part seems correct.\n\nFor the least annual growth, I should look for the smallest percentage increase in total passengers. Let me go through each row:\n\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 12.8% (Row 1)\n- Recife: 16.1%\n- Salvador: 20.0%\n- Porto Alegre: 11.6%\n- Belo Horizonte: 7.5%\n- Curitiba: 13.0%\n- Fortaleza: 24.0%\n- Florian\u00f3polis: 7.8%\n- Manaus: 10.3%\n- Bel\u00e9m: 13.5%\n- Vit\u00f3ria: 6.1%\n\nThe smallest annual change is indeed Vit\u00f3ria at 6.1%. That's lower than all others, confirming the second part of the claim.\n\nPutting it together: Vit\u00f3ria has the highest capacity in use and also the least annual growth. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro be the only location to see more than 10,000,000 passenger pass through their airport.\"\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to check how many passengers each location had. The relevant column here is \"total passengers.\" I'm specifically looking for locations that have more than 10 million passengers.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo has 13,611,227 passengers. That's over 10 million.\nRow 2: Also S\u00e3o Paulo with 12,940,193 passengers. Again, over 10 million.\nRows 3 to 15: The next highest is Row 3, which is Bras\u00edlia at 9,926,786. Wait, that's actually under 10 million. Then Rio de Janeiro has rows 4 and 5. Let me check:\n\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro has 6,024,930 passengers. That's under 10 million.\nRow 5: Another entry for Rio de Janeiro with 4,887,306 passengers. Also under 10 million.\n\nSo, from this, only S\u00e3o Paulo (Rows 1 and 2) have total passengers over 10 million. Rio de Janeiro doesn't make it to the 10 million mark in any of their entries.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim says \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro\" as the only locations. But according to the table, only S\u00e3o Paulo has over 10 million. Rio de Janeiro's rows are at 6 million and 4 million, which is below 10 million.\n\nSo that means the claim is incorrect because it claims both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have more than 10 million passengers, but in reality, only S\u00e3o Paulo does. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant column is \"total passengers,\" so for each location that meets the condition, their rows are relevant.\n\nSo, for S\u00e3o Paulo (rows 1 and 2), their total passengers columns are relevant because they have over 10 million. Rio de Janeiro doesn't meet the condition, so their cells aren't relevant here.\n\nI should list all row indices where the location is S\u00e3o Paulo and the total passengers exceed 10 million. That would be rows 1 and 2.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total passengers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport, and both of them have 1 run under capacity and 1 running over.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The first part is about locations: it specifies two cities, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as the only locations with two airports each. Then, for these two locations, it says that each has one airport operating under capacity (annual change less than 100%) and another running over (annual change above 100%).\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check which rows correspond to S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo, rank 1. \nRow 2: S\u00e3o Paulo, rank 2.\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia, rank 3.\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro, rank 4.\nRow 5: Rio de Janeiro, rank 5.\nRows 6-15 cover other cities like Salvador, Porto Alegre, etc.\n\nSo, S\u00e3o Paulo has two entries (rows 1 and 2), and Rio de Janeiro also has two entries (rows 4 and 5). That's four rows in total for these two locations. \n\nNow, the claim says each of these locations (S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio) has two airports, so we need to check both rows for each city.\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\nRow 1: annual change is 12.8%, which is above 100%, but wait, no\u2014wait, capacity in use is a percentage, right? So the \"annual change\" refers to the percentage increase or decrease in total passengers compared to the previous year. If it's positive, that means more passengers than before, which could mean over capacity. If negative, fewer, under.\n\nWait, but the table might not be using capacity in use directly related to whether they're under or over. The claim is about each location having two airports: one under and one over. So for each of these four rows (S\u00e3o Paulo twice, Rio de Janeiro twice), we need to see if their annual changes are above 100% (over) and below 100% (under).\n\nWait, but the term \"annual change\" is a percentage increase or decrease. If it's positive, it means more passengers, which might mean over capacity. But wait, does higher passenger numbers always mean over capacity? That depends on the capacity, right? Because if the airport's capacity is being used up to 100%, any additional passengers would go over. So, for example, a 12.8% increase in total passengers (Row 1) suggests that they're operating above their original capacity.\n\nBut looking at Row 1: S\u00e3o Paulo, rank 1. annual change is +12.8%. Capacity in use is 113.4%, which is over 100%. So this airport is definitely over capacity.\n\nNow, the claim says each location (S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio) has two airports: one under and one over. So for each of these cities, we need to see if they have one row where annual change is positive (over) and another where it's negative or lower (under).\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\nRow 1: +12.8% (over)\nRow 2: -11.7% (under, because it's a decrease)\n\nSo that's one over, one under.\n\nFor Rio de Janeiro:\n\nRows 4 and 5.\n\nRow 4: annual change is +30.4%. Capacity in use is 40.2%, which is below 100%. Wait, that's confusing. If the capacity in use is 40.2%, does that mean it's operating at 40% of its capacity? So that would be under capacity.\n\nBut the annual change is 30.4%, meaning an increase from last year. So if they had, say, 10 million passengers last year and now have 13 million (assuming), but capacity is only 40%, so they're not using their capacity fully. That's a bit conflicting because higher passenger numbers usually indicate over capacity.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. \"Total passengers\" might be the actual number of passengers that went through the airport in a year. \"Annual change\" is the percentage increase or decrease compared to the previous year. \"Capacity in use\" refers to how much of their installed capacity they're using\u2014so if it's 40%, they have spare capacity, meaning they could handle more without being over.\n\nBut in this context, maybe the claim is considering whether each airport is operating above or below its maximum capacity. So for Row 4: annual change is +30.4% (passengers increased), but capacity in use is 40.2%. That might mean that even though passengers are up, they're still not reaching their full capacity.\n\nBut wait, if the capacity is fixed at, say, 15 million and last year was 10 million, this year it's 13 million\u2014so an increase of 30%, but still below capacity (40.2% would mean 40.2% of capacity used). So in that case, they're not over capacity; they're still under.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"capacity in use\" is a separate metric from whether the total passengers are increasing or decreasing. So, for example, if an airport's capacity is X, and it's using 40%, then even if it has a higher number of passengers than last year, it's still not over capacity\u2014it's just that they're using more, but still within their own capacity.\n\nSo, in the claim, \"both have 1 run under capacity and 1 running over\"\u2014so for each location, two airports: one where total passengers are up (over capacity), one where they're down or same (under).\n\nBut if both airports in a city are either under or over, that might not satisfy the claim.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\nRow 1: annual change +12.8% and capacity in use 113.4%. So this airport is definitely over capacity because they're using more than their maximum allowed.\n\nRow 2: annual change -11.7%, which is a decrease, so under capacity? Or is it just that the number of passengers went down?\n\nWait, if an airport's capacity is fixed, then having fewer passengers would mean it's under capacity (they could accept more without exceeding). But \"capacity in use\" being 90% might indicate they're not using their full potential.\n\nBut perhaps the key here is whether each airport is over or under\u2014so for each of these four airports (S\u00e3o Paulo twice, Rio de Janeiro twice), we need to see if one is above and one is below.\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\n- Row 1: +12.8%, capacity in use 113.4% \u2192 over\n- Row 2: -11.7% \u2192 decrease \u2192 under\n\nSo that works.\n\nFor Rio de Janeiro:\n\n- Row 4: +30.4%, capacity in use 40.2% \u2192 is this over? If capacity is fixed, then even with a higher number of passengers, if the capacity isn't being reached (40.2%), it's still under capacity.\n\nBut wait, maybe \"capacity in use\" is separate from whether they're at or above maximum capacity. So if they have a 30% increase but their capacity in use is only 40%, that might mean that they're not utilizing their full potential. But in terms of the actual maximum capacity, if passengers are increasing, even if it's below the \"capacity in use\", perhaps it's considered over.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nIf the annual change is positive, it means more passengers than last year. If they're using more than their previous year's total, that could indicate they're approaching or exceeding capacity. But without knowing the exact capacity, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nBut looking at Row 4: +30.4% and capacity in use 40.2%. So if last year they had, say, Y passengers, this year they have Y*(1+0.304)=Y*1.304. If their capacity is fixed at some number C, then having 1.304Y passengers might mean that they're still under capacity (if Y < C). But without knowing the relationship between Y and C, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"capacity in use\" is a direct measure\u2014so if it's less than 100%, the airport is under capacity; over 100%, over. So for Row 4: capacity in use is 40.2% \u2192 under. Annual change is +30.4% (passengers up) but still under capacity.\n\nSimilarly, Row 5: annual change -19.8% and capacity in use is 68.6%.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So for each of these four airports:\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo:\n\n- Row1: over capacity (113.4%), increase\n- Row2: decrease, but what about capacity? Capacity in use is 90.3%, which would be under.\n\nSo if both are considered under or over based on capacity in use, then it's mixed.\n\nBut for the claim, we need each location to have one under and one over. So let's see:\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\n- Row1: over (113.4%)\n- Row2: under (90.3%)\n\nSo that works: one over, one under.\n\nFor Rio de Janeiro:\n\n- Row4: capacity in use 40.2% \u2192 under\n- Row5: annual change -19.8%, and capacity in use is 68.6% \u2192 also under?\n\nWait, if Row4 has a +30.4% increase but still only using 40.2% of its capacity\u2014does that mean it's over or under? I'm confused because higher passenger numbers could mean they're over capacity, but if their capacity in use is still low, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"capacity in use\" is a separate metric from whether they've exceeded their previous year's total. So you can have both increases and decreases in passengers but be under or over capacity depending on the installed capacity.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe I should take the claim as needing each of these two cities to have one airport where passengers increased (over) and another where they decreased (under), regardless of the \"capacity in use\" number.\n\nSo:\n\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: Row1 over, Row2 under \u2192 satisfies\n- Rio de Janeiro: Row4 over? If +30.4% is considered over despite 40.2% capacity. Or maybe since it's a significant increase but still low usage, it's under.\n\nI think this is getting too tangled. Perhaps the answer is yes, because each city has one airport where passengers have increased (possibly over capacity) and another where they've decreased (under). So both cities satisfy the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires verifying whether two airports in each of two cities\u2014S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro\u2014each have one airport with an increase in passengers (over capacity) and another with a decrease (under capacity).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **S\u00e3o Paulo:**\n   - **Airport 1:** Passenger count increased by +12.8%, with a capacity utilization of 113.4% \u2192 Over capacity.\n   - **Airport 2:** Passenger count decreased by -11.7%, with a capacity utilization of 90.3% \u2192 Under capacity.\n\n2. **Rio de Janeiro:**\n   - **Airport 1:** Passenger count increased by +30.4%, with a capacity utilization of 40.2%. While passenger numbers are up, the low capacity utilization suggests it's still under capacity.\n   - **Airport 2:** Passenger count decreased by -19.8%, with a capacity utilization of 68.6% \u2192 Under capacity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEach city meets the condition of having one airport where passengers have increased (over capacity) and another where they've decreased (under capacity). Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{True}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about airports is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"all of the airport on the list have seen a decrease in use.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that every single airport listed has experienced a decrease in their usage. To check this, I need to look at how the 'annual change' and 'capacity in use' columns relate.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. The claim is specifically about whether the capacity in use has decreased. So, for each row, I need to check if the capacity in use is less than what it was before. However, the table doesn't provide previous years' data, so instead, the 'annual change' might indicate growth or decline.\n\nWait, the 'capacity in use' is a percentage. For example, a value of 113.4% means that the capacity used is higher than its maximum allowed capacity. So, if an airport's capacity in use is above 100%, it's being used more than its capacity. If it's below 100%, maybe there's underutilization.\n\nThe claim says \"decrease in use,\" so I think it refers to a decrease in passengers or utilization. However, since the table doesn't have historical data, perhaps we can infer from the annual change whether passenger numbers are increasing or decreasing.\n\nWait, but the 'annual change' is given as a percentage. For instance, a positive 12.8% annual change means an increase in total passengers, while a negative would be a decrease. However, looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: annual change is +12.8%\nRow 2: +11.7%\nRow 3: +45.1%\nRow 4: +30.4%\nRow 5: +9.2%\nRow 6: +20.0%\nRow 7: +11.6%\nRow 8: +7.5%\nRow 9: +16.1%\nRow 10: +13.0%\nRow 11: +24.0%\nRow 12: +7.8%\nRow 13: +10.3%\nRow 14: +13.5%\nRow 15: +6.1%\n\nAll the annual changes are positive, meaning total passengers are increasing each year for all airports listed. So, if the claim is about a decrease in use, that would mean passenger numbers going down. But according to the data, every single airport has an increase in total passengers.\n\nWait, but the 'capacity in use' might not directly correlate with passenger numbers. For example, Row 15 has a capacity in use of 222.5%, which is very high. So, even if passenger numbers are increasing, maybe their actual usage percentage is higher than capacity, indicating overcrowding or increased demand.\n\nBut the claim is about whether all airports have seen a decrease in use, so perhaps it's referring to whether they're not using their capacity. However, since all annual changes are positive, meaning more passengers, but some 'capacity in use' percentages are above 100%, which might mean they're operating beyond capacity. So, if the claim is that all airports have seen a decrease in use (i.e., using less than their capacity), then it's false because many have capacity in use over 100%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"decrease in use\" refers to passenger numbers decreasing. But since all annual changes are positive, meaning passengers increased, so all airports' total passengers went up, not down.\n\nWait, but the claim is about a decrease in use, not necessarily in passenger numbers. So perhaps it's about the capacity being underused. If an airport's capacity in use is below 100%, then they're not using their full capacity. But many rows have capacity in use above 100%, like Row 1 at 113.4%, so that's overcapacity.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is that all airports' usage has decreased compared to previous years. Since we don't have historical data, perhaps we can only consider if each airport's current annual change is a decrease. But since all annual changes are positive (increases), then none of them have a decrease in passengers. So the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"decrease in use\" refers to capacity in use being less than before, but without prior data, it's impossible to know. However, based on the given information, all airports' total passengers increased, so their usage is higher than previous years.\n\nTherefore, the claim that all airports have seen a decrease in use would be false because, according to the data, they've all experienced an increase in passenger numbers and possibly overcapacity.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that all airports on the list have seen a decrease in use. However, analyzing the table shows that every airport has an increase in total passengers (all annual changes are positive). Additionally, some capacity in use percentages exceed 100%, indicating they're operating beyond their capacity. Without historical data, we can't confirm past decreases, but current data shows increases.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the Recife airport be the most crowded airport, run at 81.2% capacity.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which aspects of the claim relate to the data in the table. The key elements are:\n1. **Location**: Recife\n2. **Capacity usage percentage**: 81.2%\n3. **Most crowded airport** (which implies it has the highest total passengers)\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an airport with specific details like rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use.\n\nI need to check:\n- If Recife's airport is listed as one of the rows.\n- What its total passengers and capacity in use are.\n- Compare it with other airports to see if it has the highest total passengers and whether 81.2% is accurate.\n\nLooking through the table, I spot Row 9: rank 9, location: Recife, total passengers: 3,173,672, annual change: 16.1%, capacity in use: 63.5%. Wait, that doesn't match the 81.2% mentioned. Hmm, did I miss another row for Recife?\n\nWait, no, there's only one Recife entry at Row 9 with a capacity in use of 63.5%. The claim says 81.2%, so that's different.\n\nSo, either the claim is incorrect in stating the capacity, or maybe I'm misunderstanding which airport is being referred to as \"Recife.\" Let me double-check the rows again.\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo\nRow 2: S\u00e3o Paulo\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro\nRow 5: Rio de Janeiro\nRow 6: Salvador\nRow 7: Porto Alegre\nRow 8: Belo Horizonte\nRow 9: Recife\nRow 10: Curitiba\nRow 11: Fortaleza\nRow 12: Florian\u00f3polis\nRow 13: Manaus\nRow 14: Bel\u00e9m\nRow 15: Vit\u00f3ria\n\nYes, only Row 9 is for Recife. Its capacity in use is 63.5%, not 81.2%. So the claim's assertion about the capacity is incorrect.\n\nNow, checking if Recife has the highest total passengers. Let me list all the total passengers:\n\n1. S\u00e3o Paulo: 13,611,227\n2. S\u00e3o Paulo: 12,940,193\n3. Bras\u00edlia: 9,926,786\n4. Rio de Janeiro: 6,024,930\n5. Rio de Janeiro: 4,887,306\n6. Salvador: 4,145,371\n7. Porto Alegre: 3,215,545\n8. Belo Horizonte: 3,194,715\n9. Recife: 3,173,672\n10. Curitiba: 2,840,349\n11. Fortaleza: 2,317,869\n12. Florian\u00f3polis: 1,382,577\n13. Manaus: 1,368,968\n14. Bel\u00e9m: 1,330,965\n15. Vit\u00f3ria: 1,246,222\n\nLooking at these numbers, S\u00e3o Paulo's first entry (13,611,227) is the highest, followed by another S\u00e3o Paulo row with slightly fewer passengers but still higher than Recife. So Recife doesn't have the highest total passengers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n- The capacity in use for Recife is 63.5%, not 81.2%.\n- The airport isn't the most crowded as it doesn't have the highest total passengers.\n\nI need to point out which rows are relevant. Rows related to Recife and capacity in use, so Row 9: location: Recife, column: capacity in use.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Recife's airport does not have an 81.2% capacity and it isn't the most crowded.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with a bunch of data about different locations and their airports' passenger numbers, changes, and capacity. The claim is that \"manaus and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport, and both of them be run over capacity.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check if manaus and rio de janeiro each have two airports. Looking at the table, row 13 is manaus with rank 13, and rows 4 and 5 are rio de janeiro. Wait, no\u2014rows are individual entries, but perhaps each location can have multiple airports? The table doesn't explicitly state how many airports per location; it just lists them in different rows.\n\nSo the claim says manaus and rio de janeiro are the only locations with two airports. But looking at the table, each row is a separate entry. For example, rio de janeiro has two entries: rank 4 and 5. So does that mean there are two airports in rio de janeiro? Similarly, manaus is just one row (rank 13). Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"two airport,\" so maybe it's implying each of these locations has more than one airport.\n\nWait, the table seems to have each location as a single row. So perhaps the rank indicates their position in terms of passenger numbers, but not the number of airports. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because the table doesn't show two airports for manaus or rio de janeiro. Manaus is just one entry, and rio de janeiro has two entries, but that's across different rows, so perhaps it's two airports in total.\n\nBut actually, looking at the data, the rank could be based on passenger numbers. So manaus has rank 13 with certain passengers, but it's only one airport as per the table structure. Similarly, rio de janeiro is mentioned twice (rows 4 and 5), which might indicate two separate airports in that city.\n\nSo the first part of the claim says \"manaus and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport.\" If each of them has one or two airports based on their rows, then maybe it's true. But I'm not entirely sure because the table isn't explicitly stating how many airports per location; it's just listing different locations.\n\nNext part: \"both of them be run over capacity.\" Looking at the data, we need to check if both manaus and rio de janeiro are over their capacity. For each location, we look at the 'capacity in use' percentage.\n\nIn row 13 (manaus), capacity in use is 75.4%, which is below 100%, so it's not over capacity.\n\nFor rio de janeiro: rows 4 and 5. Row 4 has capacity 40.2% and row 5 has 152.7%. So only one of the two airports (probably the second one) is over capacity, but the first isn't. Since both need to be run over capacity, this part fails.\n\nSo putting it all together: manaus doesn't have two airports as per the table structure, and even if it did, its capacity isn't over. Rio de janeiro has two entries, but only one is over capacity. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the most under capacity airport, vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that has seen the most annual growth.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. Let me break it down.\n\nThe term \"most under capacity airport\" refers to an airport where the capacity in use is the lowest among all listed airports. Capacity in use is a percentage compared to total capacity, so lower percentages mean more underutilized or under capacity.\n\nNext, the claim says that Vit\u00f3ria is also the airport with the most annual growth. Annual growth here would likely refer to the highest percentage increase in total passengers from one year to the next.\n\nSo, I need to check two things:\n1. Is Vit\u00f3ria's capacity in use the lowest among all airports?\n2. Does Vit\u00f3ria have the highest annual change (passenger growth) compared to other airports?\n\nLet me look at the table:\n\nThe table has 15 rows, each representing an airport. Each row includes rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use.\n\nFirst, I'll extract the relevant data for each airport:\n\nRow 1: Vit\u00f3ria is ranked 15, with total passengers 1,246,222; annual change 6.1%; capacity in use 222.5%.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table:\n\nWait, row 15 is rank 15, location: vit\u00f3ria, so that's Vit\u00f3ria. So I was right.\n\nNow, to find which airport has the highest annual growth. Annual change refers to the percentage increase in total passengers from one year to the next. A higher number means more growth.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1 (S\u00e3o Paulo): 12.8% annual change\n- Row 2 (S\u00e3o Paulo): 11.7%\n- Row 3 (Bras\u00edlia): 45.1%\n- Row 4 (Rio de Janeiro): 30.4%\n- Row 5 (Rio de Janeiro): 9.2%\n- Row 6 (Salvador): 20.0%\n- Row 7 (Porto Alegre): 11.6%\n- Row 8 (Belo Horizonte): 7.5%\n- Row 9 (Recife): 16.1%\n- Row 10 (Curitiba): 13.0%\n- Row 11 (Fortaleza): 24.0%\n- Row 12 (Florian\u00f3polis): 7.8%\n- Row 13 (Manaus): 10.3%\n- Row 14 (Belo\u00e9m): 13.5%\n- Row 15 (Vit\u00f3ria): 6.1%\n\nSo the highest annual change is in Bras\u00edlia at 45.1%, followed by Fortaleza at 24.0%. Vit\u00f3ria has only a 6.1% growth, which is lower than many others.\n\nWait, that contradicts the claim. The claim says Vit\u00f3ria has the most annual growth, but according to these numbers, it's actually one of the lowest. So the first part of the claim may already be incorrect because Vit\u00f3ria isn't even close to having the highest annual growth. \n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I misread something. Looking at each row again:\n\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia has 45.1%, which is clearly higher than all others, including Fortaleza's 24%. So the highest growth is Bras\u00edlia, not Vit\u00f3ria.\n\nNow, regarding capacity in use:\n\nCapacity in use is given as a percentage. Lower percentages mean more under capacity.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1 (S\u00e3o Paulo): 113.4%\nRow 2 (S\u00e3o Paulo): 78.4%\nRow 3 (Bras\u00edlia): 134.1%\nRow 4 (Rio de Janeiro): 40.2%\nRow 5 (Rio de Janeiro): 152.7%\nRow 6 (Salvador): 69.1%\nRow 7 (Porto Alegre): 52.7%\nRow 8 (Belo Horizonte): 213.0%\nRow 9 (Recife): 63.5%\nRow 10 (Curitiba): 81.2%\nRow 11 (Fortaleza): 77.3%\nRow 12 (Florian\u00f3polis): 125.7%\nRow 13 (Manaus): 75.4%\nRow 14 (Belo\u00e9m): 49.3%\nRow 15 (Vit\u00f3ria): 222.5%\n\nThe lowest capacity in use is Bel\u00e9m at 49.3%, followed by Recife at 63.5% and Manaus at 75.4%. Vit\u00f3ria has a capacity in use of 222.5%, which is higher than most, meaning it's actually more full relative to its capacity.\n\nSo the claim says that \"the most under capacity airport\" (which should be Bel\u00e9m or Recife) \"be also the airport that has seen the most annual growth.\" But as established earlier, Vit\u00f3ria doesn't have the highest annual growth. In fact, Bras\u00edlia does.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because:\n- The most under capacity airport isn't Vit\u00f3ria; it's either Bel\u00e9m or Recife.\n- The airport with the most annual growth isn't Vit\u00f3ria but Bras\u00edlia.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect. Hence, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because:\n\n1. **Under Capacity**: The airport with the lowest capacity in use is not Vit\u00f3ria (222.5%), but Bel\u00e9m at 49.3%.\n2. **Annual Growth**: The highest annual growth is not Vit\u00f3ria (6.1%), but Bras\u00edlia at 45.1%.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"under_capacity\": \"The most under capacity airport is Bel\u00e9m with 49.3%\",\n    \"annual_growth\": \"The highest annual growth is Bras\u00edlia with 45.1%\"\n  }\n}\n```",
