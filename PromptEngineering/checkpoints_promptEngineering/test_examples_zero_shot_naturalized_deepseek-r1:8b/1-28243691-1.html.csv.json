    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Rice University having the least number of enrolled students and the University of Texas at Austin having the most is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to identify which institutions are in question. The claim mentions two universities: Rice University and the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nStarting with Rice University, I find it in Row 6. Looking at its enrollment number, it's listed as 6799 students.\n\nNext, checking the University of Texas at Austin, it's located in Row 12. Its enrollment is much higher, at 50,995 students.\n\nNow, to confirm the claim, I need to see if Rice indeed has the least and UT Austin the most. I should check all the other universities listed to ensure no one has fewer or more than these numbers.\n\nLooking through each institution's enrollment:\n\n- Baylor University: 14,769\n- University of Louisiana at Lafayette: 16,361\n- Louisiana State University: 25,215\n- University of North Texas: 36,206\n- University of Oklahoma: 29,931\n- Rice University: 6,799 (already noted)\n- Southern Methodist University: 10,693\n- Texas A&M University: 48,702\n- Texas Christian University: 8,696\n- Texas State University at San Marcos: 32,586\n- Texas Tech University: 30,049\n- University of Texas at Austin: 50,995 (already noted)\n\nComparing all these, the lowest enrollment is Rice with 6,799, and the highest is UT Austin at 50,995. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"4 of the university list be private, the rest be public.\" So, I'm supposed to check how many universities in the table have a private affiliation versus public.\n\nLooking at the table, each row provides information about an institution, including its affiliation. The relevant column for this claim is the \"affiliation\" column because it indicates whether each university is private or public.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down their affiliations:\n\n1. Baylor University: Private (Baptist)\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette: Public\n3. Louisiana State University: Public\n4. University of North Texas: Public\n5. University of Oklahoma: Public\n6. Rice University: Private (Non-Secretarian)\n7. Southern Methodist University: Private (Methodist)\n8. Texas A&M University: Public\n9. Texas Christian University: Private (Disciples of Christ)\n10. Texas State University San Marcos: Public\n11. Texas Tech University: Public\n12. University of Texas at Austin: Public\n\nNow, let's count the private ones:\n\nRow 1: Private\nRow 6: Private\nRow 7: Private\nRow 9: Private\n\nThat makes a total of 4 private universities.\n\nThe rest (8 rows) are public. Wait, 12 rows in total. So 4 private and 8 public.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"4 of the university list be private, the rest be public.\" That seems to match because there are indeed 4 private and the remaining 8 are public. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant column here is \"affiliation,\" so each row where affiliation is either private or public needs to be considered.\n\nBut since the claim specifically refers to the count of private vs. public, perhaps only the rows that have private affiliation are relevant? Or maybe all rows because they contribute to the total count?\n\nWait, but the instruction says to list cells relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim is about the count of private and public affiliations, I think all rows are relevant as each contributes to determining whether the claim holds true.\n\nHowever, another angle: perhaps only the \"affiliation\" column needs to be checked for each row because that's what the claim refers to. So, for each institution, the affiliation is either private or public, and we need to check if exactly 4 are private.\n\nSo, I should include all rows in relevant cells but specifically highlight the affiliation data points.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: To verify the claim, we need to know how many private vs. public there are. So for each row, the \"affiliation\" column is checked. Therefore, all 12 rows' affiliation columns are relevant because each contributes to the count of private and public universities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the rows where affiliation is specified as either private or public matter, but in this table, all affiliations are provided, so perhaps all rows are relevant.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim says \"4 of the university list be private, the rest be public.\" So we need to check if exactly 4 have private affiliation and 8 have public.\n\nThus, for each row, the value in the \"affiliation\" column is what's checked. Therefore, all rows are relevant because their affiliation status contributes to the total count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the \"affiliation\" column is relevant, but since it's a single cell per row, maybe each row is considered because they have that data point. But I think the correct approach is to consider all rows as relevant because each institution's affiliation affects the overall count.\n\nWait, perhaps not. The claim is about the list of universities having 4 private and the rest public. So the total number is 12, so if exactly 4 are private, then it's TRUE. Therefore, we need to check how many have private affiliation across all rows.\n\nSo each row's affiliation is checked, which means that for each row, the cell in \"affiliation\" column is relevant because it contributes to whether the count of private is 4 or not.\n\nTherefore, all 12 rows' \"affiliation\" cells are relevant. Alternatively, perhaps only the \"affiliation\" cells need to be considered, but since they're part of a row, each row's entire structure is relevant? No, more accurately, the specific data point in the \"affiliation\" column is what's needed.\n\nWait, the user's example includes row_index and column_name. So for instance, if I'm checking revenue, it's all rows' revenue cells that are relevant.\n\nIn this case, since we're checking the count of private affiliations, each row's affiliation is a data point, so each \"affiliation\" cell in each row is relevant because they contribute to determining whether 4 are private or not.\n\nTherefore, I'll list all 12 rows with their \"affiliation\" columns as relevant.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim only refers to the count, and not necessarily to each individual row's affiliation. So maybe it's sufficient to check that there are exactly 4 private affiliations among the 12. Therefore, the relevant cells would be the \"affiliation\" column for all rows because each one is part of the total count.\n\nSo, in the JSON, I need to list all 12 rows, each with their row index and column name as \"affiliation\".\n\nWait, but maybe it's overkill, but according to the instructions, I should include all relevant cells that are used to verify the claim. Since the claim is about the count of private vs public, we need to check the affiliation of each institution, so yes, all 12 rows' affiliation columns are relevant.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, I'll list each row as a separate object, specifying their row index and column name (\"affiliation\").\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"4 of the university list be private, the rest be public,\" we need to check the affiliation status of each institution. The affiliation column for each row is relevant as it contributes to determining the total count of private and public universities.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 0,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 1,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Private\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 2,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 3,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 4,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Private\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 5,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Private\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 6,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 7,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 8,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 9,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 10,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Private\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"rowIndex\": 11,\n    \"columnName\": \"affiliation\",\n    \"value\": \"Public\"\n  }\n]\n```",

The claim says: \"Southern Methodist University was founded in 1911 and Texas Tech University was founded in 1923.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim and identify which parts of it correspond to the table data. The table has information about each institution's founding year, so I need to find the rows for Southern Methodist University (SMU) and Texas Tech University.\n\nStarting with SMU: According to the table, row 7 is Southern Methodist University. In that row, under \"founded,\" it says 1911. That matches the first part of the claim, so that's correct.\n\nNext, Texas Tech University: Looking through the rows, I see that row 11 is Texas Tech University. The founded year for this row is listed as 1923, which matches the second part of the claim. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nI should check if there's any conflicting information or if any other columns might affect this. For example, the affiliation and location are provided, but since the claim is about the founding year, those aren't relevant here.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"10 of the school list be found before 1900\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's saying that out of the 12 schools listed, 10 were founded before 1900. So I need to check each school's founding year and see how many are indeed before 1900.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Baylor University was founded in 1845. That's definitely before 1900.\n2. **Row 2**: University of Louisiana at Lafayette was founded in 1898. This is just a few years before 1900, so it counts.\n3. **Row 3**: Louisiana State University (LSU) was founded in 1860. Early enough.\n4. **Row 4**: University of North Texas was founded in 1890. Also before 1900.\n5. **Row 5**: University of Oklahoma was founded in 1890 as well, so that's another one.\n6. **Row 6**: Rice University was founded in 1891. Another yes.\n7. **Row 7**: Southern Methodist University (SMU) was founded in 1911. Wait, 1911 is after 1900. So this one doesn't count.\n8. **Row 8**: Texas A&M University was founded in 1871. That's before 1900.\n9. **Row 9**: Texas Christian University (TCU) was founded in 1873. Also early.\n10. **Row 10**: Texas State University at San Marcos was founded in 1899. Just under 1900, so it counts.\n11. **Row 11**: Texas Tech University was founded in 1923. That's after 1900. Doesn't count.\n12. **Row 12**: University of Texas at Austin was founded in 1883. Before 1900.\n\nNow, let me tally up the schools that were founded before 1900:\n\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12. That's 10 schools.\n\nWait, but Row 7 (SMU) was founded in 1911, which is after 1900, so it doesn't count. Similarly, Rows 11 (Texas Tech) was founded in 1923. So that means only 10 out of 12 are before 1900. Therefore, the claim says \"10 of the school list be found before 1900,\" which seems correct based on this count.\n\nHowever, I should double-check each founding year to make sure I didn't misread any:\n\n- Baylor: 1845\n- Louisiana-Lafayette: 1898\n- LSU: 1860\n- North Texas: 1890\n- Oklahoma: 1890\n- Rice: 1891\n- SMU: 1911 (after)\n- Texas A&M: 1871\n- TCU: 1873\n- Texas State: 1899\n- Texas Tech: 1923 (after)\n- UT Austin: 1883\n\nYes, that's 10 schools before 1900. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says to list relevant cells. The relevant column here is \"founded\" because we're checking each school's founding year against the cutoff of 1900. So for each of those 10 schools, I need to note their row index and the \"founded\" column name.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be all rows where founded < 1900, which are rows 1 through 6, 8-10, and 12. That's 10 rows.\n\nI think that's it. The claim is TRUE because exactly 10 schools were founded before 1900.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant column here is \"enrollment.\" So, I should go through each row, extract the enrollment number, and see if it's between 30k and 40k.\n\nLet me list out all the enrollment numbers:\n\n1. Baylor University: 14769 \u2013 this is below 30k.\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette: 16361 \u2013 also below 30k.\n3. Louisiana State University: 25215 \u2013 still below 30k.\n4. University of North Texas: 36206 \u2013 this one is above 40k, so it's over the upper limit.\n5. University of Oklahoma: 29931 \u2013 wait, that's just under 30k? No, actually, 29,931 is just below 30k, right? So it's outside the range.\n6. Rice University: 6799 \u2013 way below.\n7. Southern Methodist University: 10693 \u2013 also below.\n8. Texas A&M University: 48702 \u2013 that's over 40k.\n9. Texas Christian University: 8696 \u2013 still low.\n10. Texas State University at San Marcos: 32586 \u2013 this is just under 30k? Wait, no, 32,586 is above 30k but below 40k, so it falls within the range. Hmm, wait, actually, 32,586 is between 30k and 40k.\n11. Texas Tech University: 30049 \u2013 that's just slightly over 30k? Wait, no, 30,049 is above 30k, so it falls into the lower part of the range but still within 30-40k.\n12. University of Texas at Austin: 50,995 \u2013 way above 40k.\n\nWait, let me double-check each enrollment number to make sure I didn't misread any.\n\nRow 4: University of North Texas has 36,206 \u2013 that's between 30k and 40k? No, 36k is within the range. Wait, no, 36k is over 30k but under 40k. So yes, it's within.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me correct myself:\n\n- Row 4: 36206 \u2013 yes, between 30k and 40k.\n- Row 11: Texas Tech University has 30049 \u2013 that's just above 30k, so yes.\n- Row 10: Texas State University at San Marcos: 32586 \u2013 same as above.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought only three schools fall into this range, but upon checking, it seems there might be more than three. Let me recount:\n\n1. University of North Texas (Row 4): 36,206 \u2192 yes.\n2. Texas Tech University (Row 11): 30,049 \u2192 just above 30k.\n3. Texas State University at San Marcos (Row 10): 32,586 \u2192 also within.\n\nSo that's three schools: Rows 4, 10, and 11. Wait, but the claim says \"3 school list have an enrollment between 30000 and 40000.\" So exactly three.\n\nWait, are there any others? Let me check all rows again:\n\n- Row 12: 50k \u2013 no.\n- Row 8: 48,702 \u2013 over 40k.\n- Rows 1-7: mostly below 30k except maybe none. Wait, row 5: University of Oklahoma is 29,931 \u2013 that's just under 30k, so not included.\n\nSo only three schools meet the criteria: North Texas (Row4), Texas Tech (Row11), and Texas State (Row10). Therefore, the claim is TRUE because exactly three schools have enrollments between 30k and 40k.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I didn't miss any.

So that's one private institution.\n\nRow 2: University of Louisiana at Lafayette is public. That's the first public institution.\n\nRow 3: Louisiana State University is also public, so that's the second.\n\nRow 4: University of North Texas is public as well, making it three.\n\nRow 5: University of Oklahoma is public too, now four public institutions.\n\nRow 6: Rice University is private.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim to check: \"rice university have the most number of enrolled students, while the university of texas at austin have the least.\" I need to figure out if this is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should identify which universities are mentioned in the claim. The claim specifically talks about Rice University and the University of Texas at Austin. So, I'll look for their entries in the table.\n\nLooking through the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: Baylor University \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: University of Louisiana at Lafayette \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Louisiana State University \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: University of North Texas \u2013 nope.\nRow 5: University of Oklahoma \u2013 nope.\nRow 6: Rice University \u2013 yes, this is the one with 6799 enrolled students. So I'll note that down.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 7: Southern Methodist University \u2013 nope.\nRow 8: Texas A&M University \u2013 nope.\nRow 9: Texas Christian University \u2013 nope.\nRow 10: Texas State University at San Marcos \u2013 nope.\nRow 11: Texas Tech University \u2013 nope.\nRow 12: University of Texas at Austin \u2013 yes, this has 50995 enrolled students.\n\nSo now I need to compare Rice's enrollment number with that of Texas at Austin. Rice has 6,799 students, and the University of Texas has 50,995 students.\n\nThe claim says Rice has the most and Texas at Austin has the least. But wait, Texas at Austin actually has a much higher enrollment than Rice. So the second part of the claim is incorrect because Texas at Austin doesn't have the least; it's one of the largest in the list.\n\nAs for the first part, does Rice really have the most? Looking through all the enrollments:\n\nRow 6: Rice \u2013 6799\nRow 12: Texas at Austin \u2013 50995\n\nI should check other universities to see if any have higher enrollment than Rice. Let's go through them:\n\n- Baylor: 14769\n- Louisiana-Lafayette: 16361\n- LSU: 25215\n- North Texas: 36206\n- Oklahoma: 29931\n- Rice: 6799\n- SMU: 10693\n- A&M: 48702\n- TCU: 8696\n- Texas State: 32586\n- Tech: 30049\n- UT Austin: 50995\n\nSo the highest enrollment is Louisiana State University with 25,215, followed by North Texas at 36,206, then Oklahoma with 29,931, then Texas A&M at 48,702. After that, the next highest is Texas State at 32,586, Tech at 30,049, and finally Rice at 6,799.\n\nWait, actually, Louisiana State has the highest at 25k, North Texas at 36k, which is higher than LSU. Then comes A&M at almost 50k, then UT Austin at 50k as well, but I think A&M is higher? Let me check: A&M is 48,702 and UT Austin is 50,995. So UT Austin has more than A&M.\n\nWait no, 50k is more than 48k, so UT Austin is higher. Then comes Texas State at 32k, Tech at 30k, SMU at 10k, TCU at 8k, Baylor at 14k, Louisiana-Lafayette at 16k, and Rice at 6.7k.\n\nWait no, actually, the order from highest to lowest:\n\n1. Texas A&M: 48,702\n2. University of Texas at Austin: 50,995\n3. University of North Texas: 36,206\n4. Louisiana State University: 25,215\n5. University of Oklahoma: 29,931 \u2013 wait, no, 29k is less than 36k. So order after A&M and UT Austin would be North Texas at 36k, then LSU at 25k, then maybe Tech at 30k? Wait, Tech is at 30k, which is between LSU (25k) and North Texas (36k). Hmm.\n\nWait, let me list all the enrollments:\n\n- Baylor: 14,769\n- Louisiana-Lafayette: 16,361\n- LSU: 25,215\n- North Texas: 36,206\n- Oklahoma: 29,931\n- Rice: 6,799\n- SMU: 10,693\n- A&M: 48,702\n- TCU: 8,696\n- Texas State: 32,586\n- Tech: 30,049\n- UT Austin: 50,995\n\nSo the highest is UT Austin at 50,995, then A&M at 48,702, then North Texas at 36,206, then LSU at 25,215, then Tech at 30,049 (wait, no, 30k is less than 36k). So order after UT and A&M would be North Texas, then LSU, then Tech? Or wait, Tech is 30,049 which is higher than LSU's 25,215 but lower than North Texas' 36,206.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me sort them numerically:\n\n50,995 (UT Austin)\n48,702 (A&M)\n36,206 (North Texas)\n29,931 (Oklahoma)\n30,049 (Tech)\n32,586 (Texas State)\n25,215 (LSU)\n16,361 (Louisiana-Lafayette)\n14,769 (Baylor)\n10,693 (SMU)\n8,696 (TCU)\n6,799 (Rice)\n\nSo the order is:\n\n1. UT Austin: 50,995\n2. A&M: 48,702\n3. North Texas: 36,206\n4. Tech: 30,049\n5. Oklahoma: 29,931\n6. Texas State: 32,586 \u2013 wait, no, 32k is between 30k and 36k.\nWait, 32,586 is higher than 29,931 but lower than 30,049? No, 32k is less than 30k? No, 32k is more than 30k. Wait:\n\n- Tech: 30,049\n- Texas State: 32,586\nSo after North Texas at 36,206 comes Tech at 30,049, but that doesn't make sense because 30k is less than 36k. So the order should be:\n\n1. UT Austin:50,995\n2. A&M:48,702\n3. North Texas:36,206\n4. LSU:25,215\n5. Tech:30,049 \u2013 Wait no, this doesn't make sense because 30k is higher than 25k but lower than 36k.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up here. Let me list them properly sorted:\n\n50,995 (UT Austin)\n48,702 (A&M)\n36,206 (North Texas)\n32,586 (Texas State)\n30,049 (Tech)\n29,931 (Oklahoma)\n25,215 (LSU)\n16,361 (Louisiana-Lafayette)\n14,769 (Baylor)\n10,693 (SMU)\n8,696 (TCU)\n6,799 (Rice)\n\nSo the highest is UT Austin, then A&M, then North Texas, then Texas State, then Tech, then Oklahoma, then LSU, and so on.\n\nTherefore, Rice has 6,799, which is much lower than all except TCU, SMU, Baylor, Louisiana-Lafayette.\n\nThe claim says Rice has the most, but that's incorrect because UT Austin and A&M have way more students. Also, Texas at Austin doesn't have the least; it has the most after A&M.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are wrong: Rice is not the highest, and Texas at Austin is not the lowest. In fact, Texas at Austin has one of the highest enrollments.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect on both counts.\n</think>\n\nThe statement provided is incorrect in both parts. \n\n1. **Rice University does not have the most students among those listed.** The university with the highest enrollment is the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) with 50,995 students, followed by Texas A&M University with 48,702 students.\n\n2. **The University of Texas at Austin does not have the least number of students.** In fact, UT Austin has one of the largest enrollments in the list.\n\nTherefore, the claim is inaccurate as it reverses the actual standings of both universities in terms of student enrollment.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"10 of the school list be found after 1900\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"10 of the school list.\" Looking at the table provided, there are 12 rows, each representing a different institution. So, the total number of schools listed is 12. The claim says that 10 of these schools were founded after 1900. That means I need to check how many institutions in the table have their \"founded\" year after 1900.\n\nNext, I should go through each row and note down the \"institution\" and its \"founded\" year:\n\nRow 1: Baylor University, founded 1845\nRow 2: University of Louisiana at Lafayette, founded 1898\nRow 3: Louisiana State University, founded 1860\nRow 4: University of North Texas, founded 1890\nRow 5: University of Oklahoma, founded 1890\nRow 6: Rice University, founded 1891\nRow 7: Southern Methodist University, founded 1911\nRow 8: Texas A&M University, founded 1871\nRow 9: Texas Christian University, founded 1873\nRow 10: Texas State University (San Marcos), founded 1899\nRow 11: Texas Tech University, founded 1923\nRow 12: University of Texas at Austin, founded 1883\n\nNow, let's identify which institutions were founded after 1900. That means their \"founded\" year is greater than 1900.\n\nLooking through the list:\n- Row 7: 1911 (after 1900)\n- Row 11: 1923 (after 1900)\n\nSo, there are only 2 schools in the table that were founded after 1900. The claim says that 10 of them were, which is clearly not correct because it's only 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check how many institutions in the table were founded after 1900.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Southern Methodist University and Texas Tech University is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"Southern Methodist University was founded in 1871 and Texas Tech University was founded in 1923.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for both institutions in the table to find their founding years. \n\nStarting with Southern Methodist University (SMU), I'll scan through each row. Looking at Row 7, the institution is Southern Methodist University, location: university park, texas, founded: 1911. So SMU was founded in 1911, not 1871 as the claim states. That's a problem because it directly contradicts the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check Texas Tech University. Going through each row again, Row 11 is Texas Tech University with a founding year of 1923. The claim says they were founded in 1923, which matches. So only Texas Tech part of the claim is correct.\n\nSince the claim makes two statements and only one is accurate, the overall statement is false because it incorrectly states SMU's founding year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Southern Methodist University was founded in 1871 and Texas Tech University in 1923. Checking the table, Southern Methodist University was actually founded in 1911 (Row 7), and Texas Tech University was indeed founded in 1923 (Row 11).

The claim states: \"3 school list have an enrollment between 20000 and 40000 students.\"\n\nFirst, I should go through each row of the table and check the 'enrollment' numbers for each institution listed.\n\nLet's start by listing all the institutions along with their enrollments:\n\n1. Baylor University - 14769\n2. University of Louisiana at Lafayette - 16361\n3. Louisiana State University (LSU) - 25215\n4. University of North Texas - 36206\n5. University of Oklahoma - 29931\n6.

Texas State University at San Marcos - 32586\n11. Texas Tech University - 30049\n12. University of Texas at Austin - 50995\n\nNow, the claim is that exactly three schools have enrollments between 20,000 and 40,000 students.\n\nLet me go through each enrollment:\n\n1. Baylor: 14,769 \u2192 Below 20k \u2192 Doesn't qualify.\n2. UL Lafayette: 16,361 \u2192 Below 20k \u2192 No.\n3. LSU: 25,215 \u2192 Between 20k-40k \u2192 Yes.\n4. UNTx: 36,206 \u2192 Between 20k-40k \u2192 Yes.\n5. OU: 29,931 \u2192 Between \u2192 Yes.\n6. Rice: 6,799 \u2192 Too low.\n7. SMU: 10,693 \u2192 No.\n8.

UT Austin: 50,995 \u2192 Above \u2192 No.\n\nNow, count the institutions that fall within the range:\n\n- LSU: 25k\n- UNTx: 36k\n- OU: 29k\n- TX State: 32k\n- TTU: 30k\n\nWait, that's five schools. But the claim says three schools. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me double-check each:\n\nLSU: 25,215 \u2192 yes\nUNTx: 36,206 \u2192 yes\nOU: 29,931 \u2192 yes\nTX State: 32,586 \u2192 yes\nTTU: 30,049 \u2192 yes\n\nThat's five schools, not three. So the claim is incorrect because it states only three, but actually there are more.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread some enrollments. Let me check again:\n\nRow 3: LSU - 25215 \u2192 Between\nRow4: UNTx - 36206 \u2192 Between\nRow5: OU - 29931 \u2192 Between\nRow10: TX State - 32586 \u2192 Between\nRow11: TTU - 30049 \u2192 Between\n\nYes, that's five schools. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but the original table has rows from Row1 to Row12. Let me ensure I didn't miss any other institution in between that might fall within that range.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow3: LSU\nRow4: UNTx\nRow5: OU\nRow10: TX State\nRow11: TTU\n\nNo others seem to be in the 20k-40k range.
