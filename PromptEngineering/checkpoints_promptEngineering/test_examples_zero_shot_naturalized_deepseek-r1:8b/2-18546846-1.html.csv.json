    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the 49ers win 8 of the game in the 1947 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding each part of the claim and then cross-reference it with the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that the 49ers won 8 games in the 1947 season. So I need to check how many wins they had that year. Looking at the table provided, which seems to list their game results week by week from August 31, 1947, to December 7, 1947.\n\nI'll go through each row and tally up the number of wins:\n\n- Row 1: W (win) \u2192 1\n- Row 2: W \u2192 2\n- Row 3: W \u2192 3\n- Row 4: L (loss) \u2192 stays at 3\n- Row 5: W \u2192 4\n- Row 6: T (tie) \u2192 no change\n- Row 7: W \u2192 5\n- Row 8: L \u2192 stays at 5\n- Row 9: W \u2192 6\n- Row 10: L \u2192 stays at 6\n- Row 11: L \u2192 stays at 6\n- Row 12: W \u2192 7\n- Row 13: W \u2192 8\n- Row 14: T \u2192 no change\n\nSo, by the end of week 14, which is December 7, they've reached 8 wins. Therefore, in the 1947 season, the 49ers won 8 games.\n\nNow, checking if all other relevant data supports this without contradiction. The claim doesn't mention any ties or losses affecting the total, so focusing only on wins seems correct. \n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant for verifying the number of wins. Each row has a \"result\" column that can be 'w' for win, 'l' for loss, or 't' for tie. So the relevant columns are \"result\".\n\nTherefore, I should list all rows where the result is 'w' because each win contributes to the total.\n\nLet me list the rows with wins:\n\n- Row 1: W\n- Row 2: W\n- Row 3: W\n- Row 5: W\n- Row 7: W\n- Row 9: W\n- Row 12: W\n- Row 13: W\n\nThat's a total of 8 wins, which matches the claim.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are all rows where the result is 'w' since each win contributes to the count.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 49ers won 8 games in the 1947 season. By reviewing each row, we can count the number of wins:\n\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 13 are wins, totaling 8.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, supported by the 'result' column in these rows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the 49ers first opponent of the season be the brooklyn dodger.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The 49ers are a team, probably referring to the San Francisco 49ers, which is an NFL team. Their opponents in the 1947 season would be other teams they played against. The claim specifies that their first opponent was the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists the 49ers' games from week 1 to week 14 in 1947. Each row has details like the date, opponent, result, score, and record. \n\nI need to find out who the 49ers played in their first game of the season. The first row is week 1, so I should check that row. According to the table, on August 31, 1947, the opponent was the Brooklyn Dodgers with a result of 'w' (win), score 23-7.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"first opponent,\" which would logically be the first game of the season, so week 1. That seems to match. So the first opponent is indeed the Brooklyn Dodgers. \n\nI should also make sure there's no other team in an earlier week that could be considered the first opponent, but since it's a weekly schedule starting from week 1, there isn't an earlier week than that. So the first game is definitely week 1 against the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the information in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table, as the first row indicates the 49ers' initial opponent was the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"August 31, 1947 be the date of the first game of the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see when the games took place. The table has rows numbered from Row 1 to Row 14. Each row includes a week number, date, opponent, result, score, and record. \n\nRow 1: Week 1, August 31, 1947, Opponent: Brooklyn Dodgers, Result: W, Score: 23-7, Record: 1-0.\nRow 2: Week 2, September 7, 1947, Opponent: Los Angeles Dons, Result: W, Score: 17-14, Record: 2-0.\nRow 3: Week 3, September 14, 1947, Opponent: Baltimore Colts, Result: W, Score: 14-7, Record: 3-0.\nRow 4: Week 4, September 21, 1947, Opponent: New York Yankees, Result: L, Score: 21-16, Record: 3-1.\nRow 5: Week 5, September 28, 1947, Opponent: Buffalo Bills, Result: W, Score: 41-24, Record: 4-1.\nRow 6: Week 6, October 5, 1947, Opponent: Baltimore Colts, Result: T, Score: 28-28, Record: 4-1-1.\nRow 7: Week 7, October 12, 1947, Opponent: Chicago Rockets, Result: W, Score: 42-28, Record: 5-1-1.\nRow 8: Week 8, October 26, 1947, Opponent: Cleveland Browns, Result: L, Score: 14-7, Record: 5-2-1.\nRow 9: Week 9, November 2, 1947, Opponent: Los Angeles Dons, Result: W, Score: 26-16, Record: 6-2-1.\nRow 10: Week 10, November 9, 1947, Opponent: New York Yankees, Result: L, Score: 24-16, Record: 6-3-1.\nRow 11: Week 11, November 16, 1947, Opponent: Cleveland Browns, Result: L, Score: 37-14, Record: 6-4-1.\nRow 12: Week 12, November 21, 1947, Opponent: Chicago Rockets, Result: W, Score: 41-16, Record: 7-4-1.\nRow 13: Week 13, November 27, 1947, Opponent: Brooklyn Dodgers, Result: W, Score: 21-7, Record: 8-4-1.\nRow 14: Week 14, December 7, 1947, Opponent: Buffalo Bills, Result: T, Score: 21-21, Record: 8-4-2.\n\nNow, the claim is that August 31, 1947 was the first game of the season. So I need to check if any game took place before this date. Looking at Row 1, it's Week 1 on August 31. Since there are only 14 rows and no row has a date earlier than August 31, 1947, that would suggest that August 31 is indeed the first game of the season.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any chance that week 0 or some other week might have occurred before? No, because weeks are numbered starting from 1. So week 1 is the earliest. Therefore, the first game was on August 31, 1947.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the San Francisco 49ers tying 2 out of their 14 games in the 1947 season is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The user claims that there are two ties (ties) in 14 games during the 1947 season. So I need to look through the table for any games where the result was a tie and count how many times that happened out of the total number of games played.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like week, date, opponent, result, score, and record. The 'result' column has values like 'w' for win, 'l' for loss, and 't' for tie.\n\nSo my first task is to count how many times the result was a tie ('t'). Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 2: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 3: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 4: Result is 'l' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 5: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 6: Result is 't' \u2013 this is one tie.\nRow 7: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 8: Result is 'l' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 9: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 10: Result is 'l' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 11: Result is 'l' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 12: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 13: Result is 'w' \u2013 not a tie.\nRow 14: Result is 't' \u2013 this is the second tie.\n\nSo from rows 6 and 14, there are two games that ended in ties. That's two out of the total number of games played in the season.\n\nNow, I need to check how many games were played in the 1947 season. The table starts at week 1 and goes up to week 14. Each row represents a game, so there are 14 games in total. Wait, but let me make sure if all these weeks are indeed part of the 1947 season for the 49ers.\n\nLooking at the dates: August 31, September through November, and December 7. So yes, that's the entire 1947 season for them, as they played from late August to early December.\n\nSo total games: 14 (weeks 1-14).\n\nTies in these games: 2 (rows 6 and 14).\n\nThe claim is about tying 2 out of 14 games. So the number of ties is exactly 2, which is a subset of the total 14 games.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be correct based on the table provided.\n\nNow, to structure this into the JSON response as per instructions, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this claim. The relevant information would be the two rows where the result was a tie and possibly the count or the weeks involved. But since the claim is about the number of ties (2), the relevant cells are those with 'result' being 't'.\n\nSo each tie is in row 6 and row 14, so their respective columns are 'result'. Therefore, the relevant_cells would be these two rows, indicating the column name as 'result' for both.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The claim is about the number of ties (2) out of 14 games. So to verify this, we need to look at how many times the result was a tie in those 14 games. Therefore, each occurrence of 't' in the 'result' column is relevant.\n\nHence, the relevant cells are rows 6 and 14 under the 'result' column.\n\nSo the JSON should list these two rows with their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data provided in the table. There are exactly two ties ('t') out of 14 games in the 1947 season for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the 49ers play the los angeles don 2 times in the 1947 season.\" \n\nFirst, I should probably identify who the 49ers are playing against twice in 1947. Looking at the table, each row has a week number, date, opponent, result, score, and record.\n\nLet me go through each row to see if any team appears more than once that year. The opponents listed are:\n\nRow 1: Brooklyn Dodgers\nRow 2: Los Angeles Dons\nRow 3: Baltimore Colts\nRow 4: New York Yankees\nRow 5: Buffalo Bills\nRow 6: Baltimore Colts\nRow 7: Chicago Rockets\nRow 8: Cleveland Browns\nRow 9: Los Angeles Dons\nRow 10: New York Yankees\nRow 11: Cleveland Browns\nRow 12: Chicago Rockets\nRow 13: Brooklyn Dodgers\nRow 14: Buffalo Bills\n\nSo, looking for which team plays against the 49ers (I assume they are referred to as \"San Francisco 49ers\" though not explicitly named here) twice. Wait, actually, in the table, who is the home team? The claim mentions \"the 49ers play the los angeles don,\" so I need to check if both teams listed are the same, and how many times they face each other.\n\nWait, but in the table, the opponents are all away teams or home teams? Since it's a naturalized table without context, perhaps the 49ers are playing against these opponents. But wait, the term \"play\" can mean either home or away games. The claim says \"the 49ers play the los angeles don 2 times,\" so I need to see if the Los Angeles Dons (or Los Angeles Don) appear more than once as an opponent of the 49ers in 1947.\n\nBut looking at the table, row 2 has Los Angeles Dons and row 9 also has Los Angeles Dons. So that's two games against them in 1947.\n\nWait, but I need to check if those are indeed the same team. The term \"Don\" vs. \"Dons\" \u2013 maybe it's the same team. For example, sometimes teams have plural or singular names in different contexts. If both mentions are of Los Angeles Dons, then yes, they played twice.\n\nBut let me check: row 2 is week 2, September 7, 1947, against Los Angeles Dons, result w, score 17-14. Then row 9 is week 9, November 2, 1947, also against Los Angeles Dons, result w, score 26-16.\n\nSo that's two games against the same team in the same season. Therefore, the claim seems to be true based on the table.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that these are indeed the San Francisco 49ers playing those teams. The opponents listed are, for example, Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, etc. So assuming that the 49ers are the home team in these games, but it's not explicitly stated. However, the claim is about the 49ers playing the Los Angeles Don twice, so regardless of home or away, just that they played them two times.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, Los Angeles Dons appear twice as opponents, which supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two rows in the table where the San Francisco 49ers face the Los Angeles Dons. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Teams:** The 49ers play against several teams listed in the table.\n2. **Check for Repeats:** Los Angeles Dons appear in week 2 and week 9, 1947.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since they face each other twice, the claim is true.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- Both games are recorded in rows 2 and 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So I need to check if there are exactly 8 losses recorded in the table.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, which seems to list all the games played by a team, probably the San Francisco 49ers based on the opponent names and results. Each row represents a week, the date of the game, the opponent, the result (win or loss with some ties), the score, and the current record.\n\nMy goal is to count how many times the result was a loss in that season. So I'll go through each row and note the 'result' column.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Result is W (Win).\nRow 2: W.\nRow 3: W.\nRow 4: L (Loss) - so that's one loss.\nRow 5: W.\nRow 6: T (Tie), not a loss.\nRow 7: W.\nRow 8: L - second loss.\nRow 9: W.\nRow 10: L - third loss.\nRow 11: L - fourth loss.\nRow 12: W.\nRow 13: W.\nRow 14: T, so no loss.\n\nSo counting the losses: Row4 (1), Row8 (2), Row10 (3), Row11 (4).

The 'week' column goes up to week 14, with the latest date being December 7, 1947 (row 14). This suggests that week 14 is the last game of the season because the next weeks aren't provided, so it's safe to assume that week 14 is indeed the last game.\n\nNow, examining row 14: week: 14, date: december 7 , 1947. The opponent listed here is \"buffalo bills,\" and the result is a tie with a score of 21 - 21. Wait, but the claim mentions the Brooklyn Dodgers as the last opponent. So, this doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check row 14's opponent. The table shows that in week 14, the 49ers played against the Buffalo Bills, not the Brooklyn Dodgers. That means my initial assumption was wrong; perhaps I need to look for any games beyond week 14? But since there are only up to week 14, and it's the latest date given, that must be the last game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me check again: row 13 is week 13 with the opponent as the Brooklyn Dodgers, result win, score 21-7. That seems correct. Then row 14 is against the Bills, so perhaps the claim is referring to a different season or there's confusion in the data.\n\nWait, but according to the table, the last game is week 14 against the Bills, so the last opponent isn't the Dodgers. Therefore, the claim is false because the last opponent was the Buffalo Bills, not the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the last game of the season.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and check the dates. The claim says that August 31, 1947 was the last game of the season. So I need to find out when the season ended and if that's indeed August 31 or something else.\n\nLooking at the table, let's list out all the weeks and their corresponding dates:\n\n- Week 1: August 31, 1947\n- Week 2: September 7, 1947\n- Week 3: September 14, 1947\n- Week 4: September 21, 1947\n- Week 5: September 28, 1947\n- Week 6: October 5, 1947\n- Week 7: October 12, 1947\n- Week 8: October 26, 1947\n- Week 9: November 2, 1947\n- Week 10: November 9, 1947\n- Week 11: November 16, 1947\n- Week 12: November 21, 1947\n- Week 13: November 27, 1947\n- Week 14: December 7, 1947\n\nNow, the season seems to be running from August 31 to December 7. So the last game is in week 14 on December 7. Therefore, the claim that August 31 was the last game must be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any indication of a playoff or something after the regular season. However, the table doesn't show games beyond week 14. So it seems like the last game is indeed week 14 on December 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because August 31 isn't the last date of the season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that August 31, 1947 was the last game of the season is false because the season continued until December 7, 1947. \n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the 49ers lose 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season\" is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n- The team in question is referred to as \"the 49ers.\" However, looking at the table, I see teams like Brooklyn Dodgers, Los Angeles Dons, Baltimore Colts, New York Yankees, Buffalo Bills, and Chicago Rockets. None of these are listed as \"49ers.\" Wait, that's a problem because the claim mentions \"the 49ers,\" but the table doesn't include them. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nBut assuming that the team in question is indeed among those in the table, perhaps it's a different name for the same team. Alternatively, maybe I'm misreading something. Let me double-check the teams listed:\n\n- Row 1: Brooklyn Dodgers\n- Row 2: Los Angeles Dons\n- Row 3: Baltimore Colts\n- Row 4: New York Yankees\n- Row 5: Buffalo Bills\n- Row 6: Baltimore Colts again\n- Row 7: Chicago Rockets\n- Row 8: Cleveland Browns\n- Row 9: Los Angeles Dons again\n- Row 10: New York Yankees again\n- Row 11: Cleveland Browns again\n- Row 12: Chicago Rockets again\n- Row 13: Brooklyn Dodgers again\n- Row 14: Buffalo Bills again\n\nNone of these are \"49ers.\" Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the claim is using a different name for what is now known as the San Francisco 49ers? Or perhaps there's a misprint in the table. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the team names. For example, sometimes teams change their names, but from this table, it doesn't seem like that's the case.\n\nAssuming that \"the 49ers\" isn't in the table, how can we assess the claim? Wait, perhaps the table is for a different league or year. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again at each row to see if any of the opponents match known 49ers opponents from 1947.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Brooklyn Dodgers\n- Week 2: Los Angeles Dons\n- Week 3: Baltimore Colts\n- Week 4: New York Yankees\n- Week 5: Buffalo Bills\n- Week 6: Baltimore Colts\n- Week 7: Chicago Rockets\n- Week 8: Cleveland Browns\n- Week 9: Los Angeles Dons\n- Week 10: New York Yankees\n- Week 11: Cleveland Browns\n- Week 12: Chicago Rockets\n- Week 13: Brooklyn Dodgers\n- Week 14: Buffalo Bills\n\nThese opponents don't align with known 1947 San Francisco 49ers games. The 49ers were part of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1947, and their main competitors included teams like the Colts, Bears, Eagles, etc., but not exactly the same as what's listed here. Wait, perhaps the table is from a different league or division.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the 49ers\" refers to the New York Giants? But that doesn't make sense either because they were in the NFL, and this table seems to be from another league like AAFC.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the 1947 season,\" so it's specific. If the team isn't in the table, then we can't verify the claim based on the given data. But maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the table is incomplete or mislabeled.\n\nAssuming that the table includes all relevant games for \"the 49ers,\" let's proceed. The claim states they lost 2 out of 14 games. So first, we need to know how many games they played in total in 1947 and how many they lost.\n\nLooking at the table, it goes up to week 14, but each row represents a different week. Let me count the number of games:\n\nFrom week 1 to week 14: that's 14 weeks, but not necessarily all games, as some could be bye weeks or maybe not all opponents are played. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a game, so there are 14 games listed.\n\nWait, looking at each row:\n\nEach row has a 'week' number, date, opponent, result, score, and record. So it's likely that these are the 14 games of the season, meaning 14 games in total for the team. If that's the case, then we need to count how many losses they had.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nResult:\n- Row 1: W (win)\n- Row 2: W\n- Row 3: W\n- Row 4: L (loss)\n- Row 5: W\n- Row 6: T (tie)\n- Row 7: W\n- Row 8: L\n- Row 9: W\n- Row 10: L\n- Row 11: L\n- Row 12: W\n- Row 13: W\n- Row 14: T\n\nNow, counting the losses: Rows 4,8,10,11. That's four losses.\n\nSo they lost 4 games out of 14, not 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, earlier I was confused because \"the 49ers\" aren't in the table. But assuming that the team in question is indeed the one listed here (even though their name isn't mentioned), then the number of losses is four, not two. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if the team's name is different, and perhaps it's a typo or mislabeling in the problem, then without knowing which team corresponds to \"the 49ers,\" we can't verify. But given the data provided, the answer would be that they didn't lose two games but four.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the 49ers\" lost 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season is incorrect based on the provided data. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Team's Games:** The table lists 14 games, each occurring in a different week (weeks 1 through 14). These represent all games played by \"the team\" during the 1947 season.\n\n2. **Determine Game Outcomes:** Reviewing each row:\n   - W (Win), L (Loss), T (Tie)\n   \n3. **Count Losses:**\n   - Row 4: L\n   - Row 8: L\n   - Row 10: L\n   - Row 11: L\n   Total losses = 4\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since there were 4 losses, the claim of only 2 losses is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect; the team lost 4 games in the 1947 season, not 2.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 49ers play the los angeles dones 1 time in the 1947 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in the 1947 season, there was only one game between the 49ers and the Los Angeles Donnes. Wait, actually, looking closer, it mentions \"los angeles dones,\" which might be a typo because I think the team is called the Los Angeles Dodgers. But perhaps the table uses a different name. Let me check the table.\n\nLooking at the table, in Row 2, the opponent is listed as \"los angeles dons.\" Hmm, that's not the Dodgers. The Dodgers are typically referred to as the Los Angeles Dodgers, so maybe it's a variation of the name? Or perhaps it's a different team altogether. But the claim mentions \"los angeles dones,\" which I think is likely a typo for the Dodgers.\n\nWait, but in Row 1 and Row 13, the opponents are \"brooklyn dodgers\" and again \"brooklyn dodgers.\" So the 49ers played against the Brooklyn Dodgers multiple times, not the Los Angeles ones. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to the wrong team or location.\n\nBut let's focus on the key points: whether there was only one game between these two teams in the 1947 season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week, and each has an opponent. Let me go through each week:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Brooklyn Dodgers (Row 1)\n- Week 2: Opponent is Los Angeles Dons (Row 2)\n- Week 9: Opponent is Los Angeles Donnes? Wait, no\u2014Row 9 says \"los angeles dons\" as well. Let me check:\n\nWait, in Row 2, the opponent is \"los angeles dons,\" and in Row 9, it's again \"los angeles dons.\" Are these the same team or different?\n\nHmm, I think that might be a mistake because typically, after moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers would have been known as the Los Angeles Dodgers. So perhaps \"los angeles dons\" is not the correct name. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo for the Dodgers.\n\nBut regardless of the exact name, let me check how many times the 49ers played against this team in 1947.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Row 2: Week 2, result: w\n- Row 9: Week 9, result: w\n\nSo that's two games. But wait, the claim says \"play...1 time,\" which would be FALSE if there were two games. However, let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the rows. Let me list out all opponents:\n\nRow 2: Los Angeles Dons (Week 2)\nRow 9: Los Angeles Donnes? Or is it Dons again?\n\nWait, looking back at Row 9's opponent: \"los angeles dons\" as well. So that's two games against the same team.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 1: Opponent Brooklyn Dodgers\nRow 2: Opponent Los Angeles Dons\nRow 3: Baltimore Colts\nRow 4: NY Yankees\nRow 5: Buffalo Bills\nRow 6: Baltimore Colts again? Wait, no\u2014Row 6 is against Baltimore Colts as well.\nWait, actually, Row 12 and others also have different opponents.\n\nBut focusing on the Los Angeles Dons: they appear in Week 2 (Row 2) and Week 9 (Row 9). So that's two games. Therefore, the claim says \"play...1 time,\" which would be incorrect because there were two meetings.\n\nWait, but let me check if Row 9 is against the same team as Row 2. The opponent in Row 2 is \"los angeles dons\" and in Row 9 it's \"los angeles dones\"\u2014maybe a typo, but perhaps it's the same team. So that would be two games.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they played only once is FALSE because there were at least two games against this opponent.\n\nWait, but I should also check if the table has any other entries for Los Angeles Donnes or Dons. Let me scan through all rows:\n\nRow 2: Los Angeles Dons\nRow 9: Los Angeles Dones (wait, that's \"dones\" with an 'e' at the end? Or is it a typo?)\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the table's opponent names. Maybe Row 9 is actually against the Cleveland Browns or another team. But as per the given data, Rows 2 and 9 are both against \"los angeles dons\" or \"los angeles dones.\"\n\nAssuming that these are the same teams, then it's two games. Therefore, the claim of only one game is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if the 49ers played any other team named Los Angeles Donnes or Dons in 1947. From the table, the opponents after Row 9 don't mention those again, so it seems like there were only two games against that opponent.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect; it's FALSE because there were actually two meetings.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons twice in the 1947 season.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{False}",
