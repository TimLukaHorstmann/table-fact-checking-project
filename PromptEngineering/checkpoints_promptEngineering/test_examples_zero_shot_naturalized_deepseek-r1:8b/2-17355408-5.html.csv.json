    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"the game against Philadelphia be played in the Pepsi Center with 19,155 people in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the team is Philadelphia. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 13 has the team as Philadelphia (Philadelphia). Now, checking what venue that game was played at: the location attendance column for Row 13 shows \"pepsi center 19155.\" That matches the venue in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if the attendance number is correct. The location attendance for Row 13 is listed as 19,155, which matches the number in the claim. \n\nThere's also a mention of the game being against Philadelphia, so that part checks out too. Since all the details in the claim are supported by the corresponding cells in the table, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"pepsi center 19175 be the location attendance during the game against philadelphia\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a match for this specific information. The relevant columns here are 'location attendance' and 'game'. \n\nLooking at Row 13: game is 31, date is December 28, team is New York. So that's against New York, not Philadelphia. The location attendance is 19763. \n\nRow 12: game 30, date Dec 26, team Philadelphia. Score is a win with 105-101 in OT. The location attendance here is pepsi center 19155. \n\nWait, the claim mentions \"pepsi center 19175\". I need to check if any row has location attendance as 19175 for a game against Philadelphia.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: pepsi center with 14243, but game is Toronto.\nRow 2: pepsi center 15866, San Antonio.\nRow 3: arco arena, Sacramento.\nRow 4: pepsi center 14007, Minnesota.\nRow 5: pepsi center 15322, Golden State.\nRow 6: American Airlines Center, Dallas.\nRow 7: Toyota Center, Houston.\nRow 8: pepsi center 19155, Cleveland. \nRow 9: Airways Center, Phoenix.\nRow 10: pepsi center 18611, Portland.\nRow 11: Rose Garden, Portland.\nRow 12: pepsi center 19155, Philadelphia. So game 30 against Philly has attendance 19155 at pepsi center.\nRow 13: Madison Square Garden, New York.\nRow 14: Philips Arena, Atlanta.\nRow 15: Air Canada Centre, Toronto.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"pepsi center 19175\". But looking at all the rows, the highest attendance for pepsi center is 19155 in Row 12 and 19155 again in Row 8. There's no row with location attendance as 19175. \n\nSo the number 19175 doesn't appear anywhere in the table. Therefore, there's no evidence to support that figure being the attendance for a game against Philadelphia.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to 'pepsi center 19175' as the attendance for the game against Philadelphia. Checking all relevant rows, none match this exact number. The highest attendance at pepsi center is 19155 for game 30.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
