    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match be hold in Bolivia in June 2008.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions a specific competition (2010 FIFA World Cup qualification), a location (Bolivia), and a date range (June 2008). So I need to check if there's any data in the table that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Date is June 15, 2008. Venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. The competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. \n\nWait, so this row directly mentions Bolivia, June 2008, and the correct competition. That seems to support the claim.\n\nBut let me check other rows just in case. Row 2 has the same date, venue, and competition but different scores and results. So it's another match on the same day in Bolivia for the same World Cup qualification. So both these rows are about matches in Bolivia during June 2008 related to the 2010 World Cup.\n\nThe other rows don't mention Bolivia or the 2010 World Cup qualification. Row 3 is in Japan, and Row 4 and 5 are in Chile but also for different competitions (friendly match and another World Cup qualification, but not the 2010 one). \n\nSo the key data points from the claim are: competition, location, and date range. The table has multiple rows that fit the location and competition, specifically Rows 1 and 2.\n\nNow, does the claim say \"a match\" or \"matches\"? It says \"a match,\" but there are two matches in June 2008 in Bolivia for the same qualification. However, even if there's more than one, at least one exists which satisfies the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there was indeed a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match held in Bolivia during June 2008.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the estadio monumental be locate in santiago , chile and host qualification match for the 2014 fifa world cup\". \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. The Estadio Monumental is located in Santiago, Chile.\n2. It hosted a qualification match for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a match or event. My goal is to find any rows that mention Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile and see if they relate to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: It's from June 15, 2008, at Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. The score is 0-1 and result is 0-2, with competition being the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. This doesn't mention Estadio Monumental or Santiago.\n\nRow 2: Same date and venue as Row 1, so it's also in La Paz, Bolivia. Again, no mention of Estadio Monumental.\n\nRow 3: May 29, 2009, at Fukuda Denshi Arena in Chiba, Japan. Score is 1-1, result is 1-1, competition is friendly. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 4: October 11, 2011, venue is Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile. The score is 3-0 and the result is 4-2, with competition as 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. This directly relates because it mentions Estadio Monumental in Santiago for a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying match.\n\nRow 5: October 15, 2013, also at Estadio Monumental in Santiago. Score is 2-0, result is 2-1, competition is again the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. So this row supports both parts of the claim.\n\nNow, looking at the claim's two points:\n- Location: Estadio Monumental is indeed in Santiago, Chile, as seen in Rows 4 and 5.\n- Hosting qualification matches for 2014 FIFA World Cup: Both Rows 4 and 5 indicate that Estadio Monumental hosted such matches.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. The relevant cells are from Row 4 and Row 5 where Estadio Monumental is mentioned in Santiago, Chile, and the competition is the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile hosted qualification matches for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more point be score by the win team in the 2011 world cup qualification match in chile than in the 2013 match",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"More points be scored by the winning team in the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Chile than in the 2013 match.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table details. There are five rows, each representing a different match.\n\nLooking for matches related to Chile's World Cup qualifications. So I'm focusing on rows that have \"competition: 2014 fifa world cup qualification\" and location as Chile. Wait, actually, in the table, row 4 is on October 11, 2011, venue Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile, score 3-0, result 4-2, competition: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. And row 5 is October 15, 2013, same venue, same competition.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions 2011 and 2013 matches in Chile for World Cup qualification. So rows 4 and 5 are both related to Chile's 2014 World Cup qualification, but they are two years apart: 2011 and 2013. So these must be the two matches referred to in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if in the 2011 match (row 4), the winning team scored more points than the 2013 match (row 5). \n\nLooking at row 4: score is 3-0 for the home team. The result is 4-2, which indicates that the home team won by a margin of 2 goals. So the score was 3-0, and they won 4-2.\n\nIn row 5: date is October 15, 2013, same venue, score is 2-0 for the home team, result is 2-1. So the winning team scored 2 goals in that match, and the result was a narrow 1 goal victory.\n\nNow, I need to figure out what \"points\" refer to here. In football (soccer), points are typically awarded based on goals and possibly other factors like assists or penalties. However, in this context, it's more likely referring to the total goals scored by the winning team. \n\nSo, for the 2011 match, the winning team scored 3 goals. In the 2013 match, they scored 2 goals. So 3 is more than 2. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not misunderstanding anything. The claim says \"more points be score by the win team.\" Are points different from goals? Well, in FIFA competitions, points are awarded as follows: a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point each. But in this case, both matches resulted in a win for the home team, so they would have received 3 points each.\n\nWait, but the \"score\" here might be referring to the total goals scored by the winning team, not the points earned. So in row 4, the score is 3-0 (so 3 goals for the winning team), and in row 5, it's 2-0 (2 goals). Therefore, the winning team in 2011 scored more goals than in 2013.\n\nSo yes, the claim that \"more points be scored by the win team\" would be TRUE because they scored 3 goals in 2011 and only 2 in 2013.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells from the table are relevant. The claim refers to two matches: 2011 and 2013 World Cup qualification in Chile. Looking at the table, these correspond to row 4 (2011) and row 5 (2013). \n\nEach of these rows has several columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. So for each match, we need to extract the \"score\" as it's relevant to determining the number of points scored by the winning team.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 4, column_name: score\n- Row 5, column_name: score\n\nSo in the JSON response, these will be included with their respective row indices.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table support this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the estadio monumental in chile host world cup qualify in both october 2011 and october 2013.\" So, they're saying that Estadio Monumental in Chile hosted World Cup qualifiers in October 2011 and October 2013. \n\nLooking at the table provided, I see five rows. Each row has a date, venue, score, result, and competition. My goal is to find if there are any matches in the table where Estadio Monumental was the venue for World Cup qualifying matches on those specific dates.\n\nLet me go through each relevant column. The key columns here are \"venue\" and \"competition.\" So, I should look at rows where venue is \"Estadio Monumental,\" competition mentions \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\" or similar, and the date is either October 2011 or October 2013.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Venue - Estadio Hernando Siles, La Paz, Bolivia. So, not relevant since it's in Bolivia.\nRow 2: Same venue as Row 1, so not relevant.\nRow 3: Venue is Fukuda Denshi Arena, Chiba, Japan. Also not relevant.\nRow 4: Venue is Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile. Date is October 11, 2011. Competition is \"2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\" So this matches the first part of the claim for 2011.\nRow 5: Venue is Estadio Monumental again, date October 15, 2013. Competition is same as Row 4. This matches the second part of the claim for 2013.\n\nSo both rows 4 and 5 are relevant because they show Estadio Monumental hosting World Cup qualifiers in October 2011 and October 2013 respectively.\n\nNow, to map this back to the table's columns:\n\nEach row has a date, venue, score, result, competition. So, the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Row 4:\n- \"date\": October 11, 2011\n- \"venue\": Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\n\nFor Row 5:\n- \"date\": October 15, 2013\n- \"venue\": Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row indices 4 and 5 (but wait, the table starts at index 0. Let me check:\n\nWait, the first row is index 0, so Row 1 is index 0? Or maybe the rows are as given: Rows 1 to 5 correspond to indexes 0 to 4? Hmm, but in the example given, the relevant cells have row_index as int, and looking at the table, it's presented with 5 rows. So I think each row corresponds to row index from 0 to 4.\n\nSo Row 4 is index 3 and Row 5 is index 4.\n\nWait no, actually in the table:\n\nRow 1: date: 15 june 2008...\nRow 2: same as Row 1\nRow 3: May 29, 2009...\nRow 4: October 11, 2011 (index 3)\nRow 5: October 15, 2013 (index 4)\n\nSo the relevant rows are index 3 and 4.\n\nEach of these has \"venue\" as Estadio Monumental and dates in 2011 and 2013, respectively. So their columns are:\n\nFor each row, the \"date\" and \"venue\" columns are relevant because they directly show when and where the event took place, confirming that Estadio Monumental hosted World Cup qualifiers on those dates.\n\nSo, the claim is supported by these two rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Estadio Monumental in Chile indeed hosted World Cup qualifying matches in October 2011 and October 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, the claim's assertion about the venue and date isn't fully supported by the table data provided.\n\nSo, I'll check if any relevant cells are found:\n\nOnly Row 3 is related because it's in May 2009 and has a friendly competition with a tie score, but the venue doesn't match.

The claim says: \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match be held in Bolivia in May 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for rows related to the competition mentioned in the claim, which is the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. From the table, I see that Row 1 and Row 2 both have this competition listed.\n\nLooking at Row 1: date is June 15, 2008, venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. The score is 0-1, result 0-2. So this seems to be a match where Bolivia played and lost against Ecuador, as the result shows a 0-2 loss.\n\nRow 2 also has the same competition date on June 15, 2008, same venue, same scores and result. This likely refers to the same match but perhaps a different aspect or a correction. Wait, both rows have the same data? That might be a mistake, but for now, I'll consider them as separate entries.\n\nRow 3: May 29, 2009, venue is Fukuda Denshi Arena in Chiba, Japan. The score and result are 1-1, which is a draw against Japan.

There's no entry for May 2009 involving Bolivia in the context of 2010 qualification.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there was a match between Bolivia and another team in May 2009 related to 2010 qualification. From my general knowledge, Bolivia's World Cup qualifiers often involve home matches, but looking at the table, nothing matches that criteria except for the June dates.\n\nSo, since there is no match in Bolivia during May 2009 listed in the table under 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match was held in Bolivia in May 2009.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about the Estadio Monumental is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the estadio monumental be locate in santiago , chile and host friendly match in 2011.\" So, there are two main points here. The first is that Estadio Monumental is located in Santiago, Chile, and the second is that it hosted a friendly match in 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if any of them relate to these points.\n\nRow 1: June 15, 2008, venue is Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. This doesn't mention Estadio Monumental or Santiago, Chile, so it's not relevant.\n\nRow 2: Also mentions Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. Again, not relevant.\n\nRow 3: May 29, 2009, venue is Fukuda Denshi Arena in Chiba, Japan. No mention of Estadio Monumental or Santiago, so this isn't relevant either.\n\nRow 4: October 11, 2011, venue is Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile. The score is 3-0 and result 4-2 for the competition 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. This is relevant because it shows that Estadio Monumental was indeed located in Santiago, Chile and hosted a match in 2011.\n\nRow 5: October 15, 2013, venue is Estadio Monumental again, but this time the competition is also about the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. So while it's relevant for 2013, the claim mentions 2011, so I need to check if there was a friendly match in 2011.\n\nNow, focusing on Row 4, which is from October 11, 2011. The competition was 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, not a friendly match. A friendly match would typically be marked differently or perhaps indicated by the result being a draw or a non-competitive match. Here, the score was 3-0 and result 4-2, which suggests it's a competitive match.\n\nLooking back at Row 3, it mentions a friendly match in May 2009, but that's in Chiba, Japan, not Santiago. So there isn't a friendly match at Estadio Monumental in 2011 according to the table.\n\nTherefore, while Estadio Monumental is located in Santiago, Chile (as seen in Row 4), it didn't host a friendly match in 2011 as per the provided data. The claim's second part about hosting a friendly match in 2011 isn't supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Estadio Monumental hosted a friendly match in 2011, but according to the table, the only relevant entry is Row 4 (October 11, 2011), which was a FIFA World Cup qualification match, not a friendly one. Therefore, the claim's assertion about the friendly match is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data in the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the estadio monumental in japan host world cup qualify in both october 2011 and october 2013.\" Hmm, wait a second. The mention of \"japan\" here might be a mistake because I remember that Estadio Monumental is actually located in Chile, not Japan. So right off the bat, there's something odd about this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, let's see what data we have. There are five rows with different dates and information. Let me go through each row one by one to check for any matches related to Estadio Monumental hosting World Cup qualifiers in October 2011 and 2013.\n\nRow 1: June 15, 2008, Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia. The competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Not relevant since it's not October 2011 or 2013, and the venue isn't Monumental.\n\nRow 2: Same date as Row 1 but different score and result. Again, same venue and competition, so no match here either.\n\nRow 3: May 29, 2009, Fukuda Denki Arena in Chiba, Japan. This is a friendly match. The venue is in Japan, not Chile, and the date is in May, so no relevant information for our claim.\n\nRow 4: October 11, 2011, Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile. The score is 3-0, result 4-2, competition is 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. So this row shows that Estadio Monumental hosted a qualifying match in October 2011.\n\nRow 5: October 15, 2013, same venue, Estadio Monumental in Santiago, Chile. Score is 2-0, result 2-1, competition again is 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. So this row also shows that the stadium hosted another qualifying match in October 2013.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: it mentions Estadio Monumental in japan hosting qualifiers in both Oct 2011 and 2013. Wait, the venue is actually in Chile, not Japan. That's a problem because the claim is referring to the wrong country. So already, there's a discrepancy here. \n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me read it again: \"the estadio monumental in japan host world cup qualify in both october 2011 and october 2013.\" No, it still says Japan, which is incorrect because Estadio Monumental is in Chile.\n\nSo, even if we ignore the country part, does the venue actually host qualifiers in those years? From the table, yes. Rows 4 and 5 show that Estadio Monumental hosted World Cup qualification matches in both Oct 2011 and Oct 2013. \n\nBut since the claim incorrectly states that it's in Japan, not Chile, this makes the entire statement FALSE because the venue isn't where they said it was. So, the answer should be FALSE because of the geographical mistake in the claim.\n\nAs for relevant cells, I need to find which rows and columns support the claim, but since the country is wrong, even though the data shows the correct venue hosting the matches, the false information about the location makes the entire claim incorrect. Therefore, no specific cells are relevant beyond noting that Estadio Monumental did host those matches, but since the claim misplaces it, those rows aren't directly supporting the claim as stated.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently: perhaps the user intended to say Estadio Monumental in Chile, not Japan. If that's the case, then the venue did host qualifiers in 2011 and 2013. But the claim says Japan, which is wrong. So whether the data supports it depends on the correctness of the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key issue is that Estadio Monumental isn't in Japan, so regardless of other details, the claim is incorrect because it's associating the venue with Japan instead of Chile. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Estadio Monumental is in Japan, whereas it's actually located in Chile. While the venue did host World Cup qualifiers in 2011 and 2013, the mistake about its location makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more point be score by the win team in the 2011 world cup qualification match in bolivia than in the 2013 match",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"More points be scored by the winning team in the 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia than in the 2013 match.\" So, the claim is comparing two matches from different years (2011 and 2013) in Bolivia's World Cup qualifiers. It's about whether the winning team scored more points in 2011 compared to 2013.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: June 15, 2008, venue in La Paz, score 0-1, result 0-2, competition: 2010 qualification.\nRow 2: Same date and venue but different scores? Wait, no\u2014row 2 has the same date as row 1. Hmm, that might be a typo or perhaps a duplicate entry. But since both are under Bolivia for 2010 qualification, maybe it's an error, but I'll proceed.\n\nRow 3: May 29, 2009, venue in Chiba, Japan, score and result are 1-1, competition friendly.\nRow 4: October 11, 2011, venue in Santiago, Chile, score 3-0, result 4-2, competition 2014 qualification.\nRow 5: October 15, 2013, same venue, score 2-0, result 2-1, also 2014 qualification.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions \"2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia\" and \"2013 match.\" Looking at the table, I need to find matches that are World Cup qualifiers for Bolivia in those years. \n\nIn row 1 and 2: competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. So these are not 2011 or 2013.\n\nRow 4: October 11, 2011, venue Chile, score 3-0 (away team?), result 4-2. Since it's under 2014 qualification, that might be for the host nation or another year. Not sure if this is Bolivia's match. Wait, the competition column says 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, but the date is in 2011. Maybe it's a match where Bolivia was playing away in Chile.\n\nRow 5: October 15, 2013, same venue, score 2-0 (away team?), result 2-1, again under 2014 qualification.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The table has matches from different years and venues. Let me clarify which rows correspond to Bolivia's World Cup qualifiers in 2011 and 2013.\n\nLooking at the competition column:\n\n- Rows 1 and 2: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (so these are likely matches before 2010, but maybe part of the process for 2014 or earlier tournaments. Not sure.)\n- Row 4: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, date 2011.\n- Row 5: 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification, date 2013.\n\nSo Bolivia was involved in 2014 qualification matches in both 2011 and 2013. The claim is about these specific matches.\n\nNow, the claim says that \"more points be scored by the win team in the 2011 match than in the 2013 match.\" So I need to compare the points (I think score here refers to points) of the winning teams in those two matches.\n\nLooking at row 4: score is 3-0, result 4-2. Since the score is 3-0, that means the home team scored 3 goals and the away team 0. So the winning team (home) scored 3 points? Wait, in soccer, a win typically gives 3 points for a 3-0 victory, but in this case, the result is 4-2. Hmm, maybe it's about goals, not points. Wait, the table uses \"score\" and \"result.\" In soccer terms, \"score\" could be the goal tally, while \"result\" might refer to the match outcome.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify:\n\nIn row 4: date is October 11, 2011, venue Chile, score 3-0, result 4-2. So the team scored 3 goals and won by a margin of 4-2 (which might be the aggregate or overall goals over two legs). But I'm not sure how that translates to points.\n\nWait, no, in soccer matches, each match typically awards 3 points for a win, 1 point each for a draw. So if a team wins with a scoreline of 3-0, they get all 3 points. If it's 2-1, the winner gets 3 points as well.\n\nWait, but in the table, the \"score\" is like 0-1 or similar, which probably refers to the goal tally. The \"result\" might indicate whether it was a win, loss, or draw. For example, if the score is 0-2 and the result is 0-2, that means the home team lost both halves, so it's a clear loss.\n\nIn row 4: the score is 3-0, which likely means Bolivia scored 3 goals against Chile, resulting in a win. So they got 3 points for that match.\n\nRow 5: date October 15, 2013, same venue, score 2-0, result 2-1. So again, Bolivia scored 2 goals and won by 2-1. They got 3 points for this match as well.\n\nSo both matches resulted in a win for the home team (Bolivia), with 3 points each. Therefore, there is no difference in the points scored; they are equal. Thus, the claim that \"more points be scored by the win team in the 2011 match than in the 2013\" is false because both teams won their respective matches and scored the same number of points (3 each).\n\nWait, but wait: in row 4, score is 3-0, so Bolivia scored 3 goals. In row 5, score is 2-0, so they scored 2 goals. So the actual goals scored by the winning team are higher in 2011 than in 2013. But does that translate to points? If \"points\" refer to match points, then both teams got 3 points each, but if it's about total goals scored by the winner, then 3 vs 2.\n\nThe claim is a bit ambiguous: it says \"more point be score by the win team.\" It might mean more points (as in goals) were scored by the winning team in 2011 compared to 2013. But if \"points\" refer to the match points awarded, both are equal at 3 points each.\n\nWait, but in reality, each match awards 3 points for a win, regardless of the scoreline. So even though Bolivia scored more goals in 2011, both matches gave them 3 points. Therefore, there's no difference in points earned between 2011 and 2013. So the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"points\" refer to total goals scored by the winning team, then 2011 had more (3) than 2013 (2), making the claim true. But that depends on how it's interpreted.\n\nGiven the wording of the table: \"score\" and \"result,\" it's likely that \"point\" refers to the match points, not total goals. Therefore, both matches resulted in 3 points for Bolivia, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim made by the user is false. Both matches resulted in the winning team (Bolivia) earning 3 points each. There is no difference in the points scored by the winning teams between the 2011 and 2013 matches.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim that Bolivia scored more points in the 2011 match than in the 2013 match is false. Both matches resulted in 3 points for the winning team, so there was no difference in points earned between the two years.",
