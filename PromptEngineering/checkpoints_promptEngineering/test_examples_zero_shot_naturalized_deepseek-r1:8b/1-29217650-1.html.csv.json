The claim states: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 27 be p16.5 million.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant row and column in the table. Looking at Row 1, it's about the movie \"ang tanging ina mo.\" The columns listed are movies, dec25, dec26, dec27, dec28, total, and total 2-week gross.\n\nThe claim refers to December 27, so I'm looking for the cell corresponding to dec27. From Row 1, under dec27, the figure is p16.5 million. This matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nTherefore, the figure mentioned in the claim is present in the table at row index 0 (since rows start from 0) and column \"dec27.\" \n\nI should check if all conditions are met.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the figure for ang tanging ina mo (last na 'to!) on december 28 be p13.6 million.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row that corresponds to \"ang tanging ina mo\". Scanning through each row, I see Row 1 is about this movie. So row_index will be 0 because it's zero-indexed.\n\nNext, within Row 1, I need to check which column has the December 28 figure. The columns are: movies, december 25, december 26, etc. The amount for december 28 should be under the \"december 28\" column. So the relevant cell is row_index=0 and column_name=\"december 28\".\n\nNow, checking the value in that cell from the table: Row 1, December 28 shows P13.6 million. That matches exactly with what's claimed.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"december 28\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Checking Row 5, movies: rpg : metanoia, on December 25, it's listed as p5.1 million. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the total from December 25 to 28 is p15.3 million. Looking at the same row, the total for that period is indeed p15.3 million. \n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows with a December 25 figure of 5.1 million.

The claim is: \"the film father jejemon earned p1.4 million on december 27.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure.

No, actually, in the table, for father jejemon, December 25 is p1.4 million. But wait, the claim says it earned p1.4 million on December 27.

The claim says, \"p2.1 million be the figure for father jejemon in december 25.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where \"father jejemon\" is mentioned in the table. Looking at each row, Row 3 is about \"movies: father jejemon.\" So that's the relevant row. The claim is specifically about December 25th, so I need to check the cell for that date under \"father jejemon.\"\n\nIn Row 3, the columns are December 25, 26, 27, and 28.

So December 25th is p1.4 million.\n\nWait, but the claim says p2.1 million for father jejemon on December 25th. That doesn't match. The figure in the table is p1.4 million, not p2.1 million. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because the amount stated isn't what's shown in the table.\n\nI should also make sure I'm checking all relevant columns for that row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's specifically looking for the figure (which is a monetary amount) for \"rosario\" on December 27.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each corresponding to different movies. Each row has columns for dates from December 25 to December 28 and their respective revenues. The last column in each row seems to be the total revenue over those four days. So, I need to look for a movie named \"rosario\" in the table.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Movies include \"ang tanging ina mo.\" No \"rosario\" here.\nRow 2: Movies are \"dalaw.\" Not \"rosario.\"\nRow 3: \"father jejemon.\" Nope.\nRow 4: This one says \"movies: rosario.\" Yes, that's the one we're looking for.\n\nNow, I need to find December 27 for \"rosario.\" Let's check the columns. Each row has four dates: Dec 25, 26, 27, 28. The figures are as follows:\n\n- Dec 25: p3.2 million\n- Dec 26: p2.5 million\n- Dec 27: p2.1 million\n- Dec 28: p1.4 million\n\nSo, the figure for December 27 is indeed p2.1 million. However, the claim says \"p18 million.\" That's a big difference. Wait, maybe I misread something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the row. Let me double-check the table again. \n\nLooking at Row 4: movies are listed as \"rosario,\" and each date has a corresponding figure. So, Dec 27 is p2.1 million. But the claim says p18 million, which doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the columns. Are the figures per day or cumulative? The last column for Row 4 says p9 million as the total over four days. Each of the first three columns (Dec 25-27) are daily revenues adding up to that total. So Dec 27 is indeed p2.1 million, not p18.\n\nWait, perhaps \"rosario\" refers to a different row or maybe I misread the movie names. Let me check again:\n\nRow 4: movies: rosario \u2013 yes, that's correct.\nColumns for each date: Dec25:3.2M, Dec26:2.5M, Dec27:2.1M, Dec28:1.4M.\n\nSo the figure on Dec27 is p2.1 million, not p18 million. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a higher amount than what's in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"p18 million be the figure for rosario on december 27\" is FALSE because according to the table, the revenue on December 27 for \"rosario\" was p2.1 million.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"December 27\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
