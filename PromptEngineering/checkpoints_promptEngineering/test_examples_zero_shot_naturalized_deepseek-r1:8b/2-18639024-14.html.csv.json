    "claim": "4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 2 year",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 2 year.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse what this claim means. It seems like it's saying that four Melbourne Victory players have been active for a total of two years each. So, each of these four players has spent exactly two years with the team.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a player with several attributes: name, games played (with and without goals), finals appearances, goals scored, and their active years. The key here is to find out for each player whether they have been active for exactly two years.\n\nI need to check each of the 36 players in the table to see if four of them meet this condition. However, since the claim doesn't specify which four players, I might need to consider that any set of four players who meet the criteria could satisfy the claim. But wait, actually, the claim is about four specific players, so perhaps it's referring to a particular group.\n\nLooking through the table, let me scan each row for the 'years' column. The 'years' data seems to be represented by the \"years\" entry in each row. For example:\n\n- Row 1: years: 2010\u2013Present (which is more than two years)\n- Row 4: years: 2008\u2013Present (more than two years)\n- Row 26: years: 2008\u2013Present\n- Row 30: years: 2009\n- Row 31: years: 2008\n- Etc.\n\nWait, I need to find rows where the 'years' are exactly two. Let me check each row's \"years\" field:\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: years: 2010\u2013Present (no)\n- Row1: 2008\u2013Present (no)\n- Row2: 2009\n- Row3: 2008 (yes, that's two years if it's from 2008 to 2010. But wait, \"years\" is listed as 2008, which might mean just one year? Or does it indicate the starting year, and if there's a next year, it would be another?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to interpret 'years' correctly. Each row lists 'years' as something like \"2010\u2013Present\", which is more than two years. Some have \"2009\" alone, maybe indicating one year. Others like Row31: 2008, which might mean only one year.\n\nWait, no, in the table, for example:\n\nRow 35: \"years\": 2008 (maybe just that year)\nRow 36: \"years\": 2010\u2013Present\n\nSo, if a player's years are listed as just one specific year, like 2008, does that mean they were active only in 2008? That would be one year. But the claim is about two years.\n\nWait, but looking at Row26: years: 2008\u2013Present. So that's multiple years beyond two.\n\nI need to find players where their 'years' are exactly two years. For example, if a player joined in 2010 and left after 2011, that would be two years.\n\nBut in the table, how is it represented? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: \"years\": 2010\u2013Present (not two)\nRow1: 2008\u2013Present (not two)\nRow2: 2009\nRow3: 2008\nRow4: 2008\u2013Present\n...\nLooking further down, maybe I can find any rows where the years are exactly two.\n\nWait, perhaps some players have \"years\" listed as a single year, which would be one season. Others might have two seasons. For example, if a player was active from 2009 to 2010, that's two years.\n\nLooking at Row30: years: 2009 (so one year)\nRow31: 2008\nRow32: 2010\u2013Present\nRow33: 2008\nRow34: 2009\nRow35: 2008\nRow36: 2010\u2013Present\n\nHmm, I don't see any rows where the 'years' are exactly two. Most either have a single year or multiple years beyond two.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to parse the 'years' field. Maybe it's not just the start and end years but the total duration in terms of years. For example, if someone started in 2008 and left after two seasons (2008, 2009), that would be two years active.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row lists \"years\" as either a single year or a range like \"2010\u2013Present\". If it's just one year, that's one season. So to have been active for two years, they must have a range like \"2009\u20132010\".\n\nWait, let me check Row26 again: \"years\": 2008\u2013Present (so multiple years beyond two)\nRow30: 2009 (one year)\nRow31: 2008\nRow32: 2010\u2013Present\nRow33: 2008\nRow34: 2009\nRow35: 2008\nRow36: 2010\u2013Present\n\nI don't see any player with exactly two years. So, the claim that four players have been active for a total of two years each might be false because I can't find such players in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some players are listed as \"years\": 2009-2011, which would be three years.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each row methodically:\n\nRow0: 2010\u2013Present (not two)\nRow1: 2008\u2013Present (no)\nRow2: 2009 (one year)\nRow3: 2008 (one year)\nRow4: 2008\u2013Present (no)\n...\nRow26: 2008\u2013Present\nRow30: 2009 (one)\nRow31: 2008 (one)\nRow32: 2010\u2013Present\nRow33: 2008 (one)\nRow34: 2009 (one)\nRow35: 2008 (one)\nRow36: 2010\u2013Present\n\nNo, I don't see any players with exactly two years. Therefore, there are zero players who have been active for exactly two years.\n\nBut the claim says four players have been active for a total of two years each, which would mean they each spent two seasons. If no such players exist, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to parse the 'years' field. Perhaps if a player's \"years\" are listed as just one year, it actually represents two years because they might have played in the same season? But that doesn't make sense. Each season is typically a separate year.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps \"years\" refers to the number of seasons they've been active. So if a player has been active for two seasons, their \"years\" would be 2009\u20132010, making it two years.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIs there any row where \"years\" is exactly two? For example, in Row34: 2009 (one year)\nRow30: 2009 (one)\nWait, no. So maybe none of the players have been active for exactly two seasons.\n\nTherefore, the claim that four players have been active for a total of two years each is incorrect because there are zero such players.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing whether there exist four players who have been active for exactly two years. Upon examining each player's record:\n\n- **Years Representation**: Each player's \"years\" field indicates either a single year (e.g., 2008) or a range, such as \"2010\u2013Present,\" which signifies multiple years beyond two.\n- **Two-Year Activity Check**: There are no players with \"years\" set to exactly two. Single-year entries indicate one season of activity, and ranges cover more than two seasons.\n\n**Conclusion**: No player meets the criteria of having been active for exactly two years. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as there are zero such players.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{The statement is false.}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Rebecca Tegg be not active in 2009 , 2010 , or 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Rebecca Tegg's row in the table. Scanning through the names, I see that Row 33 is named Rebecca tegg. That's the relevant row for her data.\n\nNext, I need to look at her years of activity. The 'years' column will tell me when she was active. From the table, Row 33 has \"years: 2008\". This means she was only active in 2008 and not in 2009, 2010, or 2011.\n\nThe claim says she wasn't active in those years. So, since her activity ended in 2008, she indeed wasn't active in 2009, 2010, or 2011. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to identify which columns are important for verifying this. The 'years' column directly indicates her active periods, so that's crucial. There might also be a 'year_active' column, but looking at the table structure, it seems each row has a single 'years' entry. Therefore, only the 'years' column is relevant here.\n\nSo, I'll note down Row 33 and the 'years' column as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

She's in row 3 (row_index: 2 if we start from 0). Her 'years' column shows she is active from 2008 to present. So she's currently active.\n\nNext, Snez Veljanovska is in row 36. Looking at her 'years' column, it says \"2010 - present,\" which means she's still active as well.\n\nSo both athletes are currently active.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown be 3 of the player to not receive any goal.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It states that these three players did not score any goals in their games. So I need to check each of their rows to see if they have a 'goals' value of 0.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Laura Alleway (Row 1): The goals column has 0.\n- Megan Archer (Row 2): The goals column also shows 0.\n- Ashley Brown (Row 3): Wait, I need to check which row number corresponds to Ashley Brown. Looking through the list, Row 3 is for Kara Mowbray, so that's not him. Let me count properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them:\n\nRows 1-26: Laura Alleway is 1, Megan Archer is 2, and then proceeding to Ashley Brown\u2014let me see, the next few rows are:\n\nRow 3: Kara Mowbray\nRow 4: Dianna Niceski\n...\nWait, I think Row 25 is Bronwyn Nutley, then Row 26 is Marlies Oostdam. Hmm, maybe Ashley Brown is later on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each row until I find Ashley Brown's data. Let me scan the table:\n\nRow 22: Rita Mankowska\nRow 23: Kara Mowbray\nRow 24: Dianna Niceski\nRow 25: Bronwyn Nutley\nRow 26: Marlies Oostdam\n...\nContinuing, I might reach Row 35 or so. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that Ashley Brown is at Row 3? Wait no, the rows are numbered from 0 to 36.\n\nWait, the table starts with Laura Alleway as Row 1 (since it's the first entry). Let me list them properly:\n\nRow 1: Laura Alleway\nRow 2: Megan Archer\nRow 3: Ashley Brown?\nNo, because in the initial rows, after Row 2, Row 3 is Kara Mowbray. So perhaps I need to check further down.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. The table has 36 entries, from row_index 0 to 35 (since it starts at 1, but maybe zero-indexed). Let me see:\n\nLooking through the list, after Row 2 comes Row 3: Kara Mowbray.\n\nContinuing down, I think Ashley Brown is likely in a later row. For example, looking for \"Ashley Brown\"\u2014I see that in the given data, he's at Row 24? Wait no, Row 24 is Dianna Niceski.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check each row until I find Ashley Brown.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note that the claim says Laura, Megan, and Ashley did not receive any goals. So their 'goals' value should be zero.\n\nChecking Laura Alleway (Row 1): goals = 0.\nMegan Archer (Row 2): goals = 0.\nAshley Brown: Looking through the table, I see Row 22 is Rita Mankowska, Row 23 Kara Mowbray, Row 24 Dianna Niceski, Row 25 Bronwyn Nutley, Row 26 Marlies Oostdam, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed Ashley Brown.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Laura Alleway\nRow 2: Megan Archer\nRow 3: Kara Mowbray\nRow 4: Dianna Niceski\n...\nContinuing until I find Ashley Brown.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in numbering, or perhaps I misread. Alternatively, perhaps the third row after Laura and Megan is indeed Ashley Brown.\n\nBut looking at Row 3: Kara Mowbray with goals=1.\n\nSo if the claim says that all three have 0 goals, but Ashley Brown has 1, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the rows. Maybe the table starts at row 0 instead of 1.\n\nWait, in programming, often lists are zero-indexed. So Row 0: Laura Alleway, Row 1: Megan Archer, etc.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\nRow 0: goals = 0\nRow 1: goals = 0\nRow 2: Kara Mowbray - goals =1\n\nSo Ashley Brown would be in a different row.\n\nWait, but I think the user listed them from 1 to 36, so perhaps it's better to check each one properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that all three (Laura, Megan, and Ashley) have zero goals. So if Ashley Brown has zero, then the claim holds.\n\nBut looking at Row 22: Rita Mankowska - 0\nRow 23: Kara Mowbray -1\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that Laura and Megan have zero goals, but Ashley Brown does not, so the claim is incorrect. Or vice versa.\n\nBut to accurately assess this, I need to know Ashley Brown's row and his goals value.\n\nSince I might be making a mistake in identifying Ashley Brown's row, perhaps it's better to check each row until I find \"Ashley Brown\".\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nRow 1: Laura Alleway\nRow 2: Megan Archer\nRow 3: Kara Mowbray\nRow 4: Dianna Niceski\nRow 5: Bronwyn Nutley\nRow 6: Marlies Oostdam\nRow 7: Vendrana Popovic\nRow 8: Sarah Richardson\nRow 9: Marika Ruyter-Hooley\nRow 10: Julienne Sitch\nRow 11: Stephanie Tanti\nRow 12: Jodie Taylor\nRow 13: Rebecca Tegg\nRow 14: Katie Thorlakson\nRow 15: Brittany Timko\nRow 16: Snez Veljanovska\n\nWait, I don't see Ashley Brown in these rows.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 17: (assuming numbering continues)\nBut perhaps the user's list stops at Row 36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Ashley Brown is not part of this table, which would mean the claim might be incorrect. Or perhaps he's included later on.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the better approach is to conclude that only Laura and Megan have zero goals, but Ashley Brown has one, making the claim partially true.\n\nBut without knowing Ashley Brown's exact position and goals value, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check each row until I find a player named Ashley Brown.\n\nLooking through:\n\nRow 1: Laura\nRow 2: Megan\nRow 3: Kara\nRow 4: Dianna\nRow 5: Bronwyn\nRow 6: Marlies\nRow 7: Vendrana\nRow 8: Sarah\nRow 9: Marika\nRow 10: Julienne\nRow 11: Stephanie\nRow 12: Jodie\nRow 13: Rebecca\nRow 14: Katie\nRow 15: Brittany\nRow 16: Snez\n\nNone of these are Ashley.\n\nPerhaps the next set:\n\nRow 17: Maybe another player, but not listed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the names or rows.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should conclude that only Laura and Megan have zero goals, Ashley Brown does not, making the claim incorrect.\n\nBut without more information, it's difficult to be certain.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, only Laura Alleway and Megan Archer have zero goals. Ashley Brown's status is unclear as his row and goals value could not be confirmed from the provided data.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nOnly Laura Alleway and Megan Archer have zero goals in the given context. Without clear evidence of Ashley Brown's goals, the claim that all three have zero goals cannot be fully substantiated.",

The claim is: \"katrina gorry be active after daniela diggiammarco and rebecca tegg.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It seems to say that Katrina Gorry is active after Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg. So I need to check if there's any information in the table supporting this.\n\nI'll start by looking up each person mentioned: Katrina Gorry, Daniela Diggiammarco, and Rebecca Tegg.\n\nFor each of them, I'll look at their rows in the table to see when they were active. The \"active\" part might refer to whether their status is current or if they have retired, but since the term isn't explicitly provided, I need to infer based on the data given. Perhaps it means they are still listed as active participants.\n\nStarting with Daniela Diggiammarco: Her row is number 4 (row_index=4). Looking at her details, \"games\" is 12, which might indicate she has played 12 games, but without knowing if that's recent or not. The \"years\" column shows 2008-2010. So she was active until 2010.\n\nNext, Rebecca Tegg: Her row is number 33 (row_index=33). She has \"games\" as 10 and \"years\" as 2008. This suggests she played her last game in 2008 and hasn't played since then, so perhaps she's not active anymore.\n\nNow, Katrina Gorry: Looking for her row. I'll scan through the list. At row 32 (row_index=32), the name is Katrina Tanti, so that's not her. Wait, no, actually, row 4 is Daniela Diggiammarco, and then moving down, I see row 12 is someone else.

The claim is about \"katrina gorry,\" so let's look for that exact name.\n\nI think I found her at row 32: Jodie Taylor? No, that's not it. Wait, perhaps she's at row 8: Stephanie Tanti. No, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo and meant another player, but regardless, let me proceed.\n\nAssuming that Katrina Gorry is active, her details would be in her respective row. For example, if she is active, she might have a recent \"years\" status, like 2023 or something, indicating current activity. But without explicit data, it's hard to tell.\n\nHowever, Rebecca Tegg is at row 10, with years 2008, meaning she hasn't played since then, so perhaps she's retired or not active anymore.\n\nPutting this together: if Daniela Diggiammarco (row 4) is still active as of her last game in 2010, and Rebecca Tegg (row 10) retired in 2008, and Katrina Gorry's activity status isn't clear from the table provided, but let's assume she's active.\n\nIf the claim is that Daniela Diggiammarco is still active while Rebecca Tegg has retired, that would make sense. But since the original statement seems to be a comparison between them, perhaps it's implying that one is still playing and the other isn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended different players, but given the information, I'll proceed with what's in the table.\n\nSo, Daniela Diggiammarco (row 4) was last active until 2010, so she might still be active. Rebecca Tegg (row 10) retired in 2008, so not active anymore. If Katrina Gorry is indeed active, her row would indicate that.\n\nBut without knowing her exact status, I can't confirm. However, based on the table, since Rebecca Tegg isn't playing anymore and Daniela might still be, the original statement could be implying that Diggiammarco is still active while others have retired.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, the initial claim seems to have some basis but may not cover all aspects accurately.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of the table indicates that Daniela Diggiammarco (row 4) was last active as of 2010, suggesting she is likely still playing. Conversely, Rebecca Tegg (row 10) retired in 2008 and is no longer active. The statement partially holds, with Daniela possibly still participating while others have retired.\n\n**Answer:** Daniela Diggiammarco remains active as of 2010, whereas Rebecca Tegg has retired, having last played in 2008.",

    "claim": "4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 8 year",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 8 year\" is true or false based on the provided table. First, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating.\n\nThe claim mentions \"4 of the Melbourne Victory record player be active for a total of 8 years.\" So, it seems to say that four players from the Melbourne Victory have been active for a combined total of eight years. Alternatively, it could mean each has been active for eight years, but the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with details like name, games played, goals scored, and their active years. The columns relevant here are \"Name,\" \"Games,\" \"Goals,\" and \"Years Active.\" But since the claim refers to the total number of years, I need to focus on the \"Years Active\" column.\n\nI'll go through each player in the table to see which ones have been active for a certain number of years that might contribute to the total being eight. Since there are 36 rows, but many players may not meet the criteria.\n\nStarting from Row 0 (Melbourne Victory Player 1) up:\n\n- Row 4: Dianna Niceski is active from 2008-Present. That's about 14 years as of now.\n- Row 5: Bronwyn Nutley, same as above, 2008-Present, so 14+.\n- Row 6: Marlies Oostdam, active since 2008, 14+.\n- Row 7: Vendrana Popovic, 2009-Present, about 14 years.\n- Row 8: Sarah Richardson, 2008-Present, 14+.\n- Row 9: Marika Ruyter-Hooley, active since 2008, 14+.\n- Row 10: Julianne Sitch, 2009-Present, 14+.\n- Row 11: Stephanie Tanti, 2008-Present, 14+.\n- Row 12: Jodie Taylor, active from 2010-Present, about 13 years.\n- Row 13: Rebecca Tegg, 2008-Present, 14+.\n- Row 14: Katie Thorlakson, 2009-Present, 14+.\n- Row 15: Brittany Timko, 2008-Present, 14+.\n- Row 16: Snez Veljanovska, active since 2010, about 13 years.\n\nLooking at these, many players have been active for over a decade. Now, the claim is about four players being active for a total of eight years. This could mean that each has contributed two years, but more likely, it's about the total number of active years across four players adding up to eight.\n\nAlternatively, if \"active for a total of 8 years\" means each player has been active for eight years, then we need four players who have each been active for at least eight years. Let's check:\n\nRows where Years Active >=8:\n\n- Row 4: Dianna Niceski - 14\n- Row 5: Bronwyn Nutley - 14\n- Row 6: Marlies Oostdam -14\n- Row7: Vendrana Popovic -14\n- Row8: Sarah Richardson -14\n- Row9: Marika Ruyter-Hooley -14\n- Row10: Julianne Sitch -14\n- Row11: Stephanie Tanti -14\n- Row12: Jodie Taylor -13 (close but not 8)\n- Row13: Rebecca Tegg -14\n- Row14: Katie Thorlakson -14\n- Row15: Brittany Timko -14\n- Row16: Snez Veljanovska -13\n\nSo, there are many players with active years of at least eight. The problem is the claim states \"4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 8 year.\" If it's four players each active for eight years, that would require four different players, but looking at the table, I don't see four players who have been active only for eight years.\n\nWait, actually, some players started in 2008 and maybe only active up to certain years. For example:\n\n- Row 4: Dianna Niceski - active since 2008-Present (assuming she's still active)\n- Row5: Bronwyn Nutley\n- Row6: Marlies Oostdam\n- Row7: Vendrana Popovic\n\nIf these four have been active for, say, eight years each, that would add up to 32 years. But the claim says \"total of 8 year,\" which is likely a typo and should be \"years.\" However, regardless, if the claim is that four players are active for a total of eight years combined, it's more about summing their active years.\n\nBut considering the exact wording: \"4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 8 year.\"\n\nI think the correct interpretation is that there are four players who have been active for a total of eight years. So, each has been active for two years (sum to eight across four). Alternatively, it's about the duration they've been active adding up.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- If we look for four players whose \"Years Active\" add up to eight, that would mean each with two years: 4 players * 2 years =8.\n\nBut checking the table, most players have been active for over a decade. The only ones with fewer than eight years are perhaps:\n\nLooking at rows beyond 16:\n\n- Row17 onwards: I don't see any player with less than eight years active as of now.\n\nWait, perhaps some players had shorter careers. For example, if a player joined in 2020 and is no longer active (assuming current year is 2023), that's three years, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, maybe the table only shows up to 2016? Or perhaps I need to clarify. The table seems to go up to Row 36, with some players having been active since 2008 onwards.\n\nGiven that, it's likely no player has been active for just two years. Therefore, the claim is likely incorrect or based on outdated information.\n\nAlternatively, if \"active for a total of 8 years\" refers to four players who have each been active for at least eight years, then there are many such players as shown above (e.g., Dianna Niceski, Bronwyn Nutley, etc.), so the claim is true but perhaps ambiguously worded.\n\nBut considering the exact wording: \"4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 8 year.\" It seems to suggest that collectively, these four have been active for eight years in total. That would mean each has been active for two years (assuming they joined together). However, as per the table, no such players exist because their active years are much longer.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect based on the given data. There are no four players who have collectively been active for just eight years; rather, many have been active for over a decade.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim is false because it's based on an assumption that each of these four players has only been active for two years, which isn't the case.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data, the statement \"4 of the melbourne victory record player be active for a total of 8 year\" is incorrect. The key points are:\n\n1. **Interpretation of the Statement**: The claim suggests that four players have been active collectively for eight years. This could mean each has been active for two years (summing to eight) or that their combined active periods add up to eight years.\n\n2. **Analysis of Player Active Years**: Reviewing the table reveals that most players have been active for over a decade, with some starting as early as 2008 and still active. This indicates that each player has been active for significantly more than two years.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since no players have only been active for two years, the statement does not hold true. The claim is therefore false.\n\n**Final Answer**: The statement is incorrect because it's based on an assumption that each of these four players has only been active for two years, which isn't supported by the data provided.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Laura Alleway, Megan Archer, and Ashley Brown be the only 3 players who make goal.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to say that these three players are the only ones who have scored goals in their careers according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various statistics. The relevant columns here would be \"goals\". So I need to check for each of these three players if they have any goals recorded.\n\nLet's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **Laura Alleway**: Checking her row (Row 0), I see the column \"goals\" has a value. In the table, it shows \"2\" under goals. So she does score goals.\n\n2. **Megan Archer**: Her row is Row 1. The \"goals\" column also has a value, which is \"0\". Wait, that's zero. Does scoring a goal mean they have at least one goal? If Megan Archer has zero goals, then maybe she doesn't make any goals. That could be an issue for the claim.\n\n3. **Ashley Brown**: Her row is Row 2. Looking at the \"goals\" column, it says \"0\". Same as Megan, Ashley also hasn't scored any goals according to the table.\n\nSo, if the claim states that these three are the only ones who make goals (i.e., have goals in their stats), but both Megan and Ashley have zero goals, then the claim isn't fully supported. It's incorrect because not all three make goals.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Row 0: Laura Alleway, goals=2. Correct. Row 1: Megan Archer, goals=0. Yes. Row 2: Ashley Brown, goals=0. So only Laura has scored goals among the three.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because not all three have made goals.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I should break down the claim into parts and see what each part means.\n\nThe name mentioned is Rebecca Tegg. Looking through the table, I find Row 33: name: rebecca tegg. Now, I need to check her details in the table to see if they support or contradict the claim.\n\nThe claim says \"rebecca tegg be not active in 2003 , or 20011.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. It seems like there are two years mentioned: 2003 and 20011. Wait, 20011 isn't a real year; maybe it's a typo for 2011? That makes more sense.\n\nSo, the corrected claim might be \"Rebecca Tegg was not active in 2003 or 2011.\" Now I need to check if she was active during those years.\n\nLooking at Row 33, her details are:\n- games: 10 (0)\n- w - league: 10 (0)\n- finals: 0 (0)\n- goals: 1\n- years: 2008\n\nThis shows that Rebecca Tegg was active in 2008. But the claim is about 2003 and 2011.\n\nSo, her activity in 2008 doesn't directly tell us about 2003 or 2011. I might need to look for any other information related to her activity beyond what's listed in her row.\n\nWait, the table only provides data from 2008 onwards because the earliest year mentioned is 2008 (Row 25: bronwyn nutley). So if Rebecca Tegg's activity started in 2008 and continued after that, then she wasn't active before 2008. Therefore, she wasn't active in 2003 or 2011.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if the 'years' column indicates her participation during those years. If it says \"years: 2008,\" does that mean she was only active in 2008 and not earlier? Or does it mean she was active from a certain year onward?\n\nLooking at other rows for comparison, for example, Row 26: marlies oostdam has \"years: 2008 - present.\" So maybe the format is \"year - present\" or just a single year if she only participated once.\n\nSo Rebecca Tegg's row says \"years: 2008,\" which might mean she was active in 2008 and not before. Therefore, she wasn't active in 2003 or 2011. That would support the claim that she was not active during those years.\n\nBut wait, the claim is phrased as \"not active in 2003 , or 20011,\" which could be a typo for 2011. So if Rebecca wasn't active before 2008 and her last activity was in 2008, then she wasn't active in either of those years.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be true based on the information given.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"years\"}]}",

The claim is: \"enza barilla and snez veljanovska be 2 of the athlete that be no longer active.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look up Enza Barilla in the table. She's Row 3. Her status seems to be 'finals: 1 (1)', which means she has been to a final, but there's no indication here that she is no longer active. Maybe being in finals implies she's still active. \n\nNext, Snez Veljanovska is Row 36. Looking at her row, the 'finals' column says '1 (1)', similar to Enza. So, like Enza, Snez has been in a final but doesn't show any inactive status.\n\nWait, I should check if there's another way to determine if they're no longer active. Maybe looking for terms like 'retired' or specific statuses. In the table, columns include 'finals' and others, but nothing explicitly says 'inactive.' So, based on what's provided, both Enza and Snez have been in finals but are still listed as active because there's no info indicating they've retired.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they're no longer active isn't supported by the table data.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"katrina gorry be active before daniela diggiammarco and rebecca tegg\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who each person mentioned in the claim is and where they are in the table.\n\n- Katrina Gorry: Looking through the rows, I find her in Row 11.\n- Daniela Diggiammarco: Found in Row 7.\n- Rebecca Tegg: Located in Row 33.\n\nNext, the claim is about their activity. I need to see what each of their \"years\" of activity indicates. The table has a column named \"years,\" which probably refers to when they were active or joined the team.\n\nFor Katrina Gorry (Row 11): Her \"years\" are listed as \"2010 - present.\" So she became active in 2010 and is still active now.\n\nDaniela Diggiammarco (Row 7): Her \"years\" are also \"2008 - present,\" meaning she joined in 2008 and is still active.\n\nRebecca Tegg (Row 33): Her \"years\" are listed as \"2008.\" This likely means she joined in 2008, but it's not clear if she's still active. The way the data is presented, sometimes \"years\" might just indicate the year they started without stating if they're still active. If her row only says \"2008,\" it could mean she's no longer active or perhaps her activity ended that year.\n\nNow, comparing their joining years:\n- Katrina Gorry: 2010\n- Daniela Diggiammarco: 2008\n- Rebecca Tegg: 2008\n\nSo, Daniela and Rebecca joined in the same year, 2008. If the claim is about who was active before whom, we need to see if Katrina joined before either of them.\n\nKatrina joined in 2010, which is after both Daniela (2008) and Rebecca (2008). Therefore, she wasn't active before them; she came later.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"katrina gorry be active before daniela diggiammarco and rebecca tegg.\" So it's suggesting that Katrina was active earlier than the other two. However, from their data, Daniela and Rebecca were active in 2008, while Katrina started in 2010. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate because Katrina wasn't active before them.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if \"years\" refers to when they joined or if it's a different metric. If \"years\" indicates their activity period, like whether they are still active now, then:\n- Daniela is active from 2008 to present.\n- Rebecca might have been active only in 2008, so perhaps she isn't active anymore.\n- Katrina is active from 2010 to present.\n\nIn this case, if the claim is about being active before, it's comparing who was active earlier. But since Daniela and Rebecca were active starting in 2008, and Katrina started later in 2010, the statement would still be false because she wasn't active before them.\n\nI need to make sure I'm interpreting \"years\" correctly. If \"years\" denotes when they joined, then the conclusion holds. If it's about their activity status now, the same logic applies\u2014Katrina is active after 2010, so not before Daniela and Rebecca who started earlier.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim that Katrina Gorry was active before Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg is false because she joined later in 2010, after both of them had already been active since 2008.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is analyzed by comparing the joining years of each individual mentioned. Katrina Gorry joined in 2010, while Daniela Diggiammarco and Rebecca Tegg joined earlier in 2008. Therefore, the statement that Katrina was active before them is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"years\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
