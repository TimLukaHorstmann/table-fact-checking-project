    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"when new york be the opponent , the score be 111 - 106.\" So I need to check each row where the opponent is New York and see if the score matches 111-106.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 1: Opponent is San Francisco, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Opponent is Boston, no.\nRow 3: Baltimore, nope.\nRow 4: San Diego, no.\nRow 5: San Francisco again, moving on.\n\nRow 6: San Francisco, same opponent as before. Score is 108-123, doesn't match.\n\nRow 7: Seattle, not New York.\nRow 8: Philadelphia, nope.\nRow 9: Cincinnati, not relevant.\nRow 10: Milwaukee, opponent.\nRow 11: New York! This is the first time I see New York as the opponent. Let me check the score here. The score is 111-106, which matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nWait, but there are two more rows after this. Row 12: Detroit, not relevant. Row 13: Chicago, nope. Row 14: Baltimore again, and so on until row 17, where the opponent is Cincinnati, and the score is different.\n\nSo, only in row 11 does New York appear as the opponent with a score of 111-106. That directly supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each relevant part of the claim against the table. Let's break it down into two parts: the location and the score.\n\nStarting with the location: \"alexander memorial coliseum.\" I'll go through each row in the table to find where this location is mentioned. Scanning through the 'location / attendance' column:\n\n- Row 1: Alexander Memorial Coliseum\n- Row 4: Alexander Memorial Coliseum\n- Row 11: Alexander Memorial Coliseum\n- Row 16: Alexander Memorial Coliseum\n\nSo, games 1, 4, 11, and 16 are at the Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Now, looking for a game where both location is this coliseum and the score is 113 - 106.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: Score is 109-105. Not matching.\nRow 4: Score is 114-101. Not matching.\nRow 11: Let's check the opponent, date, and other details. Wait, in Row 11 (game 18), the score is 111 - 106. Close, but not 113 - 106.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let me double-check each game at Alexander Memorial Coliseum:\n\nGame 1: 109-105\nGame 4: 114-101\nGame 11: 111-106\nGame 16: Score is 126 - 109 (Row 17 mentions 12-12, which is game 24, but that's different. Wait, no\u2014game 16 is Row 13? No, wait:\n\nWait, the rows are numbered from 1 to 17. Game 18 is Row 11: score 111-106. So perhaps there's a game with 113-106 at Alexander Memorial Coliseum.\n\nLooking back through all rows where location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum: \n\nRow 1 (game 8): 109-105\nRow 4 (game 11): 114-101\nRow 11 (game 18): 111-106\nRow 16 (game 23): 94-91\n\nWait, none of these have a score of 113-106. Hmm. Did I miss any rows?\n\nLet me check again:\n\nLooking through each row's location and score:\n\nGame 8: 109-105\nGame 11: 114-101\nGame 18: 111-106\nGame 23: 94-91\n\nNo, there's no game with the exact score of 113-106 at Alexander Memorial Coliseum. Therefore, the claim that \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 113 - 106\" isn't supported by any row in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again for each game at Alexander Memorial Coliseum:\n\n- Game 8: Score 109-105\n- Game 11: 114-101\n- Game 18: 111-106\n- Game 23: 94-91\n\nNo 113-106 there. So the claim is not fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any row in the table, as none of the Alexander Memorial Coliseum games have a score of 113 - 106.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"new york be the opponent at the game with a score of 112 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is asking. It's looking for a specific game where New York is the opponent, and the score is exactly 112-106.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check for these conditions.\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Row 1: Opponent is San Francisco, score 109-105.\n2. Row 2: Opponent is Boston, score 103-123.\n3. Row 3: Opponent is Baltimore, score 119-140.\n4. Row 4: Opponent is San Diego, score 114-101.\n5. Row 5: Opponent is San Francisco, score 113-106.\n6. Row 6: Opponent is San Francisco again, but the score is 108-123.\n7. Row 7: Opponent is Seattle, score 142-113.\n8. Row 8: Opponent is Philadelphia, score 115-116.\n9. Row 9: Opponent is Cincinnati, score 125-130.\n10. Row 10: Opponent is Milwaukee, score 89-119.\n11. Row 11: Opponent is New York! The score here is 111-106.\n12. Row 12: Opponent is Detroit, score 129-121.\n13. Row 13: Opponent is Chicago, score 114-96.\n14. Row 14: Opponent is Baltimore again, score 111-118.\n15. Row 15: Opponent is Baltimore once more, score 99-102.\n16. Row 16: Opponent is Cincinnati, score 94-91.\n17. Row 17: Opponent is Cincinnati again, score 126-109.\n\nLooking at each row's opponent and score:\n\nThe claim mentions \"new york be the opponent\" with a specific score of 112-106. Let's check if any row matches this.\n\nIn Row 11, the opponent is New York, but the score is 111-106, not 112-106. So that doesn't match.\n\nNow, I should also look for a game where the opponent is New York and the score is 112-106. From the table provided, I don't see any such row.\n\nAdditionally, let me check each column to ensure I'm looking at the right cells. The relevant columns are 'opponent' because we're checking who the opponent is and 'score' since we need a specific score.\n\nSo for each row, I should note the row index, column name, and whether it matches the claim.\n\nBut in this case, none of the rows have New York as the opponent with 112-106. The closest is Row 11 where they play New York but with a different score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what's needed. The claim has two parts: the location (Alexander Memorial Coliseum) and the score (114-106). So I need to check if there's a game in the table that satisfies both these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists games from row 1 to row 17, each with details like game number, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. \n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the score is 114-106. I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 4: Score is 114 - 101 \u2192 Not matching.\nRow 11: Score is 111 - 106 \u2192 Close, but not 114-106.\nOther rows don't have a score of 114-106. So maybe only one game has that specific score.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I think I might have missed something. Let me check each row's score:\n\nRow 1: 109-105\nRow 2: 103-123\nRow 3: 119-140\nRow 4: 114-101\nRow 5: 113-106\nRow 6: 108-123\nRow 7: 142-113\nRow 8: 115-116\nRow 9: 125-130\nRow10:89-119\nRow11:111-106\nRow12:129-121\nRow13:114-96\nRow14:111-118\nRow15:99-102\nRow16:94-91\nRow17:126-109\n\nHmm, none of the scores are exactly 114 - 106. Wait, perhaps I misread a row. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at row 4: score is 114-101. That's close but not the same as 114-106.\n\nWait, maybe it's in another row. Let me see:\n\nRow 5: 113-106\nRow11:111-106\nRow13:114-96 \u2192 here, the home team scored 114, away scored 96. So the score is 114-96.\n\nSo that might be relevant for the location part but not the exact score.\n\nWait, maybe I misread row 4's score as 114-101 when it's actually 114-106? Let me check again. No, row 4 says \"score: 114 - 101\", so home is 114, away is 101.\n\nSo there's no game with a score of exactly 114-106 in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me go through each row's score:\n\nRow1:109-105 \u2192 No\nRow2:103-123 \u2192 No\nRow3:119-140 \u2192 No\nRow4:114-101 \u2192 Close but not 106\nRow5:113-106 \u2192 Opponent is San Francisco, location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum. So this game's score is 113-106, which is close but not 114-106.\n\nWait, the claim says \"score of 114 - 106.\" The only scores in the table that are near are row4 (114-101) and row5 (113-106). But none match exactly.\n\nSo the score part isn't met. Therefore, even if the location is correct, the score doesn't match, making the claim false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: Is there a game where both location is Alexander Memorial Coliseum and score is 114-106?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow1: Location: Alexander, Score:109-105 \u2192 No\nRow4: Location: Alexander, Score:114-101 \u2192 Close\nRow5: Location:Alexander, Score:113-106\u2192Close but not exact.\nRow11:Location: Alexander,Score:111-106\u2192Nope.\n\nSo no row has both the location and score as specified in the claim. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"alexander memorial coliseum be the location of the game with a score of 114 - 106,\" we need to check if any row in the table matches both the location and the exact score.\n\n1. **Check for games at Alexander Memorial Coliseum:**\n   Rows where Location is \"Alexander Memorial Coliseum\":\n   - Row1: Score 109-105\n   - Row4: Score 114-101\n   - Row5: Score 113-106\n   - Row8: Score 115-116\n   - Row11: Score 111-106\n   - Row16: Score 94-91\n\n2. **Check for the exact score of 114-106:**\n   None of these games have a score of 114-106.\n\nSince there's no game in the table that has both the location and the specified score, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because there is no game in the provided data with both the location as Alexander Memorial Coliseum and the score of 114-106.",
