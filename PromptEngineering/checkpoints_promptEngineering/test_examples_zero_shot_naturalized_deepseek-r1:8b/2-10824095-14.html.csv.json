    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the home team of essendon have a crowd of 47656.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means and then check against the table.\n\nThe home team of Essendon would be in one of the rows where the home team is Essendon. Looking at the table, Row 6 has home team: Essendon. So that's row_index 6.\n\nNow, the claim mentions a crowd of 47656. I need to find out what the crowd was for Essendon's game on their home ground. From Row 6, the venue is mcg, and the crowd is listed as 47656.\n\nSo, does Essendon have a crowd of 47656? Yes, according to the table. So the claim seems to be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the home team of Essendon had a crowd of 47656. Checking Row 6, where Essendon is the home team, confirms the crowd was indeed 47656.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a crowd size is true or false based on the provided table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to verifying the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"there be a crowd of 74656 for essendon home team on 26 june 1952.\" So, we're looking for an entry where the home team is Essendon, the crowd size is 74,656, and the date is June 26, 1952.\n\nNow, let's examine the table provided. The table has six rows, each representing a different match. I'll go through each row one by one to see if any match the claim.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Geelong, score 17.8 (110), venue Kardinia Park, crowd 15,107, date June 26, 1982. This doesn't match because the home team isn't Essendon and the date is in 1982, not 1952.\n\nRow 2: Home team Fitzroy, score 16.16 (112), venue Junction Oval, crowd 12,300, date June 26, 1982. Again, not Essendon and same date as above.\n\nRow 3: Home team Collingwood, score 10.12 (72), venue Victoria Park, crowd 25,409, date June 26, 1982. Not Essendon.\n\nRow 4: Home team Hawthorn, score 17.14 (116), venue Princes Park, crowd 23,354, date June 26, 1982. Still not Essendon.\n\nRow 5: Home team Melbourne, score 13.16 (94), venue VFL Park, crowd 18,947, date June 26, 1982. Not matching the criteria.\n\nRow 6: This is where things get interesting. The home team here is Essendon with a score of 15.15 (105). The venue is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and the crowd is 47,656. However, the date listed in the table is June 26, 1982. The claim we're verifying mentions June 26, 1952. So even though Essendon's home team matches, the dates don't align.\n\nWait a minute\u2014does any row have Essendon as the home team with a crowd of around 74k on June 26? Let me double-check each column in relevant rows.\n\nIn Row 6, the crowd is indeed 47,656, which is close to 74,656 but not exactly. The date here is 1982, not 1952. So even though Essendon is the home team and the crowd size is high, the dates don't match. Therefore, there's no row in the table that has both Essendon as the home team with a crowd of 74,656 on June 26, 1952.\n\nI should also consider whether any other rows might have this information. Looking back at all rows, only Row 6 mentions Essendon, and it doesn't meet the date or crowd size criteria. All other rows don't mention Essendon as the home team.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table data provided. The crowd for Essendon on June 26, 1952, with a figure of 74,656 isn't present in any row of the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"crowd\"}]}",
