    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"not 1 kazakhstani advance to the quarterfinal or past that.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It seems like it's a table of athletes from Kazakhstan competing in different weight categories. Each row has details about their matches and whether they advanced through each round. The columns include athlete name, event (weight category), and then the results for each round: round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals.\n\nThe claim is saying that no Kazakhstani athletes advanced beyond the quarterfinals or didn't advance at all past that. So I need to check each athlete's progress through the rounds.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: nariman shakirov in finweight (-54 kg). His round of 32 match was against Mateus Soares, which he won with 19-5 points. Then in the round of 16, he lost to Ajaiman Al-Ojaiman 4-6. So he didn't advance past round 16, let alone the quarterfinals.\n\nRow 2: zhalgas bekkassymov in flyweight (-58 kg). He had a bye in the round of 32, so he automatically advanced. Then lost in round of 16 to Pen-ek Karaket 3-4, so again, didn't advance past round 16.\n\nRow 3: darkhan kassymkulov in bantamweight (-63 kg). He beat Surendra Bhandari 8-7 in the round of 32. Then lost to Jawad Lakzaee 5-10 in the next round, so didn't make it past round 16.\n\nRow 4: aibar dyussebayev in lightweight (-74 kg). Had a bye in round of 32, then lost to Dmitriy Kim 3-4 in round of 16. So same as before.\n\nRow 5: sultan kassymov in welterweight (-80 kg). Bye in round of 32, lost in round of 16 to Alisher Gulov 2-6. Again, didn't advance past round 16.\n\nSo all Kazakhstani athletes (I assume the name indicates they are Kazakhstani) didn't advance beyond the quarterfinals? Wait, no. Let me check the progression again.\n\nWait, each row shows whether they advanced in their respective matches. The claim is about not advancing to the quarterfinal or past that. So if any of them made it to the quarterfinals, the claim would be false because at least one did.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: nariman shakirov lost in round of 16, so didn't advance beyond that.\n\nRow 2: zhalgas bekkassymov also lost in round of 16.\n\nRow 3: darkhan kassymkulov same.\n\nRow 4: aibar dyussebayev lost in round of 16.\n\nRow 5: sultan kassymov lost in round of 16.\n\nWait, so none of them made it to the quarterfinals? Because each of their next steps after the rounds are either 'did not advance' or they lost. So if they didn't make it past the round of 16, that's before the quarterfinals. Therefore, no one advanced to the quarterfinals or beyond.\n\nSo the claim is saying \"not 1 kazakhstani advance to the quarterfinal or past that.\" If none of them made it to the quarterfinals, then the statement would be true because no Kazakhstani athletes advanced beyond the round of 16, which is before the quarterfinals.\n\nWait, but the term \"quarterfinals\" is a specific stage. So if someone makes it to the quarterfinals, they have advanced past the earlier stages. But in this table, all Kazakhstani athletes lost before reaching the quarterfinals, meaning none of them made it that far.\n\nSo yes, the claim holds true because no one from Kazakhstan advanced beyond the round of 16, so certainly not to the quarterfinals or further.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and see what information is provided. The table lists several athletes along with their event weight classes and the results of their matches. The claim mentions \"heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram,\" so my main focus will be on finding any athlete who weighs 80 kg.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Athlete Nariman Shakirov, event is -54 kg (finweight). That's much lighter than 80 kg.\nRow 2: Zhalgas Bekkassymov, event flyweight (-58 kg). Also not close to 80 kg.\nRow 3: Darkhan Kassymkulov, bantamweight (-63 kg). Still not near 80 kg.\nRow 4: Aibar Dyussebayev, lightweight (-74 kg). Closer but still not 80 kg.\nRow 5: Sultan Kassymov, welterweight (-80 kg). Wait, that's exactly -80 kg, which corresponds to the welterweight category. So this athlete is in the 80 kg weight class.\n\nNow, I need to verify if Sultan Kassymov indeed competes in the welterweight division, which is -80 kg. The claim says \"heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram,\" so if Sultan is in that category, then it's true. However, I should check if there are any other athletes with higher weights than him.\n\nLooking through all the events:\n- Row 1: -54 kg\n- Row 2: -58 kg\n- Row 3: -63 kg\n- Row 4: -74 kg\n- Row 5: -80 kg\n\nAmong these, Sultan Kassymov is the heaviest at -80 kg. None of the other athletes have a higher weight class mentioned in their events. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because there's an athlete weighing 80 kg.\n\nWait, but I should also check if \"heaviest\" means the maximum or the category name. Since Sultan is listed as welterweight (-80 kg), and no one else has a higher weight class, he is indeed the heaviest competitor in that category. So the claim stands.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the heaviest competitor weighs 80 kilograms. From the table, Sultan Kassymov is the only athlete listed with a weight of -80 kg, which corresponds to the welterweight division. Since there are no competitors with a higher weight class mentioned in the table, Sultan Kassymov is indeed the heaviest competitor weighing 80 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about the mean weight of all competitors is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The table lists athletes with their respective events and the outcomes in each round of a competition.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The claim is that \"the mean weight of all competitor be 65.8 kilogram.\" I need to check if this is true by looking at the table provided. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row seems to represent an athlete with their event and the results in each round. For example, Row 1 has nariman shakirov competing in finweight (-54 kg) and details of his matches in the rounds of 32, 16, etc. Similarly, other rows follow the same pattern.\n\nWait a minute, I'm noticing that each row lists an athlete's name, event (with weight), and their match outcomes. But nowhere do I see the actual weights or bodyweights of the athletes mentioned. The events are categorized by weight classes like finweight (-54 kg), flyweight (-58 kg), etc. However, these are the categories or divisions in which the athletes compete, not their own bodyweights.\n\nSo, the key point here is whether the \"event: finweight (-54 kg)\" refers to the athlete's actual weight or the category they compete in. From the context of mixed martial arts or similar competitions, it's standard that these event names are the categories or divisions. So, for example, an athlete in the lightweight division might weigh around 74kg but is categorized as -74kg.\n\nGiven that, the table doesn't provide each competitor's actual weight; instead, it lists their event category along with their match results. Therefore, there's no direct data about the mean weight of all competitors because we don't have their individual weights listed anywhere in the table.\n\nSince the claim is about the mean weight being 65.8kg, and the table doesn't provide the necessary data points (i.e., each athlete's actual weight), I can't verify this claim based on the information given. Therefore, the claim must be false because there's no way to calculate or confirm it with the provided data.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the table doesn't contain any data that would allow calculating the mean weight of all competitors.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim about the mean weight is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each row for relevant information but found none regarding the athletes' weights. The events listed are categories, not actual weights, so the necessary data isn't present to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the information in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"the lightest competitor.\" In a fighting competition like mixed martial arts or similar, competitors are usually categorized into weight classes. The table lists various events with specific weight ranges for each athlete. For example, the first row is about nariman shakirov in the finweight category, which is -54 kg. So that's 54 kilograms, right? Finweight typically refers to a lower weight limit.\n\nNow, I need to check if there's an athlete in the table who weighs exactly 54 kilograms. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: nariman shakirov in finweight (-54 kg). That's 54 kg. So he is the lightest competitor in his category, but does that mean he's the absolute lightest in the entire tournament?\n\nWait, other athletes might be in different weight classes. Let's see if any others are lighter than 54 kg. The events listed are:\n\n- Row 1: finweight (-54 kg)\n- Row 2: flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Row 3: bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Row 4: lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Row 5: welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nWait, the negative sign indicates the weight range. So -54 kg is 54 kg and above? Or does it mean up to 54 kg? I think in MMA terms, a negative weight class like -54 kg means that fighters must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg to be eligible for that division. But sometimes tournaments allow fighters within the same division to have different weights.\n\nBut the problem is whether there's a competitor who weighs exactly 54 kg. Looking at Row 1: nariman shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg). So he weighs 54 kg exactly? Or does it mean up to that weight?\n\nWait, no, in mixed martial arts, if someone is -54kg, they must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg. But sometimes the lower limit is set as a minimum. For example, if it's -54kg, maybe the actual minimum weight is higher, like 52kg. So perhaps nariman shakirov weighs between 52kg and 54kg.\n\nBut then, other competitors in lighter classes: flyweight is -58kg, which would be lighter than 54kg? Wait no, because -58kg is a lower weight class, meaning they can weigh up to 58 kg. So someone in flyweight could be heavier than someone in finweight?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Finweight (-54 kg): This means the maximum weight for this category is 54 kg. So competitors here must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg.\n- Flyweight (-58 kg): The maximum here is 58 kg, so they can be heavier than finweight competitors but lighter than other higher weight classes.\n\nSo if nariman shakirov is in finweight and weighs exactly 54 kg, then he is the lightest competitor. But wait, there are other competitors in flyweight who might weigh more, like up to 58 kg. So they are heavier than him, not lighter.\n\nBut what about competitors in lighter categories? Wait, no, because lighter weight classes have lower numbers with negative signs. For example, -63 kg is bantamweight. But that actually means the maximum allowed weight for bantamweight is higher (63 kg), so someone in bantamweight can weigh more than 54 kg.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding this. In MMA, lighter weight classes have lower numbers but with negative signs. So -54 kg (finweight) would mean that competitors must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg to be eligible for that division. But other divisions may have higher limits. For example, flyweight is usually around -58kg, which allows up to 58 kg.\n\nSo in this table:\n\n- Row 1: nariman shakirov in finweight (-54 kg) \u2192 so he can weigh up to 54 kg.\n- Row 2: zhalgas bekkassymov in flyweight (-58 kg) \u2192 can weigh up to 58 kg, which is heavier than 54 kg.\n\nWait, no. If someone is in flyweight and weighs 56 kg, that's more than 54 kg but less than 58 kg. So nariman shakirov at 54 kg is lighter than the flyweight competitors. But then, is there a competitor who is lighter than nariman?\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\nRow 3: bantamweight (-63 kg) \u2192 up to 63 kg.\nRow 4: lightweight (-74 kg) \u2192 up to 74 kg.\nRow 5: welterweight (-80 kg) \u2192 up to 80 kg.\n\nSo the lightest competitor would be the one in finweight who weighs exactly 54 kg. Because anyone in a higher weight class can weigh more but not less than 54 kg.\n\nWait, no. For example, if someone is in flyweight and weighs 55 kg, they are heavier than nariman at 54 kg. But what about others? If there's an athlete in finweight who is lighter than 54 kg, say 53 kg, then he would be the lightest.\n\nBut according to Row 1, nariman shakirov is in finweight with -54 kg. So he can weigh up to 54 kg. But does that mean his actual weight is exactly 54 kg, or could it be lower?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim says \"the lightest competitor weighs 54 kilogram.\" So if there's an athlete who weighs exactly 54 kg, and no one else is lighter than that, then the claim is true.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- nariman shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg). If this means he must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg, but not necessarily exactly 54 kg. So perhaps he could be lighter.\n\nBut the other competitors are in higher weight classes (flyweight, bantamweight, etc.), which allow higher weights. So their minimums would be lower? Or higher?\n\nWait, no. In MMA, lower numbers mean lighter categories. So -54kg is heavier than -58kg? No, that doesn't make sense because -58kg is a lighter class. Wait, actually, in mixed martial arts, the weight classes go from lightest to heaviest:\n\n- Flyweight (-57 kg)\n- Bantamweight (-66 kg)\n- Lightweight (-76 kg)\n- Welterweight (-84 kg)\n- Middleweight (-86 kg)\n- Heavyweight (+265 kg)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The actual weight classes are usually as follows (with the lower limit):\n\n- Flyweight: 52.2 kg to 57.2 kg\n- Bantamweight: 56.2 kg to 61.4 kg\n- Lightweight: 66.0 kg to 73 kg\n- Welterweight: 77 kg to 84 kg\n- Middleweight: 85 kg to 93 kg\n\nWait, that's more accurate. So each higher weight class has a lower minimum and higher maximum.\n\nSo in this table:\n\n- Finweight (-54 kg): This would mean competitors must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg.\n- Flyweight (-58 kg): Competitors must weigh between 52.2 kg and 57.2 kg.\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because -58kg should be lighter (i.e., lower minimum) than finweight.\n\nI think I'm confusing the notation. In mixed martial arts, sometimes the weights are denoted with a hyphen before the limit in kilograms. For example:\n\n- Flyweight: 57\u201372 kg\n- Bantamweight: 66\u201393 kg? No, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is different here. The problem states:\n\nYou are given competitors with their weight classes as follows:\n\nCompetitors:\n\n1. A fighter in Finweight (-54kg)\n2. A fighter in Flyweight (-58kg)\n3. A fighter in Bantamweight (-63kg)\n4. A fighter in Lightweight (-74kg)\n5. A fighter in Welterweight (-80kg)\n\nNow, assuming that \"-54kg\" means the competitor must weigh less than or equal to 54 kg for Finweight.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Flyweight (-58kg): \u226458 kg\n- Bantamweight (-63kg): \u226463 kg\n- Lightweight (-74kg): \u226474 kg\n- Welterweight (-80kg): \u226480 kg\n\nBut wait, that would mean each higher weight class allows heavier competitors. So the lightest competitor is in Finweight.\n\nBut if Finweight is -54kg, then the minimum weight for Finweight would be... perhaps 52kg? Or does it mean exactly 54kg?\n\nI think I need to make an assumption here. Let's assume that each \"-Xkg\" denotes the maximum weight allowed for that division. So:\n\n- Finweight (-54kg): competitors must weigh \u226454 kg\n- Flyweight (-58kg): competitors must weigh \u226458 kg (so heavier than Finweight)\n- Bantamweight (-63kg): competitors must weigh \u226463 kg\n- Lightweight (-74kg): competitors must weigh \u226474 kg\n- Welterweight (-80kg): competitors must weigh \u226480 kg\n\nSo the lightest competitor is in Finweight, and his maximum weight is 54kg. But wait, could someone in Finweight weigh less than 54kg? Yes, but then they would be even lighter.\n\nHowever, without more information about exact weights, we can't know if nariman shakirov weighs exactly 54kg or less. The claim says \"the lightest competitor weighs 54kg.\" So unless the lightest competitor is exactly 54kg and no one else is lighter, the claim could be false.\n\nBut from the table, competitors in higher weight classes can weigh more but not less than Finweight. So the minimum weight for each division is as follows:\n\n- Finweight: \u226454 kg\n- Flyweight: \u226458 kg (but higher than Finweight)\nWait no, if someone is in Flyweight and weighs 56kg, they are heavier than Finweight's maximum of 54kg. But does that mean that the minimum weight for Flyweight is higher than Finweight? Or lower?\n\nI think I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that each \"-Xkg\" denotes the minimum weight for that division.\n\nSo:\n\n- Finweight (-54kg): \u226554 kg and \u226458 kg (if Flyweight is -58kg)\nWait, no. That can't be because then Finweight would overlap with Flyweight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"-Xkg\" denotes the maximum weight for that division. So:\n\n- Finweight (-54kg): \u226454 kg\n- Flyweight (-58kg): \u226458 kg (so heavier than Finweight)\nBut that doesn't make sense because if someone is in Flyweight, they can weigh up to 58kg, which is more than Finweight's 54kg.\n\nSo the lightest competitor would be in Finweight. But without knowing their exact weight, we can't say for sure.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"the lightest competitor weighs 54 kilogram.\" So if nariman shakirov is in Finweight and weighs exactly 54 kg, and no one else is lighter than that, then the statement holds. However, if someone in Finweight weighs less than 54kg, then the statement would be false.\n\nBut from the problem's perspective, we might need to assume that each \"-Xkg\" refers to a division where competitors must weigh at least X kg and no more than some higher weight. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"-Xkg\" is the minimum weight for that division. So:\n\n- Finweight (-54kg): \u226554 kg\n- Flyweight (-58kg): \u226558 kg (heavier than Finweight)\n- Bantamweight (-63kg): \u226563 kg\n- Lightweight (-74kg): \u226574 kg\n- Welterweight (-80kg): \u226580 kg\n\nIn this case, the lightest competitor is in Finweight, but their exact weight could be above 54kg. So if nariman shakirov weighs exactly 54kg and no one else is lighter, then the claim holds.\n\nBut I think without more information, we can't know for sure. However, the problem might be testing the understanding that each \"-Xkg\" division includes competitors of a certain weight range, with Finweight being the lightest.\n\nTherefore, if nariman shakirov is in Finweight and weighs exactly 54kg, and no one else is lighter, then the statement is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\nBut considering the problem structure, it's likely that each division's \"-Xkg\" refers to the maximum weight allowed, meaning the lightest competitor would be in Finweight with a maximum of 54kg. So if nariman shakirov weighs exactly 54kg, and no one else is lighter (since higher divisions have higher max weights), then he is indeed the lightest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that narayan is the lightest competitor.\n</think>\n\nNarayan is the lightest competitor as he competes in Finweight with a maximum weight of 54 kg. Competitors in higher weight classes can weigh more but not less than this, so Narayan's exact weight matches the division's limit and makes him the lightest.\n\n**Answer:** Narayan is the lightest competitor.",

Each row corresponds to a different athlete from Kazakhstan competing in various weight categories.

However, looking at all the athletes:\n\n- **Nariman Shakirov**: Did not advance past Round of 16.\n- **Zhalgas Bekkassymov**: Same as above.\n- **Darkhan Kassymkulov**: Also didn't advance beyond Round of 16.\n- **Aibar Dyussebayev**: Same as the others.\n- **Sultan Kassymov**: Same.\n\nWait, all five athletes from Kazakhstan did not make it past the Round of 16. So none of them advanced to the quarterfinals or beyond. That means the claim is saying only one competitor advanced, but in reality, zero competitors from Kazakhstan advanced. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's asserting that only one made it, but actually none did.\n\nI should make sure I'm interpreting \"advance to the quarterfinal or beyond\" correctly. The quarterfinals are a round; if an athlete doesn't advance past Round of 16, they didn't reach the quarterfinals. So yes, none of them made it that far. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether only one competitor from Kazakhstan advanced to the quarterfinal or beyond, we analyze each row:\n\n1. **Nariman Shakirov**: Lost in Round of 16.\n2. **Zhalgas Bekkassymov**: Lost in Round of 16.\n3. **Darkhan Kassymkulov**: Lost in Round of 16.\n4. **Aibar Dyussebayev**: Lost in Round of 16.\n5. **Sultan Kassymov**: Lost in Round of 16.\n\nNone advanced past the Round of 16, so no one made it to the quarterfinals or beyond. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round of 32\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round of 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round of 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round of 16\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round of 16\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"each competitor compete in only the same weight class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that every athlete listed in the table competes in only one specific weight class. So, each athlete shouldn't be competing in multiple weight classes, but rather just one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an athlete with their event (which I assume corresponds to the weight class). For example, Row 1 is \"nariman shakirov\" in \"finweight (-54 kg)\", and so on.\n\nNow, I need to check if each competitor only competes in that specific weight class. To do this, I should look at their matches or opponents in different rounds. If an athlete has a bye (which means they automatically advance without facing someone) or if they face competitors from other weight classes, it might indicate they are competing across multiple classes.\n\nWait, no, the event column is the key here. Each athlete's event is listed as a specific weight class: finweight, flyweight, bantamweight, lightweight, and welterweight. So each row has a unique event.\n\nBut the claim is about each competitor competing in only the same weight class. If an athlete is only in one event (their own weight class), that would mean they are only in that class. But perhaps I need to check if any athlete competes across multiple events, which would mean they're in different weight classes.\n\nWait, looking at the table again, each row has a single event listed for the athlete. The columns after that show their round of 32 and round of 16 opponents or results. So, maybe I'm supposed to check if any athlete is participating in more than one event (i.e., multiple weight classes).\n\nBut in the table, each athlete seems to be associated with only one event. For example, Row 1: nariman shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg). The other columns show their opponents in subsequent rounds, but that doesn't change the fact they are in a single event.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the table is showing each athlete's participation across different weight classes over time, and if any of them have competed in more than one class, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at Row 1: nariman shakirov has an event of finweight (-54 kg). In round of 32, he faces mateus soares (TLS) who is also in finweight? Or maybe that's his opponent. Wait, no, looking closer:\n\nEach row lists the athlete's own event, and then their opponents in each round. So for Row 1: nariman shakirov (finweight) faced mateus soares (TLS), but I think TLS is the opponent's country or something? Or maybe it's a code for the event.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any athlete has competed in different weight classes. For example, if an athlete is listed under both finweight and another class, that would mean they've competed in multiple.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 1: Event -54 kg (finweight)\nRow 2: -58 kg (flyweight)\nRow 3: -63 kg (bantamweight)\nRow 4: -74 kg (lightweight)\nRow 5: -80 kg (welterweight)\n\nEach athlete is in a unique weight class, and there's no overlap. So each competitor is only competing in their own same weight class.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"each competitor compete in only the same weight class.\" So if all competitors are in the same single weight class, then it would be true. But here, they're all in different classes. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim.\n\nWait no, the claim is that each competitor competes in only the same weight class as others? Or each in their own same weight class. Hmm.\n\nActually, the wording is \"each competitor compete in only the same weight class.\" So it might mean that all competitors are in the same weight class. But looking at the table, they're all in different classes: one in finweight, another in flyweight, etc.\n\nSo if the claim is that each competitor is in the same single weight class (i.e., all are in, say, finweight), then it's false because they are in different ones. Alternatively, maybe the claim is that each competitor is only in one weight class, not multiple, which is true because each row has a single event.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any athlete is competing across multiple events (i.e., in more than one weight class). For example, if an athlete was listed under both finweight and flyweight, then they have competed in two classes, making the claim false.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row has only one event. So perhaps the claim is that each competitor only competes in their own same weight class (i.e., they don't switch between different ones), which seems to be true because each athlete is listed with a single event.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"each competitor compete in only the same weight class,\" which could mean that all competitors are in the same single weight class. But in reality, they're in different classes, so the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that each competitor only competes in their own weight class (i.e., doesn't switch), which is true because each row has one event.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to see if any athlete is in more than one weight class. Since each row lists a single event, no athlete is competing in multiple classes. So the claim that each competitor competes in only their same (i.e., single) weight class is true.\n\nBut wait, the table shows each athlete's own event, but perhaps they could have faced opponents from different weight classes. For example, if nariman shakirov (finweight) faced someone else in a higher or lower weight class, does that mean he's competing across classes? Or is it just that he is in finweight and others are in other classes.\n\nNo, each competitor is only in their own event (same for all). So the claim is true because each athlete is only in one weight class.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each competitor competes in only one specific weight class. By examining each row of the table, it's evident that each athlete is associated with a single event, which corresponds to a unique weight class. There are no instances where an athlete participates in multiple events or weight classes. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the lightest competitor weigh more than 54 kilogram",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the lightest competitor weigh more than 54 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"lightest competitor\" refers to the athlete with the lowest weight in their respective weight class. The claim states that this competitor weighs more than 54 kilograms. Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense because all the competitors listed have negative weights, which I assume correspond to pounds or kilograms but are presented as negative numbers. So, for example, \"finweight (-54 kg)\", \"flyweight (-58 kg)\", and so on. It's standard in some contexts, like mixed martial arts, for weight classes to be named with a negative sign followed by the weight in kg.\n\nNow, looking at the claim again: it says the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilograms. But in the table, all athletes have weights that are -54kg or lower. So, for instance, nariman shakirov is in finweight (-54kg), zhalgas bekkassymov is flyweight (-58kg), and so on. Negative numbers can be a bit confusing, but I think here they mean the competitor's weight is 54 kg below a certain limit, or maybe it's just the class name.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the \"event\" column indicates the athlete's weight category. So, for example, in Row 1, nariman shakirov competes in finweight (-54kg). If \"-54kg\" is part of their event, that might mean they are competing in a weight class where the limit is 54 kg. So if someone is in the finweight division, maybe they're weighed at or below 54kg? Or perhaps it's the opposite; maybe it's the minimum weight for the division.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to parse this correctly. The claim is about whether the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kg. So, I need to find out which athlete is the lightest and check their weight against 54kg.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: nariman shakirov, finweight (-54kg). His event is -54kg, so perhaps his weight is 54kg? Or maybe it's a negative number representing something else. It's unclear.\n\nRow 2: zhalgas bekkassymov, flyweight (-58kg). So, perhaps he weighs 58kg or -58kg. If the latter, that would mean he's lighter than 58kg? That doesn't make sense in terms of weight classes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to find the athlete who is the lightest and see if their weight exceeds 54kg. So, looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Event is finweight (-54kg). So perhaps nariman shakirov weighs -54kg, which would mean he's below 54kg.\n\nRow 2: flyweight (-58kg), so zhalgas bekkassymov is lighter than 58kg.\n\nRow 3: bantamweight (-63kg), darkhan kassymkulov.\n\nRow 4: lightweight (-74kg), aibar dyussebayev.\n\nRow 5: welterweight (-80kg), sultan kassymov.\n\nSo, the lightest competitor would be someone with the lowest weight. Since all events have negative weights, meaning they are under that number. So, the lighter the athlete, the more negative their weight is. Therefore, nariman shakirov at -54kg is actually heavier than zhalgas bekkassymov at -58kg because -54 is greater than -58.\n\nWait, no. Negative numbers increase as they become more negative. So, -58kg is lighter (smaller) than -54kg. Therefore, zhalgas bekkassymov is lighter than nariman shakirov.\n\nContinuing, the lightest competitor would be the one with the smallest weight number. Looking at all rows:\n\n- Row 1: -54kg\n- Row 2: -58kg\n- Row 3: -63kg\n- Row 4: -74kg\n- Row 5: -80kg\n\nSo, sultan kassymov is in the welterweight division with -80kg. That's the lightest among all competitors.\n\nNow, the claim says that this lightest competitor weighs more than 54kg. So, does sultan kassymov weigh more than 54kg? If his weight is -80kg, that would imply he's 80kg under some limit, or perhaps it's a representation of his actual weight in kg.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the event column. Perhaps \"event: finweight (-54kg)\" means that the event's weight class is at -54kg, so the competitor must weigh less than that. So, if someone is in the finweight division, they must weigh less than 54kg to compete.\n\nSo, if nariman shakirov is in finweight and his event is (-54kg), then he must weigh less than 54kg. Similarly, zhalgas bekkassymov is in flyweight at -58kg, so he must weigh less than 58kg.\n\nTherefore, the lightest competitor would be the one with the lowest weight limit or actual weight. But looking at the table, each athlete's event has a specific weight class, but their own weight isn't explicitly stated except through the event.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The table lists the athletes' events and their matches. For example, in Row 1: nariman shakirov's event is finweight (-54kg), and he lost in round of 32 to mateus soares. So perhaps his weight is -54kg.\n\nIf that's the case, then nariman shakirov weighs -54kg, which would mean 54kg below a certain threshold, but I'm not sure how that translates to actual weight.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in parentheses are their weights in kg. For example, nariman shakirov is finweight (-54kg), so perhaps his weight is 54kg? But then, zhalgas bekkassymov is flyweight (-58kg), so his weight would be 58kg.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the claim says the lightest competitor weighs more than 54kg. If nariman shakirov is at 54kg and others are lighter (like 58kg?), then that wouldn't fit.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. The claim is about whether the lightest competitor weighs more than 54kg. So, I need to find which athlete is the lightest and check their weight against 54kg.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Nariman: finweight (-54kg)\n- Zhalgas: flyweight (-58kg)\n- Darkhan: bantamweight (-63kg)\n- Aibar: lightweight (-74kg)\n- Sultan: welterweight (-80kg)\n\nAssuming that the numbers in parentheses represent their actual weights, then:\n\nNariman: -54kg (so 54kg under? Or is it a typo and should be positive?)\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense. Maybe the negative sign indicates something else, like the minimum weight for the division.\n\nIf that's the case, nariman shakirov's event requires him to weigh less than 54kg, so his actual weight would be below that. Similarly, zhalgas must weigh less than 58kg, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the lightest competitor is sultan kassymov, who needs to weigh less than -80kg? That doesn't make sense because he can't weigh negative kilograms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting this entirely. Maybe the numbers after the event name are their weights in kg, and the minus sign indicates they're below a certain threshold for that event.\n\nSo:\n\n- Nariman: 54kg (finweight division)\n- Zhalgas: 58kg (flyweight)\n- Darkhan: 63kg (bantamweight)\n- Aibar: 74kg (lightweight)\n- Sultan: 80kg (welterweight)\n\nIn that case, nariman is the lightest at 54kg. The claim says the lightest competitor weighs more than 54kg. So, 54kg is not more than 54kg; it's equal.\n\nTherefore, the statement would be false because the lightest competitor does not weigh more than 54kg but exactly 54kg.\n\nAlternatively, if the negative sign indicates that their weight is below that number (e.g., -54kg meaning they're below 54kg), then nariman shakirov's actual weight is less than 54kg. The same applies to others:\n\n- Nariman: <54kg\n- Zhalgas: <58kg\n- Darkhan: <63kg\n- Aibar: <74kg\n- Sultan: <80kg\n\nIn this case, the lightest competitor would be nariman shakirov at just under 54kg. The claim says more than 54kg, which would be false because he's lighter.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about how to interpret the numbers. Maybe it's better to think that each event has a minimum weight requirement:\n\n- Finweight (-54kg): meaning competitors must weigh at least -54kg (which doesn't make sense).\n- Flyweight (-58kg)\n- Bantamweight (-63kg)\n- Lightweight (-74kg)\n- Welterweight (-80kg)\n\nWait, if it's a negative number, maybe they represent the weight as kilograms with the sign indicating direction. For example, -54kg means 54kg below a certain limit, but that doesn't translate to actual weight.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the negative sign is a formatting error, and it's meant to be positive numbers indicating the weight in kg for each division.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\n- Finweight: 54kg\n- Flyweight: 58kg\n- Bantamweight: 63kg\n- Lightweight: 74kg\n- Welterweight: 80kg\n\nThen, nariman shakirov is 54kg, and he's in the lightest division. The claim says the lightest competitor weighs more than 54kg. But if nariman is exactly 54kg, then it's not more, just equal.\n\nTherefore, the statement is false because the lightest competitor does not weigh more than 54kg but equals it.\n\nBut I'm not confident in this interpretation either.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each number after the event represents the weight of the competitor. So:\n\n- Nariman: -54kg\n- Zhalgas: -58kg\n- Darkhan: -63kg\n- Aibar: -74kg\n- Sultan: -80kg\n\nSo, in terms of actual weight:\n\nNariman: 54kg below a certain limit? Or negative weight doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent their weight in kg as positive numbers, and the minus sign is just part of the event name. For example, \"finweight (-54kg)\" might mean something else, like -54kg is their weight.\n\nBut again, negative weights don't exist. So perhaps it's a formatting issue, and the actual weight is 54kg for finweight, 58kg for flyweight, etc.\n\nIf that's true, then nariman shakirov weighs 54kg, which is the lightest among all competitors. The claim says the lightest competitor weighs more than 54kg, which would be false because it's exactly 54kg.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect.\n\nI think this is the most plausible interpretation, despite some confusion with the negative signs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilograms is **false**. The lightest competitor (Nariman) weighs exactly 54 kilograms, not more than that.\n\nAnswer:  \n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh less than 80 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each row in the table represents. Each row corresponds to an athlete competing in a specific weight category (like finweight, flyweight, etc.), and they progress through rounds of a competition, but ultimately didn't advance past certain stages as indicated.\n\nThe claim is about whether the heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kilograms. So, I need to find out which row corresponds to the heaviest athlete. Looking at each event:\n\n- Row 1: Finweight (-54 kg)\n- Row 2: Flyweight (-58 kg)\n- Row 3: Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n- Row 4: Lightweight (-74 kg)\n- Row 5: Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nWait, actually, the more negative the weight category, the heavier the athlete. So, -80 kg is heavier than -63 kg because it's further from zero. Therefore, the heaviest competitor is in the Welterweight category, which is -80 kg.\n\nNow, looking at Row 5: Sultan Kassymov is in the welterweight division with a weight of -80 kg. The claim states that this heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kg. \n\nThe athlete's weight is listed as -80 kg. So, does -80 kg mean 80 kg? In combat sports like MMA or similar competitions, negative kilograms are used to denote weight classes below the lightweight division. For example, -54 kg would be a flyweight or featherweight, depending on the specific tournament.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about \"less than 80 kilogram.\" So, if the athlete's weight is -80 kg, that doesn't directly translate to a positive value for comparison. However, in terms of actual weight, an athlete at -80 kg would weigh 80 kilograms because negative weights don't subtract from your body weight; they denote lower divisions.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm confusing this with other sports. Let me think again: In some tournaments, the scale might be inverted so that -80 kg is a higher division than -74 kg. So, in terms of actual weight, -80 kg would mean 80 kilograms, and -74 kg would be lighter (74 kg). Therefore, Sultan Kassymov weighs 80 kg.\n\nBut the claim says \"the heaviest competitor weigh less than 80 kilogram.\" If his weight is exactly 80 kg, then it's not less than 80; it's equal. So that would make the claim FALSE because 80 kg is not less than 80 kg.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some contexts, negative kilograms mean subtracted from a base. For example, -54 kg might mean 46 kg (since 54 kg off), but I think that's more common in sports like judo or wrestling where weight classes are based on a standard. However, in MMA, the negative scale is used to denote the division, so -80 kg is indeed an 80 kg athlete.\n\nTherefore, since Sultan Kassymov weighs exactly 80 kg, he doesn't weigh less than 80 kg; he's equal to it. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitor be less than 60 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's in the table and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, let me look at the structure of the table. Each row represents an athlete with their event category, followed by their performance in each round. The columns include the athlete's name, event weight, and results in each match.\n\nThe claim is about the mean (average) weight of all competitors being less than 60 kg. To check this, I need to extract all the weights from the table and compute their average.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: nariman shakirov, event: finweight (-54 kg). So, his weight is -54 kg.\nRow 2: zhalgas bekkassymov, event: flyweight (-58 kg).\nRow 3: darkhan kassymkulov, event: bantamweight (-63 kg).\nRow 4: aibar dyussebayev, event: lightweight (-74 kg).\nRow 5: sultan kassymov, event: welterweight (-80 kg).\n\nWait, all these events have negative weights. I think in this context, the numbers are representing weight classes in kilograms. So, for example, -54 kg would mean a weight limit of 54 kg. Similarly, -58, -63, etc.\n\nSo each athlete's event has a specific weight class. Now, the claim is about the mean weight of all competitors being less than 60 kg. I think this refers to their weight classes, not their actual weights, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be that the average of the athletes' weights (as per their event) is below 60 kg.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each athlete's event has a specific weight category. For example, nariman shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg), which I believe is a weight class up to 54 kg. Similarly, flyweight is -58 kg (up to 58 kg), bantamweight is -63 kg (up to 63 kg), lightweight is -74 kg (up to 74 kg), and welterweight is -80 kg.\n\nBut the claim is about the mean weight of all competitors being less than 60 kg. So I need to consider each athlete's event weight as their weight, not their actual fighting weight. So for example, nariman shakirov's event is finweight at -54 kg, which would imply his fighting weight is within that class, say around 54 kg.\n\nSimilarly, the others:\n\nRow 1: -54\nRow 2: -58\nRow 3: -63\nRow 4: -74\nRow 5: -80\n\nWait, but these are all negative numbers, so if I take their average, it would be negative. But that doesn't make sense for a weight because you can't have a mean of -60 kg when the claim is about being less than 60 kg.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the event weights are positive numbers but represented as negative in the table for some reason. Alternatively, perhaps the table uses the negative sign to denote the weight category, like -54 kg meaning 54 kg in that division.\n\nSo perhaps I should ignore the negative signs and treat them as positive values. That would make sense because you can't have a negative mean weight when comparing competitors' weights.\n\nSo let's list out the weights without the negative sign:\n\nRow 1: 54\nRow 2: 58\nRow 3: 63\nRow 4: 74\nRow 5: 80\n\nNow, I need to calculate the mean of these values. Let me add them up.\n\n54 + 58 = 112\n112 + 63 = 175\n175 + 74 = 249\n249 + 80 = 329\n\nTotal sum is 329 kg. There are 5 athletes, so the average would be 329 / 5.\n\nCalculating that: 329 \u00f7 5 = 65.8 kg.\n\nSo the mean weight is 65.8 kg, which is greater than 60 kg. Therefore, the claim that the mean weight is less than 60 kg is false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake here.\n\n54 +58=112; 112+63=175; 175+74=249; 249+80=329. Yes, that's correct. Divided by 5 gives 65.8.\n\nSo the average is about 65.8 kg, which is indeed more than 60 kg. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe mean weight calculated from the table is approximately 65.8 kg, which is greater than 60 kg. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
