    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim about Rhodesia having certain medals is true or false by checking the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"Rhodesia have 2 bronze medal , 5 silver medal , and 10 gold medal.\" So, they're saying Rhodesia won 10 gold, 5 silver, and 2 bronze medals.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find Rhodesia's row. Scanning through the 'nation' column: Row 1 is the United States, Row 2 Great Britain, Row 3 Italy, Row 4 Australia, Row 5 Rhodesia. Okay, so Rhodesia is in Row 5.\n\nNow, check each medal count as per the claim against the table data for Rhodesia (Row 5). \n\nGold medals: The table shows gold:10. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSilver medals: The claim says 5 silver. Looking at the 'silver' column for Row 5, it's 5. That also matches.\n\nBronze medals: The claim mentions 2 bronze. Checking the 'bronze' column in Row 5, it shows 2. So that aligns as well.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes countries can have different medal counts based on events or years, but here we're only looking at this specific table. So according to this data, all three medal counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
