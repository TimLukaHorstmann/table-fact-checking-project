    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"11 of the players for the Paris Saint-Germain football club be not of French nationality.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that out of 11 players associated with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), 11 have a nationality other than French. My task is to check each relevant row in the table and count how many PSG players are not French.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that each row represents a player with details like name, position, period, appearances, goals, and nationality. The claim specifically mentions Paris Saint-Germain, so I need to identify which rows correspond to PSG players.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Larrys Mabiala: Nationality is Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 not French.\n2. Micka\u00ebl Madar: France \u2013 French. So this doesn't count towards the 11.\n3. St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n4. Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n5. Florian Makhedjouf: Algeria \u2013 Not French. Counts as 1.\n6. Tripy Makonda: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n7. Michel Marella: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n8. Patrice Marquet: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n9. Didier Martel: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n10. \u00c9ric Martin: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n11. Olivier Martinez: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n12. Blaise Matuidi: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n13. Florian Maurice: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n14. Jean-Eudes Maurice: Haiti \u2013 Not French. Counts as 2.\n15. Maxwell: Brazil \u2013 Not French. Counts as 3.\n16. Modeste M'bami: Cameroon \u2013 Not French. Counts as 4.\n17. Patrick Mboma: Cameroon \u2013 Not French. Counts as 5.\n18. Bernard Mendy: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n19. J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n20. Franck M\u00e9relle: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n21. Roland Mitoraj: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n22. Mario Mongelli: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n23. Fabrice Moreau: Cameroon \u2013 Not French. Counts as 6.\n24. Thierry Morin: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n25. Thiago Motta: Italy \u2013 Not French. Counts as 7.\n26. Jean-Michel Moutier: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n27. Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9: Republic of the Congo \u2013 Not French. Counts as 8.\n28. Youssuf Mulumbu: France \u2013 French. Doesn't count.\n29. Edwin Murati: Albania \u2013 Not French. Counts as 9.\n\nWait, I've gone through all 31 rows and counted 9 non-French players so far. Let me double-check if I missed any. \n\nI'll go through again quickly:\n\n- Mabiala (1): Congo\n- Makhedjouf (5): Algeria\n- Makonda (6): France\n- Maurice (14): Haiti\n- Maxwell (15): Brazil\n- M'bami (16): Cameroon\n- Mboma (17): Cameroon\n- Moreau (23): Cameroon\n- Motta (25): Italy\n- M'pel\u00e9 (27): Congo\n- Murati (31): Albania\n\nThat's 9 non-French players. The claim says 11, so unless I missed two more, it's false.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me check again:\n\nRow 12: Blaise Matuidi \u2013 France, correct.\nRow 19: J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez \u2013 France, correct.\nRow 26: Thierry Morin \u2013 France, correct.\nSo no, only 9 non-French players.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only 9, not 11, PSG players who are not French nationality.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}, {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 20 more appearances as a defender than Larrys Mabiala.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find both players.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 is in Row 3. His position is defender and he has 33 appearances.\n\nLarrys Mabiala is in Row 1. He's also a defender with 13 appearances.\n\nNow, the claim is about the number of appearances as defenders. So I need to compare their appearances specifically as defenders.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9: 33\nLarrys Mabiala: 13\n\nTo find out if St\u00e9phane has 20 more, I subtract Larrys' appearances from Stephane's: 33 - 13 = 20. That means Stephane has exactly 20 more appearances as a defender than Larrys.\n\nSo the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the 'appearances' column for both players to verify their counts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 2 corresponds to Micka\u00ebl Madar. His goals column shows 17 goals. So that's one part of the claim correct.\n\nNext, I'll check J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez. Looking at Row 19, it says his position is midfielder and period starts in 2011. His appearances are 84, but the important thing is his goals. The table shows he has 17 goals.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Fran\u00e7oise M'pel\u00e9 and Bernard Mendy is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9 be the highest scorer for the Paris Saint-Germain football club though Bernard Mendy have the most appearance.\" So, the claim has two parts:\n1. Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9 is the highest scorer.\n2. Bernard Mendy has the most appearances.\n\nI'll need to verify both statements against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with details like name, position, period (years), appearances, goals, and nationality. \n\nStarting with Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9. His information is in Row 29:\n- Name: fran\u00e7ois m'pel\u00e9\n- Position: forward\n- Period: 1973 - 1979\n- Appearances: 217\n- Goals: 95\n\nNow, the claim says he's the highest scorer. Highest scorer typically refers to the player with the most goals. So I need to check if his goal count is higher than other players in the table.\n\nLooking at other rows, particularly focusing on forwards and top scorers:\n- Row 7: michel marella, forward, 60 apps, 14 goals.\n- Row 13: florian maurice, forward, 47 apps, 14 goals.\n- Row 15: maxwell, defender, 63 apps, 3 goals.\n- Row 29: fran\u00e7ois m'pel\u00e9, forward, 217 apps, 95 goals.\n\nWait, the last row (Row 30) is about Youssuf Mulumbu. Let me check if there are other forwards with higher goals than M'pel\u00e9. For example, looking through all rows:\n\n- Row 17: patrick mboma, forward, 24 apps, 6 goals.\n- Row 9: didier martel, forward, 5 apps, 0 goals.\n- Row 14: jean-eudes maurice, forward, 50 apps, 3 goals.\n\nIt seems that Fran\u00e7oise M'pel\u00e9 has the highest number of goals (95) among all players listed. So the first part of the claim holds true.\n\nNow, checking Bernard Mendy's appearances. His information is in Row 18:\n- Name: bernard mendy\n- Position: defender\n- Period: presumably based on his years in the league.\n- Appearances: not directly provided, but looking at other rows:\n\nWait, actually, in the table, each row lists \"appearances.\" So for Bernard Mendy, I need to find the number of appearances he has. But wait, looking back, Row 18 is about him, and his appearance count isn't listed? Wait no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 18: name is Bernard Mendy. The columns include \"appearances.\" Let me see:\n\nRow 18:\n- Name: bernard mendy\n- Position: defender\n- Period: 1984 - 1987 and 1988 - 1989 (wait, no, looking at the table again, I might have misread. Actually, Row 25 is Fabrice Moreau with two periods.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify each row's data.\n\nRow 18: bernard mendy\n- Position: defender\n- Period: 1984 - 1987 and 1988 - 1989? Wait, no, the period for Row 18 is \"1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989\"? Or perhaps it's a single period. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 18 says:\n- name: bernard mendy\n- position: defender\n- period: 1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989? Wait no, the actual data is \"1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989\" for appearances and goals?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look at Row 18 again:\n\nRow 25 is Fabrice Moreau, but Row 18 is Bernard Mendy:\n- position: defender\n- period: 1984 - 1987, 1988 - 1989?\nNo, wait, the period for each row seems to be in two parts. For example, Row 29 (Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9) has \"1973 - 1979.\"\n\nSo for Row 18: bernard mendy\n- position: defender\n- period: 1984 - 1987 and 1988 - 1989? Or is it one period?\n\nWait, the table shows each row with multiple columns. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe table's columns are:\n0: name\n1: position\n2: period (years)\n3: appearances\n4: goals\n5: nationality\n\nSo for Row 18:\n\nname: bernard mendy  \nposition: defender  \nperiod: 1984 - 1987  \nappearances: ?  \ngoals: ?  \nnationality: france\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the row data is structured as:\n\"bernard mendy\", \"defender\", \"1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989\", \"3\", \"0\", \"france\"\n\nAh, so the period column has both periods separated by a comma. So his appearances are listed as 3? That can't be right because appearing in two periods would sum up more than that.\n\nWait no, perhaps the data is structured differently. Maybe the period is \"1984 - 1987\" and another period \"1988 - 1989,\" but the appearances might be cumulative.\n\nSo for Row 18:\n- Appearances: 3 (for each period?)\nBut that would mean he appeared 3 times in each period, totaling 6. But often, players have more than that over multiple seasons.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table's structure. Let me look at another row to clarify.\n\nTake Row 29: fran\u00e7ois m'pel\u00e9\n- Period: 1973 - 1979  \n- Appearances: 217  \nSo it seems that for each player, the period is one or more intervals, and appearances are a total count over those periods.\n\nTherefore, in Row 18 (bernard mendy):\n- Period: 1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989\n- Appearances: 3\n\nWait, but that seems low for two periods. Maybe it's a mistake or a formatting issue. Alternatively, the appearances might be per period.\n\nBut if I take \"appearances\" as the total across all periods listed, then 3 is very low, especially considering players like M'pel\u00e9 have over 200.\n\nThis makes me think that perhaps Row 18 has incorrect data or maybe the appearances are not captured correctly. Alternatively, maybe I misread the columns.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, the rows are structured with each cell separated by commas. So for Row 18:\n\nname: bernard mendy  \nposition: defender  \nperiod: 1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989  \nappearances: ?  \ngoals: ?  \nnationality: france\n\nWait, perhaps the appearances and goals are in another column. Wait no, I think the columns after period are appearances and goals.\n\nSo for Row 18:\n\nColumn 3: period is \"1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989\"  \nColumn 4: appearances = 3  \nColumn 5: goals = 0\n\nThat seems odd because having only 3 appearances over those periods would be low, but maybe that's accurate for some players.\n\nBut in any case, the question is whether Bernard Mendy has more or fewer appearances than others. If his total is 3, that's less than M'pel\u00e9's 217, which can't be correct because he's a defender who likely played many games.\n\nThis suggests I might have misinterpreted the table structure. Alternatively, perhaps the appearances and goals are listed in another way.\n\nWait, looking at Row 18 again:\n\nThe row is: \"bernard mendy\", \"defender\", \"1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989\", \"3\", \"0\", \"france\"\n\nSo that's six elements: name, position, period (with two periods), appearances (3), goals (0), nationality.\n\nThus, Bernard Mendy has a total of 3 appearances across his entire career. That can't be right because it would mean he only played a handful of matches, which is unlikely for someone who stayed in the league for multiple seasons.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in how I'm interpreting the table's data. Perhaps the period is not both periods but a single period, and the appearances are per period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"appearances\" column isn't correctly aligned. Maybe the columns after name are: position, period, appearances, goals, nationality. So for Row 18:\n\nColumn 3: appearances = 3  \nBut that still doesn't make sense if he played in two periods.\n\nWait, maybe the table is formatted with the period as one cell and then separate cells for each additional parameter. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the table's data isn't clear, making it difficult to accurately extract the number of appearances for Bernard Mendy. But assuming that in Row 18, appearances are listed as \"3,\" which seems low but possible if he only played a few games.\n\nIf we take that at face value, then Bernard Mendy has 3 appearances, while M'pel\u00e9 has 217. Therefore, M'pel\u00e9 has more appearances, which would mean that the statement \"Bernard Mendy has more appearances than Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9\" is false; M'pel\u00e9 has more.\n\nHowever, this seems counterintuitive because a defender typically plays many games over their career. So it's likely I made an error in interpreting the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the table's columns are not properly aligned, leading me to misread which column corresponds to appearances and goals.\n\nLet me re-examine the structure of the table as provided:\n\nThe user wrote: \n\nHere\u2019s a table of some players with their stats:\n- Name, Position, Period, Appearances, Goals, Nationality\n- [Players listed...]\n\nSo each row should have six columns: name, position, period (as years), appearances, goals, nationality.\n\nThus, for Row 18:\n\n- Name: bernard mendy  \n- Position: defender  \n- Period: 1984 - 1987 , 1988 - 1989  \n- Appearances: 3  \n- Goals: 0  \n- Nationality: france\n\nThis implies Bernard Mendy only played 3 matches in total across his career, which is highly unlikely. Therefore, it's possible that the data has a mistake, or perhaps I misread the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"appearances\" refers to per period, meaning he appeared 3 times in each of those periods, totaling 6. Still, 6 is very low for a defender over two periods spanning multiple years.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps it's better to consider that Bernard Mendy has more appearances than M'pel\u00e9 if the data is correct, but realistically, M'pel\u00e9 should have more.\n\nBut based on the table as given, if Appearances are 3, then he has fewer. Therefore, the initial statement \"Bernard Mendy has more appearances than Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9\" would be true according to the table, even though it's counterintuitive.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\nBased on the table provided, Bernard Mendy has 3 appearances in total across his career, while Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 has 217 appearances. Therefore, Bernard Mendy does indeed have more appearances than Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 according to the given data.\n\n**Answer:**  \nBernard Mendy has more appearances than Fran\u00e7ois M'Pel\u00e9 based on the provided table.",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"only 2 people have 1 appearance for the team , franck m\u00e9relle and mario mongelli.\" So I need to check if these two individuals are the only ones with exactly one appearance each in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a person with various attributes like name, position, period of appearances, number of appearances, goals, and nationality. My focus here is on the \"appearances\" column because the claim is about people who have 1 appearance.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to count how many times someone has exactly one appearance. I can skip rows where the appearances are not equal to one.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Larrys Mabiala has 13 appearances \u2013 that's more than one, so no.\nRow 2: Micka\u00ebl Madar with 46 is also more than one.\nRow 3: St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has 33, which is way above one.\nRow 4: Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 appears 118 times \u2013 definitely not one.\nRow 5: Florian Makhedjouf has 3 appearances \u2013 still above one.\nRow 6: Tripy Makonda with 27 \u2013 nope.\nRow 7: Michel Marella has 60, so no.\nRow 8: Patrice Marquet \u2013 24 appearances, not one.\nRow 9: Didier Martel has 5, which is more than one.\nRow 10: \u00c9ric Martin with 17 \u2013 nope.\nRow 11: Olivier Martinez appears 3 times \u2013 still above one.\nRow 12: Blaise Matuidi has 87 \u2013 definitely more.\nRow 13: Florian Maurice made 47 appearances \u2013 not one.\nRow 14: Jean-Eudes Maurice has 50, so no.\nRow 15: Maxwell with 63 is way above.\nRow 16: Modeste M'bami appears 101 times \u2013 nope.\nRow 17: Patrick Mboma with 24 \u2013 still more than one.\nRow 18: Bernard Mendy has 249 appearances, not one.\nRow 19: J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez appears 84 times \u2013 no.\nRow 20: Franck M\u00e9relle is listed as having 1 appearance. That's one person.\nRow 21: There are only up to Row 31, so I need to check each row carefully.\n\nWait, looking again, the table goes from Row 0 to Row 30, but in the problem statement, it's up to Row 31. Let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Each row corresponds to a single person, and I need to count how many people have exactly one appearance.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 20: Franck M\u00e9relle \u2013 1 appearance (so that's one).\nRow 21: There might be a typo because after Row 30 is Row 31, but perhaps the table has 30 rows. Wait, in the provided data, it goes up to Row 30 or 31? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, looking back, the user listed up to Row 31 (Edwin Murati). So total of 32 rows, indexed from 0 to 31.\n\nBut I'll go through each row from 0 to 31:\n\n- Rows 0-19: None have 1 appearance except Franck M\u00e9relle at Row 20.\n- Then Row 21: Is there a person named Mario Mongelli? Let me check. Looking through the table, yes, Mario Mongelli is in Row 25.\n\nRow 25: Fabrice Moreau \u2013 appearances are 3, so no.\nWait, wait, Mario Mongelli would be Row 26: No, Row 26 is Thierry Morin with 174 appearances.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

So in this list:\n\nOnly Row19 (Franck M\u00e9relle) has 1 appearance.\n\nBut the claim says Franck M\u00e9relle and Mario Mongelli. But looking at the table, I don't see Mario Mongelli with 1 appearance. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let's go through each row:\n\nLooking for \"appearances = 1\".\n\nRow0:13\nRow1:46\nRow2:33\nRow3:118\nRow4:3\nRow5:27\nRow6:60\nRow7:24\nRow8:5\nRow9:17\nRow10:3\nRow11:87\nRow12:47\nRow13:50\nRow14:63\nRow15:101\nRow16:24\nRow17:249\nRow18:84\nRow19:1 (Franck)\nRow20:3\nRow21:174\nRow22:31\nRow23:38\nRow24:217\nRow25:22\nRow26:24\n\nNo, only Row19 has 1 appearance. So the claim is incorrect because Mario Mongelli isn't in the list with 1 appearance.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the table. Let me check again for any row where appearances are 1.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Row0 to Row18: All have more than 1.\n- Row19: Franck M\u00e9relle -1\n- Rows20 onwards: No one else has 1.\n\nSo only Franck M\u00e9relle has 1 appearance. Therefore, the claim that both Franck and Mario have 1 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a row where someone else has 1. Let me check again:\n\nRow numbers from 0 to31.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, after Row24 (Fran\u00e7ois m'Pel\u00e9), it goes up to Row25: Youssuf Mulumbu \u201322\nRow26: Edwin Murati \u201324\n\nSo total rows are 27? Or is there a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the problem statement's data:\n\nIt seems that from Row0 to Row31 (Edwin Murati). But when listing them out, maybe some are missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table has 32 rows (0-31), but in the problem statement, it's written up to Edwin Murati as Row31. So let me make sure each row is accounted for:\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow0: Larrys Mabiala \u201313\nRow1: Micka\u00ebl Madar\u201346\nRow2: St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9\u201333\nRow3: Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9\u2013118\nRow4: Florian Makhedjouf\u20133\nRow5: Tripy Makonda\u201327\nRow6: Michel Marella\u201360\nRow7: Patrice Marquet\u201324\nRow8: Didier Martel\u20135\nRow9: \u00c9ric Martin\u201317\nRow10: Olivier Martinez\u20133\nRow11: Blaise Matuidi\u201387\nRow12: Florian Maurice\u201347\nRow13: Jean-Eudes Maurice\u201350\nRow14: Maxwell\u201363\nRow15: Modeste M'bami\u2013101\nRow16: Patrick Mboma\u201324\nRow17: Bernard Mendy\u2013249\nRow18: J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez\u201384\nRow19: Franck M\u00e9relle\u20131\nRow20: Fabrice Moreau\u20133\nRow21: Thierry Morin\u2013174\nRow22: Thiago Motta\u201331\nRow23: Jean-Michel Moutier\u201338\nRow24: Fran\u00e7ois m'Pel\u00e9\u2013217\nRow25: Youssuf Mulumbu\u201322\nRow26: Edwin Murati\u201324\n\nWait, that's 27 rows. So perhaps in the problem statement, it goes up to Row26 (Edwin), but I might have miscounted.\n\nIn any case, only Franck M\u00e9relle has 1 appearance, so the claim is incorrect because Mario Mongelli isn't listed as having 1 appearance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo, and Mario Mongelli is in another row with 1. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for any other rows where appearances are 1.\n\nI don't see any others. So only Franck has 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both have 1 is wrong; only Franck does.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to identify individuals who have appeared exactly once in a list of names. After carefully reviewing each entry, it becomes clear that only one person meets this criterion: **Franck M\u00e9relle**. The claim about Mario Mongelli also appearing exactly once is incorrect as there is no record of him in the provided data with an appearance count of one.\n\n**Answer:** Only Franck M\u00e9relle has appeared once.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about various football players, including their name, position, period they played, appearances, goals, and nationality. The claim I need to verify is: \"St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 has less than 10 more appearances as a defender than Larrys Mabiala.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It's saying that St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 (S.M.) has fewer than 10 more appearances compared to Larrys Mabiala (L.M.). So, essentially, S.M.'s appearances minus L.M.'s appearances should be less than 10.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for both players. Starting with St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9: his row is Row 3. His position is defender, and he played during 1995-1996 with 33 appearances and 0 goals, nationality France.\n\nNow, Larrys Mabiala is in Row 1. He's a defender as well, playing from 2006-2009 with 13 appearances and 1 goal, nationality Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe key data here are their positions and the number of appearances each had during their careers. Since both are defenders, we can compare their total appearances directly.\n\nCalculating the difference: S.M.'s appearances (33) minus L.M.'s appearances (13). 33 - 13 equals 20. So, S.M. has 20 more appearances than L.M. \n\nThe claim states that S.M. has less than 10 more. But 20 is greater than 10, which means the claim is false.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other relevant cells beyond these two. Both players are defenders, so their positions are consistent with what's being compared. Nationality doesn't affect the claim, as it's about the number of appearances. So, only the 'appearances' column for both rows is relevant.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compare the \"appearances\" of St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 (33) and Larrys Mabiala (13). The difference is 20, which is more than 10, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appearances\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

His goals are listed as 17. So he scored 17 goals, not 10. That already seems to contradict the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez.

It's about PSG players who are non-French in nationality. Specifically, it's stating that less than 10 such players exist. So, I need to check each row in the table where the player isn't French and count how many there are.\n\nLooking at the table, I see rows from 1 to 31, each with a player's name, position, period, appearances, goals, and nationality. My focus is on the \"nationality\" column for players who aren't from France.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Larrys Mabiala - Congolese\nRow 5: Florian Makhedjouf - Algerian\nRow 16: Modeste M'bami - Cameroonian\nRow 17: Patrick Mboma - Cameroonian\nRow 31: Edwin Murati - Albanian\n\nWait, let me check each nationality.

Wait, the table has up to Row 31.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 15: Maybe not relevant. Let me focus on all rows from 1 to 31.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake by not including all relevant players. Let me list all nationalities as per each row:\n\nLooking at each row's nationality (from the given data):\n\n- Row 1: DR Congo\n- Row 2: France\n- Row 3: France\n- Row 4: France\n- Row 5: Algeria\n- Row 6: France\n- Row 7: France\n- Row 8: France\n- Row 9: France\n- Row 10: France\n- Row 11: France\n- Row 12: France\n- Row 13: France\n- Row 14: Haiti\n- Row 15: Not applicable as per given data.\nWait, the initial table provided by the user goes up to which row? Let me check.\n\nThe user said \"You are tasked with identifying...\" and showed a table with headers and rows. The last row is probably Row 31, but I think in the context of this problem, it's better to focus on the nationalities as per each player listed in the table provided by the user.\n\nAssuming that the table includes all players up to Row 31, let me list the nationalities accordingly:\n\nAfter Row 14 (Haiti), continuing:\n\nRow 15: Maybe not relevant. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of all the rows and their nationalities as per the data given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can count the number of non-French players based on the nationalities listed in each row.\n\nBut without the exact list, it's challenging. However, from the previous discussion, we identified 8 non-French players:\n\n1. Larrys Mabiala\n2. Florian Makhedjouf\n3. Modeste M'bami\n4. Patrick Mboma\n5. Thiago Motta\n6. Jean-Eudes Maurice\n7. Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9\n8. Edwin Murati\n\nThat's 8 players who are not French.\n\nTherefore, the task was to identify non-French players in a table, and the count is 8.\n</think>\n\nThe task required identifying all non-French players from a given table. After examining each row, eight individuals were found to be non-French based on their nationalities:\n\n1. Larrys Mabiala - DR Congo\n2. Florian Makhedjouf - Algeria\n3. Modeste M'bami - Cameroon\n4. Patrick Mboma - Cameroon\n5. Thiago Motta - Italy\n6. Jean-Eudes Maurice - Haiti\n7. Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9 - DR Congo\n8. Edwin Murati - Albania\n\n**Answer:** There are 8 non-French players in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Bernard Mendy is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"Bernard Mendy has the most appearances and scores the most goals for Paris Saint-Germain.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find Bernard Mendy's row. Scanning the rows, I see Row 18 is named Bernard Mendy.\n\nNext, I need to check how many appearances and goals he has. In Row 18, his appearances are listed as 249, and he scored 11 goals.\n\nNow, to verify if he has the most appearances and goals for Paris Saint-Germain. I'll need to look at all other players on the team to see if anyone else has higher numbers in both categories or just one.\n\nLooking through the table, I see players like Didier Martel (Row 9) with 5 appearances but 0 goals. \u00c9ric Martin (Row 10) has 17 appearances and 1 goal. Patrice Marquet (Row 8) has 24 appearances and 2 goals. Olivier Martinez (Row 11) has 3 appearances, 0 goals. Blaise Matuidi (Row 12) is at 87 appearances but 9 goals. Florian Maurice (Row 13) has 47 appearances and 14 goals. Jean-Eudes Maurice (Row 14) has 50 appearances and 3 goals. Maxwell (Row 15) has 63 appearances and 3 goals. Modeste M'bami (Row 16) has 101 appearances but only 1 goal. Patrick Mboma (Row 17) has 24 appearances and 6 goals. Bernardo Mendy's numbers are 249 appearances and 11 goals.\n\nLooking at the other players, none seem to have higher appearances than Bernard Mendy except maybe Blaise Matuidi with 87, but Bernard is higher. In terms of goals, no one else seems to have more than him either\u2014most have lower or equal in both categories.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that all these players are part of Paris Saint-Germain. Looking at the nationalities, most are from France except some like Maxwell (Brazil) and a few others, which makes sense for a French club. So it's likely they're all part of PSG.\n\nSo Bernard Mendy appears more than anyone else listed here and scores more goals as well. Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking Bernard Mendy's appearances and goals against other players on Paris Saint-Germain. He has the highest number in both categories.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Appearances\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"nobody have only 1 appearance on this team , though 2 have 2 appearance.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that no one on the team has exactly 1 appearance. However, there are two players who each have 2 appearances. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check the 'appearances' column for each player and see if anyone has exactly 1.\n\nStarting with Row 0: Larrys Mabiala has 13 appearances.\nRow 1: Micka\u00ebl Madar \u2013 46\nRow 2: St\u00e9phane Mah\u00e9 \u2013 33\nRow 3: Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2013 118\nRow 4: Florian Makhedjouf \u2013 3\nRow 5: Tripy Makonda \u201327\nRow 6: Michel Marella \u201360\nRow7: Patrice Marquet \u201324\nRow8: Didier Martel \u20135\nRow9: \u00c9ric Martin \u201317\nRow10: Olivier Martinez \u20133\nRow11: Blaise Matuidi \u201387\nRow12: Florian Maurice \u201347\nRow13: Jean-Eudes Maurice \u201350\nRow14: Maxwell \u201363\nRow15: Modeste M'bami \u2013101\nRow16: Patrick Mboma \u201324\nRow17: Bernard Mendy \u2013249\nRow18: J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez \u201384\nRow19: Franck M\u00e9relle \u20131\nWait, Franck M\u00e9relle has 1 appearance. That's a problem because the claim says nobody has only 1 appearance.\n\nThen Row20: Roland Mitoraj \u201368\nRow21: Mario Mongelli \u20131\nSo Mario Mongelli also has 1 appearance.\nRow22: Monteiro \u20139\nRow23: Bernard Moraly \u201321\nRow24: Fabrice Moreau \u20133\nRow25: Thierry Morin \u2013174\nRow26: Thiago Motta \u201331\nRow27: Jean-Michel Moutier \u201338\nRow28: Fran\u00e7ois M'pel\u00e9 \u2013217\nRow29: Youssuf Mulumbu \u201322\nRow30: Edwin Murati \u201324\n\nWait, so Franck M\u00e9relle (Row19) has 1 appearance. That directly contradicts the claim because the claim says nobody has only 1. So that makes the claim false.\n\nAlso, checking for two players with exactly 2 appearances. Looking at the 'appearances' column:\n\nI don't see any player with exactly 2. Let me double-check each row.\n\nRow0:13, Row1:46, Row2:33, Row3:118, Row4:3, Row5:27, Row6:60, Row7:24, Row8:5, Row9:17, Row10:3, Row11:87, Row12:47, Row13:50, Row14:63, Row15:101, Row16:24, Row17:249, Row18:84, Row19:1 (Franck M\u00e9relle), Row20:68, Row21:1 (Mario Mongelli), Row22:9, Row23:21, Row24:3, Row25:174, Row26:31, Row27:38, Row28:217, Row29:22, Row30:24.\n\nNo one has exactly 2. So the second part of the claim is also incorrect because it says \"though 2 have 2 appearances,\" which isn't true.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are players with exactly 1 appearance (Franck M\u00e9relle and Mario Mongelli), and no two players have exactly 2 appearances.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
