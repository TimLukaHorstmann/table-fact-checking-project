The claim is: \"Evita be nominate for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions two awards: Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, both in the year 2012, for the work \"Evita.\" So I need to look through the table to find any rows that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result. I'll scan each row for the year 2012.\n\nRow 16: Year is 2012, award is Tony Award, category is best performance by a featured actor in a musical, nominated work is Evita, result is nominated.\nRow 17: Year is 2012, award is Drama Desk Award, category is outstanding featured actor in a musical, nominated work is Evita, result is nominated.\n\nSo both the Tony and Drama Desk Awards are listed as nominated for \"Evita\" in 2012. Therefore, the claim is true because Evita was indeed nominated for both awards that year.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row in 2012 for \"Evita.\" Both the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award entries show \"evita\" as the nominated work with results as \"nominated.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"award\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any mentions of \"Sweeney Todd\" and the Drama League Award around 2006.\n\nLooking at Row 7: year 2006, award is Tony Award, category best performance by a leading actor in a musical. Nominated work is Sweeney Todd... So yes, it was nominated for a Tony but not specifically the Drama League.\n\nRow 8: year 2006, Drama Desk Award, outstanding actor in a musical. Again, Sweeney Todd. So no mention of Drama League here.\n\nRows 9 and 10 also refer to 2006 but are about nominations for other awards, so they don't mention Drama League either.\n\nSo in the table, there's no entry where \"Sweeney Todd\" was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"in 2012 evita be nominate for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what it's saying. It mentions the year 2012, the award category as \"outstanding featured actor in a musical,\" and the nominated work is \"evita.\" So I'm looking for an entry in the table that matches these specifics.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different award or nomination with details like year, award name, category, nominated work, and result. The rows go from 1993 to 2012, so I should focus on the years around 2012, specifically looking for entries in 2012.\n\nStarting with row 16: year is 2012, award is tony award, category is best performance by a featured actor in a musical, nominated work is evita, and result is nominated. That seems to match all parts of the claim. So this row supports the claim because it shows that in 2012, Evita was nominated for the outstanding featured actor in a musical.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant rows. Row 17 is also from 2012 but it's about the drama desk award and category outstanding featured actor in a musical with evita as the nominated work. The result here is also nominated. So both row 16 and 17 are relevant because they both pertain to Evita being nominated for the same category in 2012.\n\nWait, does the claim specify \"outstanding featured actor\" or \"best performance by a featured actor\"? Looking back, the claim says \"outstanding featured actor,\" but row 16's category is \"best performance by a featured actor.\" So technically, the categories are slightly different. But maybe they're considered equivalent in this context. I need to confirm if both fall under the same award category.\n\nAlso, the claim doesn't specify whether Evita was won or just nominated, and since both rows 16 and 17 have \"result: nominated,\" it fits the claim which mentions being \"nominate[d].\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 16 and row 17. So in my JSON response, I should include these two rows with their respective details.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \" nominated work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \" nominated work\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"evita be nominate work after 2006 , that be award the outer critic circle award and the outstanding featured actor in a musical.\" \n\nBreaking this down, it seems to be saying two things:\n1. The nominated work \"Evita\" happened after 2006.\n2. For this nomination, both the Outer Critics Circle Award and the Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical were awarded.\n\nNow I'll look at the table to find relevant information. \n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Rows 16 and 17 are for 2012, award: Tony and Drama Desk respectively, category: best performance by a featured actor in musical and outstanding featured actor in musical, nominated work: Evita, result: nominated.\n\nSo, in row 16, \"Evita\" was nominated for the Tony Award but didn't win. Similarly, row 17 shows it was also nominated for the Drama Desk but didn't win either.\n\nNow, checking if \"Evita\" was awarded any of these prizes. From the table, both nominations resulted in \"nominated\" outcomes, not \"won.\" So there's no entry where Evita won either award after 2006.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other years after 2006: rows 11-15 and beyond don't mention \"Evita.\" So there are no instances of \"Evita\" winning any awards after 2006 in the table provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"evita be nominate work after 2006 , that be award the outer critic circle award and the outstanding featured actor in a musical\" is FALSE because Evita was only nominated but didn't win either of those awards.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The award is drama league award, category is distinguished performance, nominated work is king lear. So this doesn't match.\n\nRows 12-15: These are all for \"lovemusik.\" So they don't mention evita.\n\nLooking at the entire table, I don't see any row where the year is 2007 and the awarded work is evita with that specific category. The closest related rows are in 2012 (Rows 16-17), but that's a different year.\n\nSo it seems there's no data supporting the claim.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then list the relevant cells that support this determination. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"the who 's tommy / sweeney todd : the demon barber of fleet street be the nominated work, nominate for the drama league award after 2007.\"\n\nSo, breaking it down, the claim mentions two specific shows: \"The Who's Tommy\" and \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. It says that these are the nominated works that should have been nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007.\n\nFirst, I need to check if both shows were indeed nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For \"The Who's Tommy\":\n  - The only relevant row is Row 1 (year:1993), which says it was nominated but didn't win. However, the claim refers to after 2007, so we need to see if there's a later nomination.\n\nWait, checking again, I might have missed other rows for \"The Who's Tommy.\" Let me scan through each row:\n\nRows 1-3: Year 1993, all about \"The Who's Tommy,\" but they are from 1993. The claim mentions after 2007, so that's a different time period.\n\nThen, looking at the shows after 2007:\n\nIn 2006 (Row 7-10): \"Sweeney Todd...\" is nominated for several awards, including Drama League Award (Drama League Award: result: nominated) but specifically in Row 9: category: distinguished performance. So Sweeney Todd was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"after 2007.\" So after 2007 would be 2008 onwards. Let me check if there's another nomination for either show post-2007.\n\nLooking at Rows 11-17:\n\nRow 11: 2007, King Lear, Drama League Award, nominated.\n\nRow 12: 2007, Lovemusik, Tony Award, nominated.\n\nRows 13-15: Same as above, different awards.\n\nRow 16-17: 2012, Evita, nominated for Tony and Drama Desk, but not Drama League.\n\nSo after 2007 (i.e., 2008 onwards), are there any more nominations for the two shows in question?\n\nFor \"The Who's Tommy,\" I don't see any rows beyond 1993. It was only nominated in 1993, so no later nomination.\n\n\"Sweeney Todd\" was nominated for Drama League Award in 2006 (Row 9). But the claim refers to after 2007, which would mean 2008 onwards. There's no mention of Sweeney Todd being nominated again post-2007.\n\nAdditionally, \"The Who's Tommy\" isn't mentioned as being nominated again after 1993.\n\nSo the claim might be incorrect because it suggests that both shows were nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007, but Sweeney Todd was only in 2006 and The Who's Tommy hasn't been mentioned beyond 1993.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is saying that either of those two shows was the nominated work for the Drama League Award after 2007. So does any of them get nominated again after 2007?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Sweeney Todd: Only in 2006 (Row 9), so before 2007.\n- The Who's Tommy: Not mentioned after 1993.\n\nTherefore, neither show was nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007. So the claim would be FALSE because there is no data supporting that either of those works were nominated for the Drama League Award post-2007.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check. Maybe I missed something. Let me go through each row again.\n\nLooking at rows starting from 11 onwards:\n\nRow 11: King Lear (2007), not our shows.\n\nRows 12-15: Lovemusik (2007), Drama League Award is for distinguished performance, but the show is Lovemusik, not either of our two mentioned.\n\nRows 16-17: Evita in 2012, which isn't one of our shows.\n\nSo no, neither show appears after 2007 as being nominated for the Drama League Award. Therefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence that either show was nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007.\n\nAdditionally, I need to identify the relevant cells that confirm this. These would be the rows where \"Drama League Award\" and the respective shows are involved, but only up to 2006. So the relevant cells would be Row 9 (Sweeney Todd) and perhaps any others if applicable.\n\nBut since after 2007 there's no data supporting the claim, the relevant cells would be the ones showing Sweeney Todd was nominated for Drama League in 2006, which is before 2007. Therefore, it doesn't support the claim of being after 2007.\n\nSo, to answer:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because neither \"The Who's Tommy\" nor \"Sweeney Todd...\" were nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007.\n- The relevant cells would include Row 9 where Sweeney Todd was nominated for the Drama League Award in 2006, but that's not after 2007, so it doesn't support the claim. However, perhaps only cells relevant to show they didn't get it after 2007 are needed.\n\nWait, but maybe I should list all the rows where \"Drama League Award\" is mentioned because they are related. So:\n\nRows with Drama League Award:\n\nRow 1: The Who's Tommy (1993)\nRow 9: Sweeney Todd (2006)\nRow 11: King Lear (2007)\n\nSo these would be relevant as they show that only up to 2007 the shows were nominated, but not after.\n\nTherefore, the cells showing Drama League Award are Rows 1, 9, and 11. These indicate that \"The Who's Tommy\" was only in 1993, Sweeney Todd in 2006, and King Lear in 2007.\n\nThus, the claim is about after 2007, so no relevant data supports it beyond 2007 except Row 11 (King Lear), which isn't one of the two shows mentioned. Therefore, the cells show that neither of the two shows were nominated for Drama League Award after 2007, making the claim false.\n\nI think I've covered all bases here.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe task was to determine whether either \"The Who's Tommy\" or \"Sweeney Todd...\" was nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007. \n\n**Analysis:**\n- **Drama League Award Nominations:**\n  - **Row 1 (1993):** \"The Who's Tommy\" was nominated but did not win.\n  - **Row 9 (2006):** \"Sweeney Todd...\" was nominated for the Drama League Award in the category of \"distinguished performance.\"\n  - **Row 11 (2007):** \"King Lear\" was the show nominated, unrelated to either of our focus shows.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nNeither \"The Who's Tommy\" nor \"Sweeney Todd...\" received a nomination for the Drama League Award after 2007. The claim is **false** because there is no evidence of either show being nominated in that period.\n\n**Relevant Rows:**\n- Rows 1, 9, and 11, which indicate nominations but only up to 2007, not after.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe statement is false. Neither \"The Who's Tommy\" nor \"Sweeney Todd...\" was nominated for the Drama League Award after 2007. The relevant data points are rows 1 (1993), 9 (2006), and 11 (2007).",
