I need to find out how many bronze medals Morocco has compared to other countries.\n\nI'll scan through each row to locate Morocco's data. Scrolling down, I see that Row 9 is for Morocco. According to the table, Morocco has rank: 9, gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 7, and total: 7. So, Morocco has 7 bronze medals.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other country has more than 7 bronze medals.

So, I'm looking for how many silver medals Tunisia has compared to other nations. The key metric here is the 'silver' column in each row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different nation along with their gold, silver, bronze, and total medal counts. The first step is to locate Tunisia's data. Scanning through the 'nation' column, I find Tunisia in Row 2.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Algeria won the second-highest number of gold medals. So, I need to check how many gold medals each nation has and see if Algeria indeed has the second highest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different nation with their respective gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. I'll focus on the \"gold\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Algeria - 9 gold medals.\nRow 2: Tunisia - 4 gold medals.\nRow 3: Egypt - 3 gold medals.\nRow 4: Senegal - 1 gold medal.\nRow 5: Angola - 1 gold medal.\nRow 6: South Africa - 0 gold medals.\nRow 7: Nigeria - 0 gold medals.\nRow 8: Niger - 0 gold medals.\nRow 9: Morocco - 0 gold medals.\nRows 10-13: Several nations with 0 gold medals each.\n\nSo, the highest number of gold medals is 9 by Algeria (Row 1). The next highest is Tunisia with 4. After that, Egypt has 3, Senegal and Angola have 1 each, and the rest have 0.\n\nNow, checking the claim: \"algeria win the second most gold medal\". Since Algeria has the highest number of gold medals at 9, they can't be in second place. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that Algeria is second when they are actually first.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Maybe \"second most\" refers to the total medals rather than just gold. But the claim specifically mentions \"gold medal\", so it should only consider the gold count.\n\nTherefore, since Algeria has the highest number of golds (9), they can't be in second place for that category. So the statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

That means I need to check two things: the number of gold medals Morocco has and the number of bronze medals they have. If their gold count is higher than their bronze count, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a nation along with their rank, total medals, and specific counts of gold, silver, and bronze medals.

Now, comparing the two: 0 gold vs. 7 bronze. Clearly, 0 is not greater than 7.

The task is to determine whether the given claim about Tunisia winning fewer silver than gold medals in the championship is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly: \"tunisia win the fewer silver than gold medal in the championship.\" So, we're comparing the number of gold medals Tunisia has won to the number of silver medals they've won. The claim suggests that Tunisia's silver count is less than their gold count.\n\nNext, I'll look through the table to find Tunisia's data. Scanning each row, I see that Row 2 corresponds to Tunisia. In this row, under 'gold' and 'silver', Tunisia has 4 gold medals and 6 silver medals respectively.\n\nNow, comparing these numbers: 4 (gold) vs. 6 (silver). The claim states that Tunisia wins fewer silver than gold, which would mean silver should be less than gold. However, according to the table, Tunisia actually has more silver (6) than gold (4) medals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Tunisia's number of silver medals is greater than their gold medals. \n\nTo validate this, I'll identify the relevant cells from the table.

Each row represents a country, their rank, number of gold, silver, and bronze medals, along with the total medals. The rows go from rank 1 to rank 12, but there's some duplication in the ranks, especially for 10th place.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions \"more than 4 countries tie for 10th place.\" So I need to check how many countries are tied at 10th position.

The table shows exactly four countries tied at 10th.
