    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"Kristofer Martin was nominated for 3 act award in 2012, win the german moreno youth achievement award.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award or nomination from different years and bodies. The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are two main parts:\n1. Kristofer Martin was nominated for a \"3 act award\" in 2012.\n2. He won the \"german moreno youth achievement award.\"\n\nNow, I need to check if these parts are supported by the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"Kristofer Martin was nominated for a 3 act award in 2012.\" Looking through the table rows from 2012 (since the claim is about 2012), specifically looking for any nomination related to Kristofer Martin or \"3 act award.\"\n\nRow 4 of the table mentions 2012, but it's about the Young Critics Circle Awards, category: Best Performance, nominated for: Oros. No mention of a 3-act award here.\n\nRow 5: 28th PMPC Star Awards for Movies, category: New Movie Actor of the Year, nominated for: Tween Academy: Class of 2012. Still no \"3 act award.\"\n\nRow 6: FAMAS Awards, category: German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. The result is won, but this is about a different award.\n\nWait, Kristofer Martin's name isn't mentioned in any row, but the claim refers to him. So perhaps the table doesn't mention him, which would mean the first part of the claim might not be supported.\n\nNow, for the second part: winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. Looking at Row 6, FAMAS Awards, category is exactly that award, and the result is \"won.\" So this part is supported by Row 6.\n\nSo putting it together, the claim says Kristofer was nominated for a 3-act award in 2012 but won the German Moreno award. The table shows he did win the German Moreno award (Row 6). But there's no mention of him being nominated for a \"3 act award\" in 2012.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all rows again. In Row 5, the category is New Movie Actor of the Year, and he was nominated for Tween Academy: Class of 2012. No \"3-act award.\" So it seems the claim's first part isn't supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, since the claim includes a nomination that isn't in the table, the entire statement would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I analyzed each part against the provided table. The claim mentions Kristofer Martin being nominated for a \"3 act award\" in 2012 and winning the German Moreno award. The table confirms he won the latter but doesn't mention the former nomination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim about Kristofer Martin's awards is true or false based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says that in 2013, Kristofer Martin received only an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor in Oros at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo but won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at the 10th Golden Screen Awards. \n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find relevant information.\n\nRow 1: 2013, award giving body: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category: Stand Out Season Performer, nominated for: none, result: nominated. This doesn't mention Kristofer Martin or Oros, so probably not relevant.\n\nRow 2: 2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo, category: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, nominated for: Oros, result: won. So here's the honorable mention in 2013 at the Long Island expo. That aligns with part of the claim.\n\nRow 3: 2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards, category: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated for: Oros, result: won. This matches the second part of the claim where he won the best actor award in 2013 at the Golden Screen Awards.\n\nRows 4-7 are from 2012, so they don't pertain to 2013, so I can ignore them unless there's some confusion, but the claim is about 2013 specifically.\n\nSo the key information needed for the claim is in row 2 and row 3. Therefore, these cells are relevant because they provide the specific awards Kristofer Martin received in 2013 as mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that Kristofer Martin received an honorable mention at the Long Island International Film Expo and won Best Actor at the Golden Screen Awards in 2013 for Oros.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The user claims that in 2013, Kristofer Martin got an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor (Oros) at the Long Island expo and won Best Supporting Actor (Oros) at the Golden Screen Awards.\n\n2. **Check Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1 (2013):** Not relevant as it's about a different award category.\n   - **Row 2 (2013):** Matches the honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor at Long Island, which is part of the claim.\n   - **Row 3 (2013):** Matches the win for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at Golden Screen Awards, which supports the claim.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The relevant cells are Row 2 and Row 3, confirming the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"kristofer martin have been nominate for 7 act award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this claim is saying. It's stating that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 acting awards between the years 2012 and 2013. Out of these seven nominations, he won four.\n\nNow, let me look at the table provided. The table has six rows (from Row 1 to Row 6), each representing different award nominations and their outcomes for Kristofer Martin in the years 2012 and 2013.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: 2013, 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, Stand Out Season Performer, None, Nominated. So here, he was nominated but didn't win. That's one nomination.\n\nRow 2: 2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo, Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Oros, Won. Another award won, so that's the second win.\n\nRow 3: 2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Oros, Won. That's his third win.\n\nRow 4: 2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards, Best Performance, Oros, Nominated. So that's one more nomination for the year 2012.\n\nRow 5: 2012, 28th PMPC Star Awards for Movies, New Movie Actor of the Year, Tween Academy: Class of 2012, Nominated. That's another nomination in 2012, bringing his total nominations to two for that year.\n\nRow 6: 2012, FAMAS Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, N/A, Won. That's his fourth win.\n\nNow, let's tally this up:\n\nNominations:\n- Row 1: Nominated (1)\n- Row 4: Nominated (2)\n- Row 5: Nominated (3)\nTotal nominations: 3\n\nWait, but the claim says he was nominated for seven awards. So there seems to be a discrepancy here. The table only shows three nominations across two years.\n\nHowever, I notice that the claim mentions \"between 2012 and 2013,\" which covers both years in question. But according to the table, he was only nominated three times: once each in 2012 (Rows 4 and 5) and twice in 2013 (Rows 1 and 2). That's a total of five nominations, not seven as the claim states.\n\nWait, no, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: Nominated (2013)\nRow 2: Won (2013)\nRow 3: Won (2013)\nRow 4: Nominated (2012)\nRow 5: Nominated (2012)\nRow 6: Won (2012)\n\nSo that's five awards mentioned in the table, but only three of them are wins. Wait, no\u2014Rows 1, 4, and 5 are nominations; Rows 2,3,6 are wins.\n\nBut the claim says he was nominated for seven awards between 2012-2013, which would mean each award is a separate nomination. So if there are three nominations in total across both years (Rows 1, 4, 5), that's only three, not seven.\n\nWait, but I'm seeing that Rows 1, 4, and 5 are all nominations, totaling three. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states he was nominated for seven awards, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nAdditionally, regarding wins: the claim says he won four of those seven. According to the table, he has three wins (Rows 2,3,6). So even if the number of nominations were correct, the number of wins doesn't add up either.\n\nTherefore, both the number of nominations and the number of wins in the claim are not supported by the table data provided. This means the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Kristofer Martin was nominated for seven acting awards between 2012 and 2013, winning four, is not fully supported by the table. The table shows only three nominations across both years, with three wins.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in 'Oros'.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to see where Kristofer Martin was nominated and whether it was for 'Oros'. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: 2013, 1st Sunday All Stars Awards. Category is \"Stand Out Season Performer,\" but he wasn't nominated for anything. So no.\n\nRow 2: 2013, Long Island International Film Expo. Category is \"Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor.\" Nominated for 'Oros' and won it. So one nomination for Oros.\n\nRow 3: 2013, Golden Screen Awards. Category is \"Best Actor in a Supporting Role,\" nominated for 'Oros,' result won. That's the second nomination for Oros.\n\nRow 4: 2012, Young Critics Circle Awards. Category is \"Best Performance,\" nominated for 'Oros.' So third nomination for Oros.\n\nWait, so that's three nominations: Row 2, 3, and 4 all have 'Oros' as the nominated work, each in different award bodies and categories. \n\nRow 5: 2012, PMPC Star Awards. Category is \"New Movie Actor of the Year,\" but he was nominated for \"Tween Academy: Class of 2012.\" So not Oros.\n\nRow 6: 2012, FAMAS Awards. He won \"German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\" Nominated for 'NA,' which might mean not applicable or not available. Doesn't mention 'Oros.'\n\nRow 7: 2012, Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards. Won \"Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching,\" nominated for 'NA.' Again, no Oros.\n\nSo in total, Kristofer Martin was nominated three times for his performance in 'Oros' (Rows 2,3,4). Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row to see if Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for \"Oros.\" There are three such instances: Rows 2, 3, and 4.

Let's break down the claim and the table to see if they align.\n\nThe claim states: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 be not base on nomination for a specific show.\" So, I need to find two instances where Kristofer Martin won an award in those years but wasn't nominated for a specific show.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table pertain to Kristofer Martin. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: year 2013, category is \"stand out season performer,\" result is \"nominated.\" Not a win.\n- Row 2: awarding body is Long Island International Film Expo, but no mention of Kristofer Martin.\n- Row 3: Golden Screen Awards for best supporting actor, won. Need to see if he was nominated for that specific show.\n- Row 4: Young Critics Circle Awards, nominated but not a win.\n- Row 5: PMPC Star Awards for \"Tween Academy: Class of 2012,\" nominated but not a win.\n- Row 6: Famas Awards, won. Need to check if it's related to a specific show.\n- Row 7: Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, won. No mention of a specific show.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that the table doesn't explicitly list Kristofer Martin's name; maybe he's referred to as \"oros\" or other terms? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the 'nominated for' column: rows 3 and 5 have \"oros.\" Maybe that's a placeholder for Kristofer Martin? Or perhaps it's an abbreviation. Since the claim is about Kristofer Martin, I'll assume those are his nominations.\n\nIn row 3, he was nominated as \"oros\" (maybe standing in for Kristofer) and won best actor. So if the claim says two of his wins weren't based on a specific show's nomination, this might fit because the category is general, not tied to a specific show.\n\nRow 6: Famas Awards, category German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, won. Nominated for \"n/a,\" which likely means not applicable or not available. If he was nominated for that award but it wasn't based on a specific show, this could be another instance.\n\nSo, two wins (rows 3 and 6) where he didn't base the win on a specific show's nomination. That would make the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Kristofer Martin was only nominated for 1 acting award in 2013 but didn't win any.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table where the year is 2013 to find any nominations or wins related to Kristofer Martin.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: 2013, Award: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, Category: Stand Out Season Performer, Nominated For: None, Result: Nominated.\n- Row 2: 2013, Award: 16th Long Island International Film Expo, Category: Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won.\n- Row 3: 2013, Award: 10th Golden Screen Awards, Category: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Nominated For: Oros, Result: Won.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are from 2012, so they don't apply here.\n\nWait, the claim is about 2013. So I'm focusing on rows where year is 2013.\n\nIn row 1, it's about a category but Kristofer Martin isn't mentioned, just \"none\" for nominated for. The category is Stand Out Season Performer. It's unclear if this is related to Kristofer or not. Maybe the name is different, so perhaps it's another person.\n\nRow 2: Nominated For: Oros. If Kristofer Martin was nominated here, then it would count towards the one nomination. But I don't know his name here\u2014it says \"Oros\" as the nominee. So unless \"Kristofer Martin\" is \"Oros,\" which seems unlikely, this might not be relevant.\n\nRow 3: Nominated For: Oros again. Same issue as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe Kristofer Martin's name appears in these categories or nominations. Let me look again.\n\nIn row 1, the category is Stand Out Season Performer, and he was nominated but didn't win. If this is his only nomination in 2013, then the claim would be true if he indeed was only nominated once and didn't win any awards that year.\n\nBut looking at rows 2 and 3, both mention Oros as the nominee. So unless Kristofer Martin is \"Oros,\" which isn't clear from the table, these might not count towards his nominations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Kristofer Martin\" is the name of a person who was only nominated once in 2013 and didn't win any awards that year. But looking at the table, I don't see an exact match for Kristofer Martin's name in the award categories or nominees.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim refers to Kristofer Martin being the only one nominated for an acting award in 2013 but not winning. So looking through the table, are there any awards given to him?\n\nRow 2: He won Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor.\nRow 3: He won Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nSo actually, he won two awards in 2013. That contradicts the claim that he didn't win any.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. The table lists results as either nominated or won. So if Kristofer Martin is \"Oros,\" then he did win in rows 2 and 3, which would mean the claim about him not winning is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Kristofer Martin\" isn't \"Oros.\" Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 1: Nominated for None. So that's not acting.\nRow 2: Oros is the nominee, won.\nRow 3: Oros is the nominee, won.\n\nIf Kristofer Martin was only nominated once in 2013 and didn't win any, but according to the table, he actually won two awards in 2013. So the claim would be false because he did win some awards that year.\n\nWait, no, the claim says \"didn't win any,\" which is incorrect if he did win. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the name Oros isn't Kristofer Martin. Unless the table uses a different name, but the claim mentions Kristofer Martin specifically. So perhaps in the table, the winner's name is Oros, not Kristofer Martin. Therefore, the claim that Kristofer Martin was only nominated once and didn't win any would be correct if he was indeed only nominated once but didn't win.\n\nLooking back, in 2013:\n\nRow 1: He was nominated for Stand Out Season Performer but didn't win.\nRows 2 and 3: He won two awards. So in total, he had three entries in the table for 2013: one nomination and two wins.\n\nBut wait, in row 1, it's 2013, award giving body: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category: Stand Out Season Performer, result: nominated.\n\nSo that's his only nomination in 2013. So he was only nominated once but won two awards. Therefore, the claim says \"only nominated for 1 act award\" which is correct, but then it says \"didn't win any,\" which is incorrect because he did win.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because he didn't win any awards, but in reality, he won two. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim: \"Kristofer Martin was only nominated for 1 acting award in 2013 but didn't win any.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nIn 2013, he was:\n\n- Nominated for Stand Out Season Performer (row 1)\n- Won Best Supporting Actor (row 2)\n- Won Best Actor in a Supporting Role (row 3)\n\nSo he was indeed only nominated once (1 acting award nomination) but did win two awards. Therefore, the part about not winning any is false because he won two.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Kristofer Martin was only nominated for 1 acting award in 2013 but didn't win any\" is false because Kristofer Martin actually won two awards in 2013.

The category is Stand Out Season Performer, nominated for none, result: Nominated. This doesn't match since Kristofer's awards are in \"Oros\" and the FAMAS, which aren't mentioned here.\n\n**Row 2**: year 2013, award giving body is 16th Long Island International Film Expo.

So there's one, but the claim says two.\n\n**Row 3**: year 2013, award giving body is 10th Golden Screen Awards. Category: Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated for Oros, result: Won. This matches the second part of the claim regarding Kristofer winning Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS? Wait, no\u2014FAMAS is another award body. So row 3's category doesn't align with FAMAS.\n\nWait, I think I might be mixing up the categories and award bodies. Let me clarify.\n\nThe claim mentions two things for Kristofer in 2013:\n\n- 2 honorable mentions as Best Support Actor for \"Oros\" at Long Island Film Expo.\n- Win Best Actor in a Supporting Role for \"Oros\" at FAMAS.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 2: category is Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor. So that's one. But the claim says two, so this might be an issue unless there's another row I'm missing.\n\nRow 3: category is Best Actor in a Supporting Role. That would align with the second part of the claim about winning at FAMAS. However, the award giving body for row 3 is 10th Golden Screen Awards, not FAMAS. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, the table's Row 6: year 2012, FAMAS Awards, category German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, result won. That's 2012, so Kristofer would have gotten this in 2012, but the claim is about 2013. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to check each row again.\n\nLooking for \"Oros\" as the nominated work:\n\nRow 2: Nominated for Oros.\nRow 3: Nominated for Oros.\nRow 4: Nominated for Oros.\nRow 5: Nominated for Tween Academy: Class of 2012, not Oros.\nRow 6: Nominated for n/a (probably not Oros).\nRow 7: Nominated for n/a.\n\nSo Kristofer was nominated for Oros in rows 2,3,4. Wait, but the claim says he received two honorable mentions at Long Island Film Expo. Let me check row 2 again. It's a single win, but perhaps there were multiple categories? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the table.\n\nWait, each row is an individual award, right? So if Kristofer got one honorable mention in Best Supporting Actor for Oros at Long Island Film Expo (row 2), that's one. But the claim says two, so unless there's another row with him getting another honorable mention, it might be false.\n\nLooking through rows, I don't see another entry in 2013 where Kristofer is awarded an honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor or any other supporting category in Oros. So perhaps only one.\n\nBut the claim says two. So that would make the first part of the claim incorrect, hence making the entire statement false. However, he did win Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS in 2013 (if such a category exists). Wait, but row 3's award is from Golden Screen Awards, not FAMAS.\n\nWait, no\u2014row 6 is about FAMAS in 2012. So maybe the claim is incorrect because he didn't win Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS in 2013. Or perhaps he did, but it's not in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the columns. Let me check:\n\nColumns are: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, result. So in row 2: he was nominated for Oros and got a honorable mention (won). In row 3: same Oros, but category is Best Actor in a Supporting Role, which if that's the FAMAS, then perhaps it's correct. But the award giving body is Golden Screen Awards, not FAMAS.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Claim says Kristofer got two honorable mentions at Long Island Film Expo for Best Support Actor in Oros.\n- According to row 2: he did get one (honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor).\n- The claim says he won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at FAMAS, but according to the table, in 2013, there's no such win; row 6 is about 2012.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Part 1: Only one honorable mention, not two.\n- Part 2: No win at FAMAS in 2013 as per the table.\n\nSo both parts are incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to map which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be row 2 (for the first part) and any row that could support the second part, but since there's none for FAMAS in 2013, perhaps only row 2 is relevant. However, the claim mentions two honorable mentions, so if I'm considering that as a point to check, then both rows 2 and maybe another row, but looking at the table, it seems only one exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the table, but based on what's given, only row 2 is relevant for the first part (honorable mention) and no row supports the second part (winning Best Actor at FAMAS).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim says:\n\n- 2013\n- Two honorable mentions at Long Island Film Expo\n- Win Best Actor in Supporting Role at FAMAS\n\nLooking for cells:\n\nFor the first point: row 2 is relevant.\n\nFor the second point: no row supports a win at FAMAS in 2013. So both parts are incorrect, but only row 2 supports part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the cells to highlight would be row 2 (for the honorable mention) and perhaps none for the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if the user is referring to multiple awards, maybe rows 2 and another, but from what's given, it's just row 2.\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\n- The first part of the claim is incorrect because there's only one honorable mention.\n- The second part is incorrect because he didn't win Best Actor at FAMAS in 2013 as per the table.\n- Thus, the entire statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the task is to identify which cells are relevant for this analysis. Since the claim references specific awards and their results, the relevant rows would be where Kristofer was awarded or nominated for these categories. So row 2 (for the honorable mention) and potentially row 6 if there's confusion about FAMAS.\n\nBut since the second part is incorrect, perhaps only row 2 is needed.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the claim made about Kristofer's awards in 2013 and identifying which table cells are relevant to this analysis. Based on the provided data, the following points were considered:\n\n1. **First Part of the Claim**: Kristofer received two honorable mentions for Best Supporting Actor for \"Oros\" at the Long Island Film Expo.\n   - Only one such mention is documented in Row 2 of the table.\n\n2. **Second Part of the Claim**: Kristofer won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for \"Oros\" at the FAMAS Awards in 2013.\n   - No such win is documented in the provided data; Row 6 refers to an award from 2012, not 2013.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claim is false because only one honorable mention was awarded and no win at FAMAS in 2013 is supported by the data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 2**: Provides information about the single honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor at the Long Island Film Expo.\n  \n**Answer**: The claim is incorrect based on the provided data. Only Row 2 supports part of the claim, and no relevant row supports the second part. Therefore, the entire statement is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe claim is incorrect as it contains inaccuracies regarding the number of honorable mentions and the specific award win. Only one honorable mention for Best Supporting Actor is documented in Row 2, and there's no evidence of a win at FAMAS in 2013.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about Kristofer Martin is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"Kristofer Martin have been nominate for 7 best actor award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award.\" So I need to check if there's any data in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table rows, I see that the years are 2012 and 2013. The claim mentions both years, so I should look for Kristofer Martin's nominations in these years.\n\nEach row has the following columns: year, award giving body, category, nominated for, result. I'm particularly interested in the \"nominated for\" column since the claim talks about being nominated for awards.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1 (2013): Award is Stand Out Season Performer, but Kristofer isn't mentioned here. Maybe not relevant.\n\nRow 2 (2013): This is the 16th Long Island International Film Expo. The category is Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, and he was nominated but won. Wait, does this mean he was nominated? So that's one nomination in 2013.\n\nRow 4 (2012): From the Young Critics Circle Awards, category Best Performance, nominated for OROS. But it doesn't specify the award category as Best Actor, so not sure if it's a best actor award.\n\nRow 5 (2012): Nominated for New Movie Actor of the Year, which is a specific acting category. So that's one nomination in 2012.\n\nRow 6 (2012): This is Famas Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. He won this, but it doesn't specify if he was nominated for Best Actor or something else.\n\nRow 7 (2012): Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, category Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching. Not an acting award, so irrelevant here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The claim is about \"best actor awards.\" So looking specifically for categories that are Best Actor or similar.\n\nRow 3 (2013): Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in Supporting Role. He was nominated and won. That's one more nomination in 2013.\n\nSo from the table, I see two nominations:\n\n- In 2012: Row 5 (New Movie Actor of the Year) and possibly Row 4 if it's for a best performance that could be akin to acting awards.\n- In 2013: Row 2 (Honorable Mention Best Supporting Actor) and Row 3 (Best Actor in Supporting Role).\n\nWait, but the claim says \"7 best actor awards\" between 2012-2013. The table only shows two (Rows 2,3,4,5). But maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\nRow 1: Not acting award.\nRow 2: Acting, supporting.\nRow 3: Acting, supporting.\nRow 4: Best performance \u2013 unclear if it's acting.\nRow 5: New Movie Actor \u2013 likely acting.\nRow 6: Not acting.\nRow 7: Not acting.\n\nSo perhaps only Rows 2,3,5 are for acting awards. That would be three nominations in total across both years. The claim mentions seven, so that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let's list all the rows where \"nominated for\" is an award:\n\nRow 2: nominated for OROS (Best Supporting Actor).\nRow 3: nominated for OROS (Best Actor in Supporting Role).\nRow 4: nominated for OROS (Best Performance) \u2013 if Best Performance is equivalent to acting, that's another.\nRow 5: nominated for Tween Academy: Class of 2012 \u2013 which might be an acting award.\n\nSo four nominations total? The claim says seven, so that doesn't match. Also, the result column shows he won two awards (Rows 2 and 3), and Rows 4 and 5 were nominated but didn't win. Row 6: won, but not an acting award.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"win 4 of those awards.\" Let's count the wins:\n\nRow 2: Won.\nRow 3: Won.\nRow 6: Won (but it's not a Best Actor award).\nSo only two acting-related wins.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because he didn't have seven nominations for Best Actor awards, and he didn't win four of them. He won two non-Best-Actor awards and two acting awards.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"7 best actor award\" between 2012-2013. But from the table, there are only a few acting-related awards:\n\nRow 2: Best Supporting Actor (1)\nRow 3: Best Actor in Supporting Role (1)\nRow 4: Best Performance \u2013 if acting (1)\nRow 5: New Movie Actor of the Year (1)\n\nThat's four nominations across two years. So he was nominated for four best actor awards, not seven. Also, he only won two of them (Rows 2 and 3), so winning four is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about an award win by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 is based on a nomination for a specific show. The claim says that all of the award wins were based on nominations for a specific show.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. The table has rows from 2012 and 2013 with various award details. Each row includes the year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Kristofer Martin's awards between these years. So I need to identify which rows pertain to him. Looking at the \"nominated for\" column, I see entries like \"none,\" \"oros,\" \"tween academy : class of 2012,\" and others that say \"n/a.\" It seems like \"oros\" might be a typo or shorthand for \"Outstanding Performance,\" which is often associated with Kristofer Martin.\n\nI should check each relevant row to see if the award was based on a nomination. For example, in Row 1, year 2013, category is \"stand out season performer,\" but it says \"result: nominated.\" Since the result isn't a win, this might not be relevant unless the claim refers only to wins.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim is about whether all award wins by Kristofer Martin are based on specific show nominations. So I need rows where he won awards and see what they were nominated for.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 2: He got an honorable mention in 2013 from the Long Island Film Expo for Best Supporting Actor, nominated for \"oros.\" Result is win.\nRow 3: He won Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Golden Screen Awards in 2013, also for \"oros.\"\nRow 6: In 2012, he won the Famas Award's German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, and it was nominated for \"n/a.\"\nRow 7: He won Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching in 2012 from the Party Pilipinas Awards.\n\nSo these are his wins. Now, check what each was based on. The claim says all are based on a specific show's nomination.\n\nLooking at Row 6: \"nominated for\" is \"n/a,\" which might mean not applicable or not listed here. So maybe that one doesn't require checking because it's unclear.\n\nRow 7's award is for Most Liked Loveteam, which could be related to a specific show. If the Loveteam is with Joyce Ching, perhaps the show in question is something they were part of together.\n\nRows 2 and 3: Both are for \"oros,\" which I think stands for Outstanding Performance or similar. If these nominations are based on specific shows, then the claim would be correct if all his wins are due to being nominated for those shows.\n\nBut wait, in Row 6, it's a different award category\u2014youth achievement versus acting categories. So maybe that's based on a different metric rather than a specific show.\n\nHowever, the claim is about whether all of the award wins are based on nominations for a specific show. If Kristofer was nominated for \"oros\" in each of his winning categories, then perhaps it's tied to a particular show each time.\n\nBut I don't have information about what \"specific show\" refers to. It could be that in 2012 and 2013, the shows he was part of were different, so maybe each award is based on different specific shows.\n\nAlternatively, if \"oros\" consistently refers to his role in a single show, then all wins would be based on that show's nomination.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say definitively. However, since the claim is about all of them being based on a specific show, I need to check each relevant row where he won to see if they were nominated for a specific show.\n\nIn Row 2: nominated for \"oros\"\u2014if that's tied to a specific show.\nRow 3: same as above.\nRow 6: \"n/a\" so maybe not relevant.\nRow 7: nominated for \"n/a,\" but he won, and it's unclear.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Rows 2, 3, 6, and 7. However, since Row 6's \"nominated for\" is \"n/a,\" it might not provide useful info. Similarly, Row 7's is also \"n/a.\" So maybe only Rows 2 and 3 are relevant.\n\nBut wait, the claim says all of his award wins are based on a specific show's nomination. If in both 2012 and 2013, he was nominated for \"oros\" (which might be the same show), then those would be tied to that show. However, Row 6 is a different category and possibly a different show.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all his wins are based on being nominated by a specific organization or body rather than a specific show. The claim says \"specific show,\" so it's about the content of the nomination, not the awarding body.\n\nI think I need to focus only on the rows where he won awards and check if each was based on a specific show's nomination.\n\nSo Rows 2,3,6,7 are his wins. For each:\n\nRow 2: nominated for \"oros\"\u2014if this is tied to a specific show, then yes.\nRow 3: same as above.\nRow 6: \"n/a\" but maybe it's based on a specific show not listed here.\nRow 7: Same.\n\nWithout more info on what \"specific show\" refers to, it's hard. But the claim says all of them are based on nominations for that specific show. So if in each case he was nominated for that show's performance, then true; otherwise, false.\n\nSince I can't confirm the exact shows, maybe only Rows 2 and 3 where \"oros\" is the nomination. If they were both for the same show, then it's TRUE, but since I don't know, perhaps it's FALSE because not all have specific shows mentioned.\n\nWait, but Row 6 and 7 are wins but with \"n/a\" in nominated for. So if those awards weren't based on any nomination, then the claim is false because not all were based on a specific show's nomination.\n\nTherefore, since some of his award wins (Rows 6 and 7) don't have a specific show listed as the reason for nomination, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all of Kristofer Martin's awards between 2012 and 2013 were based on nominations for a specific show. However, examining the table:\n\n- Rows 2 and 3 (2013) indicate \"oros\" as the nominated category, which might relate to specific shows.\n- Rows 6 and 7 (2012) have \"n/a\" in the nominated field, indicating no specific show is mentioned.\n\nSince not all award wins are tied to a specific show's nomination, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nominated_for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"all of kristofer martin's award nomination be for his performance in oros.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row related to Kristoffer Martin. From the table, I see that the rows are numbered from 0 to 7. Wait, no, looking back, the user provided rows as Row 1 to Row 7, but in the JSON example, they started counting from 0. So I need to clarify: in the table, the first row is year 2013 and award giving body is 1st Sunday All Stars Awards. Let me list out each row properly.\n\nWait, the user's table starts with Row 1 as 2013, but when processing, maybe it's better to index them starting from 0 for easier handling in code, though since we're doing this manually, I'll refer to them as rows numbered 1 to 7 as per the table. Alternatively, perhaps the row indices are 0-based? The example given by the user shows row_index: 0 and 1, so probably yes.\n\nBut actually, looking at the claim, it's about Kristofer Martin's award nominations. So I need to check each row where the award giving body or category mentions him, especially if his name is there.\n\nWait, in the table provided, the \"awardee\" seems to be a person, and their name isn't directly listed. The columns are year, award giving body, category, nominated for, and result. So I need to see if any of these rows are about Kristofer Martin's nominations where he was recognized for his performance in oros.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Year 2013, award body: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, category: Stand Out Season Performer, nominated for: none. So no nomination here because it says 'none', and result is 'nominated' but not clear on what he was nominated for.\n\nWait, actually, the \"result\" might refer to whether he won or was nominated. But in this row, since the category is Stand Out Season Performer and he was nominated (since result is 'nominated'), but the nominated for column says 'none'. So maybe he was a nominee without any specific nomination? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's that he didn't have a specific nomination in this case.\n\nRow 2: 2013, Long Island International Film Expo, Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, nominated for Oros. So here, the category is supporting actor and he was nominated for Oros, and he won. So here, his award is for performance in Oros.\n\nRow 3: 2013, Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, nominated for Oros, result: won. Again, similar to Row 2, the category is supporting actor, nominated for Oros, so this is another instance where he was recognized for his performance in Oros and he won.\n\nRow 4: 2012, Young Critics Circle Awards, Best Performance, nominated for Oros. This seems like it's about a performance, but I don't know if it's specifically Orus or something else. Since the category is 'best performance' and he was nominated for Oros, perhaps this is another relevant row.\n\nRow 5: 2012, PMP Star Awards, New Movie Actor of the Year, nominated for Tween Academy: Class of 2012. So here, his nomination is not for Orus but for a different project. So this doesn't support the claim.\n\nRow 6: 2012, Famas Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, nominated for 'n/a', result won. Since it's 'n/a' in the nominated for column, I don't know what he was nominated for here. Maybe it's an award that doesn't require a nomination? Not sure if this is related.\n\nRow 7: 2012, Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, category: Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching, nominated for 'n/a', result won. Again, 'n/a' in the nominated for column. So likely, he was part of a team that was awarded, but not specifically for Orus.\n\nSo now, looking at the claim: all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in Oros.\n\nFrom the table, I see that:\n\n- Row 2 (2013): He was nominated and won for Best Supporting Actor in Oros.\n- Row 3 (2013): Similar to Row 2, he won for Best Supporting Actor in Oros.\n- Row 4 (2012): Nominated for Best Performance in Oros.\n- Rows 5,6,7: His nominations were not for Oros but for other things.\n\nSo the claim is about all his nominations. But from the table, some of his award nominations were indeed for Oros (Rows 2,3,4), while others were not (Rows 5,6,7). Therefore, not all of his award nominations were for Oros.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"all of Kristofer Martin's award nomination be for his performance in oros.\" So does that mean every single one of his award nominations was for Oros? From the table, that's not true because there are some where he was nominated for other things (Rows 5,6,7). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if any rows mention Kristofer Martin by name. Looking at the table, the \"nominated for\" and \"result\" columns don't list names; they list categories or things like 'none', 'oros', 'Tween Academy: Class of 2012', etc. So there's no direct mention of his name in the table. Therefore, I can't confirm if any of these are actually his awards.\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether all of his award nominations were for Oros. Since the table doesn't specify that he was specifically nominated for Oros, but shows some as Orus and others not, it's unclear. But based on the columns given, the 'nominated for' column in Rows 2,3,4 indicate Orus, while other rows don't. So not all are for Oros.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if any of the award categories explicitly mention Orus. Wait, no\u2014the 'category' column is like \"stand out season performer\", \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\", etc., and in Rows 2 and 3, it's Best Supporting Actor, which might relate to a performance in Oros. However, without his name being listed, I can't be certain.\n\nWait, the claim says 'Kristofer Martin', so maybe he is the awardee, but since the table doesn't list names, perhaps it's about award nominations regardless of the person's name. So if any row has \"nominated for: oros\", then that counts as an award nomination for Oros.\n\nIn Rows 2 and 3, he was nominated for Orus and won in both cases, so those are two award nominations for Oros. Row 4 also says he was nominated for Orus but the result is 'nominated', meaning he didn't win it. So that's a third nomination for Orus.\n\nRows 5,6,7: In these rows, his nominated for columns say \" Tween Academy: Class of 2012\" and 'n/a'. So not Orus.\n\nTherefore, out of all the award nominations listed in the table (Rows 2,3,4,5,6,7), only Rows 2,3,4 are for Orus. Hence, not all his award nominations were for Oros. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe task requires evaluating whether all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were specifically for \"Orus.\" Based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Rows 2 and 3 (2013):** He was nominated for and won awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, which likely relates to his performance in \"Orus.\"\n2. **Row 4 (2012):** He was nominated for Best Performance, also possibly related to \"Orus.\"\n3. **Rows 5, 6, and 7:** His nominations were for other projects or awards, not mentioned as \"Orus.\"\n\nSince the table indicates that only some of his award nominations were for \"Orus,\" it concludes that not all of his award nominations were for this specific project.\n\n**Answer: False**",
