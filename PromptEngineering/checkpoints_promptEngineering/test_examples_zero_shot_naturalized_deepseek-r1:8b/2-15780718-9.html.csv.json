    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy with a rebound count of 14, specifically against Miami. The key points here are that both players had at least 14 rebounds in a game where their team played against Miami. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. Each game has several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, etc. I need to focus on the \"high rebounds\" column for each relevant row and check if Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy are listed with 14 rebounds in any game where their team played against Miami.\n\nSo, my first step is to identify all the games where the opposing team was Miami. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 5: Game 77, date April 8, team: Miami\n- Row 9: Game 81, date April 15, team: Miami\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again: the 'team' column shows which team is playing on that row. So for example, in Row 1, the team is Detroit, and they played against someone else. So I need to find rows where the opposing team is Miami.\n\nLooking at each row's team:\n\nRow 5: team is Miami, so the game was Miami vs someone else (opponent is probably New Jersey or another team).\nRow 9: team is Miami as well.\n\nWait, actually, in Row 5, the team is Miami, and in Row 9, the team is Miami again. So I need to find if any of these games had Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy with a rebound count of 14.\n\nLet me check each relevant game:\n\nStarting with Row 5 (game 77):\n\n- Team: Miami\n- High rebounds: Michael Bradley (8), Jelani McCoy (9). Neither has 14 rebounds. So that's not the case.\n\nRow 9 (game 81):\n\n- Team: Miami\n- High rebounds: Jerome Williams (17). No mention of Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy with 14 rebounds here either.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14)\", so perhaps they're referring to two players each having at least 14 rebounds in a single game against Miami. Or maybe that together they have the highest combined rebounds.\n\nLooking back, in Row 5:\n\n- Michael Bradley has 8 rebounds\n- Jelani McCoy has 9 rebounds\nTotal: 17\n\nIn any other games where they played against Miami, do their rebounds reach 14? Let me check if there are more games against Miami.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows. Let me list all the games and see which teams are playing against whom:\n\nRow 1: Detroit vs ?\nRow 2: Detroit vs ?\nRow 3: San Antonio vs ?\nRow 4: New Jersey vs ?\nRow 5: Miami vs ?\nRow 6: Orlando vs ?\nRow 7: Milwaukee vs ?\nRow 8: New Jersey vs ?\nRow 9: Miami vs ?\nRow 10: Cleveland vs ?\n\nWait, I think the 'location' column shows where each game was held. For example, Row 5 has location attendance at American Airlines Arena, which is in Miami. So if the team's home is Miami, their opponent would be another team.\n\nBut to find games against Miami, I need to see when the opposing team is Miami. Wait, no: each row lists the home team. So for example, Row 5 has team: Miami, so that game was played at American Airlines Arena (home of Miami). The opponent would have been Detroit or another team.\n\nBut I'm trying to find any game where Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy both had 14 rebounds against Miami as the opposing team.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for games where the home team is Miami. So, in Row 5: Miami (home) vs someone else. If either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy was with the away team playing at Miami and had 14 rebounds, that would be a game against Miami.\n\nAlternatively, if they were on the home team (Miami), but looking for them to have 14 rebounds when playing against Miami themselves? That doesn't make much sense because they can't play against themselves. So likely, they are part of the away team when Miami is the home team.\n\nSo I need to find any game where Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy, as part of the away team, had 14 rebounds against Miami at their home arena.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 5: Game 77, Miami (home), high rebounds: Michael Bradley (8), Jelani McCoy (9). So they were on the home team and had 8 and 9 rebounds respectively. Since it's their own game, I don't think they would have opponents with 14.\n\nIf they were on the away team, then perhaps in a game where Miami is the home team, the away team players might have high rebounds. But looking at other rows:\n\nRow 5: Home team is Miami, so the away team is someone else (not listed as 'team' column). So maybe the away team is another team, and if any of their players had 14 rebounds against Miami, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, the claim is about Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy having 14 rebounds against Miami. So perhaps in a game where they were playing against Miami (away), and either of them had 14 rebounds. Or both did.\n\nLooking through all the games where Miami is the home team:\n\nRow 5: high rebounds for away team? No, because the 'high rebounds' column probably refers to the home team's players.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the table works. Let me check an example:\n\nIn Row 1: Detroit (team) had high rebounds of Jalen Reynolds (14). So that row is about Detroit playing as home or away? The location for Row 1 is Pistons DOME, which is Detroit's home arena, so they are the home team.\n\nSo in Row 5, the location is American Airlines Arena, which is Miami's home, so the home team is Miami. Therefore, high rebounds would be from Miami players, not the away team.\n\nWait, that changes things. So in Row 5:\n\n- Team: Miami (home)\n- High rebounds: Michael Bradley (8), Jelani McCoy (9). So these are Miami's players' stats when playing at home.\n\nSo if someone is on the away team, their stats aren't listed as 'high rebounds' because that's for the home team. Therefore, to find cases where either Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy had 14 rebounds against Miami (as the home team), they would have been part of the away team in such games.\n\nLooking through all rows where the away team might be someone else:\n\nFor example, Row 1: Detroit (home) vs someone. So high rebounds are from Detroit players.\n\nRow 5: Miami (home) vs someone else, so high rebounds are Miami's players.\n\nSo to find a game where Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy were on the away team against Miami, their stats wouldn't be listed in the 'high rebounds' column of that row. Therefore, perhaps there is no such game in the table where they have 14 rebounds against Miami as the home team.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim says they \"have the highest rebound\" which could mean either or both having at least 14 rebounds in a single game against Miami.\n\nLooking through all games:\n\nCheck each row for any mention of Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy with 14 rebounds when their team played against Miami.\n\nIn Row 5: They have 8 and 9, respectively.\n\nOther rows don't list them as having high rebounds.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any game where the home team is Miami, and either player had 14 rebounds. Since in such games, the home team's players are listed with their stats, but the away team's aren't.\n\nSo if Michael Bradley was on the away team against Miami, his stats wouldn't be listed as 'high rebounds' for that game. Therefore, perhaps there is no evidence of them having 14 rebounds against Miami in any game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that they both had 14 in a single game against Miami, regardless of being home or away. But looking through the table, I don't see any such instance.\n\nSo based on this, it seems like the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is not supported by the information in the provided table. After reviewing each relevant game and checking for high rebounds from Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy when their team played against Miami, no instance where they achieved 14 rebounds was found.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nFALSE",
