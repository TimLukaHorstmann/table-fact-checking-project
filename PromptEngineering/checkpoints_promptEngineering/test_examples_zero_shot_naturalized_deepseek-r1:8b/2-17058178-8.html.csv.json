    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim that \"the Blazers have a record of 9 - 5 during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should look at each row in the table and see if it contains information related to the Blazers' record during this period.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that the games are listed from game 33 up to game 46, covering multiple dates in January. The Blazers are playing against various teams like the Lakers, Detroit, Golden State, etc. Each row includes details like the date, opponent, score, high points, rebounds, location attendance, and the team's record after that game.\n\nI'm trying to find a row where the Blazers have a 9-5 record. Since the games start from game 33 onwards, I'll check each row sequentially. \n\nGame 33: Blazers play on January 2. The record listed is 20 - 13. So not 9-5.\n\nGame 34: They play on January 4. The record after this game would be 20 - 14.\n\nGame 35: January 7, the record becomes 21 - 14.\n\nGame 36: On January 10, the record is now 22 - 14.\n\nGame 37: January 12, the record goes to 23 - 14.\n\nGame 38: On January 14, it's 23 - 15.\n\nGame 39: January 15, the Blazers win and their record becomes 24 - 15.\n\nGame 40: January 17, they lose again, making it 24 - 16.\n\nGame 41: On January 19, they win with a record of 25 - 16.\n\nGame 42: They lose on January 21, so the record drops to 25 - 17.\n\nGame 43: January 24, another win brings their record to 26 - 17.\n\nGame 44: January 26, they win again, making it 27 - 17.\n\nGame 45: On January 28, against Charlotte, the Blazers win and their record becomes 28 - 17.\n\nGame 46: Finally, on January 31, they win with a final record of 29 - 17.\n\nWait, but all these records are either in the high 20s or low 30s. The claim is about a 9-5 record, which would be much lower than what's shown here. Since none of the rows have a 9-5 record, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe Blazers' records in each game during this stretch range from 20-13 up to 29-17, never reaching 9-5.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 39, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 42, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 46, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}",

Let me go through each row and check if Brandon Roy was the top scorer.\n\nStarting with Row 1: January 2 vs New Orleans. High points are Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez with 19, not Brandon.\nRow 2: January 4 vs LA Lakers. Top scorer is Lamarcus Aldridge with 22, so no.\nRow 3: January 7 vs Detroit. High points by Aldridge again at 26.\nRow 4: January 10 vs Golden State. Aldridge scores 26 here as well.\nRow 5: January 12 vs Chicago. Travis Outlaw leads with 33 points, not Brandon.\nRow 6: January 14 vs Philadelphia. Brandon scores 27, but let me check others. High rebounds are both Aldridge and Przybilla at 9. So points-wise, he's the leader here.\nRow 7: January 15 vs New Jersey. Brandon gets 29, which is higher than others.\nRow 8: January 17 vs Charlotte. High scorer is Aldridge with 21.\nRow 9: January 19 vs Milwaukee. Greg Oden leads with 24 points.\nRow 10: January 21 vs Cleveland. Brandi Roy scores 23, but let me see if anyone else has higher. The high rebounds are Przybilla at 15, but for points, it's Brandon at 23, and others like Oden have lower.\nRow 11: January 24 vs Washington. Brandon with 22 points, others like Aldridge have less.\nRow 12: January 26 vs LA Clippers. High scorer is Brandon with 33.\nRow 13: January 28 vs Charlotte. Aldridge leads with 25.\nRow 14: January 31 vs Utah. Brandon scores 30.\n\nLooking through each game, it seems that Brandon Roy was the top scorer in multiple games, but there are several where he wasn't. For example, Row 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 13 all have someone else as the high scorer.

The claim says: \"joel pryzbilla have more rebound in 1 game (17) than any other blazer player.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for Joel Przybilla's rebound numbers in the table. Let me scan each row's high rebounds column.\n\nLooking at Row 14, game 46 against Utah: high rebounds are listed as Joel Przybilla with 17. That's the highest number I've seen so far from any Blazers player in a single game during this period.\n\nNow, checking if any other Blazers players have higher rebounds in any of their games. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: High rebounds by Aldridge (10)\n- Row 2: High rebounds by Aldridge (11)\n- Row 3: Przybilla (7), but wait, no\u2014no one else is higher than 17 yet.\n- Row 4: Oden (8)\n- Row 5: Oden (13)\n- Row 6: Aldridge and Przybilla tie at 9\n- Row 7: Przybilla (11)\n- Row 8: Przybilla (10)\n- Row 9: Oden (15)\n- Row 10: Przybilla (15)\n- Row 11: Oden (14)\n- Row 12: Przybilla (8)\n- Row 13: Oden (14)\n- Row 14: Przybilla (17)\n\nSo, in all the games listed, Joel's highest rebound is 17.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the lowest attendance figure for any game be 13824.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that across all the games listed in the table, the smallest number of attendees is 13,824. To verify this, I'll need to look at each game's attendance and find the minimum value.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: Attendance is 20,708\nRow 2: 18,997\nRow 3: 20,644\nRow 4: 20,687\nRow 5: 18,996\nRow 6: 14,561\nRow 7: 13,824\nRow 8: 17,482\nRow 9: 20,580\nRow 10: 20,632\nRow 11: 20,566\nRow 12: 16,570\nRow 13: 20,380\nRow 14: 20,593\n\nNow, I'll list out all these numbers to find the lowest one. Starting from the highest, but actually I should look for the smallest. The numbers are:\n\n20,708; 18,997; 20,644; 20,687; 18,996; 14,561; 13,824; 17,482; 20,580; 20,632; 20,566; 16,570; 20,380; 20,593.\n\nComparing these, the smallest number is 13,824. That's in Row 7. So the claim says that this is the lowest attendance figure for any game. Looking at all other attendances, none are lower than 13,824. \n\nWait, I should double-check if there's a smaller number somewhere else. Let me go through each row again quickly:\n\nRow 1: 20k+, Row2: ~19k, Row3: ~20k, Row4: ~20k, Row5: ~19k, Row6: ~14k, which is less than 13k? Wait, no, Row7 is 13,824. So Row6 has 14,561, which is higher than 13,824 but lower than others. Wait, no, 14k is higher than 13k, so the lowest remains 13,824.\n\nWait, wait. Let me correct that: Row6's attendance is 14,561, which is higher than 13,824, so it doesn't affect the minimum. So yes, the smallest attendance is indeed in Row7 at 13,824.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there is a game with 13,824 attendees and all other games have higher or equal attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe lowest attendance figure across all games in the table is 13,824, which occurs in Row 7. This confirms that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that Brandon Roy never led his team in rebounds during any of the games listed.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to see if there's any instance where Brandon Roy is the leader in rebounds. Each row represents a game with various details like the date, opponent, score, and high rebounds.\n\nStarting from Row 1: The high rebounds are by Lamarcus Aldridge with 10.

Still not Brandon Roy.\n\nRow 4: Greg Oden has 8 rebounds. Not Brandon Roy.\n\nRow 5: Greg Oden again leads with 13 rebounds. So, no.\n\nRow 6: The high rebounds are shared between Lamarcus Aldridge and Joel Przybilla at 9 each. No Brandon Roy.\n\nRow 7: Joel Przybilla has 11 rebounds. Not Brandon Roy.\n\nRow 8: High rebounds by Joel Przybilla with 10. So, no.\n\nRow 9: Greg Oden leads with 15 rebounds. Not Brandon Roy.\n\nRow 10: High rebounds are Joel Przybilla at 15.

No Brandon Roy involved.\n\nWait a minute, but I should also check if in any row, the \"high rebounds\" column lists Brandon Roy as the leader. From my initial scan, none of them do.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"brandon roy scored the fewest points of any other player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find all the players who have points listed. The table has multiple rows (from 1 to 14), and in each row, there's a \"high points\" column that lists the player with the highest points for that game. However, the claim is about Brandon Roy scoring the fewest points compared to other players, so I need to see how his points compare across all games.\n\nWait a minute\u2014actually, the table only provides the high points and high rebounds for each game. It doesn't list all the players who scored in each game or their total points across games. So, if the claim is about Brandon Roy's total points being the fewest compared to others, we don't have enough information because the table doesn't show other players' points.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim refers to each individual game where Brandon Roy played and whether he scored fewer points than all others in that game. Let me check the games where Brandon Roy was involved.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 6: He scored 27 points.\n- Row 7: He scored 29 points.\n- Row 11: He scored 22 points.\n- Row 12: He scored 33 points.\n- Row 13: Not mentioned, but since it's about high points, he didn't lead that game.\n- Row 14: He scored 30 points.\n\nWait, the rows don't all list him as the high scorer. For example, in Row 6, his 27 is listed as high points, so others didn't score more than him in that game. Similarly, Row 7: 29 (high), etc.\n\nBut the claim says he scored the fewest among other players. So if we look at each game where Brandon Roy played, whether he had the least points among all players in that game. Since high points are listed, but not all players' points, it's impossible to know how many others scored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about his total points across games. But without cumulative data, we can't compare totals either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The table only shows per-game stats for high points and rebounds, but not all players' stats. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether Brandon Roy scored fewer points than any other player because the table doesn't provide complete information on all players in each game.\n\nSo, the claim can't be verified as TRUE based solely on this data.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"brandon roy score the fewest point of any other player,\" we need to check if Brandon Roy's points are the lowest compared to others in each game he played.

So, let's add up the wins and losses separately.\n\nStarting from Row 1 (20-13): Wins = 20, Losses =13\nRow 2: 20-14 \u2192 W=20, L=14\nRow3:21-14\u2192W=21,L=14\nRow4:22-14\u2192W=22,L=14\nRow5:23-14\u2192W=23,L=14\nRow6:23-15\u2192W=23,L=15\nRow7:24-15\u2192W=24,L=15\nRow8:24-16\u2192W=24,L=16\nRow9:25-16\u2192W=25,L=16\nRow10:25-17\u2192W=25,L=17\nRow11:26-17\u2192W=26,L=17\nRow12:27-17\u2192W=27,L=17\nRow13:28-17\u2192W=28,L=17\nRow14:29-17\u2192W=29,L=17\n\nNow, summing up all wins and losses:\n\nWins: 20 +20+21+22+23+23+24+24+25+25+26+27+28+29 = Let me add step by step.\n\nStarting from Row1 to Row14:\n\nRow1:20 \u2192 total W=20\nRow2:20 \u2192 total W=40\nRow3:21 \u2192 61\nRow4:22 \u219283\nRow5:23\u2192106\nRow6:23\u2192129\nRow7:24\u2192153\nRow8:24\u2192177\nRow9:25\u2192202\nRow10:25\u2192227\nRow11:26\u2192253\nRow12:27\u2192280\nRow13:28\u2192308\nRow14:29\u2192337\n\nSo total wins over 14 games: 337.\n\nNow, summing up losses:\n\nEach row's L is as follows:\nRow1:13 \u2192 total L=13\nRow2:14\u219227\nRow3:14\u219241\nRow4:14\u219255\nRow5:14\u219269\nRow6:15\u219284\nRow7:15\u219299\nRow8:16\u2192115\nRow9:16\u2192131\nRow10:17\u2192148\nRow11:17\u2192165\nRow12:17\u2192182\nRow13:17\u2192199\nRow14:17\u2192216\n\nTotal losses over 14 games: 216.\n\nSo, total wins =337, total losses=216. Wait, that can't be right because each game is either a win or a loss, so the sum of W and L for 14 games should be equal to 14*2=28? No, wait no, each game contributes one win or one loss. So actually, wins + losses per row equals (win-loss), which can't exceed 1. But in reality, each row is a single game result, so the total wins and losses across all games should be equal to the number of games played.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Each row represents one game, so for each row, either W or L increases by 1. Therefore, over 14 rows, total W + L should equal 14. However, in my initial approach, I was adding up all wins and losses across all games as if each game contributes multiple wins/losses, which is incorrect.\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Each row is a single game, so for each row, the team either won or lost. Therefore, over 14 games, total W + L =14. But in my earlier calculation, I was adding up all Ws and Ls as if each game contributes multiple times, which is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the table structure. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the table, each row represents a single game, with columns like 'Opponent', 'Location', 'Result', etc. The 'Record' column shows the team's overall record after that game. So for example, after Row1 (game 33), their record is 20-13, meaning they've won 20 games and lost 13 so far in the season up to that point.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"this stretch\" which I think refers to these 14 consecutive games (from game 33 to 46). So the claim is about how many wins and losses they have in this specific 14-game period. Therefore, I need to check each of these rows (1-14) and sum up their W and L within this stretch.\n\nBut wait, no. Each row's 'Record' shows their cumulative record after that game, not just within the stretch. So if I take each row's W-L from 33 onwards, I can only compare the starting point and ending point to see net wins or losses in this period, but that might require more data.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to the entire season up to each game, so the 'Record' column shows their overall standing after each game. So to check \"this stretch\", which is games 33-46, we need to compare their win-loss record from the start of this stretch (after game 32) to after game 46.\n\nBut without knowing the prior records before game 33, it's difficult. Alternatively, if \"this stretch\" refers to the 14 games starting from game 33, then each row represents a single game result, so each row would have either W or L for that specific game.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each row as a game played during this stretch and count how many wins and losses they have in these 14 games. But since the 'Record' column is their overall record after each game, not just within the stretch, it's tricky to extract the number of wins and losses specifically during this period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that \"this stretch\" refers to all games from row1 (game33) up to row14 (game46). So for each row in 1-14, I can note whether their win-loss count within this stretch is fewer wins or more losses compared to before.\n\nWait, but without knowing the previous records, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps \"this stretch\" refers to all games from game33 to game46, and we need to see if during these 14 games, they have fewer wins than losses.\n\nBut each of these rows (1-14) is a single game result, so each would contribute either +1 W or +1 L. Therefore, over 14 games, the total number of Ws and Ls would be equal to 14, but that's not meaningful because they can't have more losses than wins unless they lost all.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The claim is that during this stretch, the Blazers have fewer wins and more losses. So if in these 14 games, they won less than half and lost more than half, then it's TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, since each game is either a win or loss, let me look at each row from 1 to 14 and see how many Ws and Ls there are in the 'Record' column.\n\nBut wait, that's their overall record up to that point. So for example, after Row1 (game33), they have 20-13, which might not necessarily reflect only the games in this stretch.\n\nI think I need more information or a different approach. Perhaps the user wants to compare their performance during this stretch to before and after, but without prior data, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"this stretch\" refers to all games from Row1 to Row14, which are 14 consecutive games (game33-game46). In that case, each row is a single game, so they have either W or L. Therefore, the total number of Ws and Ls in these 14 games would determine if there are fewer wins than losses.\n\nBut without knowing each individual result (W/L), we can't count them directly from the 'Record' column because that shows overall season stats.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the table. Maybe the 'Record' column is their standing after that particular game, so for each game in this stretch, they have either a W or L, and over 14 games, the total wins and losses can be counted.\n\nBut to do that, we'd need to know whether each game resulted in a win or loss, which isn't directly provided by the 'Record' column. The 'Record' shows their overall record, not just for this stretch.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to look at the difference between their current record and previous record before this stretch started, but that would require knowing prior records.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the best way is to assume that \"this stretch\" refers to these 14 games (rows1-14), each being a single game result. Therefore, we need to count how many wins and losses they have in these 14 games.\n\nBut since we don't have W/L data for individual games, perhaps it's implied that the 'Record' shows their standing after each game, so we can infer whether each game was a win or loss based on the change from the previous row.\n\nFor example, if after Row1 (game33), they have 20-13, and before that, say they had 19-12. Then, game33 resulted in a win because their record improved to 20-13.\n\nSimilarly, for each subsequent row, we can see whether their record increased in wins or decreased in losses, indicating a W or L for that game.\n\nSo let's try that approach:\n\nStarting from Row1 (game33), assuming prior to this stretch they had a certain record. But without knowing the prior, maybe we need to assume that the first row of this stretch is after game32, but since we don't have data before that, perhaps we can only look at the progression.\n\nBut it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the user means that in these 14 games, they have fewer wins than losses overall, meaning more Ls than Ws.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\nWe need to count how many times their record improved in W or L during these 14 games.\n\nFrom Row1 (game33): Record is 20-13. Let's assume prior to this stretch, they had X-Y.\n\nBut without knowing X and Y, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps we can look at the change from Row1 to Row2, etc., to see if each game was a W or L.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nRow1: 20-13 (after game33)\nRow2: Suppose after game34, their record is 21-12 (implying they won game34)\nRow3: After game35, 22-10 (win again)\nAnd so on, if each subsequent row shows an increase in Ws or a decrease in Ls, that would indicate a win.\n\nBut without knowing the exact progression, it's difficult to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look at the difference between consecutive rows:\n\nIf from Row1 to Row2, their wins increased by 1, that's a W for game34.\nIf losses increased, that's an L.\n\nSimilarly for each row.\n\nSo let's try this approach:\n\nRow1: 20-13\nRow2: Assuming next record is 21-12 \u2192 W (game34)\nRow3: 22-10 \u2192 W (35)\nRow4:23-8\u2192W(36)\nRow5:24-7\u2192W(37)\nRow6:25-5\u2192W(38)\nRow7:26-3\u2192W(39)\nRow8:27-2\u2192W(40)\nRow9:28-1\u2192W(41)\nRow10:29-0\u2192W(42) (assuming no losses here, which is unlikely)\n\nWait, but 20 wins to 13 losses can't sustain 10 consecutive wins because that would require 30 total W-L by Row10, but the season might not be that long.\n\nThis approach is getting too speculative. Maybe a better way is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant something else. Given the confusion, I think it's best to acknowledge that without additional data or clarity on what \"this stretch\" refers to, we can't accurately determine if there are fewer wins than losses in this period.\n</think>\n\nTo address the query effectively, we need clarification on what constitutes \"this stretch.\" Without specific information about which games or time frame are being considered, it's challenging to analyze whether there are fewer wins than losses. Once additional details are provided, we can accurately determine the outcome based on the game results during that period.",

The claim is: \"the lowest attendance figure for any game be less than 13824.\" \n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and extract the 'location attendance' figures. Each game has a specific number listed under this column.\n\nLooking at Row 1, the attendance is 20708.\nRow 2: 18997\nRow 3: 20644\nRow 4: 20687\nRow 5: 18996\nRow 6: 14561\nRow 7: 13824\nRow 8: 17482\nRow 9: 20580\nRow 10: 20632\nRow 11: 20566\nRow 12: 16570\nRow 13: 20380\nRow 14: 20593\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest attendance figure. The numbers range from about 14k to over 20k. Looking at Row 6: 14561 and Row 7: 13824. These seem like lower figures.

So the lowest is indeed 13,824, which is in Row 7.\n\nThe claim says \"the lowest attendance figure for any game be less than 13824.\" But here, the lowest is exactly 13,824, which is equal to 13824, not less than. Therefore, it's not strictly less than 13,824; it's equal. So the claim would be false because it states \"less than,\" but the actual minimum is equal to that number.\n</think>\n\nThe lowest attendance figure in any game is exactly 13,824 (Row 7), which is not less than 13824 as claimed.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Extract Relevant Data:** The claim concerns the 'location attendance' for each game.\n2. **Identify the Lowest Attendance:** From the table, the lowest figure is found in Row 7 at 13,824.\n3. **Compare with Claim:** The claim states that this minimum should be \"less than\" 13824, but it's equal.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since it's not strictly less, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "joel przybilla do not lead the team in rebound in any game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"joel przybilla does not lead the team in rebounds in any game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim suggests that Joel Przybilla never led his team in rebounds across all games listed. So, my job is to check each row in the table and see if there's at least one instance where Joel Przybilla was the leader in rebounds.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various statistics. I need to focus on the columns related to rebounds. From the data provided, the relevant column for rebounds is \"high rebounds\". So, my plan is to go through each row and check who led in rebounds each time.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the rows:\n\n1. Game 33: High rebounds: Lamarcus Aldridge (10)\n2. Game 34: High rebounds: Lamarcus Aldridge (11)\n3. Game 35: High rebounds: Joel Przybilla (7) \u2013 This is the first time Joel leads in rebounds.\n4. Game 36: High rebounds: Greg Oden (8)\n5. Game 37: High rebounds: Greg Oden (13)\n6. Game 38: High rebounds: Lamarcus Aldridge and Joel Przybilla (9) \u2013 Here, both are tied.\n7. Game 39: High rebounds: Joel Przybilla (11) \u2013 Another instance where Joel leads.\n8. Game 40: High rebounds: Joel Przybilla (10)\n9. Game 41: High rebounds: Greg Oden (15)\n10. Game 42: High rebounds: Joel Przybilla (15)\n11. Game 43: High rebounds: Greg Oden (14)\n12. Game 44: High rebounds: Joel Przybilla (8)\n13. Game 45: High rebounds: Greg Oden (14)\n14. Game 46: High rebounds: Joel Przybilla (17)\n\nFrom this, I can see that in multiple games, Joel Przybilla is leading the rebounds. Specifically, he leads in Games 35, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46. Therefore, the claim that he does not lead in any game is false.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me double-check each game:\n\n- Game 3 (Row 35): Yes, Joel leads.\n- Game 7 (Row 39): Yes, Joel leads again.\n- Game 8 (Row 40): Yep, Joel is leading here too.\n- Game 10 (Row 42): Joel leads again.\n- Game 12 (Row 44): Correct, Joel is the leader.\n- Game 14 (Row 46): Joel leads once more.\n\nSo, there are multiple instances where Joel Przybilla leads in rebounds. That confirms that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"joel przybilla do not lead the team in rebound in any game\" is FALSE because Joel Przybilla led the team in rebounds in several games (Games 35, 39, 40, 42, 44, and 46).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
