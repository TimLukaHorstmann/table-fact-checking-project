The claim says, \"the format of season 6 be q145.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. The key elements are \"format,\" \"season 6,\" and \"q145.\" So I need to check if the row corresponding to season 6 has a format value of q145.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's a list of episodes from season 1 to season 16. Each row includes information like episode number, season, format, title, and original airdate. \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to locate the row for season 6. Let me go through each row one by one until I find the one where season is 6.\n\nRow 1: Season 1\nRow 2: Season 2\nRow 3: Season 3\nRow 4: Season 4\nRow 5: Season 5\nRow 6: Season 6\n\nAh, here it is. Row 6 corresponds to season 6. Now I need to check the format column for this row. The format listed there is \"q145.\"\n\nSo, the claim states that the format of season 6 is q145, and according to the table, that's exactly what's recorded. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or errors in this check. All relevant information is present and matches the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"format\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of this claim means. The term \"season 6.0\" likely refers to season number 6 in the table. So, I should look at the row where the season is 6.\n\nLooking through the table, each row has an episode number, season number, format code, title, and original airdate. I'll scan down until I find the one with season 6. \n\nRow 1: Season 1\nRow 2: Season 2\nRow 3: Season 3\nRow 4: Season 4\nRow 5: Season 5\nRow 6: Season 6 \u2014 this is the one we're looking for.\n\nNow, each row has a \"format\" column. For season 6, let's check what format it uses. Looking at Row 6, the format is listed as q145.\n\nThe claim states that season 6 should have q245 as its format. Wait, but in the table, it's q145. So that doesn't match. \n\nIs there a possibility of a mistake? Maybe I misread the row number. Let me double-check. Row numbers go from 1 to 16. So row 6 is indeed season 6.\n\nThe format for season 6 is q145, not q245. Therefore, the claim that season 6 has q245 as its format is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"q245.\" Is it possible that the table uses a different encoding or perhaps there's an error in the data provided? However, based on what's given, Row 6's format is definitely q145. There's no indication of a q245 anywhere else in the table either.\n\nSo, the claim is false because the format for season 6 isn't q245 but q145.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is incorrect. The actual format for season 6 is q145.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the given claim about an episode number and its format is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format.\" This means that we're looking for an episode numbered 223 that has a format of q147. If such an episode exists and it's the only one with that format in the table, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided to find any episodes where the format is q147. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Format h75\n- Row 2: Format h76\n- Row 3: Format q143\n- Row 4: Format q144\n- Row 5: Format h77\n- Row 6: Format q145\n- Row 7: Format q146\n- Row 8: Format h78\n- Row 9: Format q147\n- Row 10: Format h79\n- Row 11: Format h80\n- Row 12: Format q148\n- Row 13: Format q149\n- Row 14: Format q150\n- Row 15: Format h81\n- Row 16: Format h82\n\nFrom this, I can see that only Row 9 has the format q147. The episode number for Row 9 is 225, not 223. Wait, that's a discrepancy. So, according to the table, there isn't an episode numbered 223 with format q147. In fact, episode 225 is the one with q147.\n\nThis means that the claim is incorrect because it refers to episode number 223 which doesn't exist in the table with format q147. Also, even if we consider the closest episodes around 223, like 224 or 225, their formats are different: h78 and q147 respectively. So, there's no episode with the number 223 having format q147.\n\nMoreover, since only one episode (number 225) has the q147 format in the entire table, the claim's assertion that \"223 be the only\" is wrong because 223 doesn't have that format at all. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if episode number 223 has a format of q147. Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Relevant Rows**: Only Row 9 (episode 225) has the format q147.\n\nSince there's no episode with the number 223 and q147 format, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
