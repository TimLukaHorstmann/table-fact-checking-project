    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by looking at each part of the claim and see if it matches any data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"yes! fm broadcast.\" Looking at the table, every row has a \"branding\" column that says \"yes! fm\". So that part seems to check out for all rows, not just one. That's interesting because sometimes claims might specify a particular station or location, but here it's more general.\n\nNext, the claim is about broadcasting \"at 101.1 mhz.\" I need to look at the \"frequency\" column in each row. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Frequency is 101.1 MHz.\nRow 2: 104.1 MHz.\nRow 3: 91.1 MHz.\nRow 4: 106.3 MHz.\nRow 5: 104.7 MHz.\n\nSo, only Row 1 has the exact frequency mentioned in the claim. The other rows have different frequencies. That suggests that while there is at least one station broadcasting at 101.1 MHz, it's not universal for all \"yes! fm\" stations.\n\nNow, the instruction says to carefully check each condition against the table and determine which cells are relevant. So I need to see if the claim is making a statement that applies across all instances or just to some.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify whether it's about all \"yes! fm\" broadcasts or a specific one. However, since Row 1 does match both the branding and the frequency, there is at least one instance where this is true. But if the claim is intended to be universally true for all such stations, then it would be false because other rows have different frequencies.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't mention any location or callsign, just \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz.\" So it's making a statement that there exists a station with that branding and frequency. Looking at the table, since Row 1 matches both, the claim is true in that sense.\n\nBut if the claim was intended to mean all such stations broadcast at 101.1 MHz, then it would be false because other rows have different frequencies.\n\nHowever, considering how claims are often worded, \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz\" might not necessarily imply all instances. It could just state that they do so somewhere. So in that case, since Row 1 exists, the claim is true.\n\nBut I should check if the instruction is about any instance or all. The instructions say to determine if the claim is fully supported by the table. If the claim is making a general statement, then it's not fully supported because other stations have different frequencies. But if it's stating that at least one station does so, then yes.\n\nWait, but the example provided in the problem doesn't specify whether it's about all or any. The example given was about Revenue and Employees, which are properties that can vary per row. So perhaps here, since branding is consistent across all rows, but frequency varies, the claim could be considered true because there exists at least one station with that frequency.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim says \"yes! fm broadcast at 101.1 mhz.\" So it's making a specific frequency claim about the \"yes! fm\" branding. Since Row 1 has both, it's true for that row. But if the claim is saying all such stations do so, then it's false because others don't.\n\nBut without more context in the problem statement, I think the safest approach is to consider whether any station meets both criteria. Since Row 1 does, the claim is technically true because there exists at least one \"yes! fm\" broadcast at that frequency.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim was meant to be a general truth about all such stations, then it's false because others don't match.\n\nBut looking at the problem instructions again: it says to check each condition in the claim against the table. So let's break down the claim:\n\n- Branding: yes! fm\n- Frequency: 101.1 MHz\n\nWe need to see if any row has both these attributes.\n\nRow 1: branding is \"yes! fm\" and frequency is 101.1, so that matches.\n\nRows 2-5: other frequencies, so they don't match the claim's frequency.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there is at least one station meeting both conditions.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being Row 1, Column \"frequency\" and possibly Column \"branding\". Wait, but the instruction says to check each condition in the claim. So two conditions: branding and frequency.\n\nWait no, the claim is a single statement combining both branding and frequency. But perhaps it's better to consider each part separately.\n\nBut maybe the claim is asserting that for any station named \"yes! fm\", they broadcast at 101.1 MHz. In that case, since other rows have different frequencies, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is stating that there exists a station with both branding and frequency as specified, then it's true.\n\nBut I think the problem expects to check each part of the claim against the table. So let me see:\n\nThe claim has two conditions: \"yes! fm\" branding and \"101.1 mhz\" frequency.\n\nLooking at the table for any row where both are present.\n\nOnly Row 1 matches both, so the claim is true because such a station exists.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"branding\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"dyyd be the callsign for the branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay with a power of 1 kw\". I need to check if all parts of this claim are supported by the data in the table.\n\nStarting with the callsign part. The claim says the callsign is \"dyyd\". Looking at the table, each row has a callsign. Scanning through Row 3: branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay, callsign: dyyr, frequency: 91.1 mhz... Hmm, that's different from \"dyyd\". Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nRow 1: dwys\nRow 2: dzvm\nRow 3: dyyr\nRow 4: dyyd\nRow 5: dxyr\n\nSo the callsign for Row 4 is \"dyyd\". But in the claim, it's referring to Row 3, which has \"dyyr\" as the callsign. That's a problem because the callsign doesn't match. So the first part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The claim is specifically about branding yes! fm 91.1 boracay, so that would be Row 3. But in Row 3, the callsign is dyyr, not dyyd. Therefore, the callsign doesn't match. So this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nNext, checking the power. The claim says \"with a power of 1 kw\". Looking at Row 3's power column: it's 1 kw. That matches.\n\nSo, two parts to verify:\n1. Callsign for that branding: Should be dyyd, but it's actually dyyr.\n2. Power: Correct as 1 kw.\n\nSince the callsign doesn't match, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim fails because the callsign does not match; Row 3 has \"dyyr\" instead of \"dyyd\". \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"callsign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power (kw)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the frequency for callsign dxyr be from brand yes! fm 104.7\". \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if there's a station with the callsign dxyr and the branding yes! fm 104.7. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Callsign is dwys, branding yes! fm 101.1 \u2013 not matching.\nRow 2: Callsign dzvm, branding yes! fm 104.1 \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Callsign dyyr, branding yes! fm 91.1 \u2013 close, but different callsign and frequency.\nRow 4: Callsign dyyd, branding yes! fm 106.3 \u2013 not matching.\nRow 5: Callsign dxyr, branding yes! fm 104.7 \u2013 this looks promising.\n\nSo in Row 5, the callsign is dxyr, and the branding is yes! fm 104.7.

The claim is: \"dyyr be the call sign for yes! fm 104.7 cagayan de oro.\"\n\nFirst, let's look at what each part of the claim means. The call sign mentioned in the claim is 'dyyr'. I need to find out if this call sign matches any radio station in the table.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: branding yes! fm 101.1 metro manila, callsign dwys.\nRow 2: yes! fm 104.1 Urdaneta, dzvm.\nRow 3: yes! fm 91.1 Boracay, dyyr.\nRow 4: yes! fm 106.3 Dumaguete, dyyd.\nRow 5: yes! fm 104.7 Cagayan de Oro, dxyr.\n\nSo in row 3, the call sign is dyyr, and it's for yes! fm 91.1 Boracay.\n\nBut the claim says that dyyr is the call sign for yes! fm 104.7 Cagayan de Oro. In the table, the station at row 5 with frequency 104.7 MHz has the callsign dxyr, not dyyr.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the call sign doesn't match the station in question.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"1 kw be the power for yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\" So, they're asserting that the power associated with the station \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is exactly 1 kilowatt.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with multiple rows, each representing a different radio station. Each row has several columns: branding, callsign, frequency, power (kw), and location.\n\nNow, I'll focus on the specific row mentioned in the claim: \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay.\" Let me locate this in the table.\n\nRow 3 of the table corresponds to \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" as shown here:\n- Branding: yes! fm 91.1\n- Callsign: dyyr\n- Frequency: 91.1 mhz\n- Power (kw): 1 kw\n- Location: boracay\n\nSo, the power for this station is indeed listed as 1 kw in the 'power (kw)' column of row 3.\n\nNext, I need to check if all parts of the claim are addressed by the table. The claim mentions the specific frequency and location, which also match the third row's data. Therefore, all relevant information is present in row 3 under the 'power' column.\n\nAdditionally, there's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would suggest a different power for this station. Each row seems to have distinct data, so cross-referencing isn't necessary here.\n\nIn conclusion, since the 'power (kw)' value for \"yes! fm 91.1 boracay\" is explicitly stated as 1 kw in the table, the claim is fully supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power (kw)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
