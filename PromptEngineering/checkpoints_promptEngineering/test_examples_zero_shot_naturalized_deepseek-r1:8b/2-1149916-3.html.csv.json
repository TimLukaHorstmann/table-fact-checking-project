    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"denny hulme be the driver at andersdorf in 1973\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions Denny Hulme as the driver at Anderstorp in 1973. So, I should look for a row where the driver is Denny Hulme, the location is Anderstorp, and the year is 1973.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table one by one to check for these conditions.\n\nRow 1: Year 1978, driver Niki Lauda, constructor Brabham - Alfa Romeo, location Anderstorp. Doesn't match Denny Hulme or 1973.\nRow 2: Year 1977, Jacques Laffite, Ligier - Matra, Anderstorp. Not our guy and not the right year.\nRow 3: 1976, Jody Scheckter, Tyrrell - Ford, Anderstorp. Close year but driver is wrong.\nRow 4: 1975, Niki Lauda, Ferrari, Anderstorp. Still not Denny and not 1973.\nRow 5: 1974, Jody Scheckter again, same constructor. Not the right year or driver.\nRow 6: 1973, Denny Hulme, McLaren - Ford, Anderstorp. This matches all criteria!\nRow 7-10: These rows are for other years and locations, so not relevant.\nRows 11-18: Various drivers and constructors, but the years don't match.\n\nSo, looking specifically at Row 6, it has the driver Denny Hulme, location Anderstorp, and year 1973. That directly supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are Row 6 for driver, location, and year columns.\n</think>\n\nThe table contains a row (Row 6) that matches all conditions of the claim: driver Denny Hulme at Anderstorp in 1973.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
