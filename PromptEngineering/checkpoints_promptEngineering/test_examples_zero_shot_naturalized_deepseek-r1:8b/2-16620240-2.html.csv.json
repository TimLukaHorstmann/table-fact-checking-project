    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"On date 2004 - 07 - 02, the venue was idrottsparken and the djurg\u00e5rden scorer was sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided to see if there's a row that matches these details. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Date is May 5th. Opponents are IFK Timr\u00e5. Venue isn't idrottsparken, so this doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Date is May 21st. Venue is stadion, not idrottsparken. So no match here either.\n\nRow 3: Date is July 2nd, which matches the claim's date. Now, checking the venue: it says stadium, but wait\u2014the venue in the claim is idrottsparken. Is there a discrepancy? I need to check if \"stadion\" and \"idrottsparken\" are the same or different venues. I think stadion might refer to another venue, perhaps Djurg\u00e5rden's home ground is idrottsparken. So maybe this row has the correct date but not the correct venue.\n\nRow 4: Date is July 14th, so that doesn't match.\n\nRow 5: Date is October 20th, which is after July 2nd, so no match.\n\nRow 6: Date is November 6th, also after July, so it's irrelevant.\n\nWait a second. So the only row with date 2004-07-02 is Row 3. But in that row, the venue is \"stadion,\" not \"idrottsparken.\" Hmm. That seems like a discrepancy because the claim specifies idrottsparken as the venue. So does this mean the claim is false?\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding the venues. Let me think: \"stadion\" could be another name for idrottsparken, or they might be different places. If \"stadion\" refers to Djurg\u00e5rden's stadium, then it's possible that both names refer to the same venue but are listed differently in the table. Alternatively, maybe \"idrottsparken\" is a different venue altogether.\n\nLooking back at Row 3: venue is stadion, opponents are GIF Sundsvall, score is 3-1, competition stage is 1/16 final, and scorers include arneng, makondele, den Ouden. The attendance is 3,520.\n\nThe claim says the venue was idrottsparken. So if \"stadion\" in Row 3 doesn't match \"idrottsparken,\" then the claim's venue part is incorrect. Therefore, the claim would be false because the venue on that date wasn't idrottsparken but stadion.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misnaming the venues. Let me check if \"stadion\" and \"idrottsparken\" are indeed different. From what I recall, Djurg\u00e5rden's home ground is often called \"Djurg\u00e5rdsvene,\" which might be known as idrottsparken. So perhaps \"stadion\" refers to a different venue or maybe it's a translation issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has a typo and both refer to the same place but are listed differently. Without more context, I can't be sure, but based on the information given, Row 3 has date July 2nd, 2004, venue stadion, while the claim says idrottsparken. If they are different venues, then the claim is false because the correct venue wasn't idrottsparken.\n\nNext, looking at the scorers: the claim mentions sj\u00f6lund and johansson. In Row 3, the scorers are arneng, makondele, den Ouden. So there's no mention of sj\u00f6lund or johansson in that row. Therefore, both parts of the claim (venue and scorers) don't align with any row in the table.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"djurg\u00e5rden scorer be sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\" Looking at all rows:\n\n- Row 1: scorers are Stefanidis, Hys\u00e9n, Stenman.\n- Row 2: scorers are Arneng, Johansson, Hys\u00e9n.\n- Row 3: scorers are Arneng, Makondele, den Ouden.\n- Row 4: scorer is Johansson.\n- Row 5: scorers are Sj\u00f6lund and Johansson.\n- Row 6: scorers are Sj\u00f6lund (2 goals) and Johansson.\n\nSo on July 2nd, the scorers were Arneng, Makondele, den Ouden. Sj\u00f6lund scored in later matches, like October and November. So the claim's scorer part is incorrect because sj\u00f6lund wasn't scoring on that specific date.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim has two issues. First, the venue was stadion, not idrottsparken. Second, the scorers were different from what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the venue for July 2nd, 2004, was \"stadion,\" not \"idrottsparken,\" and the scorers did not include sj\u00f6lund and johansson.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"djurg\u00e5rden scorers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
