    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Ireland's medal scores is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Ireland score only 1 silver medal and no other medals.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate where Ireland is in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 34 is Ireland. Now, looking at the columns for that row: gold, silver, bronze, and total. The claim mentions silver and other medal types, so I need to check all three columns except maybe the total.\n\nLooking at Row 34: nation: ireland, gold: 0, silver: 1, bronze: 0, total: 1. So Ireland has 0 gold medals, 1 silver, and 0 bronze. The claim says they have only 1 silver and no other medals. That seems to match because they have 0 gold and 0 bronze.\n\nWait, but the total is 1, which includes just the one silver. So according to this, Ireland has exactly one silver medal and no others, making the claim true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 34 for all columns except maybe total? Or do I need to include total as well?\n\nWait, the claim is about medals, so gold, silver, bronze. The total isn't part of the claim, but it's derived from those. So the relevant cells would be all three: gold, silver, and bronze for Ireland. That way, someone can verify each medal count.\n\nSo the JSON should have answer as TRUE and include row 34 with all columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
