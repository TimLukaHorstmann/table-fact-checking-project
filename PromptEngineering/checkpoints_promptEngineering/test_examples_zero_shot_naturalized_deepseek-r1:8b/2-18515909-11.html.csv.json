    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"player geremi have win only 1 fifa club world championship.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has multiple rows with player names and various statistics like La Liga, Copa del Rey, UEFA Champions League, FIFA Club World Championship, and Total. Each row ends with a total count, which is the sum of the other columns.\n\nI need to find the relevant cells that verify this claim. The key here is the word \"only\" in the claim. This means geremi should have won exactly one FIFA Club World Championship, no more, no less.\n\nLooking through the table, I see each row corresponds to a player or a total. Let's go through each player related to FIFA Club World Championships.\n\nRow 16: name: geremi. The columns for him are La Liga:0, Copa del Rey:0, UEFA Champions League:0, FIFA Club World Championship:1, and Total:1.\n\nSo, according to the table, geremi has won 1 FIFA Club World Championship. That matches the claim exactly, as \"only\" implies one win without any more.\n\nI should check if there's any other information that could affect this conclusion. For example, is there a chance that 'fifa club world championship' column might have more entries elsewhere? But looking through all 17 rows, only row 16 (geremi) has a value of 1 in that column. The total for FIFA Club World Championships is 9 across all players, but that's the aggregate, not per player.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data. Geremi indeed has won exactly one FIFA Club World Championship.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"fifa club world championship\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
