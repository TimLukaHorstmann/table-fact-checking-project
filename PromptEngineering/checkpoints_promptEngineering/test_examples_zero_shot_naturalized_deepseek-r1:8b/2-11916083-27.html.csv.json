    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the highest issue price 24.95 and the lowest be 15.95.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The highest issue price is 24.95, and the lowest should be 15.95. So, I need to check if there are entries for both these prices in the table and whether they correspond correctly.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: year, theme, artist (which is \"n / a\"), issue price, and special notes. The issue price varies between 15.95 and 24.95. \n\nI should look for rows where the issue price is exactly 24.95 to see if they are indeed present and whether there are also rows with 15.95. Then, I can check if these prices correspond correctly.\n\nStarting with 24.95: Scanning through the table, I notice that from row 13 onwards, all the issue prices are 24.95. So, for each team (Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, etc.), there's a row where the price is 24.95. That means all themes except maybe some earlier ones have this higher price.\n\nNow, looking for the lowest price, which should be 15.95. Checking the initial rows: Row 1 has 15.95 for Calgary Flames, same with Edmonton Oilers (Row 3), Montreal Canadiens (Row 5), Ottawa Senators (Row 7), and Toronto Maple Leafs (Row 9). Vancouver Canucks also have a row with 15.95 in row 11.\n\nSo, both the highest price of 24.95 and the lowest price of 15.95 are present in the table. Each team has an entry for both these prices except perhaps some teams that might not have certain rows? Wait, let me check each theme:\n\n- Calgary Flames: Rows 1 (15.95) and 13 (24.95)\n- Edmonton Oilers: Row 3 (15.95) and 14 (24.95)\n- Montreal Canadiens: Row 5 (15.95) and 15 (24.95)\n- Ottawa Senators: Row 7 (15.95) and 16 (24.95)\n- Toronto Maple Leafs: Row 9 (15.95) and 17 (24.95)\n- Vancouver Canucks: Row 11 (15.95) and 18 (24.95)\n\nSo every team has both a low and high price. Therefore, the claim that the highest issue price is 24.95 and the lowest is 15.95 holds true for all teams in 2008 and then again in 2009 with higher prices.\n\nI don't see any reason to doubt this. The presence of both 15.95 and 24.95 in every team's row supports the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as both the highest (24.95) and lowest (15.95) issue prices are present across all teams.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"each theme be used 3 times\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"each theme\" refers to the different hockey teams listed in the 'theme' column of the table, like Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, etc. The claim says that each of these themes appears exactly three times across the rows. \n\nNow, looking at the table, I see it's organized with 18 rows, each representing a different item, possibly related to hockey teams and their sets or products. Each row has 'year', 'theme', 'artist' (which is \"n/a\"), 'issue price', and 'special notes'. For this analysis, the key column is 'theme'.\n\nI'll need to count how many times each theme appears in the table. Let me list out all the unique themes first:\n\n- Calgary Flames\n- Edmonton Oilers\n- Montreal Canadiens\n- Ottawa Senators\n- Toronto Maple Leafs\n- Vancouver Canucks\n\nNow, I'll go through each row and tally their occurrences.\n\nStarting with Calgary Flames:\n- Row 1: Calgary Flames\n- Row 13: Calgary Flames\n\nSo that's 2 times. Hmm, the claim says each should be used 3 times, so Calgary Flames only appears twice, which is less than three. That already suggests the claim might be false.\n\nNext, Edmonton Oilers:\n- Row 3: Edmonton Oilers\n- Row 14: Edmonton Oilers\n\nAgain, only two mentions. So that's also not three.\n\nMontreal Canadiens:\n- Row 5: Montreal Canadiens\n- Row 15: Montreal Canadiens\n\nAgain, two times. Not enough for the claim of three.\n\nOttawa Senators:\n- Row 7: Ottawa Senators\n- Row 16: Ottawa Senators\n\nTwo times as well.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs:\n- Row 9: Toronto Maple Leafs\n- Row 17: Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nAlso two mentions.\n\nVancouver Canucks:\n- Row 11: Vancouver Canucks\n- Row 18: Vancouver Canucks\n\nAgain, only two. \n\nSo every theme appears exactly two times in the table, not three. Therefore, the claim that \"each theme be used 3 times\" is false because each theme is used twice, not three times.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me recount quickly:\n\nThemes:\n1. Calgary Flames: Rows 1 and 13 \u2192 2\n2. Edmonton Oilers: Rows 3 and 14 \u2192 2\n3. Montreal Canadiens: Rows 5 and 15 \u2192 2\n4. Ottawa Senators: Rows 7 and 16 \u2192 2\n5. Toronto Maple Leafs: Rows 9 and 17 \u2192 2\n6. Vancouver Canucks: Rows 11 and 18 \u2192 2\n\nYes, that's correct. Each theme is only used twice, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether each theme appears exactly three times, we count occurrences for each team:\n\n- Calgary Flames: 2\n- Edmonton Oilers: 2\n- Montreal Canadiens: 2\n- Ottawa Senators: 2\n- Toronto Maple Leafs: 2\n- Vancouver Canucks: 2\n\nSince each theme occurs only twice, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the toronto maple leaf coin sell for both 24.95 and 15.95.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find any rows related to Toronto Maple Leafs coins. Scanning each row, I see that Row 9 has year 2008, theme Toronto Maple Leafs, issue price 15.95, with special notes about a coin and puck set. Then, Row 10 is for the same team but with issue price 24.95, coming from their gift set.\n\nSo, in Rows 9 and 10, the Toronto Maple Leafs coins are sold at both 15.95 and 24.95.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"all of the coin in 2009 have an issue price of 24.95.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. It seems like each row corresponds to a different team (like Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers) and their associated products or items for specific years, 2008 and 2009. The columns include year, theme (team name), artist (which is \"n / a\" here), issue price, and special notes.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the year 2009 and focuses on coins, so I should look at rows from 2009. In the table, the rows for 2009 are from row 13 to row 18. Each of these rows has a different theme (team) but all have an issue price. \n\nNow, the claim states that all coins in 2009 have an issue price of 24.95. To verify this, I need to check each relevant row for the year 2009 and see what their issue prices are.\n\nLooking at row 13: Calgary Flames, issue price is 24.95.\nRow 14: Edmonton Oilers, issue price 24.95.\nRow 15: Montreal Canadiens, issue price 24.95.\nRow 16: Ottawa Senators, issue price 24.95.\nRow 17: Toronto Maple Leafs, issue price 24.95.\nRow 18: Vancouver Canucks, issue price 24.95.\n\nAll the rows for 2009 have an issue price of exactly 24.95. So, all coins in 2009 indeed have this issue price. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because every coin from 2009 listed in the table has a 24.95 issue price.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"all of the coin in 2009 have an issue price of 24.95,\" we examine each relevant row for the year 2009.\n\n- **Row 13**: Calgary Flames, issue price 24.95.\n- **Row 14**: Edmonton Oilers, issue price 24.95.\n- **Row 15**: Montreal Canadiens, issue price 24.95.\n- **Row 16**: Ottawa Senators, issue price 24.95.\n- **Row 17**: Toronto Maple Leafs, issue price 24.95.\n- **Row 18**: Vancouver Canucks, issue price 24.95.\n\nEach of these rows corresponds to a team's coin in 2009 and has an issue price of 24.95.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"1 third of the coin from coin and puck set\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: It mentions \"1 third of the coin from coin and puck set.\" So, this suggests that there's a specific quantity or value related to coins sold in sets called \"coin and puck set.\"\n\nNow, I'll examine the table. The table has 18 rows, each representing different teams with various details like year, theme (team name), artist, issue price, and special notes.\n\nI need to focus on the \"special notes\" column because that's where additional information about the set might be mentioned. The claim refers to a \"coin and puck set,\" so I'll look for rows where the special notes include this term.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Special notes mention \"from coin and puck set.\"\n- Similarly, Rows 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 also have the same note.\n  \nSo, these rows (1,3,5,7,9,11) all refer to the \"coin and puck set.\" The claim is about a specific fraction of the coin within this set.\n\nNow, each relevant row has an issue price. For example:\n\n- Row 1: Issue price is $15.95\n- Row 3: $15.95\n- Similarly for others, some have $15.95 and others have $24.95.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify a particular team but refers to the general \"coin and puck set.\" However, in the table, each row corresponds to different teams (Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, etc.), so the issue price varies per team.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 third of the coin from coin and puck set.\" So, does this mean that for any such set, a third of the coin's value is involved? Or perhaps it refers to the price?\n\nLooking at Row 1: The issue price is $15.95, and special notes mention \"from coin and puck set.\" So maybe the coin in question has a certain value, perhaps $5.65 (which is roughly a third of $15.95). But I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, if each coin's price is listed as part of the table, but in the table, only issue price per item is given. However, the \"coin and puck set\" might be a collection where each coin has its own price, but perhaps the claim refers to the total value or quantity of coins.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that the claim says there's a 1/3 of the coin from the set. So in the table, any row with \"coin and puck set\" as special notes would have a relevant cell.\n\nBut each of those rows has an issue price. For instance, Row 1: $15.95. If that's for the entire set or per item? The term \"issue price\" can be ambiguous\u2014does it refer to per coin, total set, or something else?\n\nAssuming \"issue price\" is per unit (like per coin), then a third of that would be around $5.65. However, there's no direct evidence in the table about this fraction. The table only lists the issue price as a fixed amount for each row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a discount or bundle. For example, buying a puck and a coin set might give you a third off or something. But that's not directly stated here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. The special notes in Row 1 mention \"from coin and puck set.\" Maybe this is indicating that the item (like a coin) comes from that set, which has three components: a puck and two coins? Or maybe the set includes one puck and one coin, but the price is $15.95.\n\nIf the claim says \"1 third of the coin from the set,\" perhaps it's referring to a specific value or quantity related to the coin in each set. But without knowing the total value or composition of the set, I can't verify if 1/3 of the coin's value is as stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue price refers to the entire set, so a third of that would be part of it. For example, Row 1: $15.95. A third would be about $5.65. But without knowing what exactly is being sold or how much each component costs, I can't confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue price refers to the coin alone, and the set includes a puck as well. So if the set has one puck and one coin, but only the coin's price is listed as $15.95. Then 1/3 of that would be around $5.65, but again, there's no direct evidence in the table about this fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a promotion where purchasing the set gives you a third of something else, like a discount or another item. But the special notes don't mention any such thing\u2014they only note where the items are from.\n\nSo, perhaps the relevant cells are those where \"coin and puck set\" is mentioned because that's where the claim refers to. So all rows with this in their special notes (Rows 1,3,5,7,9,11) would be relevant. Each of these has an issue price which could relate to the value of the coin.\n\nTherefore, the table does mention \"coin and puck set\" as part of the product details, supporting that such sets exist, but it doesn't explicitly state anything about a 1/3 fraction unless we infer based on their prices. Since each of these rows has an issue price, perhaps the claim is about the coin's value within that set.\n\nHowever, without more information in the table about the composition or discounts related to these sets, I can't confirm whether 1/3 of the coin is priced at a certain amount. So, maybe the relevant cells are those with \"coin and puck set\" in their special notes because that's where the claim's subject is mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, the table supports that there are products called \"coin and puck sets,\" but it doesn't explicitly provide information about 1/3 of the coin's value. Therefore, while some rows do mention the existence of such sets, they don't verify the specific fraction stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that while the table mentions several items associated with \"coin and puck sets\" (Rows 1,3,5,7,9,11), it does not provide explicit information to confirm whether 1/3 of the coin's value is as described. Therefore, based on the data given:\n\n- **Relevant Rows**: Rows 1,3,5,7,9,11, which mention \"coin and puck set\" in their special notes.\n- **Conclusion**: The table supports the existence of these sets but does not verify the specific fraction or value mentioned in the claim.\n\nThus, while the data acknowledges the presence of coin and puck sets, it doesn't provide evidence to confirm the 1/3 fraction related to the coin's value.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim is that \"each theme be use 4 time.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that each theme (like Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, etc.) appears four times in the table. So my task is to check if every unique theme in the table occurs exactly four times.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 18 rows. Each row has a year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The artist column is marked as \"n / a\" for all entries, so that probably doesn't affect the count of themes.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the unique themes from the table:\n\n- Calgary Flames\n- Edmonton Oilers\n- Montreal Canadiens\n- Ottawa Senators\n- Toronto Maple Leafs\n- Vancouver Canucks\n\nThese are six different teams. Now, I need to check how many times each appears in the table.\n\nStarting with Calgary Flames: rows 1 and 13 mention them, so that's two appearances. Wait, but according to the claim, each theme should be used four times. So Calgary Flames only appear twice. That already contradicts the claim, making it FALSE. But let me check all just to be thorough.\n\nEdmonton Oilers are in rows 3 and 4. Again, only two times. Same issue as Calgary.\n\nMontreal Canadiens: rows 5 and 6. Also appearing twice.\n\nOttawa Senators: rows 7 and 8. Two again.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: rows 9 and 10. Two times.\n\nVancouver Canucks: rows 11 and 12. Two times.\n\nWait a minute, that's not four for any team. It seems each theme appears only twice in the table. So the claim saying \"each theme be use 4 time\" is incorrect because each actually appears two times, not four.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each theme appears four times, but each theme only appears twice. Hence, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a coin that's part of a \"coin and puck set.\" So, in the table, there are entries for 'special notes' that mention \"from coin and puck set,\" which probably refers to these sets. Each row has an issue price, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set.\" Wait, does that mean each coin in a set has two halves? Or maybe it's referring to a specific value or portion related to the coin. Maybe the 'issue price' for these sets includes something about halves?\n\nLooking at the table, I see that for some teams, there are two entries per team: one with an issue price of 15.95 and another with 24.95. For example, Calgary Flames have both prices, same with Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Vancouver Canucks. Each pair has different special notes: one from the \"coin and puck set\" and the other from the \"team's gift set.\" \n\nSo, maybe the 'issue price' for each of these sets is structured such that one is cheaper (15.95) and the other more expensive (24.95). The claim says \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set,\" which might be implying a specific value or perhaps a fraction of the total value.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication in the table about halves. Since all entries for 'issue price' are in dollars, but they're not fractions. So 15.95 could be interpreted as a single unit, and 24.95 might represent two units (like a coin plus something else), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of coins in each set. If the \"coin and puck set\" includes one coin, then the other set might have another version. But the claim says \"1 half,\" which is confusing because the issue prices don't show fractions. Unless the 24.95 represents a set that includes two coins, making it twice as much as the 15.95, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'special notes' mention \"from coin and puck set,\" so each such entry has a coin in the set. But how does that relate to the claim about halves? I'm not sure.\n\nLet me check all rows where the special note is from \"coin and puck set.\" Looking through the table:\n\nRow 1: Calgary Flames, issue price 15.95\nRow 3: Edmonton Oilers, 15.95\nRow 5: Montreal Canadiens, 15.95\nRow 7: Ottawa Senators, 15.95\nRow 9: Toronto Maple Leafs, 15.95\nRow 11: Vancouver Canucks, 15.95\n\nSo each of these has a special note indicating they're from the coin and puck set, with an issue price of 15.95.\n\nThen, the claim is about \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set.\" If each set includes one coin, maybe the 24.95 entries are for something else, like a gift set that doesn't include a coin. So perhaps the 15.95 rows are the ones with coins.\n\nBut how does that relate to the claim? The claim is about half of the coin, so maybe it's saying that each coin is worth $15.95, making the whole coin $31.90 if you have two halves. But there's no data showing anything like that in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue price for each set is structured such that one includes a puck and a coin (so 15.95), and the other is just the gift without the coin (24.95). So the \"coin and puck set\" costs 15.95, while the gift set without the coin is more expensive.\n\nBut the claim says \"1 half of the coin from coin and puck set,\" which might mean that the coin's value is represented in halves, but I don't see any indication of that in the table. The issue prices are straightforward, not fractions or halves.\n\nSo maybe the claim isn't supported by the data because there's no mention of a \"half\" value or anything related to halves in the 'issue price' or 'special notes.' It seems like the issue price is just a flat rate for each set, regardless of halves.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't have any supporting data points in the table. So I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the toronto maple leaf coin sell for both 27.95 and 15.95\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Toronto Maple Leaf coins are sold at two different prices: 27.95 and 15.95. So, my task is to check if both these prices are present in the table for the Toronto Maple Leaf theme.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a specific product with details like year, theme, artist, issue price, and special notes. The themes listed include various teams, and I'm interested in rows where the theme is \"toronto maple leafs\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries related to Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nStarting from Row 1: It's about Calgary Flames, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Edmonton Oilers, skip.\nRow 3: Edmonton Oilers again, nope.\nRow 4: Montreal Canadiens, moving on.\nRow 5: Montreal Canadiens too.\nRow 6: Ottawa Senators, no.\nRow 7: Ottawa Senators again.\nRow 8: Vancouver Canucks? No, that's a different team.\nWait, actually, looking at the themes:\nRow 9: Toronto Maple Leafs \u2013 this is relevant. The issue price here is 15.95.\nRow 10: Also Toronto Maple Leafs with a price of 24.95.\n\nSo, in Row 9, it's 15.95 from a coin and puck set. In Row 10, the same theme has a higher price of 24.95 from their gift set. \n\nNow, checking if both 27.95 and 15.95 are present for Toronto Maple Leafs. From the table, I see two entries:\n\n- 15.95 (Row 9)\n- 24.95 (Row 10)\n\nThere's no entry with 27.95 for this theme. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because there's only one price mentioned in the table for Toronto Maple Leaf coins.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. The relevant rows are 9 and 10. Their issue prices are 15.95 and 24.95 respectively. No row with 27.95 exists for this theme. So the claim is false because it claims both prices exist when only two are present in the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Toronto Maple Leaf coins sell for both 27.95 and 15.95. However, according to the table, these coins have issue prices of 15.95 and 24.95 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. There's no entry with a price of 27.95 for this theme.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where \"theme\" is \"toronto maple leafs\".\n2. **Extract Prices:** From these rows, note the issue prices.\n3. **Compare to Claim:** Check if both 15.95 and 27.95 are present.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since only 15.95 and 24.95 exist for Toronto Maple Leaf coins in the table, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"issue price\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"all of the coin in 2008 have an issue price of 24.95.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The table has rows from year 2008 and 2009. The relevant part here is 2008 since the claim is specifically about that year.\n\nLooking at each row for 2008:\n- Row 1: issue price is $15.95\n- Row 2: issue price is $24.95\n- Row 3: issue price is $15.95\n- Row 4: issue price is $24.95\n- Row 5: issue price is $15.95\n- Row 6: issue price is $24.95\n- Row 7: issue price is $15.95\n- Row 8: issue price is $24.95\n- Row 9: issue price is $15.95\n- Row 10: issue price is $24.95\n\nSo, in 2008, there are coins with both $15.95 and $24.95 prices.
