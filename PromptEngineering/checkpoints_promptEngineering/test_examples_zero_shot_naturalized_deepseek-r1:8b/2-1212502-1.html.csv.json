    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"shrek be nominate for a tony award in 2009\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"shrek\" being nominated for a Tony Award in the year 2009. So I need to look into the table provided and check if there's any entry that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: year, award, category, nominated work, and result. The claim is specifically about the Tony Award (Tony Award) in 2009 for Shrek. \n\nI'll go through each row related to the year 2009. Let's start from Row 15 onwards since that's when the years are in the 2000s.\n\nRow 15: year 2009, award is Tony, category best performance by a leading actress in a musical, work Shrek, result nominated.\nSo this one is about the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in Musical for Shrek. The result is \"nominated,\" which aligns with the claim that it was nominated. So this cell is relevant.\n\nRow 16: drama desk award, outstanding actress in a musical, same work and year. Not relevant as it's not the Tony Award.\n\nRow 17: drama league award, distinguished performance, same details except category. Not relevant for Tony.\n\nRow 18: outer critics circle award, outstanding actress in a musical, same year and work. It says \"won.\" So this is another relevant cell but the result is different from the claim.\n\nWait, the claim is about being nominated, but row 15 shows it was only nominated, while row 18 says it won. But the claim is specifically about being nominated, so maybe both are relevant because they both pertain to Shrek in 2009.\n\nRow 19 and onwards are for 2011, which doesn't match the year 2009 mentioned in the claim. So I can ignore those.\n\nSo looking back, Rows 15, 16,17,18 are in 2009 but only 15 is about the Tony Award. The result there is \"nominated,\" so that directly supports the claim.\n\nRow 18 is also relevant because it shows that Shrek won an outer critics circle award in 2009, which might indicate recognition, but since the claim is about a nomination for a Tony, row 15 is the primary relevant one.\n\nI think I should check if any other rows mention Shrek and 2009 with the Tony Award. From the table, only Row 15 fits that exactly.\n\nSo the relevant cells are Row 15, specifically the column \"result\" because it shows that Shrek was nominated for a Tony in 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from Row 15 of the table, where Shrek was indeed nominated for a Tony Award in 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2012 have a nominated result",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"2012 have a nominated result\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"2012 have a nominated result.\" This seems to suggest that in the year 20012 (wait, no, that's not right... probably 2012), there was some award nomination. But looking at the table, I notice all the years listed are between 2002 and 2013. So, yes, 2012 is included.\n\nNow, I need to find if there's any entry in the table for the year 2012 where the result was 'nominated.' To do this, I'll go through each row, check the year, and see if the result column has \"nominated.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 24: year 2012, award is Teen Choice Award, category Breakout Star Female, nominated work Bunheads, result: nominated. So that's exactly what we're looking for.\n\nTherefore, there is a record in 2012 where the result was 'nominated.' That supports the claim, making it TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to ensure no other rows for 2012 exist. The table has up to Row 25, and only Row 24 refers to 2012. So yes, that's the only one.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n1. The nominated work is \"Shrek.\"\n2. It won a drama award.\n3. The year is 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the awarded category is related to a Drama Award and the nominated work is \"Shrek\" in 2009.\n\nI'll scan through each row:\n- Rows 15-18: These are for 2009 and the award is either Tony, Drama Desk, etc. For these rows, most have \"nominated work: shrek\" but only Row 18 (Outer Critics Circle Award) says \"result: won.\" So, Shrek won an Outer Critics Circle Award in 2009.\n\nThe claim mentions a drama award, so I need to check if any of the awards are Drama Awards. The table includes Drama Desk, Drama League, etc., which are Drama awards. Since Row 18's result is \"won,\" it fits.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because Shrek won a Drama Award in 2009.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009,\" I identified relevant table rows where the award was for \"shrek\" and occurred in 2009. Only Row 18 meets all criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"in 2012, bunheads have won for breakout female star\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions the year 2012 and specifically refers to \"bunheads\" winning a \"breakout female star\" award. So my first step is to look through the table rows that correspond to the year 2012. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that row numbers go from 1 to 25. The rows for 2012 are only one: row 24. Let me check row 24 in detail.\n\nRow 24 has:\n- Year: 2012\n- Award: teen choice award\n- Category: breakout star female\n- Nominated work: bunheads\n- Result: nominated\n\nSo the result is \"nominated,\" not \"won.\" The claim says they \"have won,\" which would require a 'result' of 'won.' Since it's only 'nominated,' that doesn't support the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check if there are any other rows related to 2012 or bunheads beyond row 24. Scanning through the table, after row 24, the next years are 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, and then 2013 for row 25. So no, there's only one row for 2012.\n\nTherefore, since in 2012, bunheads were only nominated, not won, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"bunheads\" won a breakout female star award in 2012. Checking the table, the relevant row (24) shows the result as \"nominated,\" not \"won.\" Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
