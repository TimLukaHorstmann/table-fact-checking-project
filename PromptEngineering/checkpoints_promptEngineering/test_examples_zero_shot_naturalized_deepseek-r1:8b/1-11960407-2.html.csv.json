    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"toronto lose to cleveland on november 24 , 108 - 111 (ot)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It says that Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24 with a score of 108-111 in overtime. So I need to check if there's a game in the table that matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several details: game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. \n\nI'll go through each row to see if any match the claim. The key information from the claim is:\n- Date: November 24\n- Teams: Toronto vs. Cleveland\n- Score: 108 - 111 (OT)\n- Result: Loss for Toronto\n\nStarting from Row 1, the date is November 2, which doesn't match. Row 2 is November 4, still not matching. Row 3 is November 6 and so on until I reach Row 13.\n\nWait, let me count properly:\nRow 1: Nov 2\nRow 2: Nov 4\nRow 3: Nov 6\nRow 4: Nov 7\nRow 5: Nov 9\nRow 6: Nov 10\nRow 7: Nov 14\nRow 8: Nov 16\nRow 9: Nov 18\nRow 10: Nov 20\nRow 11: Nov 21\nRow 12: Nov 24\n\nAh, Row 12 is on November 24. Let me check the details of Row 12:\n- Game number: 13 (since it's the 13th row)\n- Date: November 24\n- Team: Cleveland\n- Score: l 108 - 111 (ot), which matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n- The teams involved are Cleveland and Toronto, as per the high points and other stats.\n\nWait, in Row 12, the team is listed as \"cleveland,\" so it's Cleveland playing against whom? Looking at the table, the 'team' column for Row 12 is \"cleveland.\" But in the claim, it's Toronto losing to Cleveland. So that would mean Toronto was the opposing team.\n\nBut I need to confirm whether Toronto is indeed the home team or the away team on November 24. Since the location attendance is listed as \"quicken loans arena\" for Row 12, which is in Cleveland, that means Cleveland was hosting the game. Therefore, Toronto was the visiting team, and they lost 108-111.\n\nSo all the details match: date, teams, score, location, and result (loss). So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about a game on November 20 in Dallas being a win with a score of w110-101 (OT) is true or false. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim specifies: \"the result of the game on november 20 in dallas be w 110 - 101 (ot)\". So, I need to check if this specific game is recorded as such in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, high points, etc. My first step is to find the row corresponding to November 20 and Dallas.\n\nI'll scan through each row's 'date' and 'team' columns:\n\n- Row 1: Nov 2, NJ\n- Row 2: Nov 4, Boston\n- Row 3: Nov 6, Milwaukee\n- Row 4: Nov 7, Orlando\n- Row 5: Nov 9, Philadelphia\n- Row 6: Nov 10, Chicago\n- Row 7: Nov 14, Utah\n- Row 8: Nov 16, Indiana\n- Row 9: Nov 18, Golden State\n- Row 10: Nov 20, Dallas\n- Row 11: Nov 21, Memphis\n\nSo, row 10 is the game on November 20 in Dallas. Now, I need to check the 'score' column for this row.\n\nLooking at row 10's score: it says \"l 99 - 105 (ot)\". That means Dallas lost the game with a score of 99-105 in overtime.\n\nThe claim states that Dallas won with a score of w110-101 (OT). Since row 10 shows Dallas losing, the claimed result doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
