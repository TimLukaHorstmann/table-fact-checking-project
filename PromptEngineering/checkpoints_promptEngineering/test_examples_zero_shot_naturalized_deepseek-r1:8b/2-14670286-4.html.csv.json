    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"between and include 3 june 2012 and 8 june 2012, 4 games for the 2014 fifa world cup qualification were held.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table rows to find any matches that fit this description. Let's go row by row.\n\nLooking at Row 12: It has a date of 8 June 2012 and venue Saitama Stadium 2002. The score is 5-0 with result 6-0, competition is 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification. So that's one game on the 8th.\n\nThen Row 11: Date is also 8 June 2012, same venue, score 3-0, result 6-0. That's another game on the 8th.\n\nRow 10: Also 8 June, same stadium, score 2-0, result 6-0. Another game on the 8th.\n\nWait, that might be three games on the 8th of June. But the claim says four games between 3 June and 8 June. Let me check Row 9: Date is 3 June 2012, same venue Saitama Stadium, score 1-0, result 3-0. That's one game on the 3rd.\n\nSo from 3 June to 8 June, there are four games:\n\n1. 3 June: Row 9\n2. 5 June: Hmm, I don't see a row for 5 June, so maybe only three games on those dates? Wait, no\u2014Row 12 is 8 June, Row 11 is same day but different game? Or are they separate? Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 9: 3 June 2012\n- Row 10: 8 June 2012\n- Row 11: 8 June 2012\n- Row 12: 8 June 2012\n\nSo that's one game on 3 June and three games on 8 June. The claim says four games in total between those dates. So the count is more than four if I consider each different date as separate.\n\nWait, no\u2014each row represents a single match. So from Row 9 to Row 12, there are four matches:\n\n- Row 9: 3 June\n- Rows 10-12: 8 June (three games)\n\nSo that's a total of four games within the timeframe mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the game play on 24 june 2010 be for the 2010 fifa world cup and the game play on 13 january 2011 be for the 2011 afc asian cup.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. On 24 June 2010, a game was played in the context of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n2. On 13 January 2011, a game was played in the context of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup.\n\nI need to verify each part by checking the table provided.\n\nStarting with the first part: 24 June 2010. I'll look through each row for a date matching this. Scanning the table:\n\n- Row 5: 14 June 2010\n- Row 6: 24 June 2010\n\nSo, Row 6 is the game on 24 June 2010. Now, check the competition column for that row. It says \"2010 FIFA World Cup.\" That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the second part: 13 January 2011. I'll search for a date matching this. Looking through the rows:\n\n- Row 7: 13 January 2011\n\nThis is the game on 13 January 2011. The competition column here states \"2011 AFC Asian Cup.\" That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are fully supported by the table, the claim should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For the first part, it's Row 6, columns: date, venue, score, result, competition. For the second part, it's Row 7, same columns.\n\nI should format this into a JSON object as specified.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"both the 8 june 2012 game and the 4 june 2013 game be play at the venue saitama stadium 2002 , saitama.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse this correctly. It seems to say that both games took place at Saitama Stadium 2002 in Saitama. Let me check the table for these two dates and venues.\n\nLooking through the table row by row:\n\n- Row 4: Date is 3 March 2010, venue is Toyota Stadium.\n- Rows 5-6: June 2010 matches, different venues (Free State Stadium and Royal Bafokeng Stadium).\n- Row 7: January 2011, Qatar SC Stadium.\n- Row 8: August 2011, Sapporo Dome.\n- Rows 9-12: June 2012 matches. All these are at Saitama Stadium 2002 in Saitama. So that's the first part of the claim, the 8 June 2012 game is indeed there.\n  \nNow for the second part: the 4 June 2013 game. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 14: 4 June 2013, venue is Saitama Stadium 2002 in Saitama. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, both games are at the same venue as stated.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant. For each game, I should find their respective rows and check the venue column.\n\nFor the 8 June 2012 game: It's row 9 (since the first match is row 1, so row 12 is 8 June 2012). Wait, let me recount:\n\nRows 9-12 are all for 8 June 2012. So any of these would be relevant. Let's pick one, say row 11, which has score: 3 - 0 and result: 6 - 0, competition: 2014 WCQ.\n\nFor the 4 June 2013 game: It's row 14. The columns to check are venue and date, but the claim is about the venue specifically. So I need the row where date is 4 June 2013 and venue is Saitama Stadium 2002.\n\nLooking at row 14: date is 4 June 2013, venue is Saitama Stadium 2002.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 11 (or any of rows 9-12) for 8 June 2012 and row 14 for 4 June 2013. Wait, but in the table, rows 9-12 all have date as 8 June 2012, so any one of those can be considered.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"both games\" so I need to make sure that both are at Saitama Stadium. So for each game, check their venue.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the 8 June 2012 game: any row from 9 to 12 (since all are 8 June 2012).\n- For the 4 June 2013 game: row 14.\n\nSo in the JSON, I should list these rows and their respective column names.\n\nWait, but the table's structure isn't entirely clear. Let me make sure each row has date, venue, score, result, competition. So for each relevant row, the columns are:\n\n- For the first game: row 9 (or any of 9-12), columns: date, venue.\n- For the second game: row 14, same columns.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list all relevant cells that confirm both games' venues.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because both games were at Saitama Stadium 2002. The relevant cells are:\n\nRow 11 (or any of rows 9-12) for 8 June 2012 and row 14 for 4 June 2013, checking their venue columns.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check both dates' venues in the table.\n\n1. **First Game (8 June 2012)**: Located at Saitama Stadium 2002 (rows 9-12).\n2. **Second Game (4 June 2013)**: Also at Saitama Stadium 2002 (row 14).\n\nBoth games are confirmed to be at the same venue.\n\n**Answer**: TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Row 11, column 'venue' for 8 June 2012.\n- Row 14, columns 'date' and 'venue' for 4 June 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the game on 14 august 2013 at miyagi stadium , rifu and the 6 september 2013 game at nagai stadium , osaka be consider friendly competition.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. Let me break it down.\n\nThe first game mentioned is on 14 August 2013 at Miyagi Stadium, Rifu. Looking through the table, row 16 has a date of 14 August 2013, venue: Miyagi Stadium, Rifu. The score and result are given as 2 - 4, with the competition listed as \"friendly.\" So this game is indeed a friendly match.\n\nNext, the second game is on 6 September 2013 at Nagai Stadium, Osaka. Checking row 17, it has a date of 6 September 2013, venue: Nagai Stadium, Osaka. The score is 1 - 0, result 3 - 0, and competition is listed as \"friendly.\" So this game is also friendly.\n\nNow, I need to verify whether both these games are considered friendly competitions in the table. From the data:\n\n- Miyagi Stadium on 14 August: Friendly\n- Nagai Stadium on 6 September: Friendly\n\nBoth matches have their competitions labeled as friendly, so they should be considered friendly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should identify which columns and rows are relevant. The columns needed are 'date', 'venue', but more importantly, 'competition' because that's what determines if it's a friendly match. So for each game, I'll note their respective row indices and the competition column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 16 (14 August) with 'competition' as \"friendly\"\n- Row 17 (6 September) with 'competition' as \"friendly\"\n\nThese are the specific data points that confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the relevant rows and columns in the table.\n\nThe two games specified are both labeled as friendly competitions. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the 6 september 2013 game be play at nagai stadium , osaka , but the 10 september 2013 game be play at international stadium yokohama , kanagawa\". So, the claim is making two assertions about two different games on September 6th and September 10th, 2013. It's stating where each game was played.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows corresponding to these dates, venues, and competitions. Let me go through each row to see which ones match.\n\nRow 1: May 2009\nRow 2: October 2009\nRow 3: October 2009\nRow 4: March 2010\nRow 5: June 2010\nRow 6: June 2010\nRow 7: January 2011\nRow 8: August 2011\nRow 9: June 2012\nRow 10: June 2012\nRow 11: June 2012\nRow 12: June 2012\nRow 13: February 2013\nRow 14: June 2013\nRow 15: June 2013\nRow 16: August 2013\nRow 17: September 6, 2013 (Wait, the date in row 17 is September 6, but the claim refers to September 6. Let me check that.)\nRow 18: September 10, 2013\nRow 19: All fields as of September 6, 2013\n\nSo, I'm interested in rows where the date is either September 6 or September 10, 2013.\n\nLooking at row 17: Date is September 6, 2013. Venue is Nagai Stadium, Osaka. So that matches the first part of the claim: a game on September 6 was played at Nagai Stadium, Osaka.\n\nNext, the second part says a game on October 10 (wait, no, it's actually September 10). Wait, the claim says \"the 10 september 2013 game be play at international stadium yokohama , kanagawa\". So I need to find a row with date September 10, venue International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nLooking through the rows, row 18 has the date September 10, 2013. The venue is International Stadium Yokohama, Kanagawa. That matches exactly.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table: one game on September 6 at Nagai Stadium and another on September 10 at International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells in the table support this. The relevant cells would be row 17 (September 6) and row 18 (September 10). Each of these rows has the date, venue, score, result, competition info. But the claim mentions only the venue and dates, so I think the columns we need to check are 'date' and 'venue'.\n\nSo for each relevant row, the columns 'date' and 'venue' should be considered.\n\nI should create a JSON object with answer as \"TRUE\" and list the relevant cells as objects with row_index and column_name.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by rows 17 and 18 in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"between and include June 3 2012 and June 8 2012, 9 game for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification be held.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It's talking about a set of games that took place between June 3, 2012, and June 8, 2012, specifically 9 games related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a match: date, venue, score, result, and competition. The relevant competitions mentioned in the claim are \"2014 fifa world cup qualification.\" So I need to focus on rows where the competition column mentions this.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Competition is 2009 Kirin Cup. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Friendly match. No.\nRow 3: Friendly match. No.\nRow 4: 2011 AFC Asian Cup Qualification. No.\nRow 5-6: 2010 FIFA World Cup. Not relevant for 2014.\nRow 7: 2011 AFC Asian Cup. No.\nRow 8: Friendly match. No.\nRow 9-12: All mention \"2014 fifa world cup qualification.\" These seem relevant because they're part of the same competition as the claim.\nRow 13: Friendly match. No.\nRow 14: 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification. Yes, this is relevant.\nRow 15: 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. No.\nRow 16-19: Not relevant competitions.\n\nNow, the claim specifies that there should be 9 games within those dates for the 2014 qualification. Let's count how many rows fall into this category.\n\nLooking at Rows 9 to 12 and Row 14:\n\nRow 9: June 3, score 1-0.\nRow 10: June 8, score 2-0.\nRow 11: June 8, score 3-0.\nRow 12: June 8, score 5-0.\nRow 14: June 4, score 1-1.\n\nWait, that's five rows. But the claim says 9 games. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Rows 9 to 12 are three different matches on June 8 and one on June 3. Row 14 is June 4. That makes four matches, but wait, looking back, Rows 9-12 are actually multiple entries for June 8: rows 10,11,12. So that's three separate games on the same date? Or maybe they're different matches.\n\nWait, each row is a different match. So from Row 9 to 12, there are four games (June 3 and three on June 8), plus Row 14 on June 4, making five games in total.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"9 game for the 2014 fifa world cup qualification.\" So perhaps I'm miscounting. Maybe there are more rows involved.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nRow 9: June 3\nRow 10: June 8\nRow 11: June 8\nRow 12: June 8\nRow 14: June 4\n\nThat's five matches. So that's not nine. Hmm, maybe the claim is counting multiple games on each date as separate games.\n\nWait, but in reality, each row represents a single match, regardless of the date. So even if they're on different dates, each is a separate game. But the total number here doesn't reach nine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing other rows that are part of the same competition but not explicitly mentioned as \"2014 fifa world cup qualification.\"\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 9: 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification\nRow 10: Same\nRow 11: Same\nRow 12: Same\nRow 14: Same\n\nThat's five rows. So only five games listed in the table for that competition between those dates. The claim says nine, so this suggests a discrepancy.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are more than one match per day, but each is counted as separate. For example, on June 8, three matches (rows 10,11,12). Plus others, making up to five or more. But the count in the table doesn't reach nine. So perhaps the claim's assertion isn't fully supported by the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the rows. Let me check again:\n\nRows 9: June 3\nRow 10: June 8\nRow 11: June 8\nRow 12: June 8\nRow 14: June 4\n\nThat's five matches. So unless there are more in the table, it doesn't add up to nine.\n\nBut wait, maybe other rows not specifically marked as \"2014 fifa world cup qualification\" but might be part of the same process? For example, preliminary rounds or friendlies that also count towards qualifications. However, based on the table, only Rows 9-12 and Row 14 mention that specific competition.\n\nSo, if only five games are listed in the table for June 3 to June 8, 2012, then the claim's assertion of nine games isn't supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The second part mentions a game on January 13, 2011, being for the FIFA World Cup.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find matches that fit these dates and competitions. \n\nLooking at Row 6: date is June 24, 2010. The venue is Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, with a score of 1-0 and result 3-1. The competition is listed as the 2010 FIFA World Cup. So, this matches the first part of the claim regarding the date and competition (FIFA World Cup). However, the claim specifically mentions AFC Asian Cup for that date, which doesn't match because the competition here is the World Cup.\n\nNext, checking Row 7: date is January 13, 2011. Venue is Qatar SC Stadium in Doha, score 2-1, result 2-1, competition is the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. So, this matches the second part of the claim regarding the date and competition (FIFA World Cup). Wait, no\u2014the competition here is AFC Asian Cup, but the claim says it's for the FIFA World Cup. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake there. The claim says that the game on 13 January 2011 was for the FIFA World Cup, but according to the table, it's actually the AFC Asian Cup. So that part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the competitions. Row 6: 2010 FIFA World Cup. That matches the first part correctly\u2014date is June 24, 2010, competition is FIFA World Cup. However, the claim says it's for AFC Asian Cup, which is wrong.\n\nRow 7: January 13, 2011, is the AFC Asian Cup, but the claim says it's for the FIFA World Cup, so that's incorrect as well.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are false. The game on June 24, 2010, was part of the FIFA World Cup, not the AFC Asian Cup. And the game on January 13, 2011, was part of the AFC Asian Cup, not the FIFA World Cup.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because both date-competition pairings are swapped.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the competitions for the given dates. The game on June 24, 2010, was a FIFA World Cup match, and the January 13, 2011, game was an AFC Asian Cup match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim says that none of the games in 2012 and 2013 were played at Saitama Stadium. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table provided. Each row has details like date, venue, score, result, and competition. My focus is on the years 2012 and 2013 because the claim is about those years. Also, I need to check if any game during these years was held at Saitama Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: May 2009, Nagai Stadium, Osaka \u2013 not relevant as it's before 2012.\nRow 2: October 2009, Nissan Stadium, Yokohama \u2013 also before our focus year.\nRows 3-4: 2009 and early 2010 \u2013 still before 2012.\nRow 5: June 2010 \u2013 FIFA World Cup match. Venue is Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.\nRow 6: June 2010 \u2013 Royal Bafokeng Stadium, Rustenburg \u2013 also not Saitama.\nRows 7-10: 2011 and early 2012 \u2013 some are in 2012 but let's check each.\n\nWait, rows 11-13 for 2012:\nRow 11: 8 June 2012, Saitama Stadium 2002, score 3-0. So that's a game in 2012 at Saitama Stadium.\nSimilarly, Row 12 is also in 2012 with the same venue.\nRow 13: February 2013, Kobe \u2013 not Saitama.\nRows 14: June 2013, Saitama again for World Cup qualification. So that's another game in 2013 at Saitama.\nRow 15: June 2013, Recife \u2013 not relevant.\n\nSo, the claim says none of these games in 2012 and 2013 were at Saitama. But looking at Rows 11,12,14, there are definitely games in 2012 (rows 11-13) and 2013 (row 14). Therefore, the claim is false because games were indeed played at Saitama Stadium during those years.\n\nI should identify which rows are relevant for the claim. The claim mentions 2012 and 2013, so I'll check all rows from 2012 onwards that have Saitama Stadium as the venue.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows 11-13: June 2012 \u2013 these are three matches in 2012 at Saitama.\nRow 14: June 2013 \u2013 one match in 2013 also at Saitama.\nRow 19 is a placeholder, so not relevant.\n\nSo the relevant rows are 11,12,14, and possibly 13 but that's February 2013. Wait, row 13 is 6 Feb 2013, venue is Kobe, not Saitama. So only rows 11,12,14.\n\nWait, no: rows 11,12 are in June 2012, so that's definitely within 2012. Row 14 is June 2013, which is part of 2013, and it's at Saitama. Therefore, these three rows (11,12,14) show games in the specified years at Saitama.\n\nSo the claim is false because there were games in those years at that venue.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are games listed in 2012 and 2013 played at Saitama Stadium.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the september 6 2013 be play at international stadium yokohama , kanagawa and the september 10 2013 game be play at nagai stadium , osaka.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim into two parts. The first part is September 6, 2013, at International Stadium Yokohama in Kanagawa. The second part is September 10, 2013, at Nagai Stadium in Osaka.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row of the table to find matches that fit these dates and venues.\n\nLooking at Row 19: It says \"as of 6 september 2013\" for all fields, which probably means it's some kind of summary or ongoing status as of that date. Since the claim refers to specific games on those dates, this row might not be relevant.\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\nRow 1-4 are before September 2013, so they don't match the dates in question.\nRows 5 and 6 are June 2010, also irrelevant.\nRows 7 is January 2011, nope.\nRows 8: August 2011, not relevant.\nRows 9-12: June 2012, still too early.\nRow 13: February 2013, no match.\nRow 14: June 2013, wrong month and year.\nRow 15: August 2013, not September.\nRow 16: August 2013, same as above.\nRows 17-19: \n\nWait, Row 18 is September 10, 2013. Let me check that.\n\nRow 18: Date is October 10, 2013? Wait no, the date is September 10, 2013, venue Nagai Stadium, Osaka. So that's one part of the claim.\n\nLooking for September 6, 2013:\n\nI see Row 17 is September 6, 2013, venue Nagai Stadium, Osaka, but wait, let me check.\n\nWait no, Row 17: date is September 6, 2013, venue Nagai Stadium, Osaka. So that's a match on September 6 at Nagai Stadium in Osaka. But the claim says September 6 should be at International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nSimilarly, Row 18 is September 10, 2013, venue International Stadium Yokohama, Kanagawa.\n\nWait, so let me clarify:\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. September 6, 2013, at International Stadium Yokohama (Kanagawa)\n2. September 10, 2013, at Nagai Stadium (Osaka)\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find rows where the date matches the date in each part and the venue matches.\n\nFor the first part: September 6, 2013, International Stadium Yokohama, Kanagawa.\n\nChecking Row 17: Date is September 6, 2013, venue Nagai Stadium, Osaka. So that's not it because the venue doesn't match. The claim says International Stadium Yokohama for that date, but in the table, on September 6, it's Nagai Stadium.\n\nThen, looking for a row with September 6, 2013, at International Stadium Yokohama. Scanning through, I don't see such a row. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nRow 19 is as of September 6, but that's not a game date. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because there isn't a game on September 6 at International Stadium Yokohama, Kanagawa.\n\nFor the second part: September 10, 2013, Nagai Stadium, Osaka.\n\nLooking for that in the table:\n\nRow 18: Date September 10, 2013, venue Nagai Stadium, Osaka. So this matches.\n\nTherefore, the claim says two things:\n1. A game on September 6 at International Stadium Yokohama.\n2. A game on September 10 at Nagai Stadium, Osaka.\n\nIn the table, only the second part is confirmed (Row 18), but there's no row that confirms the first part (September 6 at International Stadium Yokohama). Therefore, the claim is only partially true regarding the second date and venue, but not the first.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through each row again:\n\n- Row 17: September 6, Nagai Stadium, Osaka.\n- Row 18: September 10, International Stadium Yokohama, Kanagawa.\n\nOh! Wait a second. I think I got them mixed up earlier.\n\nSo Row 17 is September 6 at Nagai Stadium, Osaka. That doesn't match the claim's first part.\n\nRow 18 is September 10 at International Stadium Yokohama, Kanagawa. That matches the claim's second part.\n\nWait, but the claim says the September 6 game is at International Stadium Yokohama, which would require a row with date September 6 and venue International Stadium Yokohama. But in the table, on September 6, it's Nagai Stadium.\n\nTherefore, only the second part of the claim matches, while the first part does not.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because one of its parts isn't supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies two dates: September 6 and September 10, 2013. \n\n- **September 6**: The table shows a game on that date at Nagai Stadium in Osaka (Row 17), not at International Stadium Yokohama.\n- **September 10**: The table confirms a game at Nagai Stadium, Osaka (Row 18).\n\nSince the first part of the claim isn't supported by the table, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's go through each relevant row based on the claim.\n\nStarting with August 14, 2013 at Miyagi Stadium, Rifu. I'll look for rows where the date is August 14, 2013 and venue is Miyagi Stadium, Rifu. Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 16: date: 14 august 2013, venue: miyagi stadium , rifu.\n\nYes, that's a match. The competition listed here is \"friendly\". But does a friendly match count as being for the FIFA World Cup? I don't think so. The FIFA World Cup has specific competitions, and a friendly match isn't part of it. So even though the venue and date match, the competition doesn't.\n\nNext, September 6, 2013 at Nagai Stadium, Osaka. Looking for rows with that exact date and venue.\n\nRow 17: date: 6 september 2013, venue: nagai stadium , osaka.\n\nThe competition here is \"friendly\". Again, a friendly match isn't part of the FIFA World Cup. So this doesn't support the claim either.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there's any other row that might have these details. For August 14, only row 16 matches, and for September 6, only row 17 does. Both are friendly matches, not related to the FIFA World Cup.\n\nSo both games listed in the claim aren't part of the FIFA World Cup.
