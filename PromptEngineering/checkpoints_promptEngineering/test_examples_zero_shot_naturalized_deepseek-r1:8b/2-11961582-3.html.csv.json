    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"the november 16 score be i 123 - 126\". \n\nFirst, I should identify which part of the claim corresponds to data in the table. The key elements are November 16th, the score, and it's a loss. So I need to find the row where the date is November 16.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Nov 2\n- Row 2: Nov 4\n- Row 3: Nov 6\n- Row 4: Nov 7\n- Row 5: Nov 9\n- Row 6: Nov 11\n- Row 7: Nov 14\n- Row 8: November 16\n\nSo that's row index 8.\n\nNow, checking the score for row 8. The game is listed as a loss with the score being l 123 - 126. \n\nWait, the claim says \"the november 16 score be i 123 - 126\". Hmm, 'i' probably stands for a win or loss indicator. In the table, scores are written like \"l 91 - 92\" for losses and \"w 82 - 79\" for wins.\n\nSo, in row 8, it's an l (loss) with the score 123-126. The claim is stating that on November 16th, the score was i (which should be loss) 123 - 126. So if 'i' stands for a loss, then the claim matches because the game on Nov 16 was indeed a loss with that score.\n\nWait, but sometimes in sports notation, an 'l' might not always correspond directly to 'i'. But given the table's format, it uses 'w' and 'l' consistently. So if the claim is using 'i' as a shorthand for loss, then yes, it matches.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 8, checking both the date and the score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
