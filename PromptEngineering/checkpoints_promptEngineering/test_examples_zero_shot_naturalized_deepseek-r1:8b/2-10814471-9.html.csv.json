    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find Tevita Vaikona in the table. Scanning through each row, I see that Tevita Vaikona is in Row 2. So his row index is 1 (since we start counting from 0). Now, looking at the columns for this row: position, tries, goals, points.\n\nThe claim says he scored 100 points on 25 tries. Let's check the 'tries' column first. In Row 2, under 'tries', it's 25. That matches the number of tries mentioned in the claim. \n\nNext, checking the 'points' column. The value here is 100. So that's a match too.\n\nI should also double-check if there are any other columns that might affect this, like goals. But since the claim doesn't mention goals, they can be ignored for this check. \n\nSo both tries and points in Row 2 of Tevita Vaikona correspond to the claim. Therefore, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with Tevita Vaikona's data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have to determine whether the given claim about Tevita Vaikona is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Tevita Vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when make more than 23 tries.\" So, I need to check two conditions for Tevita Vaikona:\n1. Did he score at least 100 points?\n2. Did he make more than 23 tries?\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row corresponding to Tevita Vaikona. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 2 is Tevita Vaikona. In this row, his goals are listed as 0 and points as 100.\n\nWait a minute, that seems conflicting because in the claim, he needs to have scored at least 100 points. But according to the table, his goals (which I think correspond to points) are 100. So, he does meet the points condition. Now, checking his tries: Row 2 shows 25 tries.\n\nSo, Tevita has more than 23 tries (he has 25). Therefore, both conditions of the claim are met by him.\n\nBut wait, the user instruction is to verify if he's the only player meeting these two criteria. So I need to check all other players to see if anyone else has at least 100 points and more than 23 tries.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 1: Robbie Paul - goals 0, points 92. Tries 23. So, doesn't meet both conditions.\n- Row 2: Tevita Vaikona - 25 tries, 100 points. Meets both.\n- Row 3: Leon Pryce - 16 tries, 64 points.\n- Row 4: Nathan McAvoy - 4 tries, 16 points.\n- Row 5: Michael Withers - 31 tries, 124 points. So here's another player with more than 23 tries (he has 31) and at least 100 points (124). That means Tevita is not the only one.\n\nSo, that would make the claim false because there's at least one other player (Michael Withers) who meets both conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Tevita Vaikona is the only player to score at least 100 points with more than 23 tries, we check each condition and compare against all players in the table.\n\n1. **Tevita Vaikona's Data:**\n   - Tries: 25 (which is more than 23)\n   - Points: 100 (which is at least 100)\n\n2. **Verification of Other Players:**\n   - Michael Withers has 31 tries and 124 points, meeting both conditions.\n   - No other player meets both criteria simultaneously.\n\nSince there's at least one other player who satisfies the claim's conditions, Tevita Vaikona isn't unique in this aspect.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
