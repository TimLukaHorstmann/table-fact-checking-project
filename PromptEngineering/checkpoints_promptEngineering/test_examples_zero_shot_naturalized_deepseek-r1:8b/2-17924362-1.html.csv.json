    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than 2 wins in a row\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table of their game results. The table seems to list the games from week 1 through week 14 in the 1975 season, as each row has details like the opponent, result, game site, and so on.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in 1975, at no point did the Broncos have more than two consecutive wins. So my task is to check if there are any sequences of three or more wins in a row during that season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"result\" which can be 'w' for win or 'l' for loss. I need to go through each week's result and see if any three consecutive weeks have 'w' results.\n\nLet me start by listing out all the results in order:\n\nWeek 1: W\nWeek 2: W\nWeek 3: L\nWeek 4: L\nWeek 5: W\nWeek 6: L\nWeek 7: L\nWeek 8: L\nWeek 9: W\nWeek 10: L\nWeek 11: W\nWeek 12: L\nWeek 13: W\nWeek 14: L\n\nNow, I'll check for sequences of three or more 'W's in a row.\n\nStarting from Week 1:\n- Weeks 1 and 2 are both W. That's two in a row, but not three.\n- Then Week 3 is an L, so the streak breaks at two.\n\nNext, looking after that:\n- After Week 3, Week 4 is L, so no streak.\n- Week 5 is W, then Week 6 is L. Only one W there.\n- Week 7 is L, Week 8 is L.\n- Week 9 is W, followed by Week 10's L.\n- Week 11 is W, then Week 12 is L.\n- Week 13 is W, and Week 14 is L.\n\nSo in this entire season, the maximum number of consecutive wins is two. There are no three wins in a row at any point during the season. Therefore, the claim that they never had more than two wins in a row in 1975 seems to be TRUE based on the table provided.\n\nI should also note which specific cells from the table support this conclusion. The \"result\" column is key here because it shows whether each game was a win or loss. So for each week, I need to consider their result to track the streaks.\n\nLooking at the table's columns:\n\n- Row index: 0 to 13 (since there are 14 rows)\n- Columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance\n\nThe \"result\" column is where I should extract the 'W' or 'L'. So each cell in the \"result\" column from row 1 to row 14 needs to be checked for streaks of three 'W's.\n\nSince none of them have three 'W's in a row, all relevant cells are those that have 'W', but specifically looking at whether any two 'W's are followed by another 'W'. However, since there are no such instances, the relevant cells are all where the result is 'W' because each of these wins contributes to the streaks, even though none reach three.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should be more precise. The claim is about having more than two in a row, so any sequence of three or more consecutive wins would disprove the claim. Since there are no such sequences, the only relevant cells might not just be all 'W's but specifically each 'W' because they are part of potential streaks.\n\nBut perhaps to confirm that there were no three-in-a-rows, I need to check for any occurrence where three consecutive results are 'W'. Looking back at the list:\n\nWeek 1: W\nWeek 2: W\nWeek 3: L \u2192 No streak beyond two here.\n...\nWeek 5: W\nWeek 6: L \u2192 Streak broken.\n...\nWeek 9: W\nWeek 10: L \u2192 No.\nWeek 11: W\nWeek 12: L \u2192 No.\nWeek 13: W\nWeek 14: L \u2192 No.\n\nSo the only streaks are at most two 'W's. Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data because it shows no instance where they had three wins in a row.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and all the 'result' cells are relevant as they contribute to showing that there were no three consecutive wins.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than 2 wins in a row\" is true based on the provided table, we analyzed each week's game result. We found that the maximum number of consecutive wins was two, with no instance of three or more consecutive wins. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Bronco game in 1975 be at the San Diego Stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by breaking down the claim. It's about the lowest attendance at a Broncos game in 1975 being at the San Diego Stadium. So, I need to look for games that took place in 1975 and check their attendances, especially focusing on games played at San Diego Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists games from week 1 to week 14, but all the dates are in September, October, November, and December. The years aren't specified, so I have to assume that the data corresponds to the 1975 season if the Broncos were playing then. Wait, actually, I should check when the Broncos played in San Diego. \n\nI know that the Broncos moved to Mile High Stadium in Denver in 1968, but they also played some games at other stadiums, including San Diego Stadium (now Snapdragon Stadium) for certain games. Typically, these games are against teams like the Chargers, who were based in San Diego until 2016.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that the Broncos played against the San Diego Chargers in week 9 and week 11 of the season. Let me check those rows:\n\n- Week 9: Opponent is San Diego Chargers, date November 16, game site San Diego Stadium.\n- Week 11: Opponent is San Diego Chargers again, but this time at Mile High Stadium.\n\nWait, so in week 9, they played at San Diego Stadium, and the attendance was 26,048. In week 11, they played at Mile High with higher attendance, around 44,982.\n\nNow, I need to see if any other games in 1975 had lower attendance than this. The claim mentions \"lowest attendance,\" so I have to check all Broncos games in 1975 and their attendances.\n\nLooking through the table, the lowest attendance I can find is 26,048 at San Diego Stadium in week 9. Are there any other games with lower numbers? Let me check other rows:\n\n- Week 1: 51,858\n- Week 2: 52,621\n- Week 3: 79,864\n- Week 4: 49,169\n- Week 5: 52,590\n- Week 6: 70,043\n- Week 7: 52,505\n- Week 8: 49,919\n- Week 9: 26,048 (San Diego Stadium)\n- Week 10: 28,686\n- Week 11: 44,982\n- Week 12: 51,075\n- Week 13: 36,860\n- Week 14: 43,064\n\nFrom this, the lowest attendance is indeed week 9 with 26,048 at San Diego Stadium. Now, I need to confirm if that's the case for 1975.\n\nAssuming all data in the table corresponds to 1975, which it likely does since there are no conflicting dates or higher years mentioned, then yes, the lowest attendance was at San Diego Stadium.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the row for week 9 (row index 8) and the 'attendance' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"in 1975 , the most point the denver bronco score in a loss be 21.\" So, I need to determine if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the Denver Broncos' scoring in a loss during the 1975 season, specifically stating that their highest points in such games was 21. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details like week, date, opponent, result, etc. The key columns here are \"result\" and \"score.\" For each game, if the result is a loss (denoted by 'l'), I need to check what the opposing team's score was and see if it adds up to 21 or more.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions the Broncos' points in their losses. So actually, we should be looking at their own scores when they lost. That means checking for each row where \"result\" is a loss (l), and then seeing what the Broncos scored in those games.\n\nHowever, I notice that the table goes from week 1 to week 14, covering multiple years because the dates go up to December 1975 if we assume it's about the 1975 season. So, the Broncos likely played several games that year, some wins and some losses.\n\nNow, let me scan through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Win (W 37-33)\n- Week 2: Win (W 23-13)\n- Week 3: Loss (L 14-38). Here, Broncos scored 14.\n- Week 4: Loss (L 9-20). Broncos scored 9.\n- Week 5: Win\n- Week 6: Loss (L 13-26). Broncos scored 13.\n- Week 7: Loss (L 17-42). Broncos scored 17.\n- Week 8: Loss (L 16-17). Broncos scored 16.\n- Week 9: Win\n- Week 10: Loss (L 21-35). Broncos scored 21.\n- Week 11: Win\n- Week 12: Loss (L 10-17). Broncos scored 10.\n- Week 13: Win\n- Week 14: Loss (L 13-14). Broncos scored 13.\n\nFrom this, the highest points the Broncos scored in a loss during the season was 21, which occurred in week 10 against the Atlanta Falcons. That's exactly what the claim says: \"the most point the denver bronco score in a loss be 21.\" \n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any higher scores. Looking back, the highest Broncos' points in losses were indeed 21, with other losses having lower scores like 17, 16, 14, etc. So yes, 21 is the maximum.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that this was actually during the 1975 season. The table provided seems to cover multiple years because week 1 is in September, and the last row (week 14) is December 20. Assuming this is all within 1975, then yes, it's relevant.\n\nBut wait, the claim specifies \"in 1975,\" so I should confirm that these games were indeed part of the 1975 season. Typically, the NFL season runs from September to January, so weeks 1-14 in 1975 would make sense.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the Broncos had a game where they lost with a score of 21 points, which is the highest in their losses for the season.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each row where the result is a loss and note the Broncos' score. The highest score in such games was indeed 21.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of this claim means. It mentions the Denver Broncos playing in overtime only once during the 1975 season.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of games from week 1 to week 14, with various details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a different game, so I need to check each row for any indication of overtime games in 1975.\n\nWait, but the dates in the table go up to December 20, 2014, which is way beyond 1975. That\u2019s confusing. Did I misread the table? No, it seems like all the rows are from a single season or maybe multiple years. But the claim refers to 1975, so I need to focus on games that happened in 1975.\n\nLooking at each row's date: \n\nRow 1: September 21\nRow 2: September 29\nRow 3: October 5\nRow 4: October 12\nRow 5: October 19\nRow 6: October 26\nRow 7: November 26\nRow 8: November 9\nRow 9: November 16\nRow 10: November 23\nRow 11: November 30\nRow 12: December 8\nRow 13: December 14\nRow 14: December 20\n\nWait, these dates are across multiple years. For example, Row 1 is September 21, which would be in 1975 if that's the case. But without knowing exactly when this table represents, it's hard to say.\n\nAssuming the table includes the 1975 season, I should check each game result for any mention of overtime. The result column shows whether they won or lost, but doesn't explicitly state if it was in overtime. However, looking at Row 11: week 11, November 30, opponent San Diego Chargers, result w 13 -10 (OT). So this game went into overtime.\n\nBut the claim is that in 1975, they only went to overtime once. So if there's one game in overtime, does that make the claim TRUE? Wait, but I also need to check how many games in total they played in 1975 and whether overtime happened more than once.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the dates again: September 21, 29; October 5,12,19,26; November 9,16,23,30; December 8,14,20. So that's a full season from late September to early December, which aligns with a standard NFL season.\n\nBut in Row 11 (November 30), the game was in overtime. Are there any other games in 1975 where they went into overtime?\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: result w 37-33 \u2013 probably not OT\nRow 2: result w23-13 \u2013 no OT mentioned\nRow 3: loss, but result is l14-38 \u2013 no OT\nRow4: loss, l9-20 \u2013 no OT\nRow5: win, 16-15 \u2013 likely not OT\nRow6: loss, l13-26 \u2013 no OT\nRow7: loss, l17-42 \u2013 no OT\nRow8: loss, l16-17 \u2013 no OT\nRow9: win, 27-17 \u2013 no OT\nRow10: loss, l21-35 \u2013 no OT\nRow11: win in OT, 13-10 (OT) \u2013 yes, one OT game\nRow12: loss, l10-17 \u2013 no OT\nRow13: win, 25-10 \u2013 no OT\nRow14: loss, l13-14 \u2013 no OT\n\nSo only Row 11 shows an OT result. Therefore, in the 1975 season, the Broncos went to overtime only once.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"in 1975, the Denver Bronco go in overtime only 1 time.\" So if that's accurate based on the table, then it's TRUE.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because the dates in the table don't align with 1975. For example, November 30, 2014 is way after 1975. Maybe the table represents multiple years, not just 1975. If that's the case, then the claim isn't about all games but specifically about 1975.\n\nSo perhaps I need to focus only on games in 1975. But without knowing which rows correspond to 1975, it's tricky. Alternatively, if the table is supposed to represent 1975, then maybe each row is a game that season.\n\nBut given that the dates include November and December, which would be later than 1975, I'm confused. Maybe the table isn't from 1975 but from another year, making the claim's reference incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is misformatted, and each row is not a separate year. But without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nAssuming that all the games in the table are from 1975, then only Row 11 was an OT game. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE if they only had one overtime game that season.\n\nBut given the dates don't make sense for 1975, maybe the claim is incorrect because the table doesn't reflect 1975 at all. So the actual answer might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The user wants me to analyze a fictional scenario where I have this table and need to determine if the Broncos only had one OT game in 1975.\n\nSo based on the table provided, which may or may not be 1975, but assuming each row is a separate game within the same season, then only Row11 had an OT result. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident because the dates don't align with 1975. It's possible that the table represents multiple years, and the claim about 1975 isn't accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, since only one game in the table shows an OT result (Row11), and assuming all games are within 1975, then the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Broncos played in overtime only once during the 1975 season. This was a single game, specifically against the San Diego Chargers on November 30, which they won by a score of 13-10 in overtime.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true.",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 1975 , the denver bronco finish the season with a loss at the miami orange bowl\". So, the Denver Broncos played in the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975 and lost that game, ending their season with that loss.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games for the Broncos. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. I need to check if any of these rows match the claim.\n\nI notice that in row 14, which is week 14, the opponent is the Miami Dolphins, the result is a loss (13 - 14), and the game site is the Miami Orange Bowl. The date is December 20, 1975 if we consider the current year as 2023 because the table seems to be from 2023, but that might not matter. However, the key point is whether this game in week 14 was the last of the season.\n\nLooking through all the rows up to row 14, it's the last one listed, which would imply that it's the final game of the 1975 season if that's indeed week 14. So, if the Broncos lost this game at the Miami Orange Bowl in week 14, then their season ended with a loss there.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because row 14 matches all the conditions: opponent (Miami Dolphins), result (loss), and game site (Miami Orange Bowl). It's important to verify that this was indeed the last game of the season. Since it's week 14 and there are no later weeks listed in the table, it's reasonable to conclude that this was the final game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by row 14, which shows a loss against the Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl during week 14.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, their longest streak of wins was just one game.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list the games from week 1 onwards in the 1975 season.

This is a streak of 2, so if this happened in 1975, the claim would be false.\n\nSince week 2 is within the 1975 season and it shows a second win after a first win, the Broncos did have at least two wins in a row that season. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if the Denver Broncos had any consecutive wins in the 1975 season.\n\n- **Week 1**: Win (1-0)\n- **Week 2**: Win (2-0)\n\nThis shows two consecutive wins, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and the claim itself. The claim says: \"the lowest attendance for at denver bronco game in 1975 be at the mile high stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should analyze each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: It claims that the lowest attendance at a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at Mile High Stadium. So, I need to find games from 1975 where the Broncos played against another team and check their attendances, especially focusing on games hosted at Mile High Stadium.\n\n2. **Looking at the Table Structure**: The table provided has data from week 1 to week 14, but looking at the dates, it seems to cover September through December 2019 or so, not 1975. However, the claim is about 1975, which isn't covered in this table. So, I might have an issue here.\n\n3. **Checking for Relevant Data**: The table doesn't include any games from 1975. It starts with games in September 2019 and goes up to December 2019. Therefore, there's no data about the Broncos' games in 1975, let alone their attendances at Mile High Stadium.\n\n4. **Impact on the Claim**: Since the table doesn't have any relevant information for 1975, it can't confirm or deny whether the lowest attendance was at Mile High Stadium during that year. There's no data to support the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without any relevant data in the table, the claim cannot be verified as TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim about the 1975 Denver Broncos game attendances is not supported by the provided table, which lacks data from that year. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have this task where I need to determine if the claim \"in 1975, the Denver Broncos went into overtime only twice\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions the Denver Broncos going into overtime in 1975, specifically that they did so only twice. So, I need to check if there are any games listed in the table for 1975 where they went into overtime. If not, then the claim would be FALSE; if yes, and only twice, it's TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table provided, all the rows have \"week\" numbers, dates starting from September 21st, 2023, onward, which suggests that these games are taking place in a recent season, probably the 2023 NFL season. There\u2019s no mention of any games occurring in 1975. The earliest week is Week 1 on September 21, and the latest is Week 14 on December 20, 2023.\n\nSince all the dates are in 2023, there's no way that these games could have taken place in 1975. Therefore, the claim can't be supported by the data in this table because the games listed don't align with the year mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, considering the structure required for the answer: I need to return a JSON object with \"answer\" and \"relevant_cells\". Since there are no relevant cells supporting the claim (no games in 1975), the answer is FALSE. The \"relevant_cells\" would be empty because none of the rows provided have any bearing on the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should state that the claim is FALSE with an empty list of relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim is talking about a specific year, 1975, and stating that in any loss that season, the Broncos scored their highest points with 15. So, I need to check if there was a game where they lost but still scored 15 points or more, and whether this is the maximum for that year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a game played by the Denver Broncos. Each row has columns like week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The 'result' column shows whether they won ('w') or lost ('l'), along with the score.\n\nSo my first step is to find all games in 1975 where they lost. Wait, but the table doesn't specify the year. Hmm, that's a problem because the claim refers to 1975, but the table has dates from September 21, 2023 onwards, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, looking at the data again, each row's date is something like September 21, 2024? No, wait, that can't be right because the claim is about 1975.\n\nWait, hold on. I think there might be a confusion here. The table provided has dates like September 21, which I assume are game dates. But if the games are in September 2023, then it's not relevant to 1975. That can't be. So perhaps this is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to create a table for 1975 games, but the data is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the problem statement, the task is to determine if the claim about 1975 is true based on the given table, which seems to be from 2023 or later. So this seems contradictory because the dates in the table are much later than 1975. Therefore, perhaps there's an issue here.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check again. The table has rows with week numbers, dates like September 21, and opponents like Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, etc. The results show wins and losses with scores. So the games in the table are likely from 2023 or later because of the current opponents and game sites.\n\nBut the claim is about 1975. That suggests that either the table is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to check if the Broncos scored their highest loss points as 15 in 1975 based on some other data, but the provided table doesn't align with that year.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about 1975, so I need to see if any game in 1975 where the Broncos lost had them scoring 15 points. If such a game exists and it's their highest in losses for that season, then it would be TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nBut looking at the table, all the dates are much later than 1975. So none of these games are from 1975. Therefore, there's no data in the table to verify or deny the claim about 1975. Hence, the claim cannot be fully supported by the given data because it refers to a different year entirely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the table is supposed to represent historical data from 1975, but the dates are incorrect. If that's the case, then I might need to look for games where the Broncos lost and their score was 15 or more.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Lost? No, result is W.\nRow 2: Lost? No, W.\nRow 3: Lost, score L 14-38. So they scored 14 points in a loss.\nRow 4: Lost, score L 9-20. Scored 9 points.\nRow 5: Won.\nRow 6: Lost, score L 13-26. Scored 13.\nRow 7: Lost, score L 17-42. Scored 17.\nRow 8: Lost, score L 16-17. Scored 16.\nRow 9: Lost, but wait no, row 9's result is W 27-17. So they won that game.\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the 'result' column shows 'w' for wins and 'l' for losses. So in each row:\n\nRow 1: W\nRow 2: W\nRow 3: L\nRow 4: L\nRow 5: W\nRow 6: L\nRow 7: L\nRow 8: L\nRow 9: W\nRow10: L\nRow11: W\nRow12: L\nRow13: W\nRow14: L\n\nSo the lost games are rows 3,4,6,7,8,10,12,14.\n\nLooking at the scores in these lost games:\n\n- Row3: 14\n- Row4:9\n- Row6:13\n- Row7:17\n- Row8:16\n- Row10: points? Wait, the result is L but what's the score. Let me check each row's 'result' and 'score':\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, it says the task is to determine if the claim about 1975 is true based on the given table.\n\nBut the table seems to have games from much later years. Therefore, unless the table is misaligned with the correct year, there's no way to verify the 1975 claim because all the data points are after that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dates in the table are incorrect and should represent 1975. But without knowing that, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, providing a table for a different year, but asking about 1975. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the dates in the table are from 1975 and proceed accordingly.\n\nBut logically, if all games are after 2023, then none can be from 1975. So unless there's an error in the problem setup, the claim cannot be verified with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to look at the current Broncos' history in 2024 or so and see if they had a loss where they scored 15 points as their highest in that season. But again, that's speculative.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the 'result' column for each game:\n\nRow1: W 21-20\nRow2: W 30-17\nRow3: L 14-38 (so Broncos scored 14)\nRow4: L 9-20 (scored 9)\nRow5: W 24-23\nRow6: L 13-26 (scored 13)\nRow7: L 17-42 (scored 17)\nRow8: L 16-17 (scored 16)\nRow9: W 27-17\nRow10:L 21-35\nRow11:W 24-23\nRow12:L 20-31\nRow13:W 38-31\nRow14:L 17-26\n\nLooking at the lost games:\n\nRow3:14, Row4:9, Row6:13, Row7:17, Row8:16, Row10:21, Row12:20, Row14:17.\n\nThe highest score in a loss is 21 points (from row10). So if the claim was that they scored their highest loss with 15, but here it's higher than that. However, since all these games are not from 1975 but likely from 2023 or later, this might not be relevant.\n\nBut assuming we have to check for 1975, and there's no data in the table from that year, then the claim cannot be supported.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm supposed to assume that the table is about 1975 but the dates are incorrect, then look for any loss where they scored 15 or more points. From the lost games:\n\nRow3:14, which is less than 15.\n\nRow4:9, nope.\n\nRow6:13, nope.\n\nRow7:17, which is above 15.\n\nSo in that case, if the claim was that their highest loss was with 15 or more points, it's not true because they had a game where they lost and scored 17. So the claim would be false.\n\nBut again, since the table doesn't align with 1975, this is all speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, without any data from 1975 in the table, I cannot verify the claim. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the Denver Broncos scored their highest points in a loss as 15 during the 1975 season cannot be verified based on the provided table, as it contains no relevant historical data from that year. Therefore, the claim remains unsupported.\n\nAnswer: The claim is unsupported by the provided data.",

The key columns to look at are 'week', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', 'game site', 'record', and 'attendance'.\n\nI'm trying to find if there's a game in 1975 where the Broncos played against someone at the Miami Orange Bowl with a win, which would mean their record went up after that game.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table provided, all the dates are from September 21, 2019, onwards. The week numbers go up to week 14, and I don't see any rows with the year 1975. That makes me think that this table is for a recent season, not in 1975.\n\nSo, the first thing is that there's no data in this table from 1975. All games are after September 21, 2019. Therefore, it's impossible for the Broncos to have played at the Miami Orange Bowl in 1975 because they didn't play any games then.\n\nNext, I should check if any of the rows refer to 1975 or the Miami Orange Bowl. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Week 1: September 21, 2019\n- Week 2: September 29, 2019\n- ... and so on up to week 14: December 20, 2019\n\nNo games are listed in 1975, so the claim about 1975 is not supported by this table.\n\nAdditionally, looking for any mention of the Miami Orange Bowl as a game site:\n\n- Row 14 mentions 'miami orange bowl' but that's from December 20, 2019.
