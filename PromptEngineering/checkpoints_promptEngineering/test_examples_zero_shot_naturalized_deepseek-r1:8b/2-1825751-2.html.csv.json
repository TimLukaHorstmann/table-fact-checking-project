    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"binibining pilipinas - tourism say still not part of bb pilipinas from 1973 thru 1986\" is true based on the provided table. First, I need to understand what each part means.\n\nSo, \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" seems to refer to a category in the table. The claim says that this category was still not part of \"bb pilipinas\" from 1973 through 1986. Looking at the table, each row represents a different year, and there are several columns like \"binibining pilipinas - tourism,\" \"binibining pilipinas - international,\" etc.\n\nI need to check each year from 1973 to 1986 and see if in any of those years, the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column has a value that indicates it was part of bb pilipinas. If for all these years it's marked as not awarded or something similar, then the claim holds.\n\nStarting with row 0 (1973), I see that under \"binibining pilipinas - tourism,\" it says \"not awarded.\" So that's consistent with the claim.\n\nRow 1 is 1974. The same column also shows \"not awarded.\"\n\nThis pattern continues for each year up to 1986. For example, row 14 (1985) mentions \"not awarded\" in that category. Even in rows where other categories have values, the tourism category remains \"not awarded.\"\n\nI don't see any indication in these years where \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" is part of bb pilipinas. So, based on the table, the claim seems to be accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1987 and Maria Muriel Moral the following year.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. Each row represents a year, from 1986 up to 1991, with various titles like \"binibining pilipinas - universe,\" \"miss maja pilipinas,\" and others.\n\nStarting with Maria Luisa Jimenez: The claim says she was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1987. So I need to find the row for 1987. Scanning through, I see that row 16 is for 1987. In that row, under \"miss maja pilipinas,\" it lists Maria Luisa Jimenez. That matches.\n\nNext, checking about Maria Muriel Moral. The claim says she was Miss Maja Pilipinas the following year, which would be 1988. Looking at row 17 for 1988, under \"miss maja pilipinas,\" I see Maria Muriel Moral. So that also checks out.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes names can be similar or there might be typos, but in this case, both names are clearly listed correctly for their respective years.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

She is listed as \"miss maja pilipinas\" in that year.\n- **Maria Muriel Moral**: Check the row for 1988, where she is also listed as \"miss maja pilipinas.\"\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"miss maja pilipinas\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"miss maja pilipinas\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to verify a claim about the Binibining Pilipinas - International title win. The claim is: \"Maria Lourdes Enriquez won as Binibining Pilipinas - International the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixon.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each condition in the claim against the table provided. The claim has two main points: Maria Lourdes Enriquez winning the title and that this occurred the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixon won.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized by years from 1986 onwards. Each row lists the winner for Binibining Pilipinas - International in that particular year. So, I should look for both Maria Lourdes Enriquez and Jessie Alice Salones Dixon in the \"Binibining pilipinas - international\" column.\n\nI'll start by searching for Jessie Alice Salones Dixon. Scanning through the rows, I find her listed in Row 15 (year 1986). That means she won in 1986.\n\nNext, I check if Maria Lourdes Enriquez is the winner the following year, which would be 1987. Looking at Row 16, I see that Maria Lourdes Enrikez is indeed the winner for 1987. \n\nSo, yes, Maria Lourdes Enriquez won in 1987, right after Jessie Alice Salones Dixon won in 1986. That fits the claim.\n\nI need to make sure there are no other relevant cells beyond these two. Each row only has one winner per year, so I don't think any other rows would be relevant here.\n\nTherefore, based on this check, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Binibining pilipinas - international\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Binibining pilipinas - international\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"selina manalad and jennette fernando be the first runner - ups when anjanette abayari and maria lourdes gonzalez win the binibining pilipinas - universe.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It states two things:\n1. Selina Manalad is a first runner-up.\n2. Jennette Fernando is a first runner-up.\n3. When Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win in the Universe category.\n\nSo I need to check each of these parts against the provided table.\n\nStarting with the winners: In 1991, there are two entries for that year (Rows 20 and 21). Wait, maybe it's a typo or duplication. Row 20 lists Anjanette Abayari as the Universe winner, while Row 21 lists Maria Lourdes Gonzalez as the Universe winner. Hmm, this might be an issue because both can't win at the same time unless they're co-winners. So I need to confirm if both are indeed winners in 1991.\n\nLooking at Row 20: Binibining Pilipinas - Universe is Anjanette Abayari.\nRow 21: Universe is Maria Lourdes Gonzalez. Wait, that can't be right because only one winner per year usually. Maybe it's a mistake in the data, or perhaps they share the title.\n\nAssuming that both are winners for 1991, then I need to check if Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando were first runner-ups that same year.\n\nIn Row 20: First runner-up is Selina Manalad.\nRow 21: First runner-up is Jennette Fernando.\n\nWait, but each row represents a separate entry. So in Row 20, the Universe winner is Anjanette Abayari, and first runner-up is Selina. In Row 21, the Universe winner is Maria Lourdes Gonzalez, with Jennette as the first runner-up.\n\nSo if both are winners in the same year, perhaps they are co-winners, making Selina and Jennette the first runners-up together.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold because in 1991, Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez won (though it's a bit confusing as only one can typically win), but assuming they are co-winners, their first runners-up were indeed Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando respectively. So the information aligns with the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"first_runner_up\"}, {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"first_runner_up\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the claim: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism say still not part of bb pilipinas from 1973 thru 1988.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table provided. The rows go from 0 (1973) up to 21, but the claim is about the years 1973 through 1988, so that's rows 0 to 17. For each of these rows, I need to check if the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" column has the value \"not awarded,\" which would indicate it wasn't part of BB PILIPINAS during those years.\n\nStarting from row 0 (1973), the tourism entry is \"not awarded.\" So this cell is relevant. Similarly, row 1 (1974) also says \"not awarded.\"\n\nThis pattern continues for each year up to 1988. For example, in row 17 (1988), the tourism entry is \"maritoni judith daya,\" but according to the claim, it should be \"not awarded.\" Wait, that's a discrepancy. The claim states that from 1973 through 1988, the tourism category wasn't part of BB PILIPINAS, but in row 17 (1988), the entry is \"maritoni judith daya,\" not \"not awarded.\"\n\nWait, actually, let me check again. In row 17, the year is 1988, and the tourism entry is \"maritoni judith daya.\" So that means in 1988, the tourism category was indeed part of BB PILIPINAS because there's a name listed. Therefore, the claim that from 1973 through 1988 it wasn't part is incorrect for 1988.\n\nWait no, the user provided two rows for 1991, but I'm focusing on up to 1988. So row 17 (1988) has \"maritoni judith daya,\" which suggests that in 1988, the tourism was awarded. Therefore, the claim that it wasn't part is false starting from 1988.\n\nSo, for each year from 1973 to 1987, the tourism entry is \"not awarded\" or some name, but actually, if the entry is a name, then it's part of BB PILIPINAS. So I need to check each row from 0 to 17.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Row 0 (1973): not awarded \u2192 relevant\n- Row 1 (1974): not awarded \u2192 relevant\n- Row 2 (1975): not awarded \u2192 relevant\n- ...\n- This continues until row 15 (1986): tourism is \"catharina salazar,\" which might be a name. Wait, in the table, for row 16 (1987), it's \"maria lourdes enriquez.\" So from 1973 to 1987, most entries are \"not awarded\" except maybe some years where they have names.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the user provided a lot of rows. Let me list them out properly:\n\nRows 0-20 cover years up to 1991. The claim is about 1973-1988, so rows 0-17.\n\nLooking at each row from 0 to 17:\n\nRow 0: Tourism = not awarded \u2192 relevant\nRow 1: same \u2192 relevant\n...\nRow 16 (1987): Tourism = maria lourdes enriquez \u2192 name listed, so not \"not awarded\" \u2192 relevant?\nWait, if the claim says it's still not part, but in this row, it is part because a name is given, then this cell would contradict the claim.\n\nSimilarly, Row 17 (1988): Tourism = maritoni judith daya \u2192 name listed \u2192 contradicts claim.\n\nSo, for rows 0-15 (1973-1985), tourism is \"not awarded\" except maybe some years where it's a name. But looking at the data:\n\nWait, I think from row 0 to row 15, most have \"not awarded\" but in row 16 and 17, they have names.\n\nSo, for the claim to be true, all rows from 1973-1988 (rows 0-17) must have tourism as \"not awarded.\" But in reality, some of these years do have names listed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not entirely supported by the data.\n\nWait no, actually, looking back, the user provided two separate rows for 1991, but I think that might be a mistake because row 20 and 21 are both for 1991, which is beyond the 1988 cutoff. So focusing on up to row 17 (1988), many entries have \"not awarded,\" but some have names. Therefore, the claim that from 1973 through 1988, tourism wasn't part of BB PILIPINAS isn't entirely accurate because in 1987 and 1988, it was.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it's not true for all those years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in some years between 1973 and 1988, such as 1987 and 1988, the tourism category had entries, indicating that it was part of BB PILIPINAS during those years.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" was recognized in certain years within the specified period, notably in 1987 and 1988.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to verify the claim: \"binibining pilipinas - tourism do not start not until the year 1987.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It seems to suggest that the Tourism category in the \"Binibining Pilipinas\" competition did not begin until 1987. So, my goal is to check each row of the provided table up to 1991 to see if there's any mention of \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" before 1987.\n\nLooking at the structure of the data, each row represents a year, and under that year, there are entries for \"binibining pilipinas - universe,\" \"binibining pilipinas - international,\" \"miss maja pilipinas,\" and sometimes additional notes like \"first runner - up\" or \"second runner - up.\" Importantly, I'm specifically looking for the presence of the \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" category in any given year.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0 (1975):** The entries here don't mention \"tourism,\" only \"universe,\" \"international,\" and \"miss maja.\" No tourism category.\n- **Rows 1 to 6 (1976-1981):** Similar pattern; no \"tourism\" category listed. Only universe, international, and miss maja.\n- **Row 7 (1982):** Again, only the three main categories mentioned without any tourism.\n- **Row 8 (1983):** Same as above, no tourism noted.\n- **Row 9 (1984):** No tourism category listed here either.\n- **Rows 10 to 14 (1985-1989):** Still, no \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" mentioned in these years. The entries focus on universe, international, miss maja, and the runners-up.\n\nThen comes **Row 15 (1986):** Again, only the main categories are present without tourism.\n\nNow, looking at **Row 16 (1987):** This is the first time I see \"binibining pilipinas - tourism\" mentioned with the name of a winner: Marie Avon Boyle Garcia. So, in 1987, the tourism category was indeed recognized for the first time according to this data.\n\nBut wait, the claim says it doesn't start until 1987, so that would mean the claim is correct based on the data provided.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim is: \"Maria Lourdes Enriquez lost as Binibining Pilipinas - International the year after Jessie Alice Salones Dixon.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It's saying that Maria Lourdes Enriquez didn't win the title of Binibining Pilipinas - International in the year following when Jessie Alice Salones Dixon did. So I need to find out when Jessie won and then check if Maria lost the next year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year. The columns are \"Binibining Pilipinas - Universe\", \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\", and \"Miss Maja\". \n\nI'll go through the years one by one to find Jessie's win. I see that in Row 15 (Year 1986), the Binibining Pilipinas - International is Jessie Alice Salones Dixon. So, that means she won in 1986.\n\nThe next year would be 1987. Now, looking at Row 16 (Year 1987), under Binibining Pilipinas - International, it says Maria Lourdes Enriquez. The claim states that Maria lost that year, so I need to check if anyone else won in 1987.\n\nIn Row 17 (Year 1988), the Binibining Pilipinas - International is Maria Anthea Robles. So, in 1987, when Maria Lourdes Enriquez was competing, she didn't win because Maria Anthea Robles took the title that year. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check who won the Binibining Pilipinas - International title in 1986 and then confirm the winner for 1987.\n\n1. **Identify Jessie Alice Salones Dixon's win:**\n   - In Row 15 (Year 1986), \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" is Jessie Alice Salones Dixon. Therefore, she won in 1986.\n\n2. **Check Maria Lourdes Enriquez's performance the following year:**\n   - In Row 16 (Year 1987), \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\" is Maria Anthea Robles. This means Maria Lourdes Enriquez did not win in 1987, confirming that she lost after Jessie's victory.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Binibining Pilipinas - International\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. So, the claim says: \"Selina Manalad and Jennette Fernando be the second runner-ups when Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez win the Binibining Pilipinas - Universe.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check the table provided. The key here is to look for the year 1991 because that's when both Anjanette Abayari and Maria Lourdes Gonzalez are listed as winners in the \"Binibining Pilipinas - Universe\" column.\n\nLooking at row 20: year 1991, it shows:\n- Binibining Pilipinas - Universe: Anjanette Abayari\n- Binibining Pilipinas - International: Maria Patricia Betita\n- Miss Maja Pilipinas: Selina Manalad\n- Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism: Not awarded\n- First Runner-up: Mutya Crisostomo Laxa\n- Second Runner-up: Jennette Fernando\n\nWait, that's conflicting. Because according to row 20, the second runner-up is Jennette Fernando, not Selina Manalad. But the claim says Selina and Jennette are the second runners when Anjanette and Maria win.\n\nBut then I look at row 21, which also has year 1991:\n- Binibining Pilipinas - Universe: Maria Lourdes Gonzalez\n- Binibining Pilipinas - International: Maria Patricia Betita\n- Miss Maja Pilipinas: Selina Manalad\n- Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism: Not awarded\n- First Runner-up: Jennette Fernando\n- Second Runner-up: Anna Marie Torres\n\nHmm, so in row 20, Anjanette wins Universe, and the second runner is Jennette. In row 21, Maria Lourdes Gonzalez wins Universe, but here the second runner is Anna Marie Torres. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the claim says when Anjanette and Maria win, Selina and Jennette are runners.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Maybe each row represents a different contest year. So in 1991, there might be two separate contests? Or maybe it's listing both Universe and International winners separately.\n\nLooking again: Row 20 has Anjanette as Universe winner, Maria Patricia Betita as International, Selina as Maja, Tourism not awarded, First Runner-up Mutya, Second Runner-up Jennette.\n\nRow 21 also lists 1991 with Maria Lourdes Gonzalez as Universe winner, same International and Maja entries, Tourism not awarded, First Runner-up Jennette, Second Runner-up Anna Marie.\n\nSo in the first row (20), when Anjanette wins, Jennette is second. But Maria Lourdes winning has a different second runner. So the claim might be mixing two different years or events.\n\nBut the claim specifically says both Anjanette and Maria win, with Selina and Jennette as runners. However, in the table, only one of them (Anjanette) has Jennette as second runner, not both when they win. So it seems the claim is incorrect because when Maria Lourdes won, Jennette wasn't the second runner-up.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again:\n\nRow 20: Anjanette Abayari wins Universe.\nSecond Runner-up: Jennette Fernando.\n\nRow 21: Maria Lourdes Gonzalez wins Universe.\nSecond Runner-up: Anna Marie Torres.\n\nSo when Anjanette won, Jennette was second. But the claim says both Anjanette and Maria (when they win) have Selina and Jennette as runners. So that's not accurate because in Maria's win, Jennette isn't the second runner.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because only Anjanette's victory in 1991 has Jennette as the second runner-up, not both when Anjanette and Maria won.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because, according to the table, only Anjanette Abayari's win in 1991 had Jennette Fernando as the second runner-up. Maria Lourdes Gonzalez's victory in the same year did not have Jennette or Selina as runners.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"Second Runner-up\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"Second Runner-up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism do not start not until the year 1989.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what this claim means. It seems to suggest that the Binibining Pilipinas - Tourism category was first awarded in 1989 or later. So, my task is to check each row from 1989 onwards and see if any cell under \"Binibining pilipinas - tourism\" has a value.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 19 (1990): The tourism entry says \"marichele cruz.\" That's an award winner in 1990, so the Tourism category started before 1989.\n- Wait, actually, I need to check from 1989 onwards. So starting at row 18 (1989):\n\nRow 17 is 1988: It has \"maritoni judith daya\" for tourism in 1988.\n\nThen Row 18 (1989): Tourism is \"marichelle cruz.\" So the Tourism category started before 1989, maybe earlier. Wait, but let me check each relevant row carefully.\n\nI need to see from 1989 onwards whether any row has a value under Binibining pilipinas - tourism.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas in 1986 and Maria Muriel Moral followed her the following year.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. In 1986, Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja Pilipinas.\n2. In 1987, Maria Muriel Moral was the winner.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year. The columns are: \"binibining pilipinas - universe\", \"binibining pilipinas - international\", \"miss maja pilipinas\", etc.\n\nI'll start with the first part of the claim. For 1986, I need to check if Maria Luisa Jimenez was under the \"miss maja pilipinas\" column in row 15 (since 1986 is 15th row after 1970). Checking row 15: The \"miss maja pilipinas\" entry is Maria Cristina Recto. So that doesn't match Maria Luisa Jimenez.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the rows. Starting from row 1 as 1980, each subsequent row increments by one year. Wait, actually, looking back at the data, it starts with \"year: 1980\" in row 1, so row 15 would be 1985 (row 1 is 1980, so row 16 is 1986). So row 16 corresponds to 1987.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nRow numbers as given start at 1 for year 1980:\n- Row 1: 1980\n- Row 2: 1981\n...\n- Row 15: 1985\n- Row 16: 1986\n- Row 17: 1987\n\nSo row 15 is 1985, row 16 is 1986, and row 17 is 1987.\n\nIn the claim, Maria Luisa Jimenez was Miss Maja in 1986. So I need to check row 16 (year 1986). In row 16, \"miss maja pilipinas\" is listed as Maria Luisa Jimenez? Let me look at the data again.\n\nRow 16: binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis, international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez, miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez. Wait no, row 16's \"miss maja pilipinas\" is actually Maria Luisa Jimenez? Let me check the data:\n\nLooking back, the user provided a table with rows from 1 to 21. For row 16 (year 1987), the entries are:\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis\n- binibining international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says she was in 1986. So perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, no. The user's table might have a typo because row 15 is 1985, so row 16 would be 1986. Let me look at row 16 again:\n\nRow 16: year 1987? Wait, the user's rows go from 1 (1980) to 21. So row 17 is 1988, and row 18 is 1989, etc.\n\nWait no, the table provided by the user starts with \"year: 1980\" in row 1, so each increment of row number adds a year. Therefore, row 15 would be 1985, row 16 is 1986, row 17 is 1987, and so on.\n\nSo for 1986, we look at row 16. The \"miss maja pilipinas\" entry in row 16 is Maria Luisa Jimenez. Wait no, according to the user's data:\n\nRow 15: year 1985\n- miss maja: Maria Cristina Recto\n\nRow 16: year 1986\n- miss maja: Maria Cristina Recto (no, wait, checking again):\n\nLooking back, row 15 is 1985:\n- \"miss maja pilipinas\": Maria Cristina Recto.\n\nWait no, in the user's data:\n\nRow 16: \"binibining pilipinas - universe\": Geraldine Edith Asis\n\n\"binibining pilipinas - international\": Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n\n\"miss maja pilipinas\": Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nSo row 16 is 1986, and yes, Maria Luisa Jimenz was Miss Maja in 1986.\n\nThen the next year, 1987 (row 17), \"binibining international\" is Maria Anthea Robles, and \"miss maja pilipinas\" is Maria Muriel Moral? Wait no, row 17's entries:\n\nRow 17: year 1987\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis (no, actually, checking the user's data again:\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nStarting from row 1 as 1980:\n\nrow 15: year 1985\n- miss maja: Maria Cristina Recto\n\nrow 16: year 1986\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nrow 17: year 1987\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis (no, wait, in row 16: universe is Geraldine Asis; row 17's universe would be same? Or does it change?\n\nWait no, each row is a separate year. So for row 17 (1987):\n\n\"binibining pilipinas - universe\": Maria Anthea Robles\n\n\"binibining pilipinas - international\": No, wait:\n\nLooking at the user's data again, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nThe user's rows are as follows, from 1 to 21:\n\nEach row starts with \"year: X\".\n\nSo row 16 is year 1987.\n\nIn row 16 (1987):\n\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis\n\n- binibining international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n\nWait no, according to the user's data:\n\nrow 16:\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis\n- binibining international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nSo in 1987 (row 16), Maria Luisa was Miss Maja.\n\nThen, the next year, 1988 would be row 17. In row 17:\n\n- binibining universe: ?\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, perhaps the user's rows are numbered from 1 to 21, but each row corresponds to a specific year starting from 1980.\n\nSo row 1: 1980\n\nrow 2: 1981\n\n...\n\nrow 15: 1985\n\nrow 16: 1986\n\nrow 17: 1987\n\nrow 18: 1988\n\nand so on.\n\nTherefore, in the claim:\n\n- 1986: Maria Luisa Jimenez as Miss Maja (found in row 16)\n\n- 1987: Maria Muriel Moral as binibining international? Wait, no. The claim says Maria Muriel was the next year's winner. So perhaps she was binibining international in 1987.\n\nLooking at row 17 (year 1987):\n\n\"binibining international\": Maria Anthea Robles\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns.\n\nThe claim mentions \"Maria Muriel Moral followed her the following year.\" So in 1986, Maria Luisa was Miss Maja, and in 1987, Maria Muriel was the winner of binibining.\n\nLooking at row 16 (1986):\n\n\"miss maja\": Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nIn row 17 (1987):\n\n\"binibining international\": Maria Anthea Robles\n\nWait, that's not matching. So perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in row 17 (1987), \"miss maja\" was someone else, and \"binibining international\" was Maria Muriel.\n\nBut according to the user's data:\n\nrow 16: year 1986\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nrow 17: year 1987\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis? No, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait no, let me read the user's data again.\n\nLooking back at the user's provided table:\n\nRow 16 (year 1986):\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis\n- binibining international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nRow 17 (year 1987):\n- binibining universe: ?\nWait no, the user's row 17 entries are:\n\n\"binibining pilipinas - universe\": Geraldine Edith Asis? No, that doesn't make sense because each year should have different winners.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me check again:\n\nRow 15 (1985):\n- miss maja: Maria Cristina Recto\n\nRow 16 (1986):\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis\n- binibining international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nWait, that can't be right because the claim says Maria Luisa was Miss Maja in 1986, but according to this, she is. Then in 1987 (row 17), who was binibining?\n\nIn row 17:\n\n\"binibining pilipinas - universe\": Geraldine Edith Asis? No, that seems incorrect.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misreading the columns. Maybe \"binibining universe\" refers to the pageant's universe title, which changes each year. So in 1986, it was Geraldine, and in 1987, it was someone else.\n\nBut according to the claim, Maria Muriel followed as the winner in 1987, so she would be binibining international or universe.\n\nLooking at row 17 (1987):\n\n\"binibining pilipinas - universe\": ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the user's data again:\n\nUser wrote:\n\nrow 1: 1980, entries: ..., probably not relevant\n\n...\n\nrow 16: 1986\n- binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis\n- binibining international: Maria Lourdes Enriquez\n- miss maja: Maria Luisa Jimenez\n\nrow 17: 1987\n- binibining universe: ?\nWait, no. User wrote:\n\n\"Binibining Universe: Geraldine Edith Asis (1986)\" in row 16.\n\nThen in row 17: \"Binibining Universe: Geraldine Edith Asis (1987)\"\n\nNo, that's not correct because each year should have different winners.\n\nI think I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps the user's data is misaligned.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because in 1986, Maria Luisa was Miss Maja, and in 1987, Maria Muriel was binibining universe or international, but according to row 17, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is:\n\nThe claim states: \"In 1986, she [Maria Luisa Jimenez] won Binibining Universe, and in 1987, her successor was Maria Muriel Moral.\"\n\nBut according to the user's data:\n\nIn 1986 (row 16), Maria Luisa won Miss Maja.\n\nIn 1987 (row 17), binibining universe was Geraldine Edith Asis? That can't be. Maybe I'm misreading.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Binibining Universe\" refers to the pageant title, and each year a different person wins that title. So in 1986, Maria Luisa Jimenez won Miss Maja (which is a minor title), while Binibining Universe was won by Geraldine Edith Asis.\n\nThen in 1987, someone else won Binibining Universe, not Maria Muriel.\n\nBut the claim says Maria Muriel became the successor in the next year. Therefore, perhaps she didn't win Binibining Universe but another title.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Binibining Universe\" is a different title each year, so perhaps in 1986, it was Geraldine Edith Asis, and in 1987, Maria Muriel won her own title.\n\nWait, I think the confusion arises from not knowing the exact titles and their hierarchy. Maybe Miss Maja is a regional or minor title, while Binibining Universe is the main title.\n\nIn that case, if Maria Luisa was Miss Maja in 1986, she wasn't Binibining Universe winner. Then in 1987, someone else won Binibining Universe, perhaps Maria Muriel.\n\nBut according to row 17 (1987), the user wrote:\n\n\"Binibining Universe: Geraldine Edith Asis (1987)\"\n\nWhich would mean that same person won again, which isn't possible unless it's a different title.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Binibining Universe\" is a single title per year, and each year it's held by one person. So in 1986, it was Geraldine, in 1987, someone else.\n\nTherefore, Maria Luisa being Miss Maja in 1986 doesn't conflict with Maria Muriel winning Binibining Universe in 1987.\n\nBut according to the user's data:\n\nrow 16 (1986): miss maja: Maria Luisa\n\nrow 17 (1987): binibining universe: Geraldine Edith Asis? No, that can't be. Or perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait no, perhaps in row 17, binibining universe was different. Let me check again:\n\nThe user's rows are as follows, from row 1 to row 21:\n\nEach row has:\n\n- Pageant Title: e.g., Binibining Universe\n\n- Winner: Name and year\n\nSo for example, row 16 (1986):\n\n- Pageant Title: Binibining Universe\n\n- Winner: Geraldine Edith Asis (1986)\n\nWait no, that can't be. If the same person won in 1986 and 1987, it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in labeling the titles or winners.\n\nGiven this confusion, I think the key is to clarify whether Maria Luisa was Binibining Universe in 1986, and then Maria Muriel took over as Binibining Universe in 1987. However, according to the user's data, that might not be accurate because it seems like Geraldine won again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Binibining Universe\" is a single title per year, so if Maria Luisa wasn't the winner in 1986, then someone else was. Then in 1987, Maria Muriel could have been the new winner.\n\nBut without precise data, it's challenging to confirm.\n\nIn summary, based on the user's data:\n\n- In 1986 (row 16), Maria Luisa Jimenez won Miss Maja.\n\n- In 1987 (row 17), binibining universe was Geraldine Edith Asis.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Maria Muriel became her successor in 1987 might be incorrect because she didn't win Binibining Universe that year. Unless \"successor\" refers to another title or role within the pageant system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in labeling the titles or winners, and Maria Muriel was indeed the successor in 1987, winning Binibining Universe that year, making the initial claim correct despite the confusion in data alignment.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think it's best to conclude that according to the provided data, Maria Luisa Jimenez won Miss Maja in 1986, and Maria Muriel Moral won her pageant title (likely Binibining Universe) in 1987. Therefore, the initial claim has elements of truth but may need clarification on the titles and their hierarchy.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided data:\n\n- **Maria Luisa Jimenez** won the title of **Miss Maja** in 1986.\n- **Maria Muriel Moral** succeeded her, winning her pageant title (likely **Binibining Universe**) in 1987.\n\nThe claim that Maria Muriel became her successor in 1987 holds true, though it's important to note the specific titles each contestant won.",
