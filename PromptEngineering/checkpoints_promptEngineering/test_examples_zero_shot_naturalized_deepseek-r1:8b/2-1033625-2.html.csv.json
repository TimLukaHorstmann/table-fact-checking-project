    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"On April 30, 1977, Stadion Lehen, Salzburg have a score of 1 - 0 / 2 - 0 / 0 - 3 / 4 - 0 / 6 - 0 / 8 - 0 for the 1978 World Cup Qualifier.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about a specific date, venue, scores, and competition. My task is to check if this information aligns with any row in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized with several columns: date, venue, score, result, and competition. Each row corresponds to a match on that date at that venue. The claim mentions Stadion Lehen, Salzburg, which I can look up in the 'venue' column of the table. \n\nI'll start by searching for \"Stadion Lehen\" in the 'venue' column. Scanning through each row, I notice that rows 15, 17, and 19 mention \"Stadion Lehen, Salzburg.\" These are likely the matches hosted at that venue.\n\nNext, focusing on row 15: it's dated April 30, 1977, which matches the date in the claim. The 'score' column for this row lists multiple scores: 1 - 0, 2 - 0, 0 - 3, 4 - 0, 6 - 0, and 8 - 0. This seems to match exactly with the scores listed in the claim.\n\nThe competition for row 15 is \"1978 World Cup.\" The claim also specifies this as the competition. So, all elements of the claim are met by row 15: the date, venue, scores, and competition.\n\nI should verify if there's only one relevant row or if multiple rows might have overlapping information. In this case, rows 17 and 19 are for different dates (May 28, 1981) and March 24, 1982), so they don't apply to April 30, 1977.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in row 15 of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the score for march 24 1982 be 1 - 1",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim is about a specific score on March 24, 1982. Let me look through each row of the table to see if there's any relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the dates to find March 24, 1982. Scanning each row... Row 34 has the date March 24, 1982. Now, looking at that row, the score is 1 - 0, and the result is 3 - 2. The competition is the 1982 World Cup.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the score for march 24 1982 be 1 - 1.\" So I need to check if the score in that specific row matches the claim. In row 34, the score is 1 - 0, not 1 - 1. That means there's a discrepancy between the claim and the actual data.\n\nI should also make sure I didn't miss any other rows with March 24, 1982. Looking back, the only row around that date is row 34. No other rows have that exact date, so it's definitely just row 34.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the score on March 24, 1982 was 1 - 0, not 1 - 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim states: \"the score at the venue of praterstadion , vienna at the euro 1980 qualifier be 4 - 0\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions \"praterstadion\", \"vienna\", and \"euro 1980 qualifier\". So I'm looking for matches in these categories.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where praterstadion in Vienna during a Euro 1980 qualifier took place.\n\nLooking at Row 28: date is 29 August 1979, venue is praterstadion, Vienna. The competition is Euro 1980 qualifier. The score here is 4-0. This matches all parts of the claim\u2014venue, location, competition, and score. \n\nI should check if there are any other relevant rows, but this seems to be the only one that fits exactly.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because Row 28 supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
