The claim says: \"the tie game number 6 ended with a score of 0 - 3.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. \"Tie game number 6\" likely means the match that is tied as game number 6 in the table. Looking at the table rows, row numbers start from 1 to 20.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where the tie number is 6 and see the score for that game. Let me scan the 'tie no' column:\n\nRow 1: tie no: 1\nRow 2: tie no: replay\nRow 3: tie no: 2\nRow 4: tie no: 3\nRow 5: tie no: 4\nRow 6: tie no: 5\nRow 7: tie no: 6 \u2192 This is the one we're interested in. So, row 7 has tie number 6.\n\nNow, checking the score for that game. In row 7, home team is Luton Town, away team is Ipswich Town. The score column shows \"0 - 3\". That matches the claim's score of 0-3.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other relevant cells related to tie number 6, just in case. But row 7 seems to be the only one with tie no: 6, so it's the only cell needed here.\n\nSo, all the necessary information is present and supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the score in Gillingham's home game on 23 January 1982 was 0 - 1.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table. There are multiple rows, each representing a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date.\n\nI should start by identifying which row corresponds to Gillingham's home game on that specific date. The claim mentions Gillingham as the home team, so I need to find a row where the home team is Gillingham and the date is 23 January 1982.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team Blackpool\nRow 2: Home team Queens Park Rangers\nRow 3: Home team Bristol City\nRow 4: Home team Watford\nRow 5: Home team Gillingham \u2013 this seems relevant. The date here is 23 January 1982, so that's the match in question.\n\nNow, checking the score for that row. Row 5 shows a score of 0 - 1, which matches the claim. So the score is indeed 0-1 as stated.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant rows, just to make sure I haven't missed anything. The next occurrence of Gillingham would be in a replay or another tie number, but since the claim specifies the date and home game, row 5 is the only one that fits.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim should be TRUE because all the details match exactly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the tie game between the home team of huddersfield away team of orient be list as number 15.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into key parts. It mentions a tie (which implies a draw) game, with Huddersfield as the home team and Orient as the away team, specifically listed as number 15.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. My goal is to find if there's a match where Huddersfield (home) vs. Orient (away) with a tie no of 15.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Rows 1-14: Tie numbers 1-13 don't mention either Huddersfield or Orient as home and away, except for row 18 which is tie number 15 but involves Huddersfield and Orient. However, the score there is 1-1, not a draw.\n\nWait, no\u2014row 18 has tie no:15, home team: Huddersfield, away team: Orient, score 1-1. That's not a tie since it's 1-1, but I think in football, a tie (draw) is usually 0-0 or any score where both teams have the same points? Or perhaps just denoted as a draw regardless of the actual score.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a row where Huddersfield is home and Orient is away with a tie no of 15. Let me look again.\n\nRow 18: tie no 15, Huddersfield vs Orient, score 1-1, date 26 Jan. So it's not a tie in the sense of 0-0, but perhaps considered a tie because they didn't win? Or maybe the term \"tie\" here refers to a draw regardless of the actual score.\n\nBut looking at row 19: tie no replay, home team Orient vs Huddersfield, score 2-0. So that's a replay after a previous match.\n\nWait, so in row 18, it's tie number 15 with Huddersfield as home and Orient as away, but the result is 1-1. The claim says \"the tie game,\" implying a draw. But if the score is 1-1, that's a tie, right? Or maybe a tie in the context of the match being a draw regardless of goals.\n\nHowever, row 18 is about Huddersfield vs Orient with tie no 15, but the score isn't 0-0. The claim mentions \"the tie game,\" so maybe it refers to a specific type of tie where both teams have the same number of goals.\n\nLooking back at the table, I don't see any row where Huddersfield is home and Orient is away with a score like 0-0 or other equal scores for tie no 15. The closest is row 18, but it's 1-1, not exactly a tie in terms of goals.\n\nWait, perhaps the term \"tie game\" refers to a draw regardless of the score, so any match where neither team won. In that case, 1-1 would count as a tie. So maybe the claim is referring to row 18 as tie number 15 between Huddersfield and Orient.\n\nBut in the table, row 18 is indeed tie no:15 with Huddersfield (home) vs Orient (away), so it seems to fit. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because there's a match listed as tie number 15 between those two teams.\n\nWait, but I need to ensure that it's specifically a tie game. So if the score is 1-1, does that count as a tie? In football, a draw is when both teams have the same score or the match ends in a draw regardless of the goals. So yes, 1-1 would be considered a tie (draw).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a tie game (1-1) between Huddersfield and Orient listed as number 15.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a match where Huddersfield is the home team against Orient as the away team. In the table, row 18 has tie no:15 with these teams facing each other, resulting in a score of 1-1. This indicates a draw (tie), making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of the claim are relevant to each column in the table. The columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. So, for the claim to be true, there should be a row where the home team is Sunderland, the away team is Liverpool, the date is 23 January 1982, and presumably a score.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll go row by row:\n\n- Row 1: tie no: 1, home: Blackpool, away: Queens Park Rangers. No match between Sunderland and Liverpool here.\n- Row 2: replay, home: Queens Park Rangers, away: Blackpool. Not relevant.\n- Row 3: tie no: 2, home: Bristol City, away: Aston Villa. Not the right teams.\n- Row 4: tie no:3, home: Watford, away: West Ham United. No match here either.\n- Row5: Gillingham vs West Bromwich Albion. Nope.\n- Row6: Sunderland vs Liverpool. This looks promising because the home team is Sunderland and the away team is Liverpool. The date is 23 January 1982, which matches. So this row should be relevant.\n\nWait, let me check if there are any other rows that might also fit or cause confusion. For example, Row7: Luton Town vs Ipswich Town. No. Row8: Shrewsbury Town vs Burnley. Not relevant. Row9: Newcastle United vs Grimsby Town. No match. Row10: Tottenham Hotspur vs Leeds United. Not the right teams.\n\nLooking further, after row6, I don't see any other matches involving Sunderland and Liverpool. The rest of the rows either have different dates or different opponents.\n\nNow, checking if there's a replay or rescheduled match that might affect it. Row17 is a replay between Wrexham and Chelsea, so not relevant here.\n\nSo, the only row where Sunderland plays Liverpool on 23 January 1982 is row6.

Here, the away team is QPR, so this is a match they played on that date.\n\nNow, checking if they scored the most in their game. The score is 0-0, which means both teams scored zero goals. So QPR didn't score any goals in this game. Therefore, they didn't have the highest score; both teams tied with zero.\n\nI don't see any other rows where QPR is either home or away on that date.

The claim says: \"the game with a tie number of 7 ended in a score of 0 - 3.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The tie number refers to the match number in the table. Each row in the table has a \"tie no\" which is probably short for tie number. The score is the result of that game.\n\nSo, the claim specifies two things: the tie number and the score. I need to find a game (row) where the tie number is 7 and the score is 0-3.\n\nLet me look through each row in the table to see if any match both these criteria.\n\nStarting from Row 1, the tie no is 1, so that's not 7. Moving on, Row 2 has tie no: replay, which isn't 7. Similarly, Rows 3 through 6 have tie nos 2 to 5, none of which are 7.\n\nRow 7: tie no: 6, still not 7. \n\nThen, I reach Row 8: tie no: 7. So this is the game with tie number 7. Now, what's the score? The row says home team: shrewsbury town, score: 1 - 0, away team: burnley. Wait, that doesn't match the claim of 0-3.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if any other game later in the table has tie no:7 again or another row with tie number 7. \n\nLooking at Row 9: tie no:8. No, it's 8. Then Row 10: tie no:9. Not 7.\n\nWait a second, I only saw one row with tie no:7, which is Row 8. The score there was 1-0 for shrewsbury town against burnley. That's not 0-3 at all. So maybe the claim is false because the game with tie number 7 doesn't have a score of 0-3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if any other game has tie number 7 and a different score. Let me scan through again. Rows after Row 8: tie no's go up from 9 onwards, so I don't think there's another tie no:7 beyond that.\n\nWait, maybe the table wraps around or something? No, looking at the data, each tie no is sequential, and Row 8 is the only one with tie no:7. Therefore, the claim is false because the game with tie number 7 ended in a 1-0 score, not 0-3.\n\nI think that's it.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the score in Gillingham's home game on 21 January 1982 be 0 - 1.\" \n\nI'll start by identifying key components of this claim:\n1. **Gillingham**: This is the name of the home team.\n2. **Home game**: So, I'm looking for a match where Gillingham is playing at home.\n3. **Date**: The claim specifies 21 January 1982.\n4. **Score**: It should be 0 - 1.\n\nNow, I need to check each row of the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: Home team is Blackpool, so not Gillingham. Date is 23 Jan 1982.\n- **Row 2**: Away team is Blackpool, home is Queens Park Rangers. Not relevant.\n- **Row 3**: Home is Bristol City, away Aston Villa. Not Gillingham.\n- **Row 4**: Home is Watford, away West Ham United. Not Gillingham.\n- **Row 5**: Home is Gillingham, away West Bromwich Albion. Date is 23 Jan 1982. The score here is 0 - 1. But the claim mentions 21 Jan, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, so in Row 5, the date is 23 Jan, not 21 Jan as claimed. So that's a discrepancy. Also, the away team is West Bromwich Albion, but Gillingham is the home team here. The claim says \"Gillingham's home game,\" which matches this row, but the date doesn't.\n\nLet me check if there are any other rows where Gillingham is the home team on 21 Jan. Scanning through:\n\n- **Row 5**: Date is 23 Jan.\n- **Row 6 onwards**: No mention of Gillingham as a home team after that. So, in the table, the only time Gillingham is the home team is on 23 Jan.\n\nTherefore, there's no match where Gillingham plays at home on 21 Jan with a score of 0 - 1. The claim's date doesn't align with any game in the table where Gillingham is involved as the home team.\n\nAdditionally, checking for any possible replay or rescheduled games, but the dates don't show any on 21 Jan either. All relevant ties involving Gillingham are on 23 Jan.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim seems to be false because there's no such game on 21 Jan with that score. There is a game on 23 Jan where Gillingham scores 0 - 1 at home, but not on the date specified in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"17 be the tie no of the game that home team huddersfield town play.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where Huddersfield Town is the home team.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Home team is Blackpool, not Huddersfield.\nRow 2: Home team is Queens Park Rangers, nope.\n...\nContinuing this way until I find Huddersfield Town as the home team. Let's see:\n\nRow 17 mentions Huddersfield Town as the home team against Wrexham on 1 February 1982, and the tie no is replay.\n\nWait, but in the table, Row 18 is tie no: 15 for Huddersfield Town vs Orient. So that must be a different game. Then, looking further down, I see Row 19 where Huddersfield Town plays against Orient again, with tie no: replay and score 1-2.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it earlier. Let me go through each row carefully.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1 to 16 are on 23 January except some on 26th and 1st February.\n\nRow 18 is Huddersfield Town (home) vs Orient with tie no:15 on 26 Jan 1982, score 1-1.\n\nThen Row 19 is tie no: replay for the same teams, Huddersfield Town away vs Orient? Wait, no\u2014Row 19 says home team is Orient, so that's a different game. So Huddersfield's first game is on Row 18 with tie no:15.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking for \"huddersfield town\" in the home team column.\n\nRow 17: away team is Chelsea, so Huddersfield isn't playing here.\n\nRow 18: Home team is Huddersfield Town vs Orient, tie no 15 on 26 Jan 1982. So that's one game with tie number 15.\n\nThen Row 19: Home team is Orient against Huddersfield Town, which is a different match, tie no replay on 1 Feb 1982.\n\nSo in the table, Huddersfield Town has two matches:\n\n- Tie no:15 on 26 Jan (Row 18)\n- Tie no:replay on 1 Feb (Row 19)\n\nWait, but Row 17 is about Wrexham vs Chelsea, so that's not related to Huddersfield.\n\nSo the game where Huddersfield Town plays as home team is:\n\n- Row 18: tie no:15\n- The claim says \"tie no 17.\" So does Huddersfield have a match with tie no 17?\n\nLooking through all the rows, I don't see any row where tie no is 17 and home team is Huddersfield Town. The highest tie number I see is 19, but that's for Orient vs Huddersfield as away.\n\nSo the claim says that tie number 17 is the game where Huddersfield Town is playing at home. But in reality, their match on 26 Jan is tie no:15, and a replay on 1 Feb tie no: replay (which isn't 17). So there's no row with tie no:17 where Huddersfield Town is the home team.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the tie number 17 doesn't exist for that game.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"tie no\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"tie no\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
