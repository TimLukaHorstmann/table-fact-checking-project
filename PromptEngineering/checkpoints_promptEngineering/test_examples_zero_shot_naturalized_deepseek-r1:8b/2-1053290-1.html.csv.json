    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happen in enniskillen , uk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It's stating that the Brighton Hotel Bombing took place in Enniskillen, UK.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a specific event with details like year, location, perpetrator(s), and deaths. My task is to check if any row matches both the event and the location specified in the claim.\n\nStarting with the event name: \"brighton hotel bombing\". I'll search through the table for this exact event name. \n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 14: year 1984, event \"brighton hotel bombing\", location \"brighton , uk\", perpetrator(s) \"ira\", deaths 5.\nSo, this matches both the event and the location from the claim.\n\nThe location in the claim is \"enniskillen , northern ireland\". Checking through the table, I don't see any row that lists the Brighton Hotel Bombing as happening in Enniskillen. All other mentions of the Brighton bombing are in Brighton itself.\n\nSo, the claim incorrectly attributes the location to Enniskillen instead of Brighton. Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the location of the Brighton Hotel Bombing as Enniskillen, while the table shows it occurred in Brighton, UK.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the brighton hotel bombing happened in Brighton, UK\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions an event called the \"brighton hotel bombing\" occurring in Brighton, UK. My task is to find if there's a corresponding row in the table that matches both the event name and location specified in the claim.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row of the table for events related to the Brighton Hotel Bombing. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Attack on the Mosel (ship) in Bremen... Not relevant.\nRow 2: Los Angeles Times bombing... No.\nRow 3: Preparedness Day bombing in SF... No.\nRow 4: Wall Street bombing... No.\nRow 5: B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller... Munich. Not Brighton.\nRow 6: St Nazaire raid... France during wartime. No match.\nRow 7: July Plot... Wolf's Lair, Poland. No.\nRow 8: United Airlines Flight 629... Over Longmont, CO. No.\nRow 9: Aldershot bombing... UK, but not the hotel.\nRow 10: M62 coach bombing in West Yorkshire... Not Brighton.\nRow 11: Birmingham pub bombings... Birmingham. No.\nRow 12: Guildford pub bombings... Guildford. No.\nRow 13: Lucona sinking... Indian Ocean. No.\nRow 14: Brighton Hotel Bombing, location: Brighton, UK. Yes! This matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, so Row 14 is year 1984 with the event \"brighton hotel bombing\" in Brighton, UK, and the perpetrator is IRA. So this row fully supports the claim.\n\nI need to make sure that all parts of the claim are covered. The claim states both the event and the location correctly. The table has a row where both details are present, so it's confirmed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
