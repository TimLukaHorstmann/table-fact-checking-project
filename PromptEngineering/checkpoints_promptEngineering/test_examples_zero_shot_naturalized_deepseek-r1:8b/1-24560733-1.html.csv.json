The claim says, \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The Wildcats (Wildcats points) kept their opponents scoreless, meaning in those games, the opponent scored zero points. And this happened in four games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and the record after that game.\n\nI need to check for all games where the opponent's score is zero because that means Wildcats won while keeping their opponents scoreless. Then count how many such games there are.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent scored 14 points. So not a zero.\nRow 2: Opponent scored 0 points. So this counts as one.\nRow 3: Opponent scored 7. No.\nRow 4: Opponent 0. That's two.\nRow 5: Opponent 0. Three.\nRow 6: Opponent 6. No.\nRow 7: Opponent 13. No.\nRow 8: Opponent 6. No.\nRow 9: Opponent 0. Four.\nRow 10: Opponent 13. No.\n\nSo, in rows 2,4,5,9 the opponent scored zero. That's four games where Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless. So the claim is TRUE because it states that they did this in four games. \n\nWait, but looking back at row 4 and row 5, I should double-check. Row 4: Wildcat points 26, Opponents 0. Yes. Row5: 14-0. Correct. Row9: 36-0. So yes, four times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

The claim says, \"the wildcat lose 1 game in september and 2 game in november.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the games in September. From the table, there are only two September games: row 1 (Sept 20) and row 2 (Sept 27). In row 1, the result is a loss, so that's one game lost in September. Now, does this meet the claim of losing 1 game? Yes, because it's exactly one loss.\n\nNext, I need to check the November games. There are three November games: row 7 (Nov 1), row 8 (Nov 8), and row 10 (Nov 22). The results for these are a loss, win, and loss respectively. So, that's two losses in November. That matches the claim of losing two games in November.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each relevant cell to make sure I'm not missing anything. For September, only row 1 is a loss, so that's one game. In November, rows 7 and 10 are losses, making it two games. So both parts of the claim are true based on the table.\n\nI don't see any other rows that would affect this. The rest of the games in September and November either resulted in wins or just additional information like points and opponent details.

The claim says, \"the wildcat play 2 game in september , 4 game in october , and 4 game in november.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. It mentions the number of games played by the Wildcats in specific months: September, October, and November.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different game with details like date, opponent, result, points, and record. So, each row is a single game.\n\nI need to count how many times the Wildcats played games in September, October, and November based on the table.\n\nStarting with September: The table has rows 1 and 2. Wait, but I should check if these are all in September. Row 1's date is Sept 20, row 2 is Sept 27. So that's two games in September. That matches the claim of 2 games.\n\nNext, October: Looking at the table, rows 3 through 6 are in October. Let me count them: row 3 (Oct 4), row 4 (Oct 11), row 5 (Oct 18), and row 6 (Oct 25). That's four games in October, which matches the claim of 4.\n\nNow, November: The remaining rows are 7 through 10. So, let me count them: row 7 (Nov 1), row 8 (Nov 8), row 9 (Nov 15), and row 10 (Nov 22). That's four games in November as well. Wait, but the claim says \"4 game in november,\" which seems to match.\n\nBut wait a minute, I need to check if all these months are correctly assigned. Let me verify each row:\n\n- Row 1: Sept 20 \u2192 September\n- Row 2: Sept 27 \u2192 September (so two games)\n- Rows 3-6: Oct dates \u2192 October (four games)\n- Rows 7-10: Nov dates \u2192 November (four games)\n\nSo, the claim that Wildcats played 2 in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November seems accurate based on the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data from rows corresponding to September, October, and November.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the most the wildcats outscore an opponent by 36 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. It's about the maximum margin by which the Wildcats have won against their opponents in any game listed in the table. So, I need to look through each row and see the difference between the Wildcats' points and their opponents' points for each game.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: The Wildcats scored 7, the opponent (Ole Miss) scored 14. So the margin is 7 - 14 = -7. Since they lost, this doesn't count towards their wins.\n\nRow 2: They won with 20 points against Cincinnati who scored 0. So the margin here is 20 - 0 = 20.\n\nRow 3: They won against Xavier with 20 points, while Xavier scored 7. The margin is 20 - 7 = 13.\n\nRow 4: Against Georgia, Wildcats won 26-0, so margin is 26.\n\nRow 5: Win over Vanderbilt: 14-0, margin is 14.\n\nRow 6: Win against Michigan State: 7-6, margin is 1.\n\nRow 7: Loss to Alabama: 0-13, margin is -13. Doesn't count as a win.\n\nRow 8: Win over West Virginia: 15-6, margin is 9.\n\nRow 9: Big win against Evansville: 36-0, so margin is 36.\n\nRow 10: Loss to Tennessee: 6-13, margin is -7. Doesn't count.\n\nSo looking at the margins where they won (since it's about outscoring opponents in a game), the margins are 20, 13, 26, 14, 1, 9, and 36. The highest among these is 36 points in row 9.\n\nTherefore, there is indeed a game where the Wildcats outscore their opponent by 36 points. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The columns involved are 'game', 'date', 'opponent', 'result', 'wildcats points', 'opponents', and 'record'. But for the margin, we only care about 'wildcats points' and 'opponents'.\n\nSo in row 9, both 'wildcats points' (36) and 'opponents' (0) are crucial. That's where the 36-point margin comes from.\n\nI should list these two columns for row 9.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 10 game\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It says that in 10 games, the Wildcats (Wildcats) kept their opponents scoreless. That means in each of these 10 games, the opponent's points were zero. So I need to check for 10 games where the opponent's score is zero.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 rows from row 1 to row 10. Each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and the record after that game.\n\nI need to go through each of these 10 games and check the \"opponents\" column for any zero values. If in all 10 games the opponents scored zero, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nStarting with row 1: Opponent is Ole Miss, result is loss, opponents' points are 14. So not zero.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is Cincinnati, result is win, opponents score 0. That's one zero.\n\nRow 3: Xavier, win, opponents scored 7. Not zero.\n\nRow 4: Georgia (9), win, opponents 0. Second zero.\n\nRow 5: Vanderbilt (10), win, opponents 0. Third zero.\n\nRow 6: Michigan State, win, opponents scored 6. Not zero.\n\nRow 7: Alabama (18), loss, opponents scored 13. Not zero.\n\nRow 8: West Virginia, win, opponents 6. Not zero.\n\nRow 9: Evansville, win, opponents 0. Fourth zero.\n\nRow 10: Tennessee, loss, opponents 13. Not zero.\n\nSo in the 10 games listed (rows 1-10), how many have opponents score zero? Let's count:\n\nRow 2: Yes\n\nRow 4: Yes\n\nRow 5: Yes\n\nRow 9: Yes\n\nThat's four games where opponents are scoreless. So it's not all 10 games; only 4 out of 10. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because they didn't keep the opponents scoreless in 10 games.\n\nWait, but the table only has 10 rows. Are these all the games up to November 22? It seems so. So yes, only four times did the Wildcats shut their opponents down. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Wildcats kept their opponents scoreless in 10 games. By examining each of the 10 games in the table, we find that only 4 games (rows 2, 4, 5, and 9) had the opponent's score as zero.

The games are listed from September to November, so I'm focusing on games after October. In row 7, it shows a loss against Alabama on November 1st. That's one game lost in November. So that part of the claim is true.\n\nNext, looking at losses in September. The table has two September games: row 1 and row 2. Row 1 is a loss against Ole Miss on September 20th, which makes it the first game in September where they lost. So there's one loss in September as well.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" That would mean two losses in September and one in November. But from the table, only one loss happened in September (row 1) and one in November (row 7). So the claim is saying there were two losses in September, but according to the table, it's only one.\n\nThis means the claim is incorrect because it claims two September losses when only one occurred.

Therefore, there are not two losses in September as claimed.\n\nSince the claim incorrectly states two September losses, it is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- The relevant row for the November loss is row 7, specifically the \"result\" column.\n- Both rows for September losses (row 1) need their \"result\" checked.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the wildcat play 4 game in september , 2 game in october , and 2 game in november.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim separately. Starting with September: they played 4 games. Let me check the table for September games. The first row is September 20 (game 1), then the next row is September 27 (game 2). Wait, that's only two games in September. But game 3 is on October 4, which is October. So in September, there are only two games, not four. That might mean the claim is false because it says four games in September.\n\nNext, moving to October: the claim says they played two games. Looking at the table, game 3 is October 4 (opponent Xavier), game 4 on October 11 (Georgia), and game 5 on October 18 (Vanderbilt). That's three games in October, not two. So that also doesn't match.\n\nLastly, November: they played two games.

That's four games in November, not two.\n\nSo each part of the claim doesn't hold up. September has two games, October has three, and November has four. The claim says four, two, two respectively, but the actual numbers are different. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the most the wildcats outscore an opponent by 26 points.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see where the Wildcats scored more points than their opponents by a margin of 26 points.\n\nLooking at each game:\n\nRow 1: Wildcats scored 7, opponents had 14. The difference is -7, so that's not it.\nRow 2: Wildcats won 20-0, which is +20 points, but not 26.\nRow 3: They won 20-7, a difference of +13.\nRow 4: Scored 26 against Georgia, who had 0. That's a +26 margin. So this row shows they outscore by 26.\n\nI should check if any other rows have a larger difference. Let's go through the rest:\n\nRow 5: 14-0, so +14.\nRow 6: 7-6, +1.\nRow 7: 0-13, which is a loss, not relevant.\nRow 8: 15-6, +9.\nRow 9: 36-0, +36. Wait, that's a larger margin than 26.\nRow 10: 6-13, which is a loss.\n\nSo the Wildcats actually had a game (Row 9) where they outscored by 36 points, which is more than 26. Therefore, the claim that \"the most they outscore by is 26\" is false because there's a higher margin in another game.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the Wildcats scored at least 26 points more than their opponents. In Row 4, they scored 26-0, and in Row 9, they scored 36-0.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "claim": "the wildcat never score more than 7 point in any game they win",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the wildcat never score more than 7 point in any game they win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim: it's stating that in every game that the Wildcats won, their points were never more than 7. So, to verify this, I need to look at all the games where they won and check if any of those games had them scoring more than 7 points.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with several columns: game number, date, opponent, result (win/loss), Wildcats' points, opponents' points, and their overall record. My focus is on the \"result\" and \"wildcats points\" columns for the games they won.\n\nLet me go through each row to identify the wins:\n\n1. Row 2: They won with 20 points.\n2. Row 3: They won with 20 points.\n3. Row 4: They won with 26 points.\n5. Row 5: They won with 14 points.\n6. Row 6: They won with 7 points.\n8. Row 9: They won with 36 points.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me recount the rows properly because the initial list seems a bit off. The table has rows numbered from 1 to 10. So, I'll list out each game and check if it's a win:\n\n- Game 2: Win, 20 points.\n- Game 3: Win, 20 points.\n- Game 4: Win, 26 points.\n- Game 5: Win, 14 points.\n- Game 6: Win, 7 points.\n- Game 8: Win, 15 points.\n- Game 9: Win, 36 points.\n\nSo, in these games, their points are as follows:\n\n- Game 2: 20 >7 \u2192 This already contradicts the claim.\n- Game 3: 20>7\n- Game4:26>7\n- Game5:14>7\n- Game6:7 which is equal, so that's acceptable\n- Game8:15>7\n- Game9:36>7\n\nSo in several games they won, their points exceeded 7. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should identify the relevant cells for each of these games where they scored more than 7 points in a win. Let me list them:\n\n1. Row 2 (game 2): wildcats points:20\n2. Row3 (game3):20\n3. Row4:26\n5. Row5:14\n6. Row8:15\n9. Row9:36\n\nWait, the rows are numbered from 1 to 10, but in the initial table description, row numbers start at 1 as Row1. So, I need to map each game number to their corresponding row index.\n\nLooking back, the table's first line is:\n\nRow 1: game:1...\nSo Game1 is Row1, Game2 is Row2, etc. Therefore:\n\n- Game2: Row2\n- Game3: Row3\n- Game4: Row4\n- Game5: Row5\n- Game6: Row6\n- Game8: Row8\n- Game9: Row9\n\nWait, the user's table has rows 1 to 10, with game numbers from 1 to 10. So each row corresponds directly to the game number.\n\nSo:\n\n- Game2: Row2, wildcats points:20\n- Game3: Row3, 20\n- Game4: Row4,26\n- Game5:Row5,14\n- Game6:Row6,7 (this one is okay)\n- Game8:Row8,15\n- Game9:Row9,36\n\nSo the games where they scored more than 7 points in a win are:\n\nGame2 (Row2), Game3(Row3), Game4(Row4), Game5(Row5), Game8(Row8), and Game9(Row9).\n\nThus, these rows have the relevant columns: \"result\" to confirm it's a win, and \"wildcats points\" to check if >7.\n\nSo for each of these games, I need to include their row index and column name in the relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row2: result (win), wildcats points\n- Row3: same\n- Row4\n- Row5\n- Row8\n- Row9\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"never score more than 7\", so I need to find all games they won where their points were >7. So any row with a win and points>7.\n\nSo for each of these rows:\n\nRow2: result=win, points=20 \u2192 relevant\nRow3: same\nRow4:26\u2192relevant\nRow5:14\u2192relevant\nRow8:15\u2192relevant\nRow9:36\u2192relevant\n\nWait, but in the table, row6 is a win with 7 points, which is exactly 7. So it's not more than 7, just equal. Therefore, it doesn't count against the claim.\n\nSo, excluding row6.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are rows 2,3,4,5,8,9.\n\nEach of these has a column \"result\" and \"wildcats points\". So for each, I need to include both columns? Or just the specific ones?\n\nWait, the instruction says: determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim. The claim is about the Wildcats' points in games they won, so the key column is \"wildcats points\". But also, we need to check that it's a win, hence the \"result\" column is needed.\n\nTherefore, for each of these rows, both \"result\" and \"wildcats points\" are relevant because we need to confirm two things: it's a win, and their points were over 7.\n\nSo in the JSON response, each relevant cell should include both row index and column name. So for each game, the columns involved are \"result\" and \"wildcats points\".\n\nWait no, perhaps not both. Maybe just \"result\" to confirm it's a win and \"wildcats points\" to check the score.\n\nBut the instruction says: determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim. The claim is about scoring more than 7 in any game they won. So for each game, we need to look at two things: that it was a win (so result), and their points were >7 (so wildcats points).\n\nTherefore, both columns are relevant for those rows where they scored >7 in a win.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user just wants to know which games (i.e., which row indices) need to be checked. So maybe only \"wildcats points\" column is needed because we can check if it's more than 7.\n\nBut I think the correct approach is that both columns are relevant because you have to verify two things: whether it's a win and the score.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"result\" is not needed if the game number is known. But since in the given table, each row has multiple data points, including result, we need to specify which ones to look at.\n\nWait, perhaps the user wants to know which columns are relevant for verifying the claim. So for each game they won where their points >7, both \"result\" (to confirm it's a win) and \"wildcats points\".\n\nTherefore, in the JSON, each relevant cell will have row index and both column names.\n\nBut looking back at the example given by the user in the problem statement, when they had another task, but in this case, maybe I should just include the columns that are needed to verify the claim.\n\nSo for each of these games (rows 2-9 except 6), we need to check two things: was it a win and were their points >7. Therefore, both \"result\" and \"wildcats points\".\n\nThus, in the relevant cells, I should include row index, and both columns.\n\nWait, perhaps that's overcomplicating. Maybe the user just wants to know which games (rows) are relevant because they have wins where points exceed 7. So including row numbers and perhaps noting the columns as \"result\" and \"wildcats points\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the columns to include are \"result\" and \"wildcats points\", but for each of these rows.\n\nSo in the JSON response, I need to list each relevant cell as:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": number,\n  \"columns\": [ \"result\", \"wildcats_points\" ]\n}\n\nBut wait, that might be a way. Alternatively, perhaps just listing the row indices and the column name(s) needed.\n\nAlternatively, for each of these rows, we need to check both columns: result (to confirm it's a win) and wildcats points (to see if >7).\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, I should include for each relevant row:\n\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"columns\": [ \"result\", \"wildcats_points\" ]\n}\n\nSimilarly for rows 3,4,5,8,9.\n\nSo that's how the relevant cells are determined.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the Wildcats scored more than 7 points in several games they won. The relevant cells are those where the game was a win and their score exceeded 7.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"columns\": [\"result\", \"wildcats_points\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"columns\": [\"result\", \"wildcats_points\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"columns\": [\"result\", \"wildcats_points\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"columns\": [\"result\", \"wildcats_points\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"columns\": [\"result\", \"wildcats_points\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"columns\": [\"result\", \"wildcats_points\"]\n  }\n]\n```",
