    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim that \"timo boll win the ittf pro tour men single 3 time between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Timo Boll won the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles three times within the years from 1997 to 2012. So, we need to check if there are at least three instances where Timo Boll won the men's singles event in those years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year and lists various players under different categories like mens singles, womens singles, etc. I'll need to focus specifically on the \"mens singles\" column across the relevant rows (1997 to 2012).\n\nLet me go through each row and note down who won the men's singles each year:\n\nRow 16: 1997 \u2013 Jan-Ove Waldner\nRow 15: 1998 \u2013 Kong Linghui\nRow 14: 1999 \u2013 Vladimir Samsonov\nRow 13: 2000 \u2013 Wang Liqin\nRow 12: 2001 \u2013 Ma Lin, Wang Hao\nWait, actually, in row 12, it's men's doubles: Ma Lin and Wang Hao. So, the mens singles for 2001 might be someone else. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 13 (2000): Mens singles is Wang Liqin.\nRow 14 (1999): Vladimir Samsonov.\nRow 15 (1998): Kong Linghui.\nRow 16 (1997): Jan-Ove Waldner.\n\nNow, from 2002 onwards:\n\nRow 11: 2002 \u2013 Kalinikos Kreanga\nRow 10: 2003 \u2013 Timo Boll\nWait, in row 10, Year 2003, Mens Singles is Timo Boll. So that's one win.\nRow 9: 2004 \u2013 Chen Qi\nRow 8: 2005 \u2013 Timo Boll\nRow 7: 2006 \u2013 Wang Liqin\nRow 6: 2007 \u2013 Wang Hao\nRow 5: 2008 \u2013 Ma Lin\nRow 4: 2009 \u2013 Oh Sang Eun\nRow 3: 2010 \u2013 Timo Boll\nRow 2: 2011 \u2013 Seiya Kishikawa\nRow 1: 2012 \u2013 Jun Mizutani\n\nSo, from the above, Timo Boll won in 2003, 2005, and 2010. That's three times.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"between 1997 and 2012.\" So, I need to make sure that these wins are within those years. Yes, all three are within that timeframe.\n\nTherefore, based on this data, Timo Boll has won the ITTF Pro Tour Men's Singles three times between 1997 and 2012.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the ittf pro tour be host in yokohama 4 time between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Yokohama four times between 1997 and 2012. So I need to check if there were exactly four events in Yokohama during those years as listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific year and location, with details about singles and doubles players. The locations mentioned are mostly 'kobe', 'wakayama', 'chiba', 'yokohama'. I need to focus on rows where the location is Yokohama and the year falls between 1997 and 2012.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: 2012, Kobe \u2013 not Yokohama.\nRow 2: 2011, Kobe \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: 2010, Kobe \u2013 no.\nRow 4: 2009, Wakayama \u2013 no.\nRow 5: 2008, Yokohama \u2013 yes. That's one event in Yokohama.\nRow 6: 2007, Chiba \u2013 no.\nRow 7: 2006, Yokohama \u2013 that's the second.\nRow 8: 2005, Yokohama \u2013 third.\nRow 9: 2004, Kobe \u2013 no.\nRow 10: 2003, Kobe \u2013 no.\nRow 11: 2002, Kobe \u2013 no.\nRow 12: 2001, Yokohama \u2013 that's four. Wait, but I need to count how many times the location is Yokohama between 1997 and 2012.\n\nWait, rows go from Row 1 (2012) down to Row 16 (1997). So let me list out all the Yokohama events first:\n\nRow 5: 2008\nRow 7: 2006\nRow 8: 2005\nRow 12: 2001\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I think there are more than four. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking again, the years for Yokohama events are:\n\n- Row 5: 2008\n- Row 7: 2006\n- Row 8: 2005\n- Row 12: 2001\n\nWait, that's four times: 2001, 2005, 2006, 2008. So four instances in Yokohama between 1997 and 2012.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"between 1997 and 2012.\" The earliest year in the table is 1997 (Row 16), so I need to include that if applicable.\n\nLooking for Yokohama events after 1997:\n\n- Row 5: 2008\n- Row 7: 2006\n- Row 8: 2005\n- Row 12: 2001\n\nWait, are there any more? Let me check all rows again:\n\nRow 16: 1997, Chiba \u2013 no.\nRows 17-... Wait, the table only goes up to Row 16 for 1997. So after that, the earliest is 2001.\n\nSo in Yokohama between 1997 and 2012, there are four events: 2001, 2005, 2006, 2008.\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it's stated as \"host in yokohama 4 time between 1997 and 2012.\" So that would mean exactly four times. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed four Yokohama events within those years.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 5: 2008 \u2013 yes.\nRow 7: 2006 \u2013 yes.\nRow 8: 2005 \u2013 yes.\nRow 12: 2001 \u2013 yes.\nIs that all? Or are there more?\n\nLooking through the rows again:\n\n- Row 5: Yokohama, 2008\n- Row 7: Yokohama, 2006\n- Row 8: Yokohama, 2005\n- Row 12: Yokohama, 2001\n\nThat's four. So yes, exactly four times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Yokohama four times between 1997 and 2012. By checking each row of the table, we find that there were indeed four events in Yokohama during those years: 2001, 2005, 2006, and 2008.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe claim is **TRUE**.  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"type\": \"assertion\",\n    \"asserted_type\": \"fact\",\n    \"message\": \"The ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Yokohama four times between 1997 and 2012.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Wang Nan is the only female who won three consecutive years in the women's singles category at the ITTF Pro Tour. So I need to check if there are any other females who have achieved this feat in the same or different years as Wang Nan.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific year and lists the winners for both men's and women's singles, doubles, etc. The relevant columns here are \"year location\", \"men's singles\", and \"women's singles\".\n\nI'll go through each row to see who won in the women's singles category.\n\nRow 1: 2012 Kobe - Shen Yanfei\nRow 2: 2011 Kobe - Feng Tianwei\nRow 3: 2010 Kobe - Wang Yuegu\nRow 4: 2009 Wakayama - Park Mi-Young\nRow 5: 2008 Yokohama - Zhang Yining\nRow 6: 2007 Chiba - Wang Nan\nRow 7: 2006 Yokohama - Wang Yuegu\nRow 8: 2005 Yokohama - Zhang Yining\nRow 9: 2004 Kobe - Zhang Yining\nRow 10: 2003 Kobe - Guo Yue\nRow 11: 2002 Kobe - Kim Kyung-Ah\nRow 12: 2001 Yokohama - Wang Nan\nRow 13: 2000 Kobe - Wang Nan\nRow 14: 1999 Kobe - Wang Nan\nRow 15: 1998 Wakayama - Li Ju\nRow 16: 1997 Chiba - Wang Chen\n\nNow, focusing on the women's singles winners:\n\n- Shen Yanfei (2012)\n- Feng Tianwei (2011)\n- Wang Yuegu (2010, 2007, 2006)\n- Park Mi-Young (2009)\n- Zhang Yining (2008, 2005, 2004)\n- Guo Yue (2003)\n- Kim Kyung-Ah (2002)\n- Wang Nan (2006, 2001, 2000, 1999)\n- Li Ju (1998)\n- Wang Chen (1997)\n\nLooking for any female who won three consecutive years in a row. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the earliest to latest.\n\n- In 1997: Wang Chen\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2005: Zhang Yining\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2007: Wang Yuegu\n- 2008: Zhang Yining\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n\nLooking for three in a row. Let's check each consecutive trio:\n\nFrom 1997 to 1999:\n- 1997: Wang Chen\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1999: Wang Nan \u2192 Not the same person.\n\n2000, 2001, 2002:\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2002: Kim Kyung-Ah \u2192 Not three in a row for the same player.\n\n2003, 2004, 2005:\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2005: Zhang Yining \u2192 Different from 2003.\n\n2006, 2007, 2008:\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2007: Wang Yuegu\n- 2008: Zhang Yining \u2192 Not three in a row for the same player.\n\n2009, 2010, 2011:\n- 2009: Park Mi-Young\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei \u2192 No consistency.\n\nSo from this, no female has won three consecutive years. However, wait\u2014let me check again for each trio of consecutive years whether the same person won all three.\n\nLooking at Wang Nan:\n\nShe won in 1999, 2000, 2001 (if I'm counting correctly). Wait, let's double-check:\n\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n\nYes, that's three consecutive years from 1999 to 2001. So she won in 1999, 2000, and 2001.\n\nThen in 2002, it was Kim Kyung-Ah, so the streak broke.\n\nTherefore, Wang Nan did win three consecutive years: 1999, 2000, 2001.\n\nNow, checking if any other female has done this. Looking through the list:\n\n- Zhang Yining won in 2004, 2005\u2014only two consecutive.\n- Guo Yue only once in 2003.\n- Kim Kyung-Ah once in 2002.\n- Wang Yuegu in 2006, 2007, but then 2008 was Zhang Yining.\n- Feng Tianwei and Shen Yanfei only once each.\n\nSo it seems that Wang Nan is the only one who has three consecutive wins. Therefore, the claim that she's the only female to do so would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other females with three in a row.\n\nLooking at Zhang Yining:\n\nShe won in 2004, 2005\u2014only two years.\n\nWang Yuegu: 2006, 2007\u2014two years.\n\nGuo Yue: only one.\n\nSo no, only Wang Nan has three consecutive wins.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Wang Nan is the sole female who won three consecutive years in women's singles at the ITTF Pro Tour from 1999 to 2001.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"year\": 1999,\n        \"women_singles\": \"Wang Nan\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"year\": 2000,\n        \"women_singles\": \"Wang Nan\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"year\": 2001,\n        \"women_singles\": \"Wang Nan\"\n    }\n]\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim: \"kobe host the most ittf pro tour in between 1997 and 2012.\" I need to determine if this is true or false by checking the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Kobe hosted the majority of the ITTF Pro Tour events between 1997 and 2012. So, my task is to look into the table and see how many times \"kobe\" appears as the location compared to other locations in those years.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 2000 up to 2012 (rows 13 to 1). Each row lists several categories: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles. The \"year location\" is the first column of each row, indicating where that event was held.\n\nSo, I need to go through each year from 1997 to 2012 (since the claim mentions between these years) and count how many times the location is Kobe. But wait, in the table provided, the earliest year mentioned is 2000 (row 13). So actually, the events start from 2000 onwards. Therefore, the relevant rows are from row 1 to row 16, but I think it's better to focus on years 1997-2012, so that would include some years not covered by the table.\n\nBut looking at the table data, the earliest year is 1997 (row 16), and the latest is 2012 (row 1). So rows 16 to 1 correspond to years 1997 to 2012. Now, I'll go through each row and check if the location is Kobe.\n\nRow 13: 2000 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 14: 1999 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 15: 1998 \u2013 Wakayama\nRow 16: 1997 \u2013 Chiba\nRow 1: 2012 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 2: 2011 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 3: 2010 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 4: 2009 \u2013 Wakayama\nRow 5: 2008 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 6: 2007 \u2013 Chiba\nRow 7: 2006 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 8: 2005 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 9: 2004 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 10: 2003 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 11: 2002 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 12: 2001 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 13 to 16 are for years 1997-2000.\n\nSo, from row 1 (2012) down to row 16 (1997), the locations where events were held include Kobe, Wakayama, Chiba, and Yokohama. Now, I need to count how many times each location was host between 1997 and 2012.\n\nLet me list out all the rows and their locations:\n\nRow 13: 2000 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 14: 1999 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 15: 1998 \u2013 Wakayama\nRow 16: 1997 \u2013 Chiba\n\nThen from row 1 to row 12 (2012 down to 2001):\n\nRow 1: 2012 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 2: 2011 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 3: 2010 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 4: 2009 \u2013 Wakayama\nRow 5: 2008 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 6: 2007 \u2013 Chiba\nRow 7: 2006 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 8: 2005 \u2013 Yokohama\nRow 9: 2004 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 10: 2003 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 11: 2002 \u2013 Kobe\nRow 12: 2001 \u2013 Yokohama\n\nNow, let's count the number of times each location was host:\n\nKobe:\nRows 13,14,9,10,11,1,2,3 \u2013 that's 8 times.\n\nWakayama:\nRows 15,4 \u2013 2 times.\n\nChiba:\nRows 16,6 \u2013 2 times.\n\nYokohama:\nRows 5,7,8,12 \u2013 4 times.\n\nSo, the total number of events hosted in Kobe is 8. Now, considering that there are 16 rows (each representing a year from 1997 to 2012), but not all years may have an event. Wait, actually, looking at the table, each row represents an event, and each event is for a specific year. So, for example, in 2008 (row 5), it's Yokohama; in 2009 (row4), Wakayama. So each row corresponds to one event per category, but not necessarily all categories have an entry for every year.\n\nWait, no, looking at the structure, each row lists four categories: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles. But the \"year location\" is just one column, indicating where that particular event was held. So, it's possible that in some years, the event was not held in Kobe.\n\nSo, to count how many events were hosted in Kobe between 1997-2012, I need to check all 16 rows (from row1 to row16) and see how many times \"kobe\" is listed as the location.\n\nFrom my earlier count:\n\nKobe appears in rows: 13,14,9,10,11,1,2,3 \u2013 that's 8 instances.\n\nNow, total number of events between 1997-2012 is 16 (since row16 is 1997 and row1 is 2012). So Kobe hosted 8 out of these 16 events. Therefore, the claim says \"host the most ITTF Pro Tour in between 1997 and 2012.\" If we're counting events, then yes, Kobe did host more than other locations: 8 vs. 4 (Yokohama), 2 (Wakayama), and 2 (Chiba). So, Kobe hosted the majority.\n\nHowever, I should consider if \"host\" refers to hosting the most events, which it seems to. So the claim would be true.\n</think>\n\n{\"total_hosted_in_kobe\":8,\"others\": {\"wakayama\":2,\"chiba\":2,\"yokohama\":4}}",

So I need to check if there are at least three instances in that period where Wang Liqin won the men's singles category.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a different year and location, with details about both men's singles and doubles winners. My focus will be on the \"mens singles\" column for Wang Liqin across the years from 1997 up to 2012.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 16 (1997)**: The men's singles winner is Jan-Ove Waldner, so not Wang.\n- **Row 14 (1999)**: Men's singles is Vladimir Samsonov; nope.\n- **Row 13 (2000)**: Men's singles winner is Wang Liqin. That's one win.\n- **Row 7 (2006)**: No, Timo Boll won that year.\n- **Row 2 (2011)**: Seiya Kishikawa took the singles title, not Wang.\n- **Row 1 (2012)**: Jun Mizutani is the winner here.\n\nWait, so from 1997 to 2012, there's only one year (2000) where Wang Liqin won the men's singles. That means he only won once in that period, not three times as claimed. Therefore, the claim seems false.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any rows within the specified timeframe. Let me count again:\n\n- 1997: No\n- 1998: Not in the table, so no.\n- 1999: No\n- 2000: Yes (1)\n- 2001: Data not present for 2001?\nWait, looking back at the rows, row 13 is 2000, then row 14 is 1999, which I've already considered.

Let me scan each row:\n\nRow 12: 2001, location: yokohama\nRow 11: 2002, location: kobe\nRow 10: 2003, location: kobe\nRow 9: 2004, location: kob\nWait, no, let's check the table again.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 12: year 2001, location yokohama\nRow 11: 2002, kobe\nRow 10: 2003, kobe\nRow 9: 2004, kobe\nRow 8: 2005, yokohama\nRow 7: 2006, yokohama\nRow 6: 2007, chiba\nRow 5: 2008, yokohama\nRow 4: 2009, wakayama\nRow 3: 2010, kob\nRow 2: 2011, kob\nRow 1: 2012, kob\n\nSo the only row where location is Chiba is Row 6 (2007). The claim mentions hosting between 1997 and 2012, so I need to see if any of those years have Chiba as the host.\n\nLooking through the table from 1997 onwards:\n\nRow 16: 1997, chiba\nRow 15: 1998, wakayama\nRow 14: 1999, kobe\nRow 13: 2000, kob\nSo Row 16 is 1997, which is within the range of the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in between 1997 and 2012,\" which might include 1997 and 2012. So Chiba hosted in 1997 (Row 16) and also in 2007 (Row 6). Therefore, there are hosts at Chiba during that period.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if the claim is specifically about hosting by \"2 ittf pro tour.\" The table lists different events for each row, like men's singles, women's singles, etc. So perhaps the term \"2 ittf pro tour\" refers to a specific event or maybe a typo, but in the context of the table, I think it's referring to the ITTF Pro Tour events being hosted at Chiba.\n\nSo the relevant cells are where location is Chiba and within 1997-2012. From the table, that happens in Row 6 (2007) and possibly others? Wait, looking again:\n\nRow 16: 1997, chiba\nRow 6: 2007, chiba\n\nAre there any more? Let me check all rows:\n\nRows with location Chiba:\n- Row 6: 2007\n- Row 16: 1997\n\nWait, the claim says \"in between 1997 and 2012,\" which includes both years. So the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted at Chiba in 1997 and 2007, which are within that timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by these rows. But I need to make sure if it's hosted during any of those years. So the relevant cells are Row 6 (2007) and Row 16 (1997). Wait, but the table lists specific events each year, so maybe I should check if in those years, Chiba was hosting at least one event.\n\nWait, actually, the claim is about the ITTF Pro Tour being hosted at Chiba between 1997-2012. The table shows that in 1997 (Row 16) and 2007 (Row 6), Chiba was the host location. Therefore, there are hosts in both years, so the claim holds.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the term \"2 ittf pro tour\" might not be explicitly mentioned in the table. The table lists different events like men's singles, women's singles, etc., but perhaps each row represents an event hosted at that location. So if the ITTF Pro Tour includes all these events, then hosting at Chiba during those years would mean the claim is true.\n\nSo the relevant rows are Row 6 (2007) and Row 16 (1997). Therefore, the claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"2 ittf pro tour be host at chiba in between 1997 and 2012\" is supported by the table data. Specifically:\n\n- **Row 16 (1997)**: Location is Chiba, which falls within the timeframe of the claim.\n- **Row 6 (2007)**: Location is Chiba, also within the specified years.\n\nThus, the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted at Chiba during these years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 16,\n      \"year\": 1997,\n      \"location\": \"chiba\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 6,\n      \"year\": 2007,\n      \"location\": \"chiba\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the ittf pro tour be host in kobe 4 time between 1997 and 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what this means. They're saying that Kobe hosted the ITTF Pro Tour four times between the years 1997 to 2012. So I need to check each of those four events in that timeframe and see if they were indeed held in Kobe.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows representing different years, from 2008 going back to 1997, but the claim mentions up to 2012. Wait, actually, looking at the rows, row 1 is 2012, then 2011, 2010, and so on down to row 16 as 1997. So the latest year in the table is 2012, which is within the time frame given.\n\nNow, I'll go through each relevant year to see if Kobe hosted ITTF events that year.\n\nStarting from 1997 (row 16): The location is Chiba for both singles and doubles, so no event in Kobe here.\n\nMoving on to 1998 (row 15): Location is Wakayama. Not Kobe, so not relevant.\n\n1999 (row 14): Also Wakayama again. No.\n\n2000 (row 13): Kobe, but that's within the timeframe. So one event.\n\n2001 (row 12): Yokohama. Nope.\n\n2002 (row 11): Kobe, another event.\n\n2003 (row 10): Kobe again. Third event.\n\n2004 (row 9): Kobe once more. Fourth event.\n\nWait, but let me count: row 13 is 2000, row 11 is 2002, row 10 is 2003, row 9 is 2004. That's four events in Kobe between 2000 and 2004. But the claim says \"between 1997 and 2012.\" So do we include 2000 as part of that?\n\nYes, because 2000 is within 1997-2012. Now, looking for four events: 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004. That's four years in Kobe.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"hosted four times between 1997 and 2012.\" So if there are four instances, that would make it true. But let me double-check each row to ensure I'm not missing any.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- 2000: Kobe, yes (row 13)\n- 2001: Yokohama (row12), no\n- 2002: Kobe (row11), yes\n- 2003: Kobe (row10), yes\n- 2004: Kobe (row9), yes\n- 2005: Yokohama (row8), no\n- 2006: Yokohama (row7), no\n- 2007: Chiba (row6), no\n- 2008: Yokohama (row5), no\n- 2009: Wakayama (row4), no\n- 2010: Kobe (row3), yes\n- 2011: Kobe (row2), yes\n- 2012: Kobe (row1), yes\n\nWait a minute, so between 1997 and 2012, the years in which Kobe hosted ITTF events are:\n\n2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012. That's seven times, not four.\n\nBut the claim says \"four time.\" So maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps I should only consider the years from 1997 to 2012 inclusive and check if there are four events in Kobe within that period.\n\nWait, let me recount based on the rows provided:\n\nRows 13-16 are 2000-1997, which is a bit confusing because it's not chronological. So perhaps I should list them by year:\n\nLooking at each row's 'year location' field:\n\nRow1: 2012 Kobe\nRow2: 2011 Kobe\nRow3: 2010 Kobe\nRow4: 2009 Wakayama\nRow5: 2008 Yokohama\nRow6: 2007 Chiba\nRow7: 2006 Yokohama\nRow8: 2005 Yokohama\nRow9: 2004 Kobe\nRow10: 2003 Kobe\nRow11: 2002 Kobe\nRow12: 2001 Yokohama\nRow13: 2000 Kobe\nRow14: 1999 Wakayama\nRow15: 1998 Wakayama\nRow16: 1997 Chiba\n\nSo, in the years from 1997 to 2012, the times when the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe are:\n\n- 2000 (row13)\n- 2002 (row11)\n- 2003 (row10)\n- 2004 (row9)\n- 2010 (row3)\n- 2011 (row2)\n- 2012 (row1)\n\nThat's seven times, not four. So the claim says \"hosted four times,\" but according to this data, it was hosted more than that within the specified timeframe.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the user meant exactly four times in the years between 1997 and 2012, but according to the table, it's actually seven times. So the claim would be false because it states only four times, while there were seven.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted or misunderstood which rows correspond to which years.\n\nWait, no, each row has a specific year. Let me list all rows with their 'year location' and whether it's Kobe:\n\nRow1: 2012, Kobe\nRow2: 2011, Kobe\nRow3: 2010, Kobe\nRow4: 2009, Wakayama\nRow5: 2008, Yokohama\nRow6: 2007, Chiba\nRow7: 2006, Yokohama\nRow8: 2005, Yokohama\nRow9: 2004, Kobe\nRow10: 2003, Kobe\nRow11: 2002, Kobe\nRow12: 2001, Yokohama\nRow13: 2000, Kobe\nRow14: 1999, Wakayama\nRow15: 1998, Wakayama\nRow16: 1997, Chiba\n\nSo in the years from 1997 to 2012 (inclusive), the events hosted in Kobe are:\n\n2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012. That's seven events.\n\nTherefore, the claim stating that it was hosted four times is incorrect because it actually happened more than four times within that timeframe.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow13: 2000\nRow11: 2002\nRow10: 2003\nRow9: 2004\nRow3: 2010\nRow2: 2011\nRow1: 2012\n\nYes, that's seven times. So the claim is false because it was hosted more than four times in Kobe between 1997 and 2012.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant to say that there were four events, but according to the data, it's actually seven. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe four times between 1997 and 2012 is false because the data shows seven events in Kobe within this timeframe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"status\": \"false\",\n    \"reason\": \"The ITTF Pro Tour was not hosted in Kobe four times between 1997 and 2012.

That doesn't make three in a row.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the \"three years in a row.\" Maybe she won in consecutive years like 2012, 2013, 2014?\n\nLooking for her winning multiple times:\n\nRow 5 (2008): Yes.\nRow 4 (2009): No, it's Park Mi-young.\nSo no three in a row.\n\nWait, maybe she is the only female to have won three in a row at some point.\n\nI need to check if any other woman has won three consecutive years before her or after her.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nFrom 1997 onward, Zhang Yining first appears in 2008. Before that, Wang Nan and others are winners.\n\nIn 2008: Zhang Yining wins.\n2009: Park Mi-young.\nSo no, she only won once.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each row's women's singles winner.\n\nRow 5: 2008 - Zhang Yining\nRow 4: 2009 - Park Mi-young\nSo, that's two different winners in consecutive years. So Zhang didn't win three in a row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because she only won once, not three times in a row.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether Zhang Yining is the only female to have won three consecutive years in women's singles at the ITTF Pro Tour, we need to check each relevant cell in the table for her name and see if she has indeed achieved this feat.\n\nFirst, identify rows where Zhang Yining is mentioned in the \"womens singles\" column:\n\n- **Row 5 (2008)**: womens singles: zhang yining\n\nNext, check neighboring years to see if she won consecutively:\n\n- **Row 6 (2007)**: womens singles: wang nan\n- **Row 4 (2009)**: womens singles: park mi - young\n\nSince Zhang Yining only won in 2008 and did not win in either 2007 or 2009, she has not won three consecutive years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"Kobe hosted the most ITTF Pro Tour in between 2004 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what this means. Hosting the most tournaments would mean that Kobe has more entries in the 'location' column for years 2004 to 2009 compared to other locations during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year, with the location and various singles and doubles competitors. My task is to check how many times Kobe hosted during the specified period.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- Row 14: 1999, Kobe\n- Row 13: 2000, Kobe\n- Row 12: 2001, Yokohama (not Kobe)\n- Row 11: 2002, Kobe\n- Row 10: 2003, Kobe\n- Row 9: 2004, Kobe\n- Row 8: 2005, Yokohama (not Kobe)\n- Row 7: 2006, Yokohama (not Kobe)\n- Row 6: 2007, Chiba (not Kobe)\n- Row 5: 2008, Yokohama (not Kobe)\n- Row 4: 2009, Wakayama (not Kobe)\n\nWait, row 4 is 2009 and location is Wakayama. So from 2004 to 2009, rows 9,10,11,12,13,14 correspond to 2004-2009? No, row numbers go up to 16, so rows 9 (2004) up to row 15 (1998). Wait, maybe I'm mixing the order. The table seems to be in chronological order from 2012 down to 1997.\n\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: 2012\nRow 2: 2011\n...\nRow 16: 1997\n\nSo row numbers go from highest (2012) to lowest (1997). So for years between 2004 and 2009, which rows correspond?\n\nLooking for year location in 2004-2009.\n\nRow 15 is 1998, so not included. Row 14: 1999. Not in the range. Row13:2000. Yes. Row12:2001. Yes. Row11:2002. Yes. Row10:2003. Yes. Row9:2004. Yes.\n\nSo rows 9 (2004) to row13 (2000): Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2000 is before 2004. So I think rows 9 (2004), 10(2003), 11(2002),12(2001),13(2000). But wait, 2000 is included if the period is between 2004 and 2009, but maybe it's up to 2009 inclusive? Or does \"in between\" mean strictly after 2004 and before 2009? Hmm.\n\nAssuming the claim refers to events hosted in Kobe from 2004 through 2009, including both years. So rows corresponding are:\n\nRow14:1999 (not included)\nRow13:2000 (included if period starts at 2004)\nWait no, row numbers correspond to years as follows:\n\nLooking again, row1 is 2012, row2 2011,..., row16 1997.\n\nSo each row's year is listed as 'year location: X' where X is the four-digit year. So rows are in descending order from 2012 down.\n\nTherefore, for the period between 2004 and 2009, we need to find rows where the year is >=2004 and <=2009.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow1:2012 - not in range\nRow2:2011 - nope\n...\nRow9:2004 - yes\nRow10:2003 - no\nRow11:2002 - no\nRow12:2001 - no\nRow13:2000 - no\nRow14:1999 - no\n\nSo only rows 9 (2004), and row15 is 1998, which is before. So only one event in Kobe during the specified period? That can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row lists multiple events for that year, including singles and doubles. So for each year, there are multiple entries (e.g., row9 has 2004, Kobe, with several players). So how many times did Kobe host in those years?\n\nWait no, the 'year location' is the first part, so each row represents a single event? Or does it represent all events in that year for that location?\n\nLooking at row1:2012, Kobe, lists singles and doubles winners. So I think each row represents an individual tournament or perhaps multiple tournaments.\n\nBut the key point is whether the 'location' is Kobe during 2004-2009.\n\nSo for each year from 2004 to 2009 (inclusive), check if the location is Kobe.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nLooking at rows where the year is between 2004 and 2009:\n\nRow9:2004, Kobe\nRow10:2003, Kobe (but 2003 is before 2004)\nWait no, I need to check for years from 2004 onwards. So 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row9:2004, Kobe\n- Any others?\n\nRow13 is 2000, so no.\nRow14:1999, no.\nRow15:1998, no.\n\nSo only row9 (2004) has a location of Kobe during that year. That's one event.\n\nBut wait, in 2005, the location is Yokohama (row7), 2006 Chiba (row6), 2007 Yokohama (row5), 2008 Yokohama (row4), and 2009 Wakayama (row4). So none of these years from 2005-2009 have Kobe as the location except for 2004.\n\nWait, row4 is 2009, but location is Wakayama, so not Kobe.\n\nSo in total, during the period between 2004 and 2009, Kobe hosted one event (2004). Meanwhile, other locations like Yokohama hosted multiple events during those years: 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008.\n\nTherefore, Kobe did not host the most tournaments during that period; in fact, it was one of the least. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Kobe hosted only one event in 2004 during the specified period, while other locations hosted more events over those years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Claim\": \"Kobe hosted the most ITTF Pro Tour in between 2004 and 2009.\",\n  \"Verification\": {\n    \"TotalHostsInPeriod\": 1,\n    \"OtherLocationsHostedMoreEvents\": true,\n    \"Conclusion\": \"False\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"2 ittf pro tour be host at yokohama in between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the \"ITTF Pro Tour\" was hosted at Yokohama between the years 1997 and 2012. So I need to check if there are any ITTF events in Yokohama during those years as per the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, with specific locations, men's singles winners, women's singles winners, men's doubles winners, and women's doubles winners. The location column tells us where each event was held that year.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to see if any of them are from Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. \n\nStarting with Row 16: It's for the year 1997 in Chiba, so not Yokohama.\n\nRow 15 is 1998, location Wakayama\u2014so nope.\n\nRow 14: 1999, location Kobe\u2014nope.\n\nRow 13: 2000, Kobe again. Still not Yokohama.\n\nRow 12: 2001, Yokohama. So there's an event in Yokohama in 2001. Let me note that down as a relevant cell because it supports the claim.\n\nRow 11 is 2002, location Kobe\u2014nope.\n\nRows 10-4 are from 2003 to 2009, but only Row 8 (2005) and Row 7 (2006), Row 6 (2007), Row 5 (2008) are in Yokohama. So Rows 12, 8, 7, 6, 5\u2014all between 2001 and 2008. These years fall within the timeframe of 1997-2012.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim is about the ITTF Pro Tour being hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. So each of these rows (12,8,7,6,5) are for events in Yokohama during those years. \n\nBut then I realize that the first part of the claim says \"2 ittf pro tour be host.\" The '2' might indicate the second event or perhaps a typo, but more importantly, the key is whether there were ITTF Pro Tour events in Yokohama between 1997 and 2012.\n\nLooking at Row 12: 2001, Yokohama. Men's singles was Chiang Peng Lung, women's singles Wang Nan, etc. So that's an event in Yokohama for the ITTF Pro Tour.\n\nRow 8: 2005, Yokohama\u2014same here. So events were held there each year from at least 2001 to 2008 (and perhaps earlier?), but looking through the table, I see Row 12 is 2001, then Row 8 is 2005, and so on.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies between 1997 and 2012. So any events in Yokohama during those years would support the claim.\n\nBut let me check if there were ITTF Pro Tour events in Yokohama starting from 1997 or earlier. For example, looking at Row 16: 1997 in Chiba\u2014nope. So the first event in Yokohama as per the table is 2001 (Row12). Therefore, between 1997 and 2012, there were multiple ITTF Pro Tour events in Yokohama.\n\nSo the claim says that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. The data supports this because there are indeed events listed in Yokohama for those years.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful\u2014the table might not list all years, so maybe there were more events beyond what's shown here, but according to the given data, yes, there were events in Yokohama during 2001-2008. So the claim is about between 1997 and 2012\u2014so from 2001 onwards, up until 2012. The table only goes up to 2012, so it's covered.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the ITTF Pro Tour events were hosted at Yokohama during those years as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in the table where multiple rows indicate ITTF Pro Tour events held in Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
