    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify if the claim that \"the word Friday in the Polish language is pi\u0105tek\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding how the table is structured.\n\nLooking at Row 17, it's about Hungarian. The days of the week are listed as h\u00e9tf\u0151, kedd, szerda slavic, cs\u00fct\u00f6rt\u00f6k slavic, p\u00e9ntek slavic, szombat, vas\u00e1rnap. I don't think this row is relevant for Polish, so maybe I can ignore it unless there's a connection.\n\nNext, Row 19 is Chinese (Pinyin). It lists the days as \u661f\u671f\u4e00 to \u661f\u671f\u65e5, which are Monday to Sunday in Pinyin. Not helpful for Polish.\n\nRow 17: Hungarian\nRow 18: Estonian\nRow 19: Chinese (Pinyin)\nRow 20: Mongolian (Numerical)\nRow 21: Mongolian (Tibetan)\nRow 22: Turkish\n\nWait, Row 17 is Hungarian, which isn't relevant. Maybe I should check Row 17's Hungarian word for Friday and see if it matches \"pi\u0105tek\" in Polish.\n\nLooking at Row 17: Hungarian Friday is p\u00e9ntek. In Polish, the claim is pi\u0105tek. Hmm, but that doesn't match. So maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps each row corresponds to a specific language, and the columns are the days of the week. So for example, Row 17 (Hungarian) has h\u00e9tf\u0151 as Monday, kedd as Tuesday, etc., up to vas\u00e1rnap as Sunday.\n\nSo I need to find where Friday is in Polish. That would be Row X, column \"Friday\".\n\nWait, but each row seems to list all seven days of the week for that language. So Row 17 lists Hungarian days: h\u00e9tf\u0151 (Mon), kedd (Tue), szerda (Wed slavic), cs\u00fct\u00f6rt\u00f6k (Thu slavic), p\u00e9ntek (Fri slavic), szombat (Sat), vas\u00e1rnap (Sun).\n\nSo in Row 17, Friday is listed as p\u00e9ntek. But the claim is that in Polish it's pi\u0105tek.\n\nSo if I'm looking for Polish, which row has Friday as \"pi\u0105tek\"? Let me check each row:\n\nRow 0: English - days are Sunday to Saturday.\nRow 1: French\n...\nLooking through all rows, I need to find where the Friday column is filled with \"pi\u0105tek\" in Polish.\n\nI think Row 17 is Hungarian, not relevant. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the table's structure. Alternatively, perhaps each row corresponds to a language, and each cell within the row lists the day of the week in that language.\n\nTherefore, to find Friday in Polish, I need to look for the row where the language is Polish and the day is Friday. But looking through the rows provided, there isn't a row explicitly labeled as Polish. Wait, perhaps Row 17 is Hungarian, Row 18 is Estonian, etc., but the user didn't provide a row for Polish.\n\nWait, no, the user did include Row 19 as Chinese (Pinyin) and others, but I don't see a Polish row in the provided data. Maybe I missed it.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nRows are from 0 to 22.\n\nRow 17: Hungarian\nRow 18: Estonian\nRow 19: Chinese (Pinyin)\nRow 20: Mongolian (Numerical)\nRow 21: Mongolian (Tibetan)\nRow 22: Turkish\n\nNo Polish row. So perhaps the table doesn't include Polish, which means that the claim can't be directly verified from the given data.\n\nWait, but looking at Row 17 (Hungarian) and comparing to the claim: Hungarian Friday is p\u00e9ntek, while the claim is pi\u0105tek for Polish. These are different, so maybe the claim is false because the correct Polish word is not listed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Maybe each column in a row represents a specific day, and the rows list different languages.\n\nWait, no, the structure seems to be that each row lists all seven days of the week for a particular language. So Row 17 is Hungarian, listing Mon-Fri as h\u00e9tf\u0151-p\u00e9ntek.\n\nTherefore, since there's no Polish row provided in the table, we can't confirm if Friday is \"pi\u0105tek\" or not based on this data alone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to infer that if another language's Friday is \"pi\u0105tek,\" but in the table, only Hungarian and other non-Polish languages are listed. So the claim might be false because it's asserting something about Polish which isn't supported by the given data.\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says: carefully check each condition in the claim against the table. The claim is that Friday in Polish is \"pi\u0105tek.\" To verify this, I need to find where in the table the Polish word for Friday is listed as \"pi\u0105tek.\"\n\nBut looking through all rows, there's no row labeled Polish or any entry in a row that has \"Friday\" as \"pi\u0105tek.\" Therefore, the claim cannot be confirmed true based on the given data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps each column in the table corresponds to a day of the week across languages, but that doesn't seem to be the case here because each row lists multiple days for a single language.\n\nSo, without a Polish row, I can't confirm the claim. Therefore, the answer would be that the claim is false as there's no data supporting it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified using the provided table. There is no entry in the table for the Polish word \"Friday\" (pi\u0105tek). Without evidence from the table, the claim remains unconfirmed.\n\nAnswer: The claim cannot be confirmed based on the given data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to verify the claim that \"the word Saturday in the Croatian language is subota.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. The table lists languages from Row 0 (Croatian) up to Row 22. Each row has a specific day of the week associated with it. My task is to find the relevant cells that can confirm or deny the claim.\n\nLooking specifically for the Croatian language, which is in Row 0. Under the column name \"Saturday,\" I see that the Croatian word is \"subota.\" That's exactly what the claim states. So this cell directly supports the claim.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure there aren't any other relevant cells. The claim is about Saturday specifically, so only the row for Croatian language and the column for Saturday matter here. No other rows or columns are related because we're focusing on the translation of \"Saturday\" in Croatian.\n\nI don't think I need to consider other languages unless the claim was comparing multiple translations. Since it's just stating that in Croatian, Saturday is subota, only Row 0 and the relevant column for Saturday are needed.\n\nSo, putting this together, the relevant cells are in Row 0, under the \"Saturday\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Saturday\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this claim: \"Subota be the Mongolian word for Sunday.\" I need to check if this is true by looking at the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what the claim is saying. It's asserting that the word \"Subota\" (which I think is a Lithuanian word for Saturday) is used as the Mongolian word for Sunday. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some languages here.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with different languages and their days of the week. I need to find the row where Mongolian is listed because that's relevant. Let me scan through the rows:\n\nRow 20: Mongolian (numerical)\nRow 21: Mongolian (Tibetan)\n\nSo, the Mongolian entries are in rows 20 and 21.\n\nNow, let me check row 20 first. It lists each day with a numerical notation. The days from Monday to Sunday correspond to \"\u043d\u044d\u0433 \u0434\u044d\u0445 \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440\" (1), \"\u0445\u043e\u0451\u0440 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9d\u00f6r\" (2), \"\u0433\u0443\u0440av \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9d\u00f6r\" (3), \"\u0434\u00f6\u00f6r\u00f6\u0432 \u0434\u044dkh \u04e9d\u00f6r\" (4), \"\u0442\u0430\u0432 \u0434\u0430\u0445\u044c \u04e9d\u00f6r\" (5), \"\u0445\u0430\u0433as \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9d\u00f6r\" (6), and \"\u0431\u00fc\u0442\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9d\u00f6r\" (7). So, Sunday is listed as \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9d\u00f6r\" in row 20.\n\nNext, looking at row 21, which uses the Tibetan script. The days are listed as: Monday-Davaa, Tuesday-Myagmar, Wednesday-Lhagva, Thursday-P\u00fcrev, Friday-Baasan, Saturday-Byamba, Sunday-Nyam. So here, Sunday is \"Nyam.\"\n\nNow, checking if Subota is used for Sunday in Mongolian. I know that in Lithuanian, \"Subota\" means Saturday. But in Mongolian languages, whether it's Tibetan or numerical script, the word for Sunday isn't listed as \"Subota.\" Instead, row 21 uses \"Nyam,\" and row 20 uses \"\u0431\u00fc\u0442\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9d\u00f6r,\" which translates to something like \"full rest day\" in English.\n\nSo the claim that \"Subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday seems incorrect. It appears that neither of the Mongolian entries (rows 20 and 21) lists \"Subota\" as Sunday. Instead, they have different terms, especially \"Nyam\" in row 21.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be false because there's no evidence in the table supporting Subota being used for Sunday in Mongolian.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Sunday\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Sunday\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
