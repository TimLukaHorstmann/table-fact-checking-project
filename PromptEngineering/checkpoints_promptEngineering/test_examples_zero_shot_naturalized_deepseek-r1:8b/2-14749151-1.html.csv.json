The claim is that \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than belshina.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should locate both teams in the table to see their positions and other relevant information. \n\nLooking at the table, there are 16 rows each representing different teams. The first part of each row is the team name. So, I need to find the rows where the team is \"neman\" and \"belshina.\"\n\nStarting with \"neman\": Scanning through the list, I see that Row 7 is for neman. The details here include location as grodno, venue as neman, capacity of 6300, and position in 2003 as 7.\n\nNext, looking for \"belshina\": This should be Row 10, where the team is belshina. The details show location as bobruisk, venue as spartak, capacity of 3550, and position in 2003 as 10.\n\nNow, comparing their positions: neman's position is 7, and belshina's position is 10. So, neman has a lower (i.e., worse) position than belshina. The claim states that neman has a higher position than belshina, which would mean neman should have a lower numerical value if we consider 1 as the highest.\n\nWait, actually, in rankings, 1 is first place, so a lower number means higher position. So, if neman is at 7 and belshina at 10, neman has a higher (better) position than belshina. Therefore, the claim is true because neman's position is higher (7) than belshina's position (10).\n\nI need to make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Let me double-check the rows.\n\nRow 7: team: neman, position in 2003:7.\nRow 10: team: belshina, position in 2003:10.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the claim is true because neman's position (7) is higher than belshina's (10).\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than belshina\" is true, we need to check their positions in the table. \n\n1. **Finding Neman**: Row 7 lists neman with a position of 7.\n2. **Finding Belshina**: Row 10 lists belshina with a position of 10.\n\nSince 7 is less than 10, neman has a higher (better) position than belshina.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says that there are four teams whose locations are in Minsk, and one of them should be \"torpedo - ska.\" So I need to check two things: how many teams have their location listed as Minsk, and whether \"torpedo - ska\" is among those.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team with several attributes, including \"location\" and \"position in 2003.\" My focus here is on the \"team\" name and the \"location.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to see where the location is Minsk:\n\n- Row 1: Gomel\n- Row 2: Borisov\n- Row 3: Minsk (Dinamo Minsk)\n- Row 4: Minsk (Torpedo - Ska)\n- Row 5: Soligorsk\n- Row 6: Zhodino\n- Row 7: Grodno\n- Row 8: Novopolotsk\n- Row 9: Mogilev\n- Row 10: Bobruisk\n- Row 11: Brest\n- Row 12: Minsk (Zvezda - Va - BGu)\n- Row 13: Minsk Raion\n- Row 14: Mozyr\n- Row 15: Vitebsk\n- Row 16: Minsk (MTZ - Ripo)\n\nSo, the teams with locations in Minsk are:\n- Dinamo Minsk (Row 3)\n- Torpedo - Ska (Row 4)\n- Zvezda - Va - BGu (Row 12)\n- MTZ - Ripo (Row 16)\n\nThat makes four teams. Now, checking if \"torpedo - ska\" is one of them\u2014yes, it's in Row 4.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that \"torpedo - ska be 1 of 4.\" The numbering in the table shows their positions as 4th in 2003. However, the claim doesn't specify the exact position, just that they are one of four. So the position might not be necessary for this particular claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim holds true because there are indeed four teams located in Minsk, and \"torpedo - ska\" is one of them.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where the team's location is Minsk, specifically rows 3, 4, 12, and 16.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I should figure out where each team is located in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, Gomel is listed as Row 1 with a capacity of 11,800. Belshina is in Row 10 and has a capacity of 3,550. So, comparing these two capacities: 11,800 versus 3,550. Clearly, Gomel's capacity is higher.\n\nI should make sure I'm checking the correct cells. The relevant columns for this claim are \"capacity\". Therefore, I need to extract the \"row_index\" and \"column_name\" for both Gomel and Belshina.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gomel has a higher capacity than Belshina. By examining their respective capacities in the table, we see that Gomel's capacity is 11,800 while Belshina's is 3,550.

The claim says: \"mtz - ripo be 1 of 2 team with venue traktor.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It's about two things:\n1. The team name must be mtz - ripo.\n2. There should only be two teams that have a venue called traktor.\n3. The position in 2003 for this team is \"first league\" and it's either 1 or 2.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all teams with the venue traktor. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 12: Team is zvezda - va - bgu, venue: traktor. Position in 2003: 12.\n- Row 16: Team is mtz - ripo, venue: traktor. Position in 2003: first league, 2.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"1 of 2 team,\" so the positions should be either 1 and 2 or maybe just the first two in order. Let's see:\n\nRow 12 has position 12, which is not 1 or 2. So only mtz - ripo (row 16) fits the criteria because it's one of two teams with venue traktor? But wait, in the table, zvezda - va - bgu also uses traktor as their venue.\n\nSo, actually, there are at least two teams with traktor as their venue: row 12 and row 16. However, the claim says \"1 of 2 team.\" That implies that mtz - ripo is one of those two. Is that accurate?\n\nLooking back, in the table:\n- Row 12 (zvezda - va - bgu) has position 12.\n- Row 16 (mtz - ripo) has position first league, 2.\n\nSo, are there exactly two teams with venue traktor? Yes, rows 12 and 16. So mtz - ripo is one of them, specifically in second place for their division.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that mtz - ripo is one of two teams with venue traktor.

The claim mentions \"bate\" and \"slavia.\" Looking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 2: team: bate\n- Row 14: team: slavia\n\nSo, their positions in 2003 are crucial here. For each of these teams, I need to find their position in 2003.\n\nFor \"bate,\" I look at row 2 and see that the position is listed as 2 under column \"position in 2003.\"\n\nFor \"slavia,\" I go to row 14 and find its position is also 2. Wait, no, row 14's position is 14. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back: Row 2 for bate has position 2, and Row 14 for slavia has position 14. So, bate's position is 2 and slavia's position is 14 in 2003.\n\nComparing these two positions: 2 (bate) vs. 14 (slavia). Since 2 is higher than 14, the claim that \"bate finishes with a higher position than slavia\" is TRUE.\n\nI need to verify this by checking the relevant cells from the table.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which teams are involved in the claim: neman and lokomotiv. Next, I need to find their positions in 2003 as listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 7 is team: neman, location: grodno, venue: neman, capacity: 6300, position in 2003: 7.\n- Row 15 is team: lokomotiv, location: vitebsk, venue: central , vitebsk, capacity: 8300, position in 2003: first league , 1.\n\nWait, the position for lokomotiv says \"first league , 1\". I need to clarify what that means. Is \"first league\" part of the position or is it an additional information? For example, sometimes positions might be denoted as \"1st place in league\" or similar. Here, it's written as \"first league , 1.\" So, perhaps \"first league\" refers to a division or tier within the league system, and then \"1\" is their position.\n\nAssuming that \"first league , 1\" is indicating their rank, so lokomotiv's position in 2003 is 1. On the other hand, neman's position is explicitly given as 7.\n\nNow, comparing these positions: neman is at 7 and lokomotiv is at 1. Therefore, neman does not have a higher position than lokomotiv; in fact, lokomotiv has a higher (better) position.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"neman have a higher position than lokomotiv.\" Since 7 is higher numerically than 1? No, wait: lower numbers mean better positions. So if neman is 7 and lokomotiv is 1, then lokomotiv is higher. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than lokomotiv.\" From the table:\n\n- **Neman** (Row 7) has a position of 7.\n- **Lokomotiv** (Row 15) has a position of 1.\n\nSince 1 is lower than 7, Lokomotiv has a higher (better) position.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there are four teams located in Vitebsk, and \"torpedo - ska\" is one of them, specifically ranked first. So I need to check two things: whether \"torpedo - ska\" is indeed one of the four teams listed for Vitebsk, and whether it's positioned as 1st.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a team, their location, venue, capacity, and their position in 2003. So I should focus on these columns: team, location, and position.\n\nI'll start by identifying all teams that are located in Vitebsk. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 15: team: lokomotiv, location: vitebsk, venue: central, etc.\n- Any others? Let me check each row's location column. Hmm, I don't see any other rows with location: vitebsk besides row 15.\n\nWait, so only \"lokomotiv\" is in Vitebsk. But the claim mentions four teams, which suggests there might be more than one. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row to ensure I haven't overlooked any Vitebsk entries.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 1: gomel\nRow 2: borisov\nRow 3: minsk\nRow 4: minsk\nRow 5: soligorsk\nRow 6: zhodino\nRow 7: grodno\nRow 8: novopolotsk\nRow 9: mogilev\nRow 10: bobruisk\nRow 11: brest\nRow 12: minsk\nRow 13: minsk raion\nRow 14: mozyr\nRow 15: vitebsk\nRow 16: minsk\n\nSo only row 15 is in Vitebsk. That means there's only one team, \"lokomotiv,\" in Vitebsk. Therefore, the claim says that there are four teams, which isn't correct because only one team is listed for Vitebsk.\n\nAdditionally, even if I consider that maybe \"torpedo - ska\" could be another team in Vitebsk, looking through the rows, the only team with \"torpedo\" is row 6: location zhodino. So \"torpedo\" isn't in Vitebsk; it's in Zhodino.\n\nSo the claim has two issues: it claims there are four teams in Vitebsk when there's only one, and it incorrectly attributes \"torpedo - ska\" to Vitebsk when it's actually in Zhodino. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where in the table the relevant teams and their capacities are listed. The claim mentions two teams: gomel and mtz - ripo. So I'll start by searching the table for these team names.\n\nLooking at row 1: team: gomel, location: gomel, venue: central , gomel, capacity: 11800, position in 2003: 1. So, gomel's capacity is 11,800.\n\nNow, I'll search for mtz - ripo.

So, mtz - ripo's capacity is 17,600.\n\nComparing these two capacities: gomel has 11,800 and mtz - ripo has 17,600. Wait, that means mtz - ripo actually has a higher capacity than gomel. So the original claim that \"gomel have a higher capacity than mtz - ripo\" is false.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other entries for these teams. Let me double-check. For gomel, only row 1 seems to list it, and for mtz - ripo, only row 16 does.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that mtz - ripo is one of two teams that have their venue at \"atlant.\" So I need to check if there's another team also with venue \"atlant\" in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team with various attributes like location, venue, capacity, and their position in 2003. My focus is on the \"team\" and \"venue\" columns for this claim.\n\nI'll start by locating mtz - ripo in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: gomel\n- Row 2: bate\n- ...\n- Row 15: lokomotiv\n- Row 16: mtz - ripo\n\nYes, mtz - ripo is in row 16. According to the table, their venue is \"traktor\" in minsk.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions \"atlant\" as the venue for two teams. But from what I see, mtz - ripo's venue is \"traktor.\" That's different from \"atlant.\"\n\nNow, I need to check if any other team has \"atlant\" as their venue. Let me scan through all rows:\n\n- Row 1: central\n- Row 2: city stadium\n- Row 3: dinamo\n- Row 4: torpedo\n- Row 5: stroitel\n- Row 6: torpedo\n- Row 7: neman\n- Row 8: atlant (team: naftan)\n- Row 9: spartak\n- Row 10: spartak\n- Row 11: osk brestskiy\n- Row 12: traktor\n- Row 13: darida\n- Row 14: yunost\n- Row 15: central\n- Row 16: traktor\n\nSo only row 8 has \"atlant\" as the venue for team naftan. That means only one team (naftan) is at atlant. The claim says there are two teams, so this doesn't hold.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed another team with \"atlant\"? Let me double-check:\n\nRow 15: Lokomotiv has \"central\" as the venue in vitebsk, not atlant.\n\nSo only naftan is at atlant. Therefore, there's only one team, not two, at atlant.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which teams are mentioned in the claim: Bate and Lokomotiv. Now, I'll look for these teams in the table to find their positions in 2003.\n\nStarting with \"bate,\" I scan through each row. The second row has team: bate, so that's Row 2. The position given there is 2. So, Bate finished in position 2.\n\nNext, looking for \"lokomotiv.\" It appears in Row 15, where the position is listed as \"first league , 1.\" I assume this means they were first in their division or overall? Since the other positions are just numbers without \"first league,\" perhaps it's more specific. But to compare, I think Lokomotiv was at least tied for first place.\n\nWait, the claim says Bate finished with a higher position than Lokomotiv. If Lokomotiv was 1st and Bate was 2nd, then Bate didn't finish higher; their positions are lower. So the statement would be FALSE.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The table's Row 15 for Lokomotiv says \"position in 2003: first league , 1.\" Maybe it's a tie or a shared position? If Lokomotiv was first, then Bate at second can't have a higher position. So the claim is indeed FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to mark the relevant cells for both teams. For Bate, that's Row 2 and \"position in 2003.\" For Lokomotiv, it's Row 15 and their position column as well.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv in 2003\" is FALSE because Bate was in position 2 while Lokomotiv was first.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
