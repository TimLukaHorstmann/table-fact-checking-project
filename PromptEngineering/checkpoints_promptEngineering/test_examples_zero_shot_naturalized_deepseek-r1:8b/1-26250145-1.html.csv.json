    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Didi Benami sing the song choice 'angel' before 'lean on me'.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if Didi Benami is mentioned and which songs she sang. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow 1: Week: audition, theme: auditioner's choice, song choice: hey jude, original artist: The Beatles. Here, the original artist is The Beatles, not Didi Benami, so I don't think this is relevant.\n\nRow 2: Week: hollywood, theme: first solo, song choice: terrified, original artist: Katharine McPhee. Again, the original artist is someone else, so probably not Didi here.\n\nRow 3: Week: hollywood, group performance, song choice: no one, original artist: Alicia Keys. Not relevant either.\n\nRow 4: Week: hollywood, theme: second solo, song choice: angel, original artist: Sarah McLachlan. Still not Didi.\n\nNow, starting from Row 5 onwards, the weeks are top 24 (12 women), top 20 (10 women), etc., which might be where the contestants perform.\n\nRow 5: Week: top 24, theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: the way I am, original artist: Ingrid Michaelson. Not Didi.\n\nRow 6: Week: top 20, theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: lean on me, original artist: Bill Withers. So this is where \"lean on me\" was performed by someone else.\n\nRow 7: Week: top 16, theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: rhiannon, original artist: Fleetwood Mac. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: Week: top 12, theme: the rolling stones, song choice: play with fire, original artist: The Rolling Stones. Still not Didi.\n\nRow 9: Week: top 11, theme: billboard 1 hits, song choice: you're no good, original artist: Betty Everett. Not relevant.\n\nSo I don't see Didi Benami mentioned anywhere in the table as an original artist or participant. Therefore, she didn't perform \"angel\" before \"lean on me.\" The claim seems to be false because there's no evidence of her singing \"angel\" and then later \"lean on me.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"no one be not the last song choice for didi benami\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"no one.\" Looking at the table, I see that each row has a column called \"song choice,\" which lists the songs chosen by various artists. So, \"no one\" probably refers to someone's song choice in this context.\n\nNext, the claim says \"be not the last song choice for didi benami.\" So, it's talking about Didi Benami's song choices and whether \"no one\" is not the last one she chose.\n\nI'll need to look through each row of the table to see if any mention Didi Benami as an artist. But scanning through the original table data, I don't immediately see any row where the \"original artist\" is Didi Benami. The artists listed are The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Wethers, Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones, among others. There's no mention of Didi Benami in any row.\n\nSince Didi Benami isn't present as an original artist in the table, there's no way to confirm or deny whether \"no one\" is her last song choice because she doesn't have any entries here. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we check for Didi Benami in the original artist column but find none.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim refers to \"no one\" being the last song choice of Didi Benami.\n2. **Analyze the Table Data:** Look through each row's \"original artist\" column for Didi Benami.\n3. **Conclusion from Data:** No entries exist for Didi Benami, making it impossible to verify the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, the claim is stating that Didi Benami is ranked number 5 in two specific weeks: Top 20 (10 women) and Top 16 (8 women). \n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find if there's a row where \"theme\" or any other column mentions Didi Benami. But wait, scanning through each row, I don't see any mention of her name. The rows have details like week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. None of these columns seem to reference the contestant's name directly.\n\nThe claim is specifically about her being number 5 in two different weeks. Since her name isn't present in the table, it seems unlikely that she even participated, let alone being ranked. Therefore, there's no information supporting this claim.\n\nI should check if I missed anything. Maybe \"theme\" or another column has Didi Benami? But each row lists themes like \"billboard hot 100 hits,\" \"the rolling stones,\" etc., none of which indicate a contestant's name. The orders are numbers without names attached, so it's impossible to know which contestant corresponds to that number unless the name is provided.\n\nGiven all this, there's no data in the table supporting Didi Benami being ranked or even participating in those weeks.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the way i am be one of 3 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit\". So, they're saying that \"the way I am\" is one of three song choices under the theme \"Billboard Hot 100 Hits\".\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to see if there's any relevant information.\n\nRow 5: week: top 24 (12 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: the way i am, original artist: ingrid michaelson, order:9, result: safe. Here, \"the way i am\" is listed as the song choice under the \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme.\n\nNow, I need to check if this was one of three choices for that theme. The claim says it was one of three, so let me see if there are other songs in the same row or elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the table, rows 5,6,7 all have the \"billboard hot 100 hits\" theme:\n\n- Row 5: the way i am\n- Row 6: lean on me by bill withers\n- Row 7: rhiannon by fleetwood mac\n\nWait, that's three songs under that theme. So in row 5, it's one of three.\n\nBut the claim says \"the way i am be one of 3 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit\". It uses \"be\" instead of \"is\", which is a grammatical error, but I think they mean it's one of three choices.\n\nSo, yes, in row 5, under the billboard hot 100 hits theme, there are three songs: the way i am, lean on me, and rhiannon. Therefore, the claim is true because \"the way i am\" is indeed one of three song choices for that theme.\n\nI should make sure there's no other relevant information elsewhere. Let me check if any other row has billboard hot 100 hits with more than three songs. But from the table provided, only rows 5-7 have that theme, each with a different song choice, so exactly three songs.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a hollywood theme.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see where the song \"terrified\" appears and what the theme was for that week. The table has several rows, each representing a different week and various details like theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result.\n\nStarting from Row 1: week is audition, theme is auditioner's choice. The song here is \"hey jude,\" so that's not it.\n\nRow 2: week is hollywood, theme is first solo. Song choice is \"terrified,\" original artist is Katharine McPhee. So this row has \"terrified\" as the song choice in a hollywood-themed week. That seems relevant because the claim mentions \"a week with a hollywood theme.\"\n\nRow 3: week is hollywood, theme is group performance, song is \"no one.\" Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: week is hollywood, theme is second solo, song is \"angel.\" No match.\n\nRows 5-9 have different weeks and themes, none of which mention \"terrified\" as the song choice. So the only occurrence of \"terrified\" is in Row 2 under a hollywood theme.\n\nTherefore, since \"terrified\" was performed in a week with a hollywood theme, the claim should be TRUE. The relevant cells are in Row 2, specifically the column for \"song choice.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 2 where \"terrified\" was performed during a Hollywood-themed week.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim \"didi benami sand the song choice no one before hey jude\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by breaking down the claim.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions Didi Benami, which might refer to a person, and it talks about two song choices: \"no one\" and \"hey jude.\" The claim suggests that \"no one\" was chosen before \"hey jude.\" So, I need to check if there's an instance where \"no one\" was selected as the song choice in a row before \"hey jude.\"\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different week and various details like theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. The key columns here are \"song choice,\" so I'll focus on that.\n\nI'll go through each row to see where \"no one\" and \"hey jude\" appear.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Song choice is \"hey jude.\" So, that's the first mention of \"hey jude.\"\n\nNow, looking for \"no one\": Scanning the table, in Row 3, the song choice is \"no one.\" Let me check when this happened. The row index is 3. Since Row 1 is about \"hey jude,\" does Row 3 come before it? Yes, because the rows are numbered starting from 0 or 1? Wait, the first row is Row 1: week: audition, so probably indices start at 1.\n\nSo Row 3 is week: hollywood with song choice \"no one.\" This happens before Row 1 (which is the first week). Therefore, in the table, \"no one\" was chosen before \"hey jude.\"\n\nBut wait, let me confirm if Didi Benami's involvement is a factor. The claim mentions her name, but I don't see any reference to Didi Benami in the table. All the original artists mentioned are Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones.\n\nSo, there's no mention of Didi Benami in the table provided. Therefore, her involvement isn't documented here. Without evidence of her participation in either song choice, we can't confirm that she was involved in selecting \"no one\" before \"hey jude.\"\n\nWait, but the claim is about whether she sand the song choice, which I think refers to her choosing the songs in a particular order. Since the table doesn't mention Didi Benami at all, it's unclear if she even participated in the selection process.\n\nSo, given that there's no data about Didi Benami in the table, we can't verify whether \"no one\" was chosen before \"hey jude\" by her or anyone else. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no supporting evidence in the provided table.\n\nBut wait again, the relevant cells would be the ones where \"song choice\" is \"no one\" and \"hey jude.\" So the rows are 3 (song choice: no one) and 1 (song choice: hey jude). Since Row 3 comes before Row 1 in the table order, that suggests that \"no one\" was chosen before \"hey jude.\"\n\nHowever, without Didi Benami being part of any row's original artist or theme, her role isn't confirmed. So the actual selection process might not involve her, making the claim unfounded based on the given data.\n\nI think the key here is to focus only on the information provided in the table and not rely on external information about Didi Benami. Since she isn't listed as an original artist or involved in any row, we can't connect her with either song choice.\n\nTherefore, even though \"no one\" was chosen before \"hey jude,\" there's no evidence that this was done by Didi Benami, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that \"no one\" (Row 3) was chosen before \"hey jude\" (Row 1). However, since Didi Benami isn't mentioned in any row, her involvement isn't confirmed. Without her participation being documented, the claim can't be fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"no one be the last song choice for didi benami.\" So I need to check if Didi Benami's last song choice was 'no one'. \n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a contestant, including their original artist and song choice. But wait, in this table, it seems like all the original artists are well-known, like The Beatles, Alicia Keys, etc., but I don't see Didi Benami listed anywhere. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nMaybe Didi Benami wasn't part of the top 24 or whatever group this is? Or perhaps she was, but her performance isn't detailed here. Wait, maybe I should look for any row where the original artist is Didi Benami. But scanning through the table, all the original artists are other people: The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, etc. There's no mention of Didi Benami in the 'original artist' column.\n\nSo if Didi Benami isn't listed here, that might mean her last song choice isn't present either. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the claim is about whether she chose 'no one' as her last song, so I need to see if 'no one' was chosen by someone else or if it's relevant. However, looking at the table, in row 3, Alicia Keys chose 'no one'. So that might be confusing.\n\nWait, but the claim is specifically about Didi Benami, not Alicia Keys. So since Didi isn't listed and her song choice isn't mentioned, maybe the claim is false because there's no evidence of it here. Alternatively, if someone else chose 'no one', does that affect the claim?

The claim says: \"the way i am be one of 5 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. It mentions a specific song called \"the way i am\", a theme (\"billboard hot 100 hits\"), and specifies that it should be one of 5 song choices. So, I need to find in the table if there's an entry where these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. The relevant columns here are 'theme', 'song choice', 'order', and 'result'. Since the claim is about being one of 5 choices under the billboard hot 100 hits theme, I should focus on rows where the theme matches that.\n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: Week: audition, theme: auditioner's choice... Not relevant.\nRow 2: Week: hollywood, theme: first solo... Not relevant.\nRow 3: Week: hollywood, theme: group performance... Not relevant.\nRow 4: Week: hollywood, theme: second solo... Not relevant.\nRow 5: Week: top 24 (12 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: the way i am. This looks relevant because it's the exact song mentioned in the claim and under the correct theme.\n\nContinuing to check if there are other entries for the same theme:\n\nRow 6: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: lean on me... Not our song.\nRow 7: billboard hot 100 hits, song choice: rhiannon... Not our song.\nRow 8: theme is the rolling stones, so not relevant.\nRow 9: billboard 1 hits, different theme.\n\nSo only Row 5 matches both the theme and the song choice mentioned in the claim. The claim states that \"the way i am\" should be one of 5 choices under this theme. From the table, it seems like each week has a certain number of advanced results. For billboard hot 100 hits, there are three entries: Row 5 (song: the way i am), Row 6 (song: lean on me), and Row 7 (song: rhiannon). That's three songs, not five.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"one of 5 song choices\", implying that there are at least five options for that theme in the table. However, looking at the table, under the 'billboard hot 100 hits' theme, only three songs are listed (the way i am, lean on me, rhiannon). So if the claim says it's one of five, but the table shows three, that would make the claim FALSE because there aren't five song choices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check again:\n\nRow 5: the way i am\nRow 6: lean on me\nRow 7: rhiannon\n\nThat's three entries. So unless there are more rows with that theme beyond what's listed here, it doesn't meet five. Since the table provided only goes up to Row 9, and within those rows only three songs under billboard hot 100 hits, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I will check each relevant cell in the table for the conditions stated in the claim.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- **Song:** \"the way i am\"\n- **Theme:** \"billboard hot 100 hits\"\n- **Condition:** Should be one of 5 song choices\n\n**Table Check:**\n1. Look for rows where the theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\".\n2. Among these, check if the song choice includes \"the way i am\".\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 5 has the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\" and song choice \"the way i am\".\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n1. **Row 5:** Contains the relevant song under the correct theme.\n\nHowever, the claim states there are 5 such song choices.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's about someone singing a song called \"terrified\" during a week that had a Bollywood theme. So, I need to find if there's any row in the table where the song choice is \"terrified\" and the theme is related to Bollywood.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. My focus should be on the 'theme' and 'song choice' columns for this claim.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Week is \"audition,\" theme is \"auditioner's choice.\" Song choice is \"hey jude\" by The Beatles. No mention of Bollywood here.\n\nRow 2: Week is \"hollywood,\" theme is \"first solo.\" Song is \"terrified\" by Katharine McPhee. Hmm, the song is \"terrified,\" but the theme isn't specified as Bollywood. So this might be relevant because the song in question is here, but I need to check the theme.\n\nRow 3: Week is \"hollywood,\" theme is \"group performance.\" Song is \"no one\" by Alicia Keys. Not the song we're looking for.\n\nRow 4: Week is \"hollywood,\" theme is \"second solo.\" Song is \"angel\" by Sarah McLachlan. Again, not relevant.\n\nRows 5-9: These are top rounds where themes include Billboard hits and others like The Rolling Stones, but I don't see any Bollywood themes mentioned in these rows.\n\nWait, the claim mentions a week with a Bollywood theme. So the 'theme' column should have \"Bollywood\" or something similar for that week. Scanning through each row's theme:\n\nRow 1: audition\nRow 2: first solo\nRow 3: group performance\nRow 4: second solo\nRows 5-9: various themes like Billboard hits, The Rolling Stones, etc., but none say Bollywood.\n\nSo there's no week in the table where the theme is Bollywood. Therefore, \"terrified\" can't be associated with a Bollywood theme week because that week doesn't exist here.\n\nWait, actually, row 2 has the song \"terrified,\" but the theme is \"first solo.\" So even though she sang \"terrified,\" it wasn't during a Bollywood-themed week. The claim says she sang it in a Bollywood week, which isn't supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates \"terrified\" with a Bollywood theme week, but the table shows no such week exists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"theme\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
