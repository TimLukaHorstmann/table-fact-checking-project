    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"vince carter and hakeem olajuwon be the high rebounders in game 62 against houston.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two players, Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon, being the high rebounders in a specific game (game 62) against Houston.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant row for game 62. The table has 14 rows, each corresponding to a different game. So, I'll search through the 'game' column for game number 62. \n\nRow 3 is game 62: date is March 5, team is Houston, and so on. Now, in this row, under 'high rebounds', it says \"vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7)\". That means both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon are listed as the top rebounders for that game.\n\nAdditionally, the location is compaq center with 14221 attendance. The opponent is Houston, which matches the claim. So, all details align with the claim: the game is 62 against Houston, and both named players are the high rebounders.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies in the data provided. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking game 62's high rebounds, which include both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Orlando win game 65 with a score of 79 - 92.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the row in the table where the game number is 65. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 6 corresponds to game 65. So, game 65 is row_index 6.\n\nIn Row 6, let's check each relevant piece of information from the claim. The claim mentions an Orlando win, so I need to verify the team. Yes, Row 6 lists the team as Orlando.\n\nNext, the score mentioned in the claim is 79 - 92. Looking at the 'score' column for Row 6: it says \"l 79 - 92 (ot)\", which means they lost with a score of 79-92 in overtime. Wait, that's interesting because the claim says \"Orlando win game 65\". But if they lost, then the result would be a loss, not a win.\n\nSo this seems contradictory. The claim states Orlando won game 65 with that specific score, but according to Row 6, it was actually a loss. That would mean the claim is incorrect because the team didn't win but instead lost.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Orlando won game 65 with a score of 79-92. However, according to Row 6 in the table, the game was a loss for Orlando with the same score mentioned in the claim. This contradicts the assertion that they won, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"On March 10, Vince Carter (43) have high point and Alvin Williams (9) have high assist.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions two specific achievements for two players on a particular date.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows corresponding to different games, each having various columns like game number, date, team, score, high points, etc. So, I need to find the row where the game was played on March 10 and check if Vince Carter scored 43 points as a high point and Alvin Williams had 9 assists.\n\nI'll start by going through each row to locate the one that matches March 10. Scanning the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 1: March 1\n- Row 2: March 3\n- Row 3: March 5\n- Row 4: March 7\n- Row 5: March 8\n- Row 6: March 10\n\nAh, there's Row 6 with the date March 10. Now, looking at the high points and high assists for that row.\n\nIn Row 6:\n- High points: Vince Carter (16)\n- High rebounds: Antonio Davis (12)\n- High assists: Chris Childs (7)\n\nWait a minute, the claim says Vince Carter scored 43 points, but in Row 6, he only has 16. That's way off. So that part doesn't match.\n\nNow checking for Alvin Williams' assists. The claim mentions 9 assists, but looking at Row 6, it's Chris Childs who has 7 assists. There's no mention of Alvin Williams having 9 in this row.\n\nI should also confirm if there's any other row with March 10, but from the table provided, only Row 6 is on that date. So, both parts of the claim don't hold true for the same game.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be FALSE because the stats mentioned by the claim don't align with what's recorded in the table for March 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a specific game is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"game number 72 on march 28 be against cleveland with a score of w 94 - 80 (ot).\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Game Number**: 72\n2. **Date**: March 28\n3. **Opponent Team**: Cleveland\n4. **Score**: W 94 - 80 (OT)\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has 14 rows, each representing a game with specific details. The columns include game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record.\n\nI'll start by locating game number 72 in the table. Scanning through the row numbers: game 70 is March 24 against Washington, game 71 is March 27 against Miami, game 72 is March 28 against Atlanta. So, the opponent listed in the claim (Cleveland) doesn't match what's in the table for game 72.\n\nIn the table, game 72 is against Atlanta, not Cleveland. That already suggests a discrepancy. But I should check all parts to be thorough.\n\nNext, the score in the claim is w 94 - 80 (OT). Looking at game 72 in the table: the score is listed as \"w 85 - 83 (ot)\". So the scores don't match either\u2014claim says 94-80, but actual is 85-83. Therefore, both the opponent and the score are different.\n\nAdditionally, the location attendance for game 72 is 12036 at Philips Arena, while the claim doesn't specify this, but since the opponent and score are wrong, it's not necessary to check further details.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim has two incorrect elements: the opponent team and the score. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
