    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a specific claim about a football match is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down how I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"on 14 february 1976 the away team be manchester united and score 1 - 2 with home team leicester city.\" So, the claim is making two specific statements: one about the away team and another about the score. My job is to check if these match any of the matches listed in the table on that particular date.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that each row has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. The claim mentions a specific date, 14 February 1976, so my first step is to focus only on rows where the date is \"14 february 1976.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: tie no: 1, home team: leicester city, score: 1 - 2, away team: manchester united, date: 14 february 1976. This seems to match the claim exactly on all points\u2014away team is Manchester United, score is 1-2 against Leicester City. So this row is definitely relevant.\n\nRow 2: tie no: 2, home team: bolton wanderers, score: 3 - 3, away team: newcastle united, date: 14 february 1976. The away team here is Newcastle United, which doesn't match the claim's away team of Manchester United. So this row isn't relevant.\n\nRow 3: tie no: replay, home team: newcastle united, score: 0 - 0, away team: bolton wanderers, date: 18 february 1976. The date here is different, so it doesn't apply to the claim which specifies 14 February. Also, the teams involved are Newcastle and Bolton, not Manchester United or Leicester City.\n\nRow 4: tie no: replay, home team: bolton wanderers, score: 1 - 2, away team: newcastle united, date: 23 february 1976. The date is later than the claim's date, so it doesn't apply.\n\nRow 5: tie no: 3, home team: wolverhampton wanderers, score: 3 - 0, away team: charlton athletic, date: 14 february 1976. No match here for Manchester United or Leicester City.\n\nRow 6: tie no: 4, home team: west bromwich albion, score: 1 - 1, away team: southampton, date: 14 february 1976. The teams involved don't match the claim.\n\nRow 7: tie no: replay, home team: southampton, score: 4 - 0, away team: west bromwich albion, date: 17 february 1976. Date is later and different teams.\n\nRow 8: tie no: 5, home team: derby county, score: 1 - 0, away team: southend united, date: 14 february 1976. Doesn't match the claim's teams or score.\n\nRow 9: tie no: 6, home team: norwich city, score: 1 - 2, away team: bradford city, date: 23 february 1976. Date later and different teams.\n\nRow 10: tie no: 7, home team: chelsea, score: 2 - 3, away team: crystal palace, date: 14 february 1976. Different teams and different score.\n\nRow 11: tie no: 8, home team: stoke city, score: 0 - 0, away team: sunderland, date: 14 february 1976. Doesn't match the claim's teams or score.\n\nRow 12: tie no: replay, home team: sunderland, score: 2 - 1, away team: stoke city, date: 17 february 1976. Date is later and different teams.\n\nSo after reviewing all the rows, only Row 1 matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is true based on the information in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each match on February 14, 1976, and only one row (Row 1) matches Manchester United as the away team with a score of 1-2 against Leicester City.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It says \"the score be 2 - 1 when the away team be stoke city and home team be sunderland and the score be 0 - 0 when the away team be sunderland and home team be stoke city.\"\n\nSo there are two parts to this claim. I'll need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a list of matches with details like tie no (which might be some sort of identifier), home team, score, away team, and date. Each row represents a different match on specific dates.\n\nLet me break down the claim:\n\n1. The first condition: Score is 2 - 1 when the away team is Stoke City and the home team is Sunderland.\n2. The second condition: Score is 0 - 0 when the away team is Sunderland and the home team is Stoke City.\n\nI need to find if there's a match that satisfies each of these conditions in the table.\n\nStarting with the first condition (Score 2-1, away team Stoke City, home team Sunderland). I'll look through each row:\n\nRow 1: tie no 1, Leicester vs Man Utd. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Bolton vs Newcastle. No.\nRow 3: Newcastle vs Bolton in a replay. Score is 0-0. Away team is Bolton, so no.\nRow 4: Bolton vs Newcastle again, score 1-2. Home is Bolton, away is Newcastle. Not matching.\nRow 5: Wolves vs Charlton. Not relevant.\nRow 6: West Brom vs Southampton. No.\nRow 7: Southampton vs West Brom in replay, score 4-0. No.\nRow 8: Derby vs Southend. No.\nRow 9: Norwich vs Bradford. No.\nRow 10: Chelsea vs Crystal Palace. No.\nRow 11: Stoke vs Sunderland, score 0-0. Here, home team is Stoke, away is Sunderland. Not matching the first condition because the score here is 0-0, not 2-1.\n\nThen Row 12: Sunderland vs Stoke in a replay, score 2-1. Home team is Sunderland, away is Stoke. This matches the first condition of the claim (Score 2-1, home Sunderland, away Stoke).\n\nSo the first part of the claim is supported by Row 12.\n\nNow, checking the second condition: Score 0-0 when away team is Sunderland and home team is Stoke City.\n\nLooking for a match where away team is Sunderland and home is Stoke with a score of 0-0. Let's check each row again.\n\nRow 11: Stoke vs Sunderland, score 0-0. Here, home is Stoke, away is Sunderland. So this matches the second condition exactly.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by rows in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, I checked each relevant row for the specified conditions.\n\nThe first condition (Score 2-1 with Stoke as away and Sunderland as home) is found in Row 12. The second condition (Score 0-0 with Sunderland as away and Stoke as home) is found in Row 11.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Chelsea be the home team when Crystal Palace be the away team and Norwich City be the home team when Bradford City be the away team.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Chelsea as the home team vs. Crystal Palace as the away team.\n2. Norwich City as the home team vs. Bradford City as the away team.\n\nI need to check each part against the table to see if these match-ups exist on the same date or if there's any overlap that might cause a conflict.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find matches where Chelsea plays against Crystal Palace and Norwich City plays against Bradford City. \n\nStarting with Chelsea vs. Crystal Palace:\n\nI go through each row:\n- Row 1: Leicester City vs. Manchester United\n- Row 2: Bolton Wanderers vs. Newcastle United\n- Row 3: Newcastle United vs. Bolton Wanderers (replay)\n- Row 4: Bolton Wanderers vs. Newcastle United (replay)\n- Row 5: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs. Charlton Athletic\n- Row 6: West Bromwich Albion vs. Southampton\n- Row 7: Southampton vs. West Bromwich Albion (replay)\n- Row 8: Derby County vs. Southend United\n- Row 9: Norwich City vs. Bradford City\n- Row 10: Chelsea vs. Crystal Palace\n- Row 11: Stoke City vs. Sunderland\n- Row 12: Sunderland vs. Stoke City (replay)\n\nWait, in row 10, it's Chelsea home against Crystal Palace away. That matches the first part of the claim. So that seems correct.\n\nNow for Norwich City vs. Bradford City:\n\nLooking through the same rows:\n- In row 9, it's Norwich City home vs. Bradford City away. That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are met in separate rows on the same date (14 February 1976). There doesn't seem to be any conflict or overlapping dates that would cause an issue.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because Chelsea hosts Crystal Palace and Norwich City hosts Bradford City in their respective matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"all game take place 14 february 1976 or after or 23 february 1976 or before and there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. All games take place on or after February 14, 1976, or on or before February 23, 1976.\n2. There are no ties where the score is higher than 8 or lower than 1.\n\nI'll analyze each part separately using the table data.\n\nStarting with the first part: The claim suggests that all games occur between these two dates. Looking at the table, each row has a \"date\" column. I need to check if every game's date falls within this timeframe.\n\nScanning through the rows:\n- Rows 1-5 have dates on February 14, which is exactly the starting date.\n- Rows 6 and 8 also have dates on February 14.\n- Rows 7 and 12 have dates on February 17 and 17, respectively, which are after February 14.\n- Rows 3 and 4 have dates on February 18 and 23, but wait\u2014February 18 is within the range because it's before February 23. So that's okay.\nWait, no, the claim says \"or before 23 february\" so all games should be between 14th and 23rd. But looking again:\n- Rows 1: 14/2/1976 (okay)\n- Row 2: same date\n- Row3: 18/2 (still within 14-23)\n- Row4: 23/2 (exact end date, okay)\n- Row5: 14/2 (okay)\n- Row6: 14/2 (okay)\n- Row7: 17/2 (okay)\n- Row8: 14/2 (okay)\n- Row9: 23/2 (exact end date)\n- Row10: 14/2\n- Row11: 14/2\n- Row12: 17/2\n\nSo all dates are between the 14th and 23rd of February, inclusive. So that part seems to hold true.\n\nNow the second part: No ties (scores where the home team's goals minus away is >8 or <1). So I need to check if any game has a score difference of 8 or more in favor of the home team or 1 or less in favor of the away team. Wait, actually, it says \"tie higher than 8 or below 1.\" Hmm, perhaps it's referring to scores that are too high (like home winning by 8+ goals) or tied very low (like 0-0, which is technically a tie but not relevant here). Or maybe it's about ties where the score is higher than 8 in either team. But the wording is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, the term \"tie\" might be ambiguous. In football, a tie typically means both teams have the same number of goals (e.g., 1-1 or 0-0). So if the claim says \"there be never a tie higher than 8 or below 1,\" it could mean that in any game, the score doesn't reach 8-0 or 0-8, which are extreme and rare. But looking at the table, do any games have such high scores?\n\nLooking through each row's \"score\" column:\n\nRow1: 1-2 (Home 1, Away 2) \u2192 difference of -1 for home.\nRow2: 3-3 (tie)\nRow3: replay, score 0-0 (tie)\nRow4: replay, 1-2 \u2192 away team wins by 1\nRow5: 3-0 (home 3, away 0) \u2192 difference +3\nRow6: 1-1 (tie)\nRow7: 4-0 \u2192 home team wins by 4\nRow8: 1-0 \u2192 home wins by 1\nRow9: 1-2 \u2192 away wins by 1\nRow10: 2-3 \u2192 away wins by 1\nRow11: 0-0 (tie)\nRow12: 2-1 \u2192 home wins by 1\n\nI don't see any scores where a team has scored more than 8 goals, and all ties are either 0-0 or 1-1. So there's no game with a score higher than 8 in either team's favor.\n\nTherefore, both conditions of the claim seem to hold based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because:\n- All games occur between February 14 and February 23, 1976.\n- No game has a score difference exceeding 8 or resulting in ties lower than 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    ...\n    # Include all rows as relevant for both conditions\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the away team be southend united when the score be 1 - 0 and the home team be chelsea when the score be 2 - 3.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1.

I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: tie no:1, Leicester City (home) vs Manchester Utd (away), score 1-2. Not matching.\nRow 2: tie no:2, Bolton Wanderers (home) vs Newcastle Utd, score 3-3. No match.\nRow 3: replay, Newcastle Utd (home) vs Bolton Wanderers, 0-0. No.\nRow 4: replay, Bolton Wanderers (home) vs Newcastle Utd, 1-2.

No.\nRow8: tie no:5, Derby County (home) vs Southend Utd, 1-0. Here we go! The score is 1-0 and the away team is Southend United. So this row matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the second condition: when the score is 2-3, home team is Chelsea. Let's check each row:\n\nRow9: tie no:6, Norwich (home) vs Bradford City, 1-2. No.\nRow10: tie no:7, Chelsea (home) vs Crystal Palace, score 2-3. Yes! Here, the score is 2-3 and home team is Chelsea.

The score is 2 - 3 when the home team is Sunderland and the away team is Stoke City.\n\nI need to check if both of these conditions are met in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- **Row 11**: tie no:8, home team: Stoke City, score:0-0, away team:Sunderland, date:14 Feb 1976.\n- **Row 12**: tie no: replay, home team: Sunderland, score:2-1, away team: Stoke City, date:17 Feb 1976.\n\nSo for the first condition (4-0), I don't see any row where Stoke City is home and Sunderland is away with a 4-0 score.

Let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: tie no:1, Leicester City (home) vs Manchester United (away), score 1-2, date 14 Feb 1976. So this is a home game for Leicester, away for Man U, but the score isn't 3-0, and it's on the 14th.\n\nRow 2: tie no:2, Bolton Wanderers (home) vs Newcastle United (away), 3-3, same date as row1. Not relevant.\n\nRow3: replay, Newcastle United (home) vs Bolton Wanderers (away), 0-0, 18 Feb. So this is a replay on the 18th. Home team is Newcastle, away is Bolton.

Row4 is Bolton (home) vs Newcastle (away), 1-2.\n\nSo none of the rows match the claim where Leicester City is the away team scoring 3-0 against Manchester United on 18 Feb.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"all game take place on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after and every game be a tie between 7 and 1.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts to analyze:\n\n1. **Game Dates**: All games either occur on 17 February 1976, before 14 February 1976, or after 14 February 1976.\n2. **Score Range**: Every game's score is a tie between 7 and 1.\n\nI'll start by checking the dates for each game in the table to see if they fit within these parameters.\n\n**Analyzing Game Dates:**\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 1: 14 Feb 1976 (before 17 Feb)\n- Row 2: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 3: 18 Feb 1976 (after 14 Feb)\n- Row 4: 23 Feb 1976 (after 14 Feb)\n- Row 5: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 6: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 7: 17 Feb 1976\n- Row 8: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 9: 23 Feb 1976 (after 14 Feb)\n- Row 10: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 11: 14 Feb 1976\n- Row 12: 17 Feb 1976\n\nSo, all games are either on or after 14 February. Specifically, some are on 14 Feb, and others are on 18 Feb and 23 Feb. However, the claim includes \"after\" as well, which seems to fit because 18 Feb and 23 Feb are after 14 Feb.\n\nWait, but does \"after 14 february 1976 or after\" make sense? Or is it possibly a typo? The wording says \"on 17 february 1976 or before 14 february 1976 or after.\" So games on 17 Feb are included as well. But in the table, only Rows 3 and 12 are on 18 Feb and 23 Feb, which are after 14 Feb but before 17 Feb? No, 18 Feb is after 14 Feb.\n\nWait, no, 17 Feb is after 14 Feb as well. So all games except those before 14 Feb fit the date condition. But in this table, all games are on or after 14 Feb, so that part seems to check out.\n\n**Analyzing Game Scores:**\n\nNow, I need to check if every game's score is a tie between 7 and 1. Looking at the 'score' column:\n\n- Row 1: 1 - 2 (Home: Leicester City vs Away: Manchester United) \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 2: 3 - 3 (Bolton Wanderers vs Newcastle United) \u2192 Tie.\n- Row 3: 0 - 0 \u2192 Tie.\n- Row 4: 1 - 2 \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 5: 3 - 0 \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 6: 1 - 1 \u2192 Tie.\n- Row 7: 4 - 0 \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 8: 1 - 0 \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 9: 1 - 2 \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 10: 2 - 3 \u2192 Not a tie.\n- Row 11: 0 - 0 \u2192 Tie.\n- Row 12: 2 - 1 \u2192 Not a tie.\n\nSo, only Rows 2, 3, 6, and 11 have ties. The claim states that every game is a tie between 7 and 1, which implies all games must be tied with scores within the range of 1 to 7. However, in reality, many games do not meet this criteria; they either have a score outside the tied range or are not tied at all.\n\nFor example, Row 1 has a score of 1-2, which isn't a tie and also doesn't fall between 1 and 7 as a tie. The same applies to Rows 4,5,7,8,9,10,12, etc. Thus, the claim that every game is a tie within this range is false because most games don't meet these conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe dates all fit into the criteria mentioned in the claim (on or before/after the specified dates). However, the score condition isn't met by all games; many are not tied or have scores outside the stated range. Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully understanding both the claim and the table structure.\n\nThe claim states: \"Chelsea be the away team when Sunderland be the home team and Stoke City be the home team when Southampton be the away team.\" Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. I think it's two separate conditions connected with 'and', so each condition needs to be checked individually.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Chelsea is the away team when Sunderland is the home team.\n2. Stoke City is the home team when Southampton is the away team.\n\nSo, I need to find matches in the table where these conditions hold true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: tie no (which might be a reference number), home team, score, away team, and date. The rows go from 1 to 12, with some having 'replay' as the tie no, which probably indicates a replay or re-scheduled match.\n\nI'll start by identifying all matches where Sunderland is the home team. Then, I'll check if Chelsea is listed as the away team in any of those matches.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home: Leicester City, Away: Manchester United\nRow 2: Home: Bolton Wanderers, Away: Newcastle United\nRow 3: Home: Newcastle United, Away: Bolton Wanderers (replay)\nRow 4: Home: Bolton Wanderers, Away: Newcastle United (replay)\nRow 5: Home: Wolverhampton Wanderers, Away: Charlton Athletic\nRow 6: Home: West Bromwich Albion, Away: Southampton\nRow 7: Home: Southampton, Away: West Bromwich Albion (replay)\nRow 8: Home: Derby County, Away: Southend United\nRow 9: Home: Norwich City, Away: Bradford City\nRow 10: Home: Chelsea, Away: Crystal Palace\nRow 11: Home: Stoke City, Away: Sunderland\nRow 12: Home: Sunderland, Away: Stoke City (replay)\n\nWait a minute, I might have misread some rows. Let me go through each row again carefully.\n\nLooking for matches where Sunderland is the home team:\n\nI see that in Row 11: Home is Stoke City, so not Sunderland. Then, in Row 12: tie no is replay, Home is Sunderland, Away is Stoke City. So yes, there's a match where Sunderland is home and Stoke City is away.\n\nBut I'm looking for when Sunderland is home and Chelsea is away. Wait, in Row 11, the away team is Sunderland, so that doesn't fit. In Row 12, the away team is Stoke City, not Chelsea.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each row to find matches where Sunderland is home:\n\nLooking through all rows, only Row 12 has Sunderland as the home team. So in that match, the away team is Stoke City, not Chelsea. Therefore, there's no match where Sunderland is home and Chelsea is away.\n\nSo the first condition of the claim isn't met because Chelsea isn't listed as the away team when Sunderland is the home team.\n\nMoving on to the second part: Stoke City is the home team when Southampton is the away team.\n\nLooking for matches where Home is Stoke City and Away is Southampton.\n\nChecking each row, in Row 12, Home is Sunderland. So not that one. Let me go through again:\n\nRow 7: Home is Southampton, so no. The other matches don't have both Stoke City as home and Southampton as away.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a match. Let's see:\n\nLooking for 'Stoke City' in the home team column. From the table:\n\nRow 11: Home is Stoke City, Away is Sunderland.\nRow 12: Home is Sunderland, Away is Stoke City (replay).\n\nSo only Row 11 and 12 involve Stoke City as a participant.\n\nIn Row 11, Home is Stoke City, Away is Sunderland. In Row 12, it's a replay where Home is Sunderland, Away is Stoke City.\n\nI don't see any match where the home team is Stoke City and the away team is Southampton. Therefore, this condition isn't met either.\n\nSo both conditions of the claim are not fully supported by the table data. That means the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires two specific conditions to be true based on the provided matches. Upon reviewing each match in the table, neither condition is satisfied. Chelsea isn't the away team when Sunderland is home, and Stoke City isn't the home team against Southampton.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Matches Involving Sunderland as Home Team:**\n   - Only Row 12 has Sunderland as the home team, with Stoke City as the away team.\n\n2. **Check for Chelsea as Away Team in Those Matches:**\n   - No matches where Sunderland is home and Chelsea is away exist.\n\n3. **Identify Matches Involving Stoke City as Home Team:**\n   - Only Row 11 has Stoke City at home, facing Sunderland.\n\n4. **Check for Southampton as Away Team in Those Matches:**\n   - No matches have Stoke City at home against Southampton.\n\n**Conclusion:** Neither condition of the claim is supported by the table data, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Each row has:\n- tie no: Some number or 'replay'\n- home team: The team playing at home\n- score: The result as two numbers separated by a dash (like 1-2)\n- away team: The visiting team\n- date: When the match took place\n\nI need to scan each row and look for the conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1:\ntie no: 1\nhome team: Leicester City\nscore: 1 - 2\naway team: Manchester United\ndate: 14 Feb 1976\n\nHere, away team is Manchester United, but the score is 1-2. The claim looks for 0-0 and 2-1, so this row doesn't match.\n\nRow 2:\ntie no: 2\nhome team: Bolton Wanderers\nscore: 3 - 3\naway team: Newcastle United\ndate: 14 Feb 1976\n\nScore is 3-3. Not relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 3:\ntie no: replay\nhome team: Newcastle United\nscore: 0 - 0\naway team: Bolton Wanderers\ndate: 18 Feb 1976\n\nHere, home team is Newcastle United, and score is 0-0.

Not relevant for the claim.\n\nRow 8:\ntie no: 5\nhome team: Derby County\nscore: 1 - 0\naway team: Southend United\ndate: 14 Feb 1976\n\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 9:\ntie no: 6\nhome team: Norwich City\nscore: 1 - 2\naway team: Bradford City\ndate: 23 Feb 1976\n\nHere, home team is Norwich City with a score of 1-2. The claim mentions home team as Norwich City and score 2-1, but this row's score is 1-2.\n\nRow 10:\ntie no: 7\nhome team: Chelsea\nscore: 2 - 3\naway team: Crystal Palace\ndate: 14 Feb 1976\n\nNot matching the claim.\n\nRow 11:\ntie no: 8\nhome team: Stoke City\nscore: 0 - 0\naway team: Sunderland\ndate: 14 Feb 1976\n\nScore is 0-0, but away team is Sunderland. The claim requires Manchester United as away with 0-0, so not matching.\n\nRow 12:\ntie no: replay\nhome team: Sunderland\nscore: 2 - 1\naway team: Stoke City\ndate: 17 Feb 1976\n\nHere, home team is Sunderland with a score of 2-1. The claim looks for Norwich City as home with 2-1.\n\nSo after checking all rows, I don't see any match where the away team is Manchester United and the score is 0-0, nor do I see a row where the home team is Norwich City and the score is 2-1.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The claim has two separate conditions:\n1. Away team is Manchester United when the score is 0-0.\n2. Home team is Norwich City when the score is 2-1.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nFor the first condition (Manchester United away with 0-0):\nOnly Row 3 had a 0-0 score, but the away team was Bolton Wanderers, not Manchester United.\n\nFor the second condition (Norwich City home with 2-1):\nLooking for rows where home is Norwich and score is 2-1. The only row related to Norwich is Row 9, which had a score of 1-2. So no match there either.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim aren't met by any row in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported by any entries in the table. Neither Manchester United has an away game with a 0-0 score nor Norwich City has a home game ending in a 2-1 result based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
