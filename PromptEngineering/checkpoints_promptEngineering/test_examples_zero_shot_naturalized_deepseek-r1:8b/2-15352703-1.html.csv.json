    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided and identify which rows are relevant to the claim. The claim mentions draft pick number 155 and Arizona University. So I need to find the row where the pick number is 155 and see if the college mentioned is Arizona.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: pick 16, player James Williams, from Fresno State.\nRow 2: pick 43, player Carwell Gardner, from Louisville.\nRow 3: pick 70, player Glenn Parker, from Arizona.\nRow 4: pick 101, Eddie Fuller, LSU.\nRow 5: pick 155, John Nies, Arizona.\n\nWait, here we go. Row 5 has pick number 155 and the college is Arizona. So that would support the claim.\n\nBut hold on, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other relevant rows. The claim specifically mentions \"arizona university,\" so it's about the college. Other picks like row 3 also have Arizona but for Glenn Parker, but that's pick 70, not 155. So only row 5 is relevant.\n\nTherefore, since draft pick number 155 is from Arizona (as per row 5), the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row has information about a player: their round and pick number in the draft, their name, position, and college. The claim is specifically about Arizona being the college with the last draft pick.\n\nSo, to check if Arizona is the last college picked, I need to find out which colleges are represented in the table and see where they appear in order of picking. Since it's a draft, the later picks (higher numbers) would come after earlier ones, so the highest pick number corresponds to the last pick.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Fresno State, pick 16\nRow 2: Louisville, pick 43\nRow 3: Arizona, pick 70\nRow 4: LSU, pick 101\nRow 5: Arizona, pick 155\nRow 6: Minnesota-Duluth, pick 167\nRow 7: Carson-Newman, pick 171\nRow 8: Syracuse, pick 182\nRow 9: UCLA, pick 209\nRow 10: Duke, pick 239\nRow 11: UCLA, pick 266\nRow 12: Northwestern State (LA), pick 293\n\nWait, the last pick is 293, which is for Northwestern State. So Arizona has two entries but their picks are earlier than that. Therefore, Arizona isn't the college with the last pick.\n\nI need to make sure I'm focusing on the \"college\" column and the pick numbers. The highest pick number corresponds to the last pick, so pick 293 is from Northwestern State, making their the last one. Since Arizona's picks are at positions 70 and 155, which are much earlier, they don't have the last pick.\n\nSo the claim is false because the last draft pick in this table is Northwestern State, not Arizona.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
