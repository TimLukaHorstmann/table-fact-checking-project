    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"lj burger be a player on 19 - 2 - 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It mentions \"lj burger\" as the player and specifies the date \"19 - 2 - 2003\". My task is to verify if this specific entry exists in the provided table.\n\nI'll start by examining each row of the table to find any matches. The table has eight rows, each with different players, catches, versus teams, venues, and dates.\n\nRow 1: Player is m kaif on 10 - 03 - 2003.\nRow 2: v sehwag on 12 - 02 - 2003.\nRow 3: lj burger on 19 - 02 - 2003. This matches the date and player name.\nRow 4 onwards don't have lj burger.\n\nSince Row 3 has lj burger with catches: 3, versus: england, venue: port elizabeth, and date: 19 - 02 - 2003, it directly supports the claim. There's no conflicting information or another entry for the same player on that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"player\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"m kaif have 4 catch vs sri lanka\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about m kaif having 4 catches against Sri Lanka. So, I need to find in the table where m kaif is involved in a match against Sri Lanka and see if the number of catches matches.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match. The columns are: catches, player, versus, venue, date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check for \"m kaif\". \n\nRow 1: Player is m kaif, vs Sri Lanka. So this looks relevant because it's about m kaif against Sri Lanka. Now, what's the catch number here? It says catches:4. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, I should check if there are any other rows with m kaif, though from the table provided, row 1 is the only one with his name. So that's the only relevant data point.\n\nNow, to confirm: in row 1, catches=4, player=m kaif, versus=Sri Lanka. All three parts of the claim are satisfied here. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut I should make sure there aren't any other entries for m kaif against Sri Lanka with different catch numbers. From the table, it seems only row 1 has m kaif against Sri Lanka, so no need to look further.\n\nSo, the relevant cell is row_index=0 (since rows start at 0) and column_name=\"catches\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"catches\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"jp maher have a date of 19 - 02 - 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"jp maher.\" Looking at the table, I need to check if there's a row where the player's name is \"jp maher.\" Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Player is m kaif.\nRow 2: Player is v sehwag.\nRow 3: Player is lj burger.\nRow 4: Player is jp maher. Ah, here we go. So, yes, there's a player named jp maher in Row 4.\n\nNext, the claim specifies \"a date of 19 - 02 - 2003.\" I need to check if this date appears for jp maher in any column related to the date. The table columns relevant to dates are likely the 'date' column since that's where each row lists the date of the event.\n\nLooking at Row 4, the date is listed as \"20 - 02 - 2003.\" So, the date associated with jp maher is February 20th, 2003. The claim says 19th, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the statement in the claim isn't correct for jp maher. It's about a different day than what's recorded in the table.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim \"jp maher have a date of 19 - 02 - 2003\" is true, we check the table for any entry with jp maher and the specified date.\n\n- **Player Check**: Only Row 4 lists jp maher as the player.\n- **Date Check**: The date in Row 4 is \"20 - 02 - 2003,\" not \"19 - 02 - 2003.\"\n\nSince the date doesn't match, the claim is false. No relevant cells support it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
