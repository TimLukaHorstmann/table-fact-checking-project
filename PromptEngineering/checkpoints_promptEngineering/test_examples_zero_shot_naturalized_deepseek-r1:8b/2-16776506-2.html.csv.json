    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"on 2 may 1999, the surface be hard.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table. The key points are the date (2 May 1999), location, and the surface being hard.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different match with details like outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. So, I should look for the row where the date is 2 May 1999.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Outcome: winner, Date: 2 May 1999. Location: Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Surface: Hard. Opponent: Candice Jairala. Score: 3 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 5.\n\nOkay, so the first row is on 2 May 1999, which matches the date in the claim. The surface here is listed as hard, which directly relates to the claim's assertion about the surface being hard.\n\nThe other rows don't have this specific date, so I can ignore them for this particular check. Therefore, the relevant cell is Row 1, specifically the \"surface\" column.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no multiple entries or additional details that might affect this. But since the claim is only about one specific date and the surface condition, only row 1 is relevant here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim states that on 2 May 1999, the surface was hard. Checking the table confirms that in Row 1, on that date, the surface was indeed hard. There's no conflicting information elsewhere because other rows don't have this date. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out correctly as all relevant cells confirm the surface was hard on 2 May 1999.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Mirielle Dittmann is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll carefully read the claim: \"mirielle dittmann be the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand.\"\n\nI need to verify each part of this claim against the table. Let's break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Subject**: Mirielle Dittmann\n2. **Role**: Opponent in the final\n3. **Surface Type**: Hard surface\n4. **Date**: 6 February 2000\n5. **Location**: Wellington, New Zealand\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find a match.\n\nStarting with Row 1: outcome is winner, date is 2 May 1999, location Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, surface hard. Opponent in final is Candice Jairala. Not relevant because the date doesn't match and the location isn't Wellington.\n\nRow 2: outcome winner, date 11 July 1999, location Felixstowe, England, surface grass. Opponent Karen Nugent. Doesn't fit due to the surface being grass and the wrong location.\n\nRow 3: outcome runner-up, date 6 February 2000, location Wellington, New Zealand, surface hard. Opponent Mirielle Dittmann. This seems relevant because it matches all key components except for the outcome; however, the claim is about her being an opponent, not necessarily whether she won or lost. So this row could be relevant.\n\nRow 4: runner-up, date 28 May 2000, location El Paso, Texas, USA, surface hard. Opponent Erin Burdette. Doesn't match the date or location.\n\nRow 5: runner-up, date 14 September 2003, location Spoleto, Italy, surface clay. No match.\n\nRow 6: winner, date 6 February 2005, Wellington, NZ, hard. Opponent Mirielle Dittmann again. So this is another relevant row because it confirms she was the opponent on the same surface and location but a different date.\n\nRow 7: winner, 28 August 2005, Jesi, Italy, hard. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: winner, 5 Feb 2006, Taupo, NZ, hard. Opponent Natsumi Hamamura. Doesn't match the date or opponent.\n\nRow 9: winner, 12 Feb 2006, Wellington, NZ, hard. Opponent Katerina Kramperov\u00e1. Different opponent and close date but not matching.\n\nRow 10: winner, 20 April 2008, Mazatl\u00e1n, Mexico, hard. Not relevant.\n\nSo, from the analysis, Rows 3 and 6 are relevant because they both mention Mirielle Dittmann as the opponent in the final on a hard surface in Wellington, New Zealand. However, the claim specifies a date of 6 February 2000, which matches Row 3 but not Row 6 (which is 6 Feb 2005). Therefore, there's at least one matching row (Row 3) that supports the claim.\n\nWait, but I need to check if Row 3 is about her being an opponent. Yes, outcome is runner-up, so she was the opponent. The date matches 6 Feb 2000 in Wellington on hard surface.\n\nSo, there's at least one matching row, which means the claim is supported as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about a tennis final is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the opponent in final on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand on hard surface be katerina kramperov\u00e1.\" \n\nI'll start by identifying each part of this claim to map it onto the table's columns. The key components are:\n\n1. **Opponent in Final**: This is the column where we're looking for information.\n2. **Date**: 6 February 2000\n3. **Location**: Wellington, New Zealand\n4. **Surface**: Hard\n\nSo, I need to look for a row that matches all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: Date is May 2, 1999. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 2**: Date is July 11, 1999. Nope.\n- **Row 3**: Date is February 6, 2000. This matches the date part.\n  \nNow, check the location: Wellington, New Zealand. Yes, that's correct for Row 3.\n\nNext, surface: hard. The table says \"hard\" for this row. That checks out too.\n\nSo, the only thing left is to look at the opponent in final for this specific row. According to Row 3, the opponent was Mirielle Dittmann. But the claim says it should be Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. So even though all other details match (date, location, surface), the opponent doesn't align with what's stated in the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's another row with the same date, location, and surface? Let me scan through:\n\n- **Row 3**: The only row matching February 6, 2000. So no, it's unique in that aspect.\n\nTherefore, since the opponent listed in the table doesn't match Katerina Kramperov\u00e1, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that the opponent was Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 on a specific date and location. However, upon checking the table, the opponent for that exact row is Mirielle Dittmann.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on this table. The claim says, \"the surface be grass on 2 may 1999.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Surface\" refers to the type of court surface, which can be grass, hard, clay, etc. \"On 2 May 1999\" is a specific date and location. So, the claim is asserting that on that particular date in 1999, the surface was grass.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an event with details like outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. My task is to check if there's any row that matches the conditions stated in the claim.\n\nSo, I'll start by identifying which rows are relevant. The key elements from the claim are:\n- Date: 2 May 1999\n- Surface: grass\n\nNow, I'll go through each row and see if it matches these criteria.\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner, date is 2 May 1999, location is Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. The surface here is hard. So, the surface doesn't match grass, so this isn't relevant.\n\nRows 2-10 cover dates from July 1999 onwards, except Row 6 which is February 2005 and others after that. None of these rows have a date in May 1999, except for Row 1. Since Row 1's surface is hard, not grass, there's no match.\n\nWait, let me double-check the dates. The claim specifies May 2, 1999. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is 2 May 1999.\nRow 2: 11 July 1999\nRow 3: 6 February 2000\n...\nSo only Row 1 has a date in May 1999.\n\nTherefore, the relevant row is Row 1. Now, checking the surface of this row: it's hard. The claim says grass, so this doesn't match. So there's no data point that supports the claim.\n\nWait another thought\u2014could there be multiple rows with the same date? No, each row seems to have unique dates based on the given info.\n\nSo, since only Row 1 has the date in question and its surface is hard, not grass, the claim isn't supported by any relevant data. Therefore, the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
