    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"On average, there be 2709 crowd attendance when the home team be vida.\" The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Average**: We need to find out if 2709 is the average attendance.\n2. **Home team**: It specifies a particular home team, which is \"vida.\"\n3. **Crowd attendance**: This refers to the number of people attending a match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match on August 9, 2008. The columns are date, home, score, away, and attendance. Since all matches are on the same date, I don't need to worry about different dates.\n\nI'll focus on rows where the home team is \"vida.\" Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: home is \"deportes savio\"\n- Row 2: home is \"olimpia\"\n- Row 3: home is \"vida\" \u2705\n- Row 4: home is \"real espana\"\n- Row 5: home is \"real juventud\"\n\nOnly Row 3 matches the home team \"vida.\" So, I need to look at that row's attendance. The attendance for Row 3 is 2709.\n\nNow, the claim mentions an average of 2709 attendees when the home team is \"vida.\" Since there's only one match where \"vida\" is the home team, and the attendance for that match is exactly 2709, it suggests that the average is indeed 2709 because there are no other data points to average. If another match existed with a different attendance, we would need more information, but in this case, it's just one.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because the single available attendance figure matches the stated average when the home team is \"vida.\"\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for the home team being \"vida,\" found only Row 3 with an attendance of 2709. Since there's only one match, the average is exactly this number.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"vida be the home team during the match with 2709 in attendance.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The home team should be \"vida,\" and there was a match with an attendance of 2709.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has the following columns: date, home, score, away, attendance. So, for each row, I can check if 'home' is vida and if attendance matches 2709.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1:\n- Home: deportes savio (not vida)\n- Attendance: 440 (doesn't match 2709)\n\nRow 2:\n- Home: olimpia (not vida)\n- Attendance: 1487 (nope)\n\nRow 3:\n- Home: vida\n- Attendance: 2709\nThis row matches both conditions.\n\nRow 4 and Row 5 don't have home as vida, so they're out of the question.\n\nSo, only Row 3 has 'vida' as home and attendance 2709. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"during the match with a score of 1:1 , the attendance be 2709\". So, the claim has two main points:\n\n1. The score was 1:1.\n2. The attendance at that match was 2709.\n\nNow, I'll look into the table to verify these points.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- Each row represents a different match on the same date (9 August 2008).\n- Columns include 'date', 'home', 'score', 'away', and 'attendance'.\n\nI need to find which rows have a score of 1:1 and what their attendance was.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 1:\n- Score is 2:1. Doesn't match 1:1, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Score is 0:1. Again, doesn't match 1:1.\n\nRow 3:\n- Score is 1:1. This matches the score in the claim.\n- Attendance is 2709. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nRow 4 and Row 5 have scores of 4:0 and 2:0 respectively, so they don't match either.\n\nTherefore, only Row 3 has both a score of 1:1 and an attendance of 2709 that supports the claim.\n\nI should list the relevant cells. Since there's only one row matching the criteria, I'll include its index (which is 2, since rows are zero-indexed) and the column for attendance, which is 'attendance'.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table and the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"vida be the away team during the match where there be 2709 in attendance.\" \n\nI should start by understanding each part of this claim. The key elements are:\n1. \"vida\" is the away team.\n2. There was a match with an attendance of 2709.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a match on August 9, 2008. Each row includes the date (same for all), home team, score, away team, and attendance.\n\nI need to check if \"vida\" is listed as the away team in any row where the attendance is exactly 2709.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home: Deportes Savio, Score: 2-1, Away: Hispano, Attendance: 440. Here, attendance is 440, which isn't 2709, and away team is Hispano, not Vida.\n\nRow 2: Home: Olimpia, Score: 0-1, Away: Marathon, Attendance: 1487. Again, attendance is not 2709, and away team is Marathon.\n\nRow 3: Home: Vida, Score: 1-1, Away: Motagua, Attendance: 2709. Here, the home team is Vida, which means the away team would be Motagua. So, Vida isn't the away team here; it's the home team.\n\nRow 4: Home: Real Espa\u00f1a, Score: 4-0, Away: Platense, Attendance: 2168. Attendance is lower than 2709, and away team is Platense.\n\nRow 5: Home: Real Juventud, Score: 2-0, Away: Victoria, Attendance: 1223. Attendance is not 2709, and away team is Victoria.\n\nSo, in none of the rows where attendance is 2709 (only row 3) is \"vida\" listed as the away team. Instead, in that same match, Vida is the home team. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Vida isn't the away team when the attendance was 2709; it's the opposite. There isn't a match where Vida is the away team with an attendance of 2709 on that date.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if \"vida\" is the away team in any row with an attendance of 2709.\n\n- **Row 3**: Home: Vida, Away: Motagua, Attendance: 2709. Here, Vida is the home team, not the away team.\n  \nSince there's no match where Vida is the away team with 2709 attendees, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a match on August 9, 2008. Each row includes the home team, score, away team, and attendance. The claim is that \"during the match with a score of 1.1 , the attendance be 2000.\" Wait, the score in the table isn't shown as 1.1. It's written as things like \"2:1\", \"0:1\", etc. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nFirst, I should check if any row has a score of 1:1 because the claim mentions 1.1, but it's possible that in some formats, 1:1 is interpreted as 1.1. Let me look at each row:\n\nRow 1: Score 2:1\nRow 2: Score 0:1\nRow 3: Score 1:1\nRow 4: Score 4:0\nRow 5: Score 2:0\n\nSo, Row 3 has a score of 1:1. That's the only one close to 1.1 if we consider it as goals for and against without the colon. The attendance for that row is 2709.\n\nNow, the claim says when the score is 1.1, the attendance is 2000. Looking at Row 3, the attendance is 2709, not 2000. So even if the score can be interpreted as 1:1 or 1.1, the attendance doesn't match.\n\nI should also check if any other rows have a score that might fit, but none do except Row 3. So since the attendance in that row is higher than 2000, the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nThe table has a match with a score of 1:1 (Row 3), but its attendance is 2709, not 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the average attendance for matches where the home team be vida be 2609.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is asking. It's about the average attendance when the home team is vida. So, I need to look at all the matches where the home team is vida and then calculate their attendances.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, home team, score, away team, and attendance. So, I should check which rows have \"vida\" as the home team.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 1: home is deportes savio\n- Row 2: home is olimpia\n- Row 3: home is vida\n- Row 4: home is real espana\n- Row 5: home is real juventud\n\nSo, only Row 3 has \"vida\" as the home team. The attendance for that match is 2709.\n\nThe claim states that this average is 2609. But wait, the attendance for vida's match is 2709, not 2609. Since there's only one match for vida, the average would be exactly 2709. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it says 2609 instead of 2709.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The home team is in column \"home,\" so I look at that column for each row. Only Row 3 has \"vida\" in the home column. So, the relevant cell is Row 3 and the \"attendance\" column because we need to check the actual attendance figure.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states the average attendance for matches where the home team is vida is 2609. However, the table shows that the attendance for the match with vida as the home team is 2709. This discrepancy means the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Find all rows where \"home\" is \"vida.\" Only Row 3 fits this criterion.\n2. **Extract Attendance Data**: From Row 3, extract the attendance value which is 2709.\n3. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states the average is 2609, but it's actually 2709.\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the provided data does not support the claim, it must be false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
