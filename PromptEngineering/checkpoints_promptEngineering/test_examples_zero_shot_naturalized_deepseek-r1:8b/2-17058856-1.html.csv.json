    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells that support my decision.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the score be 0 - 2 met when vladimir malenkikh make a goal at 18:27.\"\n\nI should break down each part of this claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim mentions two specific things:\n1. The score is 0 - 2 in favor of the 'met' team.\n2. Vladimir Malenkhikh scored a goal at time 18:27.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the table provided and see if these conditions are met in any row. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Period is 1st, Team is met, Goal by Denis Platonov at 1:28, Score is 0 - 1 met.\n- **Row 2**: Period is 1st, Team is met, Goal by Vladimir Malenkhikh (with a pp) at 18:27, Score is 0 - 2 met.\n- **Row 3**: Period is 2nd, Team is met, Goal by Nikolai Zavarukhin, Score is 0 - 3 met.\n- The rest of the rows pertain to the 'nyr' team.\n\nSo, in Row 2, we have Vladimir Malenkhikh scoring a goal at 18:27. At this point, the score for 'met' team is indeed 0 - 2. Therefore, the claim's conditions are met here.\n\nI should check other rows to ensure that no other occurrence of Vladimir Malenkhikh or the same score happens later, but from the table, it seems Row 2 is the only instance where he scores at that time with that exact score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 2's data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are in Row 2, specifically the columns for period, team, goal, and score. These cells directly support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"period\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about a table is true or false. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"at 18:27 , meet score and the score be 0 - 2 for met.\" \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: period, team, goal details, time, and score. The relevant part of the claim is checking two things at 18:27\u2014whether it's \"meet\" with a score of 0-2.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row to see which one has the time 18:27. Scanning the table:\n\nRow 1: period 1st, team met, goal by Denis Platonov, time 1:28.\nRow 2: period 1st, team met, goal by Vladimir Malenkikh (PP), time 18:27.\nRow 3: period 2nd, team met, etc., time 30:20.\nRow 4 onwards don't have 18:27.\n\nSo Row 2 is the one with the time 18:27. Now, I need to check if at that row, the team is \"met\" and the score is 0-2.\n\nLooking at Row 2's details: team is indeed met, goal by Vladimir Malenkikh (PP), and the score is 0 - 2 met. \n\nWait, the claim says \"meet score and the score be 0 - 2 for met.\" So it's about two things: whether the team is met and their score is 0-2.\n\nIn Row 2, team is met and score is 0-2 met. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, the claim checks out. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are Row 2's period and time columns.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for a row with time \"18:27\", team \"met\", and score \"0 - 2\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made about Chris Drury is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Chris Drury scored his first goal of the game in a power play at 39:37.\" So, I'm looking for specific information in the table that matches this statement.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: period, team, goal, time, and score. The rows are numbered from 0 to 6 (since there are 7 rows). I'll need to scan through each row carefully.\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's in the 1st period, scored by Denis Plattonov. Doesn't relate to Chris Drury, so I can skip this.\n\nRow 2: Also in the 1st period, but Vladimir Malenkikh scores. Not Chris Drury, so move on.\n\nRow 3: Nikolai Zavarukhin scores in the 2nd period. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 4: This is where Chris Drury comes into play. It says \"goal: chris drury (1) ( pp ), time: 39:37.\" So, the goal is his first, it's a power play, and the time is 39:37. That matches the claim exactly except for one thing\u2014the claim mentions that this was his first goal of the game. But in Row 4, the score at that point is \"1 - 3 nyr,\" which suggests that Chris Drury scored the first goal for the Nyr team. So, depending on how we interpret \"his first goal,\" it could be true because he scored his first goal in this period.\n\nRow 5 and Row 6: These also mention Chris Drury scoring again, but as goals number 2 and 3 respectively. Since the claim is about his first goal, these are not relevant for verifying the initial statement.\n\nSo, the relevant row here is Row 4 because it's the first time Chris Drury scores, which aligns with the claim. Additionally, the power play notation (pp) confirms that it's a power play, matching another part of the claim.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows where Chris Drury might have scored earlier. But looking through all seven rows, only Row 4 is his first goal in the game. Therefore, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the score at 18:27 be 0 - 2 met because of chris drury's goal.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It mentions a specific time (18:27), a score (0-2 in favor of 'met'), and attributes this score to Chris Drury's goal, noting it's a power play (pp). So, I need to check if at 18:27, the score was indeed 0-2 with Chris Drury scoring a goal on the power play for team 'met'.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: period 1st, team met, goal by Denis Plattonov (1), time 1:28, score 0 - 1 met.\nRow 2: period 1st, team met, goal by Vladimir Malenkikh (1) (pp), time 18:27, score 0 - 2 met.\nRow 3: period 2nd, team met, goal by Nikolai Zavarukhin (1), time 30:20, score 0 - 3 met.\nRow 4: period 2nd, team nyr, goal by Chris Drury (1) (pp), time 39:37, score 1 - 3 nyr.\nRow 5: period 3rd, team nyr, goal by Dan Fritsche (1), time 45:45, score 2 - 3 nyr.\nRow 6: period 3rd, team nyr, goal by Chris Drury (2) (pp), time 50:13, score 3 - 3 nyr.\nRow 7: period 3rd, team nyr, goal by Ryan Callahan (1), time 59:40, score 4 - 3 nyr.\n\nSo, let's look for the time 18:27. From Row 2, at 18:27, team met scored a goal, making their score 0-2. The goal is attributed to Vladimir Malenkikh (1), not Chris Drury.\n\nWait, but the claim says Chris Drury's goal caused the score to be 0-2 at 18:27. However, according to Row 2, it was Vladimir Malenkikh who scored that goal on a power play. So, the goal wasn't made by Chris Drury; it was someone else.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the goal at 18:27 was not by Chris Drury but by Vladimir Malenkikh.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes the goal at 18:27 to Chris Drury when it was actually scored by Vladimir Malenkikh. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Chris Drury scoring a goal is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"Chris Drury (1) (pp) score a goal at 39:37 on te 1st period.\" I need to parse each part of this claim against the table.\n\nThe table has multiple rows with details about goals. Each row includes information like period, team, player who scored, time, and the score after that goal.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the claim:\n\n1. **Player**: Chris Drury\n2. **Goal Number**: (1) (pp) - which likely means it's a power play goal, his first of the season.\n3. **Time**: 39:37\n4. **Period**: 1st period\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\n- **Row 1**: Period is 1st, team is met. The goal is by Denis Plattonov at 1:28. Doesn't match Chris Drury.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Period is 1st, team is met. Goal by Vladimir Malenkikh (with pp) at 18:27. Not Chris Drury.\n\n- **Row 3**: Period is 2nd, so not matching the claim's period of 1st. Move on.\n\n- **Row 4**: Period is 2nd, again doesn't match. Goal by Chris Drury, but this is in the 2nd period. Also, his goal number here is (1) (pp), time 39:37. Wait, this seems to fit some criteria, but the period is wrong.\n\n- **Row 5**: Period is 3rd, not matching.\n\n- **Row 6**: Period is 3rd, so no.\n\n- **Row 7**: Period is 3rd, also no.\n\nSo, from the table, Chris Drury scored a goal at 39:37 in the 2nd period (Row 4) with goal number (1)(pp). The claim says it's in the 1st period. Therefore, the period doesn't match. \n\nAdditionally, I need to check if there's any other instance where Chris Drury scored in the first period at that time. From the table, the only time Chris Drury is mentioned is in Rows 4 and 6, both in later periods.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems incorrect because the goal was actually in the 2nd period, not the 1st.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chris Drury scored a goal at 39:37 in the 1st period. However, upon reviewing the table, the goal by Chris Drury at 39:37 is recorded in the 2nd period (Row 4), not the 1st. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where Chris Drury scored a goal with the time 39:37.\n2. **Check Period Details**: Confirm if the goal was in the 1st period as stated.\n3. **Determine Mismatch**: The actual goal by Chris Drury at 39:37 is in the 2nd period, not the 1st.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is FALSE because the goal occurred in the 2nd period, not the 1st.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"vladimir malenkikh (1) ( pp ), with a score of 3 - 3 met , have a time of 17:38\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim refers to. The goal scorer is Vladimir Malenkin, with an assist (pp), which probably means power play. The score mentioned is 3-3 for Met team. The time given is 17:38.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table provided to find any relevant rows that match these details.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Period 1st, Team: met, Goal by Denis Platonov (1), Time 1:28, Score 0-1 Met.\nNo, this doesn't fit because it's not Vladimir Malenkin and the score here is 0-1.\n\nRow 2: Period 1st, Team: met, Goal by Vladimir Malenkikh (1) (pp), Time 18:27, Score 0-2 Met.\nThis seems relevant. The goal scorer is Vladimir Malenkikh with a pp, time 18:27, score 0-2 Met.\n\nRow 3: Period 2nd, Team: met, Goal by Nikolai Zavarukhin (1), Time 30:20, Score 0-3 Met.\nNo match here.\n\nRow 4: Period 2nd, Team: nyr, Goal by Chris Drury (1) (pp), Time 39:37, Score 1-3 Nyr.\nNot relevant as it's the opponent team and different goal scorer.\n\nRow 5: Period 3rd, Team: nyr, Goal by Dan Fritsche (1), Time 45:45, Score 2-3 Nyr.\nNo match.\n\nRow 6: Period 3rd, Team: nyr, Goal by Chris Drury (2) (pp), Time 50:13, Score 3-3 Nyr.\nDifferent goal scorer and team.\n\nRow 7: Period 3rd, Team: nyr, Goal by Ryan Callahan (1), Time 59:40, Score 4-3 Nyr.\nAgain, opponent team.\n\nSo the only relevant row is Row 2. Now, let's check each part of the claim against this row.\n\nThe goal scorer is Vladimir Malenkikh (1) with pp, which matches Row 2's description. The score mentioned in the claim is 3-3 met. Looking at Row 2, the score is 0-2 Met. This doesn't match the claim's 3-3 score. Additionally, the time in Row 2 is 18:27, not 17:38 as stated.\n\nTherefore, the claim has inaccuracies regarding both the score and the time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the score and time for Vladimir Malenkikh's goal. The relevant row shows a different score and time.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the goal by chris drury (1) ( pp ) be in the 3rd period, for the time of 52:18.\"\n\nFirst, I need to locate all relevant cells in the table that pertain to Chris Drury's goals. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1 mentions a goal by Denis Platoonov in the 1st period. That doesn't relate to Chris Drury, so I can ignore this row.\n\nRow 2 is about Vladimir Malenkhikh. Again, not Chris Drury, so irrelevant for this claim.\n\nMoving on to Row 3: it's Nikolai Zavarukhin who scored in the 2nd period. Not relevant either.\n\nNow, Row 4 talks about Chris Drury. The goal here is in the 2nd period with a score of 1-3 for Nyr. This mentions Chris Drury scoring his first goal (1) on a power play at 39:37. But the claim refers to the 3rd period and a later time, so this might be a different goal by Drury but not the one in question.\n\nRow 5 is Dan Fritsche's goal in the 3rd period, which isn't Chris Drury, so I can skip it.\n\nRow 6 mentions Chris Drury again. This goal is his second (2) on a power play at time 50:13 in the 3rd period. The time here is 50:13, which is before 52:18, so this isn't the goal the claim refers to.\n\nFinally, Row 7: Ryan Callahan scores, not Chris Drury, so that's irrelevant.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check the rows. The claim says Chris Drury (1) with pp at 52:18 in period 3. Looking back, Row 4 is period 2, so the only other Drury goal mentioned is in row 6 at 50:13, which is still before 52:18.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I missed a row. Let me check again. Rows are numbered from 1 to 7. The relevant rows for Chris Drury goals are row 4 and row 6. Both of these are in periods 2 and 3 respectively, but the times don't match 52:18.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row has period, team, goal details, time, and score. So, for Chris Drury's goals, they are in row 4 (period 2) and row 6 (period 3). The time for his second goal is 50:13. There's no mention of a goal at 52:18.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the goal by Chris Drury (1) on pp occurred at 52:18 in period 3 isn't supported by the table. It seems there was a goal by him at 50:13 but not at 52:18. So, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
