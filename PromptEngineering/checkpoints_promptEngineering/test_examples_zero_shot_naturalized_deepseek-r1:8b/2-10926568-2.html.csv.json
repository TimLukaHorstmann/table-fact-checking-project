    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim says that the episode aired on March 31, 2008, and its title is \"New York: Secret Societies.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the episodes that were aired around March 31, 2008. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has production numbers from 15 to 27. The original airdate for Row 9 is March 31, 2008. That's the only row with that date, so that's the relevant row. \n\nNow, check the episode title for Row 9. It says \"new york : secret societies.\" Wait, the claim has it as \"New York: Secret Societies.\" Hmm, but in the table, the title is written as \"new york...\" all lowercase. So there might be a difference in capitalization.\n\nI should also check if any other rows could match the date or title. Let's see:\n\n- March 31, 2008 is only Row 9.\n- The title \"new york : secret societies\" matches exactly what the claim says except for the capitalization. But the claim uses capital letters for each word in the title.\n\nSo, does the case matter here? In titles, sometimes it's about style, but usually, the exact wording matters for a claim to be true. Since Row 9 has \"new york : secret societies\" in lowercase, it doesn't exactly match the claim's title which starts with a capital 'N' and has each word capitalized.\n\nWait, no, actually looking again: The claim's title is \"New York: Secret Societies.\" So, in the table, it's written as \"new york...\" with all lowercase. So that might not match because of the capitalization difference.\n\nBut sometimes, titles are standardized or the case doesn't matter for matching. I'm a bit unsure here. However, since the claim specifies \"New York: Secret Societies,\" and the table has it in lowercase, they don't exactly match. Therefore, the title doesn't fully support the claim because of the capitalization difference.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's just a formatting issue, and the actual title is considered as \"new york : secret societies.\" So if the case isn't important, then it would still match. I'm not entirely sure about this part.\n\nIn any case, the main thing is that Row 9 matches the date and production number. The title has the correct name but in lowercase, which might affect whether the claim is considered true or false based on exact string matching.\n\nSince the claim specifies the exact title with capitalization, I think it's safer to say that the claim is false because the episode title in the table doesn't exactly match the one stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the episode aired on March 31, 2008, and has the title \"New York: Secret Societies.\" \n\n- **Date Check:** Only Row 9 (production no:23) matches the date March 31, 2008. \n- **Title Check:** The table lists the title as \"new york : secret societies,\" which differs from the claim's \"New York: Secret Societies\" in capitalization.\n\nSince the titles don't exactly match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"the title of the episode that aired on January 28, 2008 was 'Vietnam' hosted by Don Wildman.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the original airdate is January 28, 2008. Scanning through the table, Row 1 has the production no:15 and the original airdate as January 28, 2008. So that's our starting point.\n\nNext, I need to check what the episode title was for that specific row. Looking at Row 1, the episode title is \"underground apocalypse.\" Hmm, that's not \"Vietnam,\" so that doesn't match the claim.\n\nNow, let me double-check if there's another row with January 28, 2008. No, only Row 1 matches that date. So since the episode title in Row 1 isn't \"Vietnam,\" the claim is false.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I'm not missing anything else, like maybe the host? But the claim mentions the host as Don Wildman, which all rows have, so that part checks out. The key discrepancy is the episode title.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4 , 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, the claim has three main parts: the episode number (202), the date (February 4, 2008), and the context that the episode \"aired\" on that date. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table for episode number 202 that originally aired on February 4, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different episode with details like production number, episode number, original airdate, title, and host. The claim specifically mentions episode number 202, so I should focus on rows where the episode number is 202. \n\nScanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Episode no: 201\n- Row 2: Episode no: 202\n- Row 3: Episode no: 203\n- ...and so on up to Row 13.\n\nSo, row 2 has episode number 202. Now, I need to check what the original airdate for that episode is. According to the table, row 2's original airdate is February 4, 2008. That matches exactly with the date in the claim.\n\nTherefore, both the episode number (202) and the airdate (February 4, 2008) are correctly aligned in the table. There\u2019s no discrepancy here. \n\nWait, but I should also make sure that the other details don't matter. The host is Don Wildman for all episodes, so that's consistent. The titles vary, but since the claim doesn\u2019t mention the title, it's not relevant here.\n\nSo putting this together, the claim states that episode 202 aired on February 4, 2008. Checking the table confirms both parts are correct. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because episode number 202 did air on February 4, 2008, as verified by row 2 of the table.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"episode number\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim is: \"episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions \"episode number 213\" and the original airdate as January 28, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific episode with details like production number, episode number, air date, title, and host. My goal is to find if there's an episode with both the correct episode number (213) and the specified airdate (January 28, 2008).\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Episode 201 on Jan 28, 2008.\n- Row 2: Episode 202 on Feb 4, 2008.\n- Row 3: Episode 203 on Feb 11, 2008.\n- Row 4: Episode 204 on Feb 25, 2008.\n- Row 5: Episode 205 on March 3, 2008.\n- Row 6: Episode 206 on March 10, 2008.\n- Row 7: Episode 207 on March 17, 2008.\n- Row 8: Episode 208 on March 24, 2008.\n- Row 9: Episode 209 on March 31, 2008.\n- Row 10: Episode 210 on April 14, 2008.\n- Row 11: Episode 211 on April 21, 2008.\n- Row 12: Episode 212 on April 28, 2008.\n- Row 13: Episode 213 on May 5, 2008.\n\nFrom this, I see that there is no episode with the number 213 airing on January 28, 2008. Instead, episode 201 is the one from that date. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008\", we check each row for both the episode number and airdate.\n\n- **Row 1**: Episode 201 on Jan 28, 2008.\n- No other rows match both episode 213 and Jan 28, 2008.\n\nNo matching episode found, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode number\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
