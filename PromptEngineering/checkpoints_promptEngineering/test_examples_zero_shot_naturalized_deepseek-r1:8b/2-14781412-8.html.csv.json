    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games have been located in a different city every year that it occurs.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is asserting. It's about the location of the equestrian events each year they've taken place. So, for every year listed in the table, the location should be different from all the previous years.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a different year from 1982 to 2010. Each row has the year, location, gold medalist, silver, and bronze winners. My task is to check if the locations are indeed changing every year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: 1982, New Delhi. That's the first year, so there's no previous years to compare yet.\n\nRow 2: 1986, Seoul. Different from New Delhi, so that's good.\n\nRow 3: 1994, Hiroshima. Different from both 1982 and 1986, so that's another change.\n\nRow 4: 1998, Bangkok. Different from all previous locations, so yes, it's a new city.\n\nRow 5: 2002, Busan. Again, different from all prior years\u2014new location.\n\nRow 6: 2006, Doha. This is different from all the earlier ones as well.\n\nRow 7: 2010, Guangzhou. This is also a new location compared to all previous years.\n\nSo each year's location is unique and hasn't repeated in any other row. That means every time the Asian Games have occurred, they've been held in a different city each year.\n\nNow, I need to check which cells are relevant for this verification. The relevant information is in the 'location' column of each row because that's what the claim is about. So, I should list all these locations as the relevant cells.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are all the 'location' entries from row 0 to row 6.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about the equestrian events at the Asian Games happening every four years from 1982 to 2010, except in 1990, is true based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table to see if there are any equestrian events listed. The columns we care about for this check are 'gold', 'silver', and 'bronze' because these represent medalists in specific sports. So, if a row has entries in these three columns, it means that an event took place in that year.\n\nNow, I'll go through each year from 1982 to 2010:\n\n1. **1982**: The row shows gold, silver, and bronze winners. So, there was an equestrian event here.\n2. **1986**: Similarly, all three medal positions are filled, so the event happened in this year.\n3. **1994**: The row has gold, silver, and bronze medals awarded. Thus, the event occurred.\n4. **1998**: Entries for all three medals indicate the event took place.\n5. **2002**: All three columns have data, so equestrian events were held here as well.\n6. **2006**: Gold, silver, and bronze winners are listed, meaning the event happened in 2006.\n7. **2010**: The row includes all three medal positions, confirming the event occurred.\n\nNow, checking if the events skipped any year between 1982 to 2010: Looking at the years where events took place\u20141982, 86, 94, 98, 02, 06, 10. There's a four-year gap each time except for 1990 not being listed in the table as an event year. Since none of the rows between 1986 and 1994 have equestrian events (as there are no medalists listed), it suggests that 1990 was skipped.\n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate because all equestrian events from 1982 to 2010 were held every four years except in 1990. So, the relevant cells are those rows where the event occurred.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Nadia Al-Moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a match for Nadia Al-Moutawaa in the gold position.\n\nRow 1 (1982) has Nadia as the gold winner. So she won in 1982. The claim mentions her being the first. I need to check if she was indeed the first in equestrian at Asian Games.\n\nSince this is the earliest row with her name, and assuming there are no earlier rows listed, it seems she was the first. However, I should confirm if there were previous years before 1982 in the table. The table starts from 1982 onwards, so yes, she's the first in that dataset.\n\nNext, I need to find the relevant cells. In Row 1 (year: 1982), columns are gold, silver, bronze. So the gold cell is where Nadia Al-Moutawaa won.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are row 0 (since it's the first row) and column \"gold\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, I checked each row for Nadia Al-Moutawaa winning gold in equestrian.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then list the relevant cells. The claim states: \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time, in Seoul and Doha (and Incheon, but that be only found elsewhere on the source page).\"\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim. It's saying that South Korea is the only country that has hosted the equestrian event at the Asian Games more than once, specifically mentioning Seoul and Doha, with Incheon being mentioned as another location but noting it's only found elsewhere.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\n- Each row represents a year, location, gold, silver, and bronze medalists.\n- The locations listed are New Delhi (1982), Seoul (1986), Hiroshima (1994), Bangkok (1998), Busan (2002), Doha (2006), and Guangzhou (2010).\n\nThe claim mentions South Korea hosting in Seoul and possibly Incheon. However, looking at the table, Seoul is indeed one of the locations listed for 1986. The next step is to check if any other countries have hosted more than once.\n\nFrom the table:\n- New Delhi: 1982\n- Seoul: 1986\n- Hiroshima: 1994\n- Bangkok: 1998\n- Busan: 2002\n- Doha: 2006\n- Guangzhou: 2010\n\nI notice that Seoul is the only location listed more than once if considering future hosts, but in the given table, each location is unique except for Seoul. However, the claim refers to South Korea hosting more than once. Wait, no, each row represents a different year and location, so each country probably hosted once per row unless the same country is listed again.\n\nWait, actually, the claim seems to be about South Korea hosting equestrian events multiple times. So I need to check if any other country besides South Korea has hosted the event more than once in the table.\n\nLooking at the locations:\n- Seoul: 1986\n- Doha: 2006\n\nAre there any others? From the given data, each location is unique except Seoul and Doha, but the claim says \"more than 1 time.\" So if South Korea hosted twice (Seoul and possibly Incheon), but in the table, only Seoul is listed.\n\nWait, the table's Row 6: 2006, Doha. So South Korea hosted in Seoul (1986) and then again in Doha (2006). That would be two times. However, the claim says \"more than 1 time,\" so that would make it TRUE if South Korea is the only one with more than once.\n\nWait, but I need to check if any other country has hosted more than once. Looking at other locations:\n\n- New Delhi: Only 1982\n- Hiroshima: 1994\n- Bangkok: 1998\n- Busan: 2002\n- Guangzhou: 2010\n\nThese are all unique, so no other countries have hosted more than once in the table.\n\nTherefore, South Korea is the only country that has hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once (Seoul and Doha). So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNext, identify the relevant cells. The locations mentioned are Seoul (Row 2) and Doha (Row 6), which are the years 1986 and 2006 respectively.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be row indices 2 and 6, corresponding to their column \"location.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because South Korea is indeed the only country that has hosted the equestrian event at the Asian Games more than once (in Seoul and Doha).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"equestrian at the Asian Game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that equestrian events at the Asian Games occur every four years starting in 1982 and ending in 2010. So the key points here are: equestrian events, every 4 years, from 1982 to 2010.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a specific year when certain medals were awarded. The columns include \"year,\" \"location,\" \"gold,\" \"silver,\" and \"bronze.\" So for each year listed (1982, 1986, 1994, etc.), there's an associated location and medalists.\n\nI need to check if the equestrian events (specifically, gold, silver, bronze medals) occurred in each of those years: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. Wait, actually, from 1982 every four years would be 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, etc., but I need to see up to when? The claim says \"from 1982 to 2010.\" So the relevant years in the table are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. Wait, 2006 is within 2010, so that's okay.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 1982, location: New Delhi. The medals awarded here are gold to Nadia Al-Moutawaa, silver to Jamila Al-Moutawaa, and bronze to Bariaa Salem Al-Sabbah. So equestrian events happened in 1982.\n\nRow 2: 1986, Seoul. Gold to Takashi Tomura, silver to Shuichi Toki, bronze to Ryuzo Okuno. So equestrian events also occurred in 1986.\n\nRow 3: 1994, Hiroshima. Gold to Konoshin Kuwahara, silver to Ryuzo Okuno, bronze to Natya Chantrasmi. Equestrian events took place here as well.\n\nRow 4: 1998, Bangkok. Gold to Jin Kanno, silver to Sohn Bong Gak, bronze to Quzier Ambak Fathil. So yes, equestrian was there in 1998.\n\nRow 5: 2002, Busan. Gold to Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski, silver to Lee Jin-Kyung, bronze to Tadayoshi Hayashi. Equestrian events happened again in 2002.\n\nRow 6: 2006, Doha. Gold to Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi, silver to Jasmine Chen-Shao Man, bronze to Joo Jung-Hyun. So equestrian was there in 2006.\n\nNow, what about 2010? The table doesn't have a row for 2010. The last row is 2010, but let's check: Row 7 is year 2010, location Guangzhou. Gold to Ramzy Al Duhami, silver to Latifa Al Maktom, bronze to Khaled Al-Eid. So equestrian events occurred in 2010 as well.\n\nWait, so from 1982 every four years would be 1982, 86, 90,94,98,02,06,10. But the table has rows up to 2010, but in the claim it's said \"from 1982 to 2010.\" So the relevant years are 1982,86,94,98,02,06,10.\n\nLooking at each of these, from the table, equestrian events (as per medals) occurred in each of those years. So that would support the claim that it happened every four years from 1982 to 2010.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if the medalists are all for equestrian events. The columns are labeled \"gold,\" \"silver,\" \"bronze.\" I'm assuming these correspond to equestrian medals because the claim is about equestrian at the Asian Games. So yes, each of those years in the table has gold, silver, bronze medalists, which implies that equestrian events took place.\n\nSo all relevant years from 1982 up to and including 2010 have equestrian events as per the medals listed. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row corresponds to a year, so for each of the relevant years (1982,86,94,98,02,06,10), we need to check if their rows have the necessary information. Looking at the table:\n\n- 1982: Row 1\n- 1986: Row 2\n- 1994: Row 3\n- 1998: Row 4\n- 2002: Row5\n- 2006: Row6\n- 2010: Row7\n\nSo rows 1 to 7 are the relevant ones, but wait, the claim is from 1982 to 2010. But let's check if all these years have equestrian events. The table includes 1982 (yes), 86 (yes), 94(yes),98(yes),02(yes),06(yes),10(yes). So each of these rows has the necessary data to confirm that equestrian events occurred in those years.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the rows from 0 to 6 (assuming row indices start at 0). Wait, let me check: Row 1 is 1982, so row index 0. So rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 correspond to 1982-2010 every four years.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"from 1982 to 2010,\" which is a span of 28 years (2010 - 1982 = 28).

Let me read through both carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"Nadia Al-Moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games and win silver another year.\"\n\nFirst, I need to check if Nadia Al-Moutawaa has won gold in equestrian at the Asian Games. Looking through each row of the table:\n\nRow 1: Year 1982, location New Delhi. The gold medalist is Nadia Al-Moutawaa. So that's one win.\n\nThen, the claim also states she won silver another year. So I need to see if there's a year where she got silver in the same event, probably equestrian.\n\nLooking through each row again for Nadia Al-Moutawaa:\n\nRow 1: Gold\nRow 2 onwards: Not mentioned as gold or bronze, and other names are different, so likely she didn't win any other medals. \n\nSo she only won gold once in 1982. She isn't listed as having won silver in any year. Therefore, the claim that she was first to win gold and also won silver another year is not supported by the table.\n\nWait, but I should double-check each row again to make sure I didn't miss her winning any other medals. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Gold for Nadia.\nRows 2-7: No mention of her at all as gold or bronze in other years. So she only has one gold medal, no silvers.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because she didn't win silver another year after winning gold. She only won gold once, and no silver mentioned anywhere else.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"Equestrian at the Asian Games have been located in a different city every year that it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each row of the table and check the location for each year specified in the claim. The years mentioned are 1994 and 1998. But let me go through all the rows to make sure.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: 1982, New Delhi\n- Row 2: 1986, Seoul\n- Row 3: 1994, Hiroshima\n- Row 4: 1998, Bangkok\n- Row 5: 2002, Busan\n- Row 6: 2006, Doha\n- Row 7: 2010, Guangzhou\n\nNow, I need to check the locations for each occurrence of the Asian Games. From the table, each location is different except for 1994 and 1998. Wait, but looking at the claim again, it says \"except 1994 and 1998.\" So according to the claim, those two years had the same city as previous ones.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\n- In 1982 (Row 1), New Delhi was the location.\n- Next in 1986 (Row 2), Seoul. Different from 1982.\n- Then 1994: Hiroshima, which is different from both 1982 and 1986.\n- 1998: Bangkok, same as Row 4's location.\n\nWait, no, in the table, each row has a unique year, so I need to check if the locations change every year except for two instances. Let me list all the locations:\n\n1982 - New Delhi\n\n1986 - Seoul (different from 1982)\n\n1994 - Hiroshima (different from 1982 and 1986)\n\n1998 - Bangkok (different from previous ones, but according to the claim, it's supposed to be same as a prior year? Wait, no, the claim says except 1994 and 1998. So the claim is saying that all other years have different locations each time.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says that every year the Asian Games occur, they've been in a different city each time except for 1994 and 1998. That would mean that in 1994 and 1998, the location was the same as a previous one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n\nThen 1986: Seoul (different)\n\n1994: Hiroshima (is this different from all prior? Yes, because it's a new location.\n\nWait, but if the claim says except for 1994 and 1998, then maybe in those years, the location was same as before. But according to the table:\n\n- 1994 is Hiroshima, which is different from New Delhi and Seoul.\n\n- 1998: Bangkok, also different from all previous locations (1982, 1986, 1994).\n\nSo that would mean the claim is false because in 1994 and 1998, the location was new each time. Therefore, the equestrian events have been in a different city every year except none\u2014because even 1994 and 1998 had new locations.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nThe claim says \"except 1994 and 1998,\" implying that those two years did not change location. But according to the table, both 1994 and 1998 have different locations from prior years. So in fact, all years up to 2010 are different, which means the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe it's saying that every year except those two had a different location. But since in 1994 and 1998, the location was different from previous, then maybe the claim is actually true because all other years have changed, but those two didn't? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as: each year the Asian Games occur, they are held in a different city than the previous year. The only exceptions are 1994 and 1998 where it stayed in the same city as before.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- From 1982 to 1986: different (New Delhi to Seoul)\n\n- 1986 to 1994: different (Seoul to Hiroshima)\n\n- 1994 to 1998: different (Hiroshima to Bangkok)\n\nSo none of these are repeats. Therefore, the claim is false because all years have been in a different city each time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the Asian Games have always moved except for two specific years where they didn't change.\n\nBut based on the table, every location is unique so far. So the claim is saying that except 1994 and 1998, all other years were in different cities. But since 1994 and 1998 are also new, then the only way the claim holds is if there were some prior years where it didn't change.\n\nWait, but I don't have data before 1982, so perhaps the claim refers to the years listed in the table. In that case, from 1982 onwards, each year has a different location except for 1994 and 1998, which are same as previous? But according to the table, 1994 is Hiroshima and 1998 is Bangkok\u2014both new locations.\n\nSo maybe the claim is incorrect because even in 1994 and 1998, the location changed from prior years. Therefore, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check each year listed in the table and see if their locations are different except for 1994 and 1998.\n\n- **1982**: New Delhi\n- **1986**: Seoul (Different from 1982)\n- **1994**: Hiroshima (Different from 1982 and 1986)\n- **1998**: Bangkok (Different from all previous years)\n\nSince both 1994 and 1998 had new locations, the claim that they didn't change is false. Therefore, the equestrian events have been in different cities every year without exception as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding the claim: It states that the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games have been different every year except in 1994 and 1998.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row of the table to see who won the gold medal each year and check if there are any repetitions. The table lists winners from 1982 to 2010.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1 (1982)**: Gold is Nadia Al-Moutawaa.\n2. **Row 2 (1986)**: Gold is Takashi Tomura.\n3. **Row 3 (1994)**: Gold is Konoshin Kuwahara.\n4. **Row 4 (1998)**: Gold is Jin Kanno.\n5. **Row 5 (2002)**: Gold is Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski.\n6. **Row 6 (2006)**: Gold is Ali Yousof Al-Rumaihi.\n7. **Row 7 (2010)**: Gold is Ramzy Al-Duhami.\n\nLooking at the gold medalists, each year seems to have a different winner. Now, checking if any years repeat. The claim mentions that only 1994 and 1998 are exceptions where the gold medalist might be the same or different? Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"have been different in every year they have occurred except 1994 and 1998.\" Hmm, that wording is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's saying that except for 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists are different each year. But looking at the data:\n\n- 1982: Nadia\n- 1986: Takashi\n- 1994: Konoshin\n- 1998: Jin\n- 2002: Mikaela\n- 2006: Ali\n- 2010: Ramzy\n\nAll of these are unique. So, the claim might be suggesting that except for 1994 and 1998, each year has a different gold medalist. But in our table, even 1994 and 1998 have unique winners compared to other years. Therefore, the claim's logic doesn't hold because there's no repetition at all. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is implying that in 1994 and 1998, the gold medalists were different from previous years but not necessarily all different every year except those two. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that in some other cases, the same person won multiple times, but only in 1994 and 1998 they didn't.\n\nWait no, looking at the data, each gold medalist is unique across the years listed. So if the claim says \"different every year except 1994 and 1998,\" but since all are different, that would make the statement FALSE because it's saying they are different in all except those two, but here none of them repeat.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the claim is suggesting that the gold medalists have been different every year except for 1994 and 1998, meaning that only in those two years they might not be different. But if in reality, all are different, then the statement would still be FALSE because it's claiming a pattern that doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"different every year except 1994 and 1998,\" meaning that from 1982 onwards, each year has a new gold medalist, but in 1994 and 1998, perhaps they might not be different\u2014but in reality, all are different regardless.\n\nWait, I think the key is to check if any years have the same gold medalist. Since none of them repeat, the claim that \"they have been different in every year except 1994 and 1998\" would be incorrect because there's no repetition at all, making the statement a bit misleading or false.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to check if any cells in the 'gold' column have the same value across different years. Since they're all unique, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, about the relevant_cells: The claim mentions \"equestrian\" and \"gold medalist.\" Looking at the table columns, each row has location and medals (gold, silver, bronze). So, for the gold column, the relevant cells are all rows where the 'gold' winner is listed. Therefore, I need to include each row's index and the 'gold' column name.\n\nSo, relevant_cells would be all 7 rows with 'gold'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"South Korea be the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time, in Seoul twice.\" So I'm looking to see if South Korea has hosted the equestrian events more than once, specifically mentioning Seoul as a host location.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The table has several rows, each representing different years, locations, gold medalists, silver, and bronze. The columns are Year, Location, Gold, Silver, Bronze.\n\nThe claim is about South Korea hosting equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically in Seoul twice. So I'm focusing on the 'Location' column for South Korea's hosts.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: 1982, New Delhi - location is India.\nRow 2: 1986, Seoul - this is South Korea. The equestrian events would be under their respective medals.\nRow 3: 1994, Hiroshima - Japan.\nRow 4: 1998, Bangkok - Thailand.\nRow 5: 2002, Busan - South Korea again.\nRow 6: 2006, Doha - Qatar.\nRow 7: 2010, Guangzhou - China.\n\nSo from the table, South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). That's two times. The claim says \"more than once,\" which would mean at least twice, so that part is true.\n\nThe second part of the claim mentions hosting in Seoul twice. From the table, only Row 2 (1986) is Seoul. There's no other row with South Korea as the location except 2002 in Busan. So the claim says South Korea hosted equestrian events more than once and specifically in Seoul twice. But according to the table, they only hosted once in Seoul, not twice.\n\nWait, the claim says \"hosted... more than 1 time, in Seoul 2 times.\" Does that mean hosting equestrian events at the Asian Games multiple times overall, with two of those being in Seoul? Or does it mean hosting in Seoul twice?\n\nLooking again: The table shows South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). So they've hosted twice. The claim says \"more than once,\" which is correct because it's twice.\n\nBut the second part of the claim specifies \"in Seoul 2 times.\" However, from the table, South Korea only hosted once in Seoul. There's no other row with South Korea as location except for 2002, which is Busan. So if the claim is saying that South Korea hosted in Seoul twice, that's incorrect because it's only once.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim means that Seoul was the host location more than once, not necessarily South Korea hosting. But no, the wording says \"South Korea... have host equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time.\"\n\nSo South Korea hosted twice: once in Seoul (1986), once in Busan (2002). So they've hosted more than once. The claim's first part is true.\n\nThe second part of the claim, though, says \"in Seoul 2 times.\" But according to the table, Seoul was only host once, so that part is false.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misreading. Let me read the claim again: \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Game more than 1 time , in seoul 2 time.\"\n\nSo it's saying South Korea hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, and that they did so twice in Seoul. So two hosts in Seoul.\n\nBut from the table, South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). So only one time in Seoul. Therefore, the claim is incorrect on the second part.\n\nSo overall, the claim says South Korea hosted more than once, which is true because they've hosted twice. But it also claims that they did so twice in Seoul, which isn't accurate because they only hosted once there. So the entire claim is false because one part is correct but another part is incorrect. Or wait, maybe the claim is a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me parse the claim again: \"South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Game more than 1 time , in seoul 2 time.\"\n\nSo it's saying two things:\n\n1. South Korea is the only country that has hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once.\n\n2. They hosted those events twice specifically in Seoul.\n\nLooking at the first part: Is South Korea the only country to have hosted more than once? Let me check other countries in the table for hosting multiple times.\n\nLooking at locations:\n\n- New Delhi (1982), Hiroshima (1994), Bangkok (1998), Doha (2006), Guangzhou (2010) \u2013 these are one-time hosts each.\n- Seoul: 1986, Busan: 2002. So South Korea has hosted twice.\n\nOther countries in the table are India, Japan, Thailand, Qatar, China. None of them have hosted more than once except South Korea. So the first part is true.\n\nThe second part says they hosted in Seoul twice. But from the table, Seoul was only once (1986). Busan was another time (2002), but that's a different city. So the second part is false because it's not twice in Seoul but twice overall, with one in Seoul and one elsewhere.\n\nSo the claim is partially true and partially false. However, since the second part is incorrect, the entire statement is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim might mean that South Korea hosted more than once at the Asian Games, and specifically, they did so twice in Seoul. So if it's two times total, including once in Seoul, then the claim would be wrong because it says twice in Seoul. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that they have hosted more than one event, each time in Seoul. But from the table, it's only once.\n\nSo to clarify:\n\n- Hosting more than once: South Korea has done this (twice).\n- Hosting in Seoul twice: they did it once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims hosting in Seoul twice, which didn't happen.\n\nThus, the overall answer is FALSE because while South Korea has hosted more than once, they haven't done so twice specifically in Seoul.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that South Korea hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, particularly twice in Seoul. The table shows South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan). They hosted twice overall but only once in Seoul. Thus, the claim's second part is incorrect, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
