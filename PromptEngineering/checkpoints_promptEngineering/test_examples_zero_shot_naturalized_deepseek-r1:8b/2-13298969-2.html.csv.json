    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about the given table is true or false. The claim is: \"lavar johnson and anthony fulller be at the wec 9 and wec 8 , respectively.\" Hmm, first, I should make sure I understand what each part of the claim means.\n\nI think \"respectively\" here means that Lavar Johnson is at wec 9 and Anthony Fuller is at wec 8. So I need to check if these two fighters are indeed in those specific events with their respective records.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows from 1 to 24, each containing details about a fight event. Each row has columns like res (result), record, opponent, method, event name, round, time, and location.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows correspond to Lavar Johnson and Anthony Fuller. I'll go through the table one by one.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Opponent is Brett Cooper. Not them.\nRow 2: Opponent Sultan Aliev. No.\nRow 3: Andreas Spann. Nope.\nRow 4: Kala Hose. Not matching.\nRow 5: Zelg Galesic. No.\nRow 6: Richard Blake. No.\nRow 7: Givanildo Santana. No.\nRow 8: Kyacey Uscola. No.\nRow 9: B.J. Lacy. Different name.\nRow 10: Keith Berry. Not matching.\nRow 11: Jaime Jara. Nope.\nRow 12: Rafael Real. No.\nRow 13: Phil Collins. Unlikely, same last name but different person.\nRow 14: Brian Stann. Different fighter.\nRow 15: Maybe not listed here? Wait, the table goes up to Row 24.\n\nWait, actually, I think Lavar Johnson and Anthony Fuller are further down in the rows.\n\nLooking at the later rows:\n\nRow 23: Opponent Lavender Johnson, event WEC 9. Oh, that's Lavar Johnson, right? So his row is 23, event wec 9.\n\nThen Row 24: Opponent Anthony fuller (wait, but in the table it's Anthony fuller spelled as \"fuller\"). Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, in Row 22: Opponent is Anthony Arria. Row 23: Lavon Johnson. Row 24: Anthony fuller. So wait, Anthony Fuller is at Row 24, event WEC 8.\n\nSo the claim says Lavar Johnson is at wec 9 (which matches his row 23) and Anthony Fuller is at wec 8 (which is his row 24). Therefore, it seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. The claim says \"lavar johnson and anthony fulller be at the wec 9 and wec 8 , respectively.\" So Lavar Johnson is at WEC 9 and Anthony Fuller is at WEC 8. According to the table:\n\n- Row 23: Lavar Johnson, event wec 9.\n- Row 24: Anthony fuller, event wec 8.\n\nYes, that matches. So the claim is true.\n\nWait, but I notice a possible typo in the table. In Row 22, opponent is Anthony Arria, and the method is \"submission ( armbar )\". But in Row 24, it's spelled as \"submission (strikes)\". Maybe the fighter's name is correctly listed as Anthony fuller there.\n\nYes, so both fighters are present at their respective events as per the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being Rows 23 and 24 for Lavar Johnson and Anthony Fuller respectively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the match against Jame Irvin and Anthony Arria both lasted less than a minute.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is asking. It's about two specific fights\u2014Jame Irvin vs. someone and Anthony Arria vs. someone\u2014and whether both of those matches ended in less than a minute.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like the result (win/loss), record, opponent, method, event, round, time, and location. So I need to find the rows where the opponents are Jame Irvin and Anthony Arria.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to locate these names. \n\nRow 11: Opponent is Jaime Jara. That's not Jame Irvin, so probably a typo. Wait, no, the claim mentions Jame Irvin, but in the table, it's spelled as \"Jame\" with an 'e' instead of an 'i'. Hmm, that might be a typo or different spelling. I'll note that and see if there's another row where the opponent is Anthony Arria.\n\nLooking further, Row 22: Opponent is Anthony Arria, and the method is submission (armbar), time is 0:22. So this fight lasted 0:22 minutes, which is less than a minute.\n\nNow, for Jame Irvin. Scanning through the rows again. I don't immediately see a row where the opponent is \"Jame Irvin.\" Wait, in Row 14: Opponent is Brian Stann, not Irvin. Then in Row 15: Ariel Gandulla. Row 16: Justin McElfresh. Row 17: Lavvar Johnson. Row 18: Jeff Terry. Row 19: Tim McKenzie. Row 20: James Irvin! Oh, there it is.\n\nRow 20: Opponent is James Irvin. Wait, the claim says \"Jame Irvin,\" but here it's spelled as \"James.\" Maybe that's a typo in both places\u2014either way, it's about the same person. So in Row 20, the fight was against James Irvin, and the time was 0:45 minutes. That's 45 seconds, which is less than a minute.\n\nWait, but earlier when I looked at Row 11, the opponent was Jaime Jara, not Irvin. But the claim refers to two matches: one against Jame Irvin and another against Anthony Arria. So we have:\n\n- Jame Irvin vs someone (probably James Irvin in Row 20)\n- Anthony Arria vs someone (Row 22)\n\nNow, checking the times for both:\n\n1. Jame Irvin's fight: Row 20, time is 0:45 minutes.\n2. Anthony Arria's fight: Row 22, time is 0:22 minutes.\n\nBoth times are less than a minute because 45 seconds and 22 seconds are under a minute (60 seconds). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that there isn't another row where the opponent is Jame Irvin. Let me check again quickly:\n\nRow 11: Jaime Jara\nRow 20: James Irvin\nRows after that up to 24 don't have any more opponents matching Jame or Anthony Arria.\n\nSo both matches indeed lasted less than a minute.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check the time each match took for the specified opponents. Both matches against James Irvin (Row 20) and Anthony Arria (Row 22) ended in under a minute.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"brett cooper and kala hose be both knock out by punch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find any mentions of Brett Cooper and Kala Hose. Each row has details like 'res' (result), 'opponent', 'method', etc. \n\nStarting with Brett Cooper: I'll scan each row's opponent column. The first row says opponent: brett cooper, and method is ko (punch). So that's a win for Brett Cooper via knockout by punch.\n\nNow, looking for Kala Hose: again, checking the opponent column. In row 4, the opponent is kala hose, and the method is ko (punch). So Kala Hose also has a knockout by punch in this fight.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if these are both wins or losses. The 'res' column shows for Brett Cooper it's a win, and for Kala Hose, row 4 also shows res: win. So both were knocked out by punches, but as wins for the fighter against them.\n\nThe claim says \"brett cooper and kala hose be both knock out by punch.\" So they are indeed both knocked out via punches. However, it's important to note that in each case, the 'res' is a win, meaning Brett Cooper and whoever fought Kala Hose (in row 4) won those fights by knockout.\n\nBut wait, looking at row 5: opponent is zelg galesic, method ko flying knee, but that's not related. Similarly, other rows don't have Brett or Kala as opponents except the first and fourth rows.\n\nSo both Brett Cooper and Kala Hose were indeed knocked out by punches in their respective fights. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the table data where Brett Cooper and Kala Hose were both knocked out by punches in their respective fights.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"rafael real and phil collins both go down to a tko due to punch.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the two fighters mentioned in the claim: Rafael Real and Phil Collins. Then, I'll look through each row of the table to find their fight records related to TKO (Technical Knockout) via punches.\n\nStarting with Rafael Real. Scanning each row, I see that in Row 12, res is win, opponent is Rafael Real. The method is tko (punches). So that's one instance where he went down to a TKO due to punches.\n\nNext, Phil Collins. Looking through the rows, I find him in Row 13. Again, res is win for Phil Collins, and the method is tko (punches). So both Rafael Real and Phil Collins have indeed gone down via TKO from punches as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I have to determine whether the claim \"the match against sultan aliev and lavar johnson both last 5 minutes\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two matches: one against Sultan Aliyev and another against Lavar Johnson. Both of these matches are said to have lasted 5 minutes. So, my task is to verify if both these matches in the table have a time column equal to 5:00.\n\nI'll start by looking for rows where the opponent's name is either Sultan Aliyev or Lavar Johnson. I should go through each row one by one until I find these two opponents.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 2 has the opponent Sultan Aliyev. Let me check the time column here. It says 5:00. That matches the claim for Sultan Aliyev's match.\n\nNext, I need to find Lavar Johnson. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 23 has the opponent Lav ar Johnson (note the typo in the table as \"lavar johnson\"). The time column here is also 5:00. So both matches last exactly 5 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, but sometimes events might have different round times or other factors. However, in this case, both matches are in round 1 and their respective event's rounds are specified as 3 and 1, but the time is clearly stated as 5:00 for both. \n\nSo, both Sultan Aliyev's and Lavar Johnson's matches indeed lasted 5 minutes according to the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. For Row 2, the column is \"time\", and for Row 23, it's also \"time\". So the relevant cells are at row indices 2 and 23, both under the \"time\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Doug Marshall taking more time to win against Anthony Fuller than Lavar Johnson is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who Doug Marshall and Anthony Fuller are in the context of the matches listed in the table. From the table, each row seems to represent a fight event with details like the result (win/loss), record, opponent, method, event name, round number, time, and location.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I see that Doug Marshall's fights are mentioned in rows 15 to 23. For example, row 15 shows Doug Marshall winning against Ariel Gandulla, but that's not relevant here. What I'm looking for is a fight where Doug Marshall fought Anthony Fuller.\n\nWait, actually, looking at row 24: res: win, record: 1 - 0, opponent: anthony fuller, method: submission (strikes), event: wec 8, round: 1, time: 0:32. So that's the fight between Doug Marshall and Anthony Fuller. The time taken was 0:32.\n\nNow, I need to find Lavar Johnson's fight against someone. From the table, looking for Lavar Johnson, I see row 23: res: win, opponent: lavar johnson, method: tko (corner stoppage), event: wec 9, round: 1, time: 5:00. That's Lavar Johnson fighting against Lavon Johnson? Wait, no, the opponent is Lavon Johnson or someone else?\n\nWait, actually, row 23 says \"opponent: lavar johnson\". Hmm, that seems odd because if it's a match between two people named Johnson, perhaps it's a typo. Or maybe it's Lavar Johnson vs. himself? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the opponent is someone else, but the name is misspelled as Johnson.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Row 23: res: win, record: 2 - 0, opponent: lavar johnson, method: tko (corner stoppage), event: wec 9, round: 1, time: 5:00. So the fight is between Doug Marshall and Lavar Johnson? Or is it someone else?\n\nWait, no, the rows are about individual fights. Each row represents a single fight where one person wins and another loses. So in row 23, the opponent is Lavar Johnson, so that means Doug Marshall fought against Lavar Johnson.\n\nSo, the claim is: Doug Marshall took more time to win against Anthony Fuller than Lavar Johnson did in his own fight.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Doug Marshall vs. Anthony Fuller happened at row 24, with a time of 0:32.\n- Lavar Johnson's fight (assuming he fought someone else) is at row 23, but wait, that's Doug Marshall's fight. So maybe I need to look for another row where Lavar Johnson fought.\n\nWait, the table doesn't seem to have any other fights involving Lavar Johnson besides row 23. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all rows from 1 to 24, I see that in row 23, Doug Marshall fought against Lavon Johnson? Or was it a typo for Lavar Johnson? Because the opponent is listed as \"lavar johnson\".\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 23: res: win, record: 2 - 0, opponent: lavar johnson, method: tko (corner stoppage), event: wec 9, round: 1, time: 5:00.\n\nSo the fight is between Doug Marshall and Lavar Johnson. The time taken was 5 minutes exactly.\n\nNow, Doug Marshall fought Anthony Fuller in row 24, which took 0:32 minutes. So comparing these two times:\n\n- Doug vs. Anthony: 0:32\n- Doug vs. Lavar: 5:00\n\nThe claim is that Doug took more time against Anthony than Lavar. But wait, the numbers say the opposite. Doug's fight against Anthony was much shorter (32 seconds) compared to his fight against Lavar, which lasted five minutes.\n\nSo the claim says Doug took more time against Anthony than Lavar, but actually, he took less time for Anthony's fight. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to compare the duration of two specific matches: one where Doug Marshall fought Anthony Fuller and another where Doug Marshall fought Lavar Johnson.\n\n1. **Doug vs. Anthony (Row 24)**:\n   - Time: 0:32\n2. **Doug vs. Lavar (Row 23)**:\n   - Time: 5:00\n\nSince 0:32 is less than 5:00, Doug Marshall's match against Anthony Fuller took less time.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells**: The relevant cells are the times of the two matches where Doug Marshall fought Anthony Fuller and Lavar Johnson. These are found in row 24 and row 23, respectively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the match against anthony arria last longer than the match against james irvin.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for both Anthony Arria and James Irvin in the table.

So Rafael Real is here. The result is a win, and the method was a KO (punches). The round is 1, so he was knocked out in the first round.\n\nNow, looking for Phil Collins.

Let me check that row carefully. \n\nRow 13: res: win, record: 9 - 3, opponent: phil collins, method: tko (punches), event: pfc 9, round: 2, time: 0:40, location: lemoore , california , united states. So Phil Collins is in Row 13 as the opponent. The result is a win for the fighter, and the method was a KO (punches). But wait, the round is 2.

Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Rafael Real** (Row 12) was indeed knocked out in Round 1.\n- **Phil Collins** (Row 13) was knocked out, but specifically in Round 2.\n\nSince only one of them was knocked out in Round 1, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the match against Sultan Aliev and Lavar Johnson be both decided by submission\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It's about two specific matches: one between Sultan Aliev and another opponent, and another between Lavar Johnson and another opponent. The claim states that both of these matches were decided by submission. \n\nNow, I need to check the table for any rows that match these two fighters and see how their respective matches ended.\n\nStarting with Sultan Aliev: I'll search each row for \"Sultan Aliev\" in the 'opponent' column. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Brett Cooper. Not Sultan.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Sultan Aliev. This seems relevant because it's one of the fighters mentioned.\n\nSo, Row 2 has res: win, record: 17 - 6, opponent: Sultan Aliev, method: decision (split). The method here is a decision, not a submission. Therefore, this match was decided by a split decision, not by submission.\n\nNext, looking for Lavar Johnson in the opponent column:\n\n- Row 23: Opponent is Lavar Johnson. This is relevant.\n\nRow 23 shows res: win, record: 2 - 0, method: tko (corner stoppage). The method here is a tko, which stands for technical knockout, not submission. So this match was decided by corner stoppage, not submission.\n\nSince both matches where Sultan Aliev and Lavar Johnson were opponents ended via methods other than submission, the claim that both matches were decided by submission is FALSE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm looking at the correct rows. Maybe the table shows these two fighters as opponents in different rows. Let me double-check.\n\nFor Sultan Aliev: Only Row 2 lists him as an opponent. The method was decision (split). So no submission there.\n\nFor Lavar Johnson: Only Row 23 lists him as an opponent, with a tko stoppage. Again, not a submission.\n\nTherefore, both matches were not decided by submission. The claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
