    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier be played in Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any rows that mention the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier and check if the venue is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's competition column. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Competition is 2006 AFC Challenge Cup.\nRow 2: Same as above.\nRow 3: 2007 Hong Kong - Macau Interport.\nRow 4: 2008 East Asian Championship Qualifier.\nRow 5-6: 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifier.\nRow 7: 2008 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier.\nRow 8-11: 2010 East Asian Football Championship Qualifier.\nRow 12: 2010 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifier.\nRow 13: Same as above.\nRow 14-16: 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier.\nRow 17: 2012 Philippine Peace Cup.\n\nWait, the claim mentions 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier. So I need to check if any row has that competition and venue.\n\nLooking through the rows, only Row 15-16 mention the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier. But let me check their venues. \n\nRow 14: Venue is Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona, score 1-0, result 5-1, competition 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier.\nRows 15-16 also have the same venue but different competitions (2013). Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, Row 14: date is 20 July 2012, venue Leo Palace, Yona, score 1-0, result 5-1, competition 2012 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier.\nRows 15-16 also mention Leo Palace but with different competitions (2013). But the claim is about 2013.\n\nWait, so in the table, are there any rows for 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Row 14: 2012\nRow 15: 2013\nRow 16: 2013\n\nSo Rows 15-16 have competition as 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier and venue Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona. Therefore, the claim is supported by these rows.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup Qualifier be played in Leo Palace...\", so the venue matches for that competition in 2013.\n\nSo yes, there are multiple rows (15-16) where this happens. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nThe claim is: \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in rizai memorial stadium , manila.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check each row of the table to see if any match this claim. I'll look for rows where the competition column mentions \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\" and the venue is \"rizal memorial stadium , manila.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 17: date: 25 september 2012, venue: rizal memorial stadium , manila, score: 2 - 1, result: 2 - 2, competition: 2012 philippine peace cup.\n\nHmm, this row's competition is \"2012 philippine peace cup,\" which doesn't match the claimed competition of \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier.\" So there's no exact match here. \n\nNext, I'll look for any other rows that might be relevant but didn't immediately come up. I see rows 14-16 mention \"2012 eaff east asian cup qualifier,\" which is a different year and competition. Row 17 is the only one related to rizal memorial stadium in Manila, but it's about a different event.\n\nSince there's no row that matches both the competition name and venue as per the claim, I think the claim isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
