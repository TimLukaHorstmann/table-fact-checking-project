    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim about the table is true or false. The claim says, \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"No defensive end pick\" suggests that in the entire draft, there are no players selected as defensive ends. Additionally, it mentions that all these picks have an overall position number smaller than 2. Wait, but the overall numbers go up to at least 228 (looking at the table), so maybe the claim is about some specific criteria.\n\nLooking at the table columns: round, pick, overall, name, position, college. The relevant columns here are \"position\" and \"overall.\" For each row, I need to check if any player's position is defensive end and if their overall pick is less than 2.\n\nWait, but in the table, I see several positions, like linebacker, defensive end, center, etc. Let me go through each row.\n\nRow 1: position is linebacker. So not a defensive end.\nRow 2: position is defensive end. Now check the overall. The \"overall\" here is 33. Is 33 smaller than 2? No, so this doesn't meet both conditions.\nRow 3: center, so not relevant.\nRow 4: cornerback, not defensive end.\nRow 5: wide receiver, nope.\nRow 6: guard, nope.\nRow 7: defensive back, which is a different position from defensive end. So not relevant.\nRow 8: wide receiver again.\nRow 9: another wide receiver.\nRow 10: wide receiver.\n\nSo only Row 2 has a defensive end. The claim says there should be \"no defensive end pick,\" but here there's at least one, so the first part of the claim is false. Also, since this player was picked in Round 2, Pick 3 with an overall number of 33, which is definitely larger than 2.\n\nWait, but maybe I misinterpret the claim. It says \"no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2.\" Does it mean that for every defensive end pick, their overall is less than 2? That would be impossible because overall picks are at least 1, but in this table, they start from 1 up to higher numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim means that there are no defensive ends picked and all the relevant picks are below a certain number. But since there's a defensive end (Tony Brackens) with an overall pick of 33, which is not less than 2, the second part also fails.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim aren't met because there's at least one defensive end pick and some have higher overall picks.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there should be no defensive end picks and all such picks must have an overall number smaller than 2. However, the table shows Tony Brackens as a defensive end picked in Round 2, Pick 3 with an overall of 33, which is larger than 2.\n\n**Answer**: FALSE\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Row 1: position\n- Row 2: position and overall\n- Row 4: position\n- ...
