    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"andre fluellen be draft ad a defensive tackle in round 3.\" \n\nFirst, let me look through each row of the table to find Andre Fluellen. Scanning through the players:\n\nRow 1: Gosder Cherilus - offensive tackle\nRow 2: Jordan Dizon - linebacker\nRow 3: Kevin Smith - running back\nRow 4: Andre Fluellen - defensive tackle\nRow 5: Cliff Avril - linebacker\nRow 6: Kenneth Moore Jr. - wide receiver\nRow 7: Jerome Felton - fullback\nRow 8: Landon Cohen - defensive tackle\nRow 9: Caleb Campbell - safety\n\nSo, in row 4, the player is Andre Fluellen, position is defensive tackle. Now, checking the rounds and picks. The table shows round:3, pick:87 for Andre Fluellen.\n\nThe claim says he was drafted \"in round 3,\" which matches the table's data. Also, his position is defensive tackle, as stated in the claim. \n\nWait, but I notice that in row 4, it's round:3 and pick:87. So the specific details match both the round and position mentioned in the claim. Therefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"round 3 be the earliest round for a player to be taken from central florida\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It claims that in Central Florida, the earliest round where a player was picked is Round 3. So, I need to check if any players from Central Florida were selected in Round 3 or earlier. But wait, if \"earliest\" means the first occurrence, then Round 3 might not necessarily be the earliest if there's a Round 1 or 2 pick from that school.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I should focus on the 'team' column for Central Florida and check their respective rounds. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Team is Boston College \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Team is Colorado \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Team is Central Florida \u2013 player Kevin Smith was picked in Round 3, pick 64. So that's one from Round 3.\nRow 4: Florida State \u2013 irrelevant.\nRow 5: Purdue \u2013 no.\nRow 6: Wake Forest \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 7: Furman \u2013 nope.\nRow 8: Ohio \u2013 no.\nRow 9: Army \u2013 no.\n\nWait, so the only player from Central Florida in this table is Kevin Smith in Round 3. That means there's at least one player taken in Round 3. But does that mean it's the earliest? If there are no players picked earlier than Round 3 from Central Florida, then yes, Round 3 would be the earliest.\n\nBut I should check if any other rows have Central Florida as their team. Scanning again, only Row 3 is for Central Florida. So since there are no picks before Round 3, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Round 3 is the earliest round a player from Central Florida was picked. From the table, the only player from Central Florida is in Round 3, so it's the earliest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"landon cohen be the player draft for defensive tackle, in round 7 who play for colorado.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of this claim to see what I need to check in the table.\n\n1. **Player's Name**: Landon Cohen\n2. **Position**: Defensive Tackle\n3. **Round**: Round 7\n4. **Team**: Colorado\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find any matches.\n\n- **Row 1**: Player is Gosder Cherilus, position is offensive tackle, team is Boston College. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 2**: Player is Jordon Dizon, position is linebacker, team is Colorado. Not Landon Cohen and not defensive tackle.\n- **Row 3**: Kevin Smith, running back, Central Florida. No match.\n- **Row 4**: Andre Fluellens, defensive tackle, Florida State. Different player, different team.\n- **Row 5**: Cliff Avril, linebacker, Purdue. Doesn't fit.\n- **Row 6**: Kenneth Moore Jr., wide receiver, Wake Forest. Not relevant.\n- **Row 7**: Jerome Felton, fullback, Furman. No match.\n- **Row 8**: Landon Cohen, defensive tackle, Ohio. Team is Ohio, not Colorado. So this row doesn't fit all the criteria but partially matches name and position.\n- **Row 9**: Caleb Campbell, safety, Army. Not relevant.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there's a player named Landon Cohen in Row 8, but he plays for Ohio, not Colorado. The claim mentions Colorado as his team, which doesn't match.\n\nAlso, checking other players: none of them are Landon Cohen with defensive tackle and round 7. \n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because although there's a Landon Cohen in the table, he isn't from Colorado.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Landon Cohen plays for Colorado, while he actually plays for Ohio.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
