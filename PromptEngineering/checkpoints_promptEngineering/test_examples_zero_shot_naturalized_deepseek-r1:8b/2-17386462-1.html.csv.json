    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a football table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided in the table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully:\n\n\"the netherfield lost the most game with 28 loss , the gateshead team and the southport team tie with the most game draw at 14 , and the bangor city team come in first position with 108 goal overall for the team.\"\n\nSo, breaking it down into three main points:\n\n1. **Netherfield has the most losses (28)**.\n2. **Gateshead and Southport have the most draws (14 each)**.\n3. **Bangor City is first with 108 goals for**.\n\nNow, I'll need to verify each of these claims by checking the relevant rows and columns in the provided table.\n\nStarting with the first point: Netherfield's losses. Looking at the table, I see that Row 22 corresponds to Netherfield. The columns related here are \"lost\" and their total games played. According to the table, Netherfield has 28 lost games out of 42. So this part seems correct.\n\nNext, checking Gateshead and Southport's draws. For Gateshead, they are in Row 4, with 14 drawn games. Southport is in Row 8, also with 14 drawn games. Both have the highest number of draws at 14 each, which supports the second part of the claim.\n\nLastly, examining Bangor City's goals for. They are in Row 1, and their goals for total 108. This matches the third point in the claim.\n\nSince all three points check out based on the table data provided, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest number of games lost by team Matlock Town is 23.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row in the table to find out how many games each team lost. The table has columns for 'position', 'team', and various other stats including 'lost'. Since we're interested in the number of losses per team, I'll focus on the 'lost' column.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n1. **Row 21**: Team is Matlock Town. Their 'lost' value is 23.\n2. Other teams like Tamworth (Row 19) have 23 losses as well, but since the claim specifically mentions Matlock Town, we only care about their number.\n\nSo, I need to check if any other team has a higher number of losses than 23. Looking through all the rows:\n\n- The highest number of losses in the table is 23, achieved by both Matlock Town and Tamworth. No team lost more than 23 games in this season.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Matlock Town did indeed lose the highest number of games (23) among all teams listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
