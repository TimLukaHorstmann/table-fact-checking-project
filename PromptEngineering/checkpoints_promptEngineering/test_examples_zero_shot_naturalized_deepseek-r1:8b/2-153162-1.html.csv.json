    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about Malaysia Airlines working with two different companies for catering is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Malaysia airline work with 2 different company for catering : taj madras air catering limit and mas cater (sarawak) sdn bhd.\" So, the claim states that Malaysia Airlines has two catering companies they work with\u2014Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different company related to the Malaysia Airlines group. The relevant columns here are \"company\" and \"type,\" as well as possibly \"group's equity shareholding.\"\n\nI'll start by locating both companies mentioned in the claim within the table.\n\n1. **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited**: \n   - Scanning through each row, I find this company in Row 10. The row states it's an associate of the group with a principal activity in catering and is incorporated in India. So, yes, this is one of the companies mentioned in the claim.\n\n2. **MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd**:\n   - Checking each row again, I find this company in Row 11. It's listed as a subsidiary with principal activities in catering, incorporated in Malaysia, and has an equity shareholding of 60% in the group. This matches the second part of the claim.\n\nNow, to confirm if Malaysia Airlines is working with both these companies for catering. The term \"work with\" implies that each company provides catering services to Malaysia Airlines. \n\nFrom Row 10, Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate and does catering. From Row 11, MAS Cater (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary and also does catering. So both are involved in providing catering services.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the equity shareholding for each:\n- Taj Madras has 20% equity.\n- MAS Cater has 60% equity.\n\nThis indicates that both companies are subsidiaries or associates of the Malaysia Airlines group, which supports the claim that they work with two different catering companies.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE based on the information provided in the table. The relevant cells would be the ones for both companies mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"company\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"company\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the given claim about Malaysia Airlines' subsidiaries and associates is true or false. The claim states: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in malaysia , except for taj madras air catering limit , which be incorporate in india.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has 12 rows, each representing a different company related to Malaysia Airlines. Each row includes details like the company name, type (sub subsidiary or associate), principal activities, incorporation country, and equity shareholding.\n\nThe claim mentions two types: subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines. From the table, I see that companies are either listed as 'subsidary' or 'associate'. For example, rows 1 through 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are subsidiaries with 100% equity shareholding except row 9 which is 80%. Then, rows 10 and 12 are associates.\n\nLooking at the incorporation countries: most of them are in Malaysia. Only row 10 (Taj Madras Air Catering Limited) is incorporated in India, as per the claim. So, this seems to fit the claim's exception part.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that all other companies are indeed incorporated in Malaysia except for Taj Madras. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Malaysia\nRow 2: Malaysia\nRow 3: Malaysia\nRow 4: Malaysia\nRow 5: Malaysia\nRow 6: Malaysia\nRow 7: Malaysia\nRow 8: Malaysia\nRow 9: Malaysia\nRow 10: India (exactly as claimed)\nRows 11 and 12: Row 11 is a subsidiary in Malaysia, and row 12 is an associate but it says incorporated in Malaysia. Wait, no, row 12's incorporation country isn't specified in the table? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the table: each row has 'incorporated in' as a column. So for row 10, it's India. For row 11, it's Malaysia. For row 12, it's Malaysia. So, the claim says all except Taj Madras are in Malaysia, which is correct because only Taj Madras is in India.\n\nBut wait, the claim also mentions 'associate' as part of the entities. The table has both subsidiaries and associates. So, in the table, there are companies labeled as 'subsidary' and others as 'associate'. For example, row 10 is an associate incorporated in India, while others are either subsidiaries or associates but in Malaysia.\n\nSo, the claim says all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines except Taj Madras are incorporated in Malaysia. That seems accurate because only Taj Madras is listed as incorporated in India.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any other companies besides Taj Madras that are associates and not in Malaysia. Looking at rows 10 and 12: row 10 (Taj Madras) is an associate from India, while row 12 (LSG Sky Chefs) is a subsidiary? Wait, no\u2014row 12's type is 'associate', but it says incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nWait, no, row 12: company is LSG Sky Chefs, type is associate, principal activities holding company, incorporated in Malaysia. So that's correct\u2014it's an associate in Malaysia.\n\nSo the only exception is Taj Madras, which is correctly noted as being in India. Therefore, the claim seems to be true because all other subsidiaries and associates are indeed incorporated in Malaysia except for Taj Madras.\n\nBut wait, another point: the table has both 'subsidary' and 'associate' types. The claim refers to \"subsidary and associate\" of Malaysia Airlines. So it's correct that all except Taj Madras are in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is TRUE, because all the subsidiaries and associates, except for Taj Madras, are incorporated in Malaysia as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by checking each row in the table. All companies except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited are incorporated in Malaysia. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me read the claim carefully: \"of all the subsidiary of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd.\" \n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. The term \"malaysia airline\" is mentioned twice, and it's not clear if it's referring to the main company or something else. Let me check the table provided to see which companies are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows where the type is \"subsiary.\" These include MASwings Sdn Bhd (Row 3), Firefly Sdn Bhd (Row 4), MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd (Row 5), MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd (Row 6), Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd (Row 7), MAS Academy Sdn Bhd (Row 8), and Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (Row 9). Additionally, there are other companies listed with types like joint venture and associate.\n\nThe claim says that \"of all the subsidiary of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd.\" I'm not entirely sure what is being compared here. It seems to suggest that among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines, MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd has the lowest equity shareholding.\n\nLooking at the table, specifically Row 11: company: mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd, type: subsidiary, principal activities: catering, incorporated in: malaysia, group 's equity shareholding: 60%. \n\nSo MAS Catering (Sarawak) has an equity shareholding of 60% in the group. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest among all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLooking through the table, let's see the equity shareholdings for each subsidiary:\n\n- Row 3: 100%\n- Row 4: 100%\n- Row 5: 100%\n- Row 6: 100%\n- Row 7: 100%\n- Row 8: 100%\n- Row 9: 80%\n- Row 11: 60%\n\nSo, the lowest equity shareholding among these subsidiaries is indeed MAS Catering (Sarawak) with 60%. \n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are other companies that might have lower equity shareholdings. Looking at the table, the only other subsidiary is Abacus Distribution Systems with 80%, which is higher than 60%. There's also Taj Madras Air Catering (Row 10), but it's an associate, not a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines.\n\nTherefore, among all the subsidiaries listed under Malaysia Airlines, MAS Catering (Sarawak) has the lowest equity shareholding at 60%. \n\nSo the claim seems to be TRUE based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiary.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. \"Malaysia airline\" likely refers to the main company, which from the table seems to be Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd or maybe MASwings, but looking at the table, it's better to check if there are companies where the equity is 100% and they're subsidiaries.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Company is Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, type subsidiary, activities cargo, incorporated in Malaysia, equity 100%. So yes, this is a subsidiary with 100% equity.\n\nRow 3: MASwings Sdn Bhd, type subsidiary, airline, equity 100%.\n\nRow4: Firefly Sdn Bhd, same type and equity.\n\nRow5: MAS Aerotechnologies, same.\n\nRow6: MAS Golden Holidays, same.\n\nRow7: Malaysian Aerospace Engineering, same.\n\nRows1-7 have 7 companies where the group's equity is 100%. Each of these is a subsidiary. So that's 7 subsidiaries with 100% equity.\n\nThe table has rows 1-12. The claim mentions 9 different subsidiaries. Let me count how many subsidiaries are there:\n\nLooking at the 'type' column, type is either subsidiary or associate/joint venture. Associates are Taj Madras Air Catering and LSG Sky Chefs, which are types of associates, not subsidiaries.\n\nSubsidiaries are rows1,3-7,9,11: that's 9 companies (row1, then 3-7 is 5, row9, row11). Wait, let me count again:\n\nRow1: subsidiary\n\nRow3-7: 5 more\n\nRow9: subsidiary\n\nRow11: subsidiary\n\nSo that's 1+5+1+1=8 subsidiaries? Wait no, row1 is one, then rows3-7 are 5 (rows3,4,5,6,7), row9 is another, and row11 is another. So total of 1+5+2=8? Or am I missing something.\n\nWait the table has 12 rows. The claim says \"9 different subsidiaries.\" Let me list all companies that are subsidiaries:\n\nRow1: subsidiary\n\nRows3-7: MASwings, Firefly, MAS Aerotech, MAS Golden Holidays, Malaysian Aerospace Engineering\u20145 more.\n\nRow9: Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia)\u2014another.\n\nRow11: MAS Catering (Sarawak)\u2014another.\n\nSo 1+5+2=8 subsidiaries. But the claim says \"9 different subsidiaries.\" So maybe I'm missing one.\n\nWait, is row1 considered as a subsidiary? Yes, it's a subsidiary with 100% equity. Then rows3-7: that's 5 more, making total of 6 so far.\n\nRow9: 7\n\nRow11:8.\n\nSo only 8 subsidiaries with 100% equity. The claim says 7 out of 9 have 100%. So perhaps the table shows that 8 companies are subsidiaries with 100%, which is more than 7. Therefore, the claim's numbers don't match exactly.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all subsidiaries:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd (row1)\n\n3. MASwings Sdn Bhd\n\n4. Firefly Sdn Bhd\n\n5. MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd\n\n6. MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd\n\n7. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd\n\n9. Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd\n\n11. MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd\n\nThat's 9 subsidiaries with 100% equity. Wait, row1 is one, rows3-7 are five more (total 6), row9 is the 7th, and row11 is the 8th or 9th? Let me count again:\n\nRow1: 1\n\nRows3-7: 5 (total 6)\n\nRow9: 7\n\nRow11: 8.\n\nWait no, rows3-7 are rows3,4,5,6,7\u2014so that's 5. Plus row1 is 6, plus row9 and 11 makes 8. So only 8 subsidiaries with 100% equity. Therefore, the claim says \"have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries.\" But according to the table, there are 8 companies that are subsidiaries with 100% equity.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because it claims 7 out of 9, but actually it's 8 out of 12 companies (but only 9 are subsidiaries). Wait no, the claim refers to subsidiaries. So among their subsidiaries, they have 100% in 7 of them. But according to the table, they have 100% in 8 of their 9 subsidiaries.\n\nWait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow1: type subsidiary\n\nRows3-7: type subsidiary (5)\n\nRow9: type subsidiary\n\nRow11: type subsidiary\n\nSo that's a total of 1+5+2=8 subsidiaries. Therefore, the claim says \"have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries,\" but actually it's 8 out of 9.\n\nWait no, the table shows 9 companies listed as subsidiaries:\n\nLooking at the 'type' column:\n\nRow1: subsidiary\n\nRows3-7: subsidiary (5)\n\nRow9: subsidiary\n\nRow11: subsidiary\n\nSo that's a total of 8. Wait, maybe I'm missing another one. Let me check all rows:\n\nRow1: subsidiary\n\nRow2: joint venture\n\nRow3: subsidiary\n\nRow4: subsidiary\n\nRow5: subsidiary\n\nRow6: subsidiary\n\nRow7: subsidiary\n\nRow8: subsidiary\n\nRow9: subsidiary\n\nRow10: associate\n\nRow11: subsidiary\n\nRow12: associate\n\nSo from rows 1-12, the subsidiaries are rows1,3-7,9,11. That's 1+5+2=8.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiaries.\" But according to the table, they have 8 subsidiaries with 100% equity. So the claim is FALSE because it's not exactly 7 but 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all companies:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd (row1): subsidiary\n\n2. MASwings: row3\n\n3. Firefly: row4\n\n4. MAS Aerotech: row5\n\n5. MAS Golden Holidays: row6\n\n6. Malaysian Aerospace Engineering: row7\n\n7. Abacus Distribution Systems: row9\n\n8. MAS Catering (Sarawak): row11\n\nThat's 8 companies with \"type\" as subsidiary and 100% equity.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect\u2014it says 7, but it's actually 8. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires analyzing the number of subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines where the company holds a 100% stake. Upon reviewing each row of the provided data:\n\n- **Row 1**: Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd (subsidiary with 100% equity)\n- **Rows 3\u20137**: MASwings, Firefly, MAS Aerotech, MAS Golden Holidays, Malaysian Aerospace Engineering (5 subsidiaries with 100% equity)\n- **Row 9**: Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (1 subsidiary with 100% equity)\n- **Row 11**: MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd (1 subsidiary with 100% equity)\n\nThis totals to 8 subsidiaries where Malaysia Airlines holds a 100% stake. The original claim states that there are 7 such subsidiaries, which is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe statement is false; there are actually 8 subsidiaries where Malaysia Airlines holds a 100% stake.",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Malaysia Airlines is true or false based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Service Malaysia, which both be not subsidiary.\"\n\nSo, the claim has two main points:\n1. Malaysia Airlines (MA) holds a 30% equity shareholding in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Service Malaysia.\n2. Both companies are not subsidiaries.\n\nI need to check if these statements are true by referring to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists several companies under different categories. The first thing I notice is that the term \"Malaysia airline\" might refer to different entities. In the table, there's Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd and MASwings Sdn Bhd, Firefly Sdn Bhd, etc., but none of them are directly named as \"Malaysia Airlines.\" Wait, maybe that's a mistake in my understanding because sometimes companies use names like \"Malaysia Airlines\" but have subsidiaries with slight variations. Or perhaps the table doesn't list MA itself, only its subsidiaries and associates.\n\nLooking at the claim again, it mentions Malaysia airline having 30% equity in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Service. So I need to find these two companies in the table and check their equity shareholdings relative to MA.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 12: company: LSG Sky Chefs (type: associate, principal activities: holding company, incorporated in: malaysia, group's equity shareholding: 30%.)\n- Row 2: company: GE Engine Services Malaysia (type: joint venture, principal activities: engine overhaul, incorporated in: malaysia, group's equity shareholding: 30%.)\n\nSo both companies have a 30% equity shareholding. Now, I need to check if these are subsidiaries of MA.\n\nLooking at the table, LSG Sky Chefs is type: associate (Row 12) and GE Engine Services Malaysia is type: joint venture (Row 2). Associates and joint ventures are different from subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are indicated by \"type: subsidiary,\" as seen in Rows 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10.\n\nSince LSG Sky Chefs is an associate and GE Engine Services Malaysia is a joint venture, they are not subsidiaries. Therefore, the second part of the claim that both are not subsidiaries is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim seems to be true because MA has 30% equity in both companies, and neither is a subsidiary.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Malaysia Airlines holds a 30% equity shareholding in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Service Malaysia and that neither are subsidiaries.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n1. **Check for Malaysia Airlines in the table**: The table lists various companies but doesn't directly name \"Malaysia Airlines.\" However, it includes their subsidiaries and associates.\n2. **Identify LSG Sky Chefs and GE Engine Services Malaysia**: Both are listed as associates/joint ventures with 30% equity shareholding (Rows 12 and 2).\n3. **Determine their types**: Both are classified as non-subsidiaries (LSG Sky Chefs: associate; GE Engine Services: joint venture).\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is accurate based on the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Malaysia airline have 100% equity in each of their subsidiary, like Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It\u2019s stating that Malaysia Airlines (probably referring to the main company) has 100% equity in all their subsidiaries. The example given is Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows related to subsidiaries and equity shareholding. For instance:\n\n- Row 3: maswings sdn bhd is a subsidiary with 100% equity.\n- Row 4: Firefly sdn bhd, same thing.\n- Row 5: MAS Aerotechnologies, again 100%.\n- Similarly, MAS Academy (Row8) and Abacus Distribution Systems (Row9) have 100% equity.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions \"each of their subsidiary,\" so does that mean all subsidiaries have 100% equity? From the table, it seems most do, except for some where equity is less. For example:\n\n- Row2: GE Engine Services has 30%.\n- Row10 and Row11: Taj Madras Air Catering (20%) and MAS Catering (60%).\n\nSo, not all subsidiaries have 100% equity. The claim says \"have 100% equity in each of their subsidiary,\" which isn't true because some have less.\n\nBut the example given is Taj Madras, which has 20%. So that's even worse. Therefore, the statement is false because not every subsidiary has 100% equity, and the example provided by the claim doesn't fit either.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because not all subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines hold 100% equity, and the example given (Taj Madras Air Catering) also does not have 100% equity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"all of the subsidiary and associate of malaysia airline be incorporated in india except taj madras air catering limit , which be not from india.\"\n\nHmm, wait, there's a typo there. It should probably say \"except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which is not from India.\" So, the claim is saying that all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are incorporated in India, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which isn't.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The table lists several companies related to Malaysia Airlines, with details like their type (subsidiary, joint venture, etc.), principal activities, incorporation country, and equity shareholding.\n\nLet me go through each row to see where \"India\" is mentioned as the incorporation country.\n\nRow 1: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 2: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 3: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 4: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 5: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 6: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 7: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 8: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 9: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 10: Incorporation in India.\nRow 11: Incorporation in Malaysia.\nRow 12: Incorporation in Malaysia.\n\nSo, only Row 10, Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, is incorporated in India. All the others, including all subsidiaries and associates, are either in Malaysia or for some other companies like LSG Sky Chefs, which is also in Malaysia.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"all of the subsidiary and associate... be incorporate in india except...\" So it's saying that all subsidiaries and associates should be in India except Taj Madras. But looking at the table, most are in Malaysia, not India.\n\nFor example, Row 1: Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary incorporated in Malaysia with 100% equity.\nRow 3-5: MASwings, Firefly, MAS Aerotechnologies, etc., all subsidiaries in Malaysia.\nRows 9 and 11 also are in Malaysia. Only Row 10 is in India.\n\nSo the claim is saying that only Taj Madras isn't in India; but wait, actually, most of them aren't in India. The majority are in Malaysia.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me clarify: The claim says \"all of the subsidiary and associate... be incorporated in india except taj madras air catering limit , which be not from india.\" So it's implying that all other subsidiaries and associates should be in India, but Taj Madras isn't. But from the table, most are in Malaysia, so this would mean that the claim is incorrect because it's claiming that all except Taj Madras are in India, but in reality, they're mostly in Malaysia.\n\nWait, no. Let me parse the claim again: \"all of the subsidiary and associate... be incorporated in india except taj madras air catering limit , which be not from india.\" So the structure is that all subsidiaries and associates (of Malaysia Airlines) are in India except Taj Madras, which isn't.\n\nBut looking at the table, only Taj Madras is in India. All others, including the subsidiaries, are in Malaysia. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims that all subsidiaries and associates are in India except Taj Madras, but actually, they're mostly in Malaysia.\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure: The claim says \"all of the subsidiary and associate... be incorporate in india except...\" So it's saying that all except Taj Madras should be in India. But the table shows that most are not; they're in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly states that only Taj Madras isn't incorporated in India, when in reality, most of them are in Malaysia and only one (Taj Madras) is in India.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The term \"associate\" might refer to something else. Looking at Row 10: type is associate, principal activities catering, incorporated in India with equity 20%. So that's the only associate in India.\n\nRows 1-12: Most are subsidiaries or joint venture, etc., but all their incorporation countries are either Malaysia (most) or India (only Taj Madras).\n\nSo the claim says \"all of the subsidiary and associate... be incorporate in india except taj madras air catering limit , which be not from india.\" But in reality, only Taj Madras is in India; all others are in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it claims that only Taj Madras isn't in India, but actually, most of them (including all subsidiaries) are in Malaysia. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Malaysia airline have equal equity in each subsidy.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Malaysia Airlines has an equal share or equity in each of their subsidiaries listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several companies under the \"group 's equity shareholding\" column. For example, Row 1 says Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd is a subsidiary with 100% equity. Similarly, other companies like MASwings and Firefly also have 100% equity. Then there are companies like Taj Madras Air Catering Limited which is an associate with 20% equity, and LSG Sky Chefs as an associate with 30%. \n\nWait, the claim specifically mentions \"Malaysia airline\" having equal equity in each subsidy. From the table, it seems that most subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines have 100% equity. However, there are also companies like Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and LSG Sky Chefs which are associates but not subsidiaries with lower equity percentages\u201420% and 30%, respectively.\n\nSo, if the claim is about equal equity in each subsidy (i.e., each subsidiary), then it's true because all subsidiaries listed have 100% equity. But if \"subsidy\" refers to any associated company, including associates, then it's false because some have different percentages.\n\nLooking back at the table, the term \"group 's equity shareholding\" likely refers to how much of the company is owned by the group Malaysia Airlines. Subsidiaries like MASwings and Firefly are 100%, while associates like Taj Madras Air Catering have lower ownership. Since the claim specifies \"subsidy,\" which typically means subsidiaries, it's about those with 100% equity.\n\nTherefore, all relevant cells for subsidiaries show 100%, so the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines has equal equity in each of its subsidiaries. From the table, all listed subsidiaries (Rows 1-5 and 7-8) have a 100% equity shareholding, indicating equal ownership. Therefore, the claim is true based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table contains information about various companies related to Malaysia Airlines (MAS), including their types, principal activities, incorporation details, and equity shareholding within the group.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"Malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except taj madras air catering limit.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim means. It seems to suggest that Malaysia Airlines uses all its subsidiaries for catering services, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which might be an exception.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several companies listed as subsidiaries of MAS. These include Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, GE Engine Services Malaysia, MASwings Sdn Bhd, Firefly Sdn Bhd, MAS Aerotechnologies Sdn Bhd, MAS Golden Holidays Sdn Bhd, Malaysian Aerospace Engineering Sdn Bhd, MAS Academy Sdn Bhd, Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, and Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\nEach of these subsidiaries has different principal activities. For example, Firefly and MASwings are involved in airlines, while others like GE Engine Services focus on engine overhaul, and Abacus deals with computer reservation systems. Taj Madras Air Catering is listed as an associate company with a 20% equity shareholding and principal activity as catering.\n\nThe claim mentions that Malaysia Airlines works with all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras. So I need to check if the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice two companies involved in catering: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited (Row 10) and MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd (Row 11). MAS Catering is a subsidiary with a 60% equity shareholding and principal activity as catering. Taj Madras is an associate with 20% ownership.\n\nNow, the claim says Malaysia Airlines uses all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras. But wait, there's another catering company, MAS Catering (Sarawak), which is a subsidiary. So if the claim states that only Taj Madras is excluded, but MAS Catering is included, then the claim might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be saying that all subsidiaries are used for catering except Taj Madras, meaning that even if other companies aren't involved in catering, they're still considered as subsidiaries but not used for catering. But in reality, MAS Catering is a subsidiary involved in catering, so the claim would be excluding Taj Madras while including another subsidiary.\n\nSo according to the table, both Taj Madras and MAS Catering are involved in catering activities as subsidiaries or associates. Therefore, the claim that Malaysia Airlines works with all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras might not be accurate because it's excluding a company that is actually involved in catering but perhaps at a different equity level.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that all subsidiaries except Taj Madras are used for catering. But since MAS Catering is also a subsidiary involved in catering, this would mean the claim is incorrect because it's excluding one (Taj Madras) while including another (MAS Catering).\n\nWait, but looking at the table, Row 10: Taj Madras is an associate with 20% equity and principal activity as catering. So it's not a subsidiary; it's an associate. MAS Catering in Row 11 is a subsidiary with 60% equity and same activity.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is that all subsidiaries (which are Row 1 to Row 9, except Taj Madras) are used for catering, but according to the table, only MAS Catering (Row 11) is a subsidiary involved in catering. The others like Firefly, MASwings, etc., are airlines or other activities.\n\nWait, that's another point. The principal activities vary: some are airlines, some are MRO, engineering, flight schools, computer systems, etc. Only two companies (Taj Madras and MAS Catering) are explicitly in catering.\n\nSo the claim says Malaysia Airlines uses all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras. But in reality, only MAS Catering is a subsidiary involved in catering. So the claim might be implying that all subsidiaries are used for catering, which isn't true because most of them aren't; only a few are.\n\nWait, no, the claim is specifically about catering. It says \"Malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except taj madras air catering limit.\" So it's saying that they use all their subsidiaries for catering services, but not Taj Madras.\n\nBut according to the table, only MAS Catering (Sarawak) and Taj Madras are involved in catering. So if Malaysia Airlines uses all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras, then it would mean that other subsidiaries like Firefly, MASwings, etc., are also used for catering, which doesn't align with their principal activities.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because most subsidiaries aren't involved in catering; only two companies are. So the statement that they work with all subsidiaries except Taj Madras for catering is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Malaysia Airlines utilizes all its subsidiaries for catering services except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. However, upon examining the table, only two companies are involved in catering: Taj Madras (as an associate) and MAS Catering (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd (as a subsidiary). Since the claim implies that other subsidiaries are also used for catering, which is not supported by the table, it is false.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Focus on rows where companies are subsidiaries or associates and have catering as their principal activity.\n2. **Analyze Catering Companies:** Only Taj Madras (Row 10) and MAS Catering (Row 11) are involved in catering, with MAS Catering being a subsidiary.\n3. **Assess the Claim:** The claim states that all subsidiaries except Taj Madras are used for catering. However, most subsidiaries have different principal activities and aren't involved in catering.\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim is incorrect because only specific companies are engaged in catering, not all subsidiaries.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate.\" So, it's suggesting that none of the associates listed in the table have a 30% equity shareholding from Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents different companies with their types, principal activities, incorporation details, and equity shareholding within the group. Now, the term \"Malaysia airline\" is a bit ambiguous because there are multiple companies related to Malaysia Airlines, like Malaysia Airlines Cargo Sdn Bhd, MASwings Sdn Bhd, Firefly Sdn Bhd, etc. Each of these has different equity percentages.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, there's no company named \"Malaysia airline\" directly. The closest is \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd,\" but that might not be the same as \"Malaysia airline.\" So perhaps the claim is referring to any of the companies under Malaysia Airlines holding 30% equity in their associates.\n\nLet me go through each row to see if any associate has a 30% equity shareholding from any of the subsidiaries or affiliates of Malaysia Airlines.\n\nRow 10: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, type: associate, principal activities: catering, incorporated in: India, group's equity shareholding: 20%. This is an associate but only holds 20%, so not 30%.\n\nRow 12: LSG Sky Chefs, type: associate, principal activities: holding company, equity shareholding: 30%. Wait, this one has a 30% shareholding. So does any of the subsidiaries or affiliates (Malaysia airline companies) hold this?\n\nWait, no. The 30% is for LSG Sky Chefs' equity in the group, not necessarily Malaysia Airlines having a stake in LSG Sky Chefs. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nThe structure is that each row represents an associate company within the group. So, if the group is Malaysia Airlines, then the equity shareholding refers to how much of the group they own. For example, Row 10: Taj Madras has 20% in the group, but it's incorporated in India, so maybe not directly under Malaysia Airlines.\n\nWait, actually, each company in the table seems to be part of the same larger group. So \"group 's equity shareholding\" refers to how much of the parent group they own. So for example, in Row 12: LSG Sky Chefs is an associate with 30% equity in the group.\n\nBut the claim is about Malaysia Airlines having a 30% equity shareholding in none of the associates. So we need to see if any of the associates have a 30% ownership from Malaysia Airlines (or its subsidiaries).\n\nLooking back, in Row 12: LSG Sky Chefs has 30% equity in the group. But is that equity coming from Malaysia Airlines? Or perhaps it's independent.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nThe claim is: \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate.\" So we're checking whether any associate has a 30% equity shareholding from Malaysia airline(s). \n\nLooking at each associate (rows 10 and 12):\n\n- Taj Madras Air Catering Limited: 20%\n- LSG Sky Chefs: 30%\n\nSo only LSG Sky Chefs has a 30% equity. Now, we need to see if this 30% is from Malaysia airline.\n\nWait, the table doesn't specify where each company's equity comes from; it just says \"group 's equity shareholding.\" So the group could be a larger entity that includes both Malaysia Airlines and these associates. Therefore, LSG Sky Chefs has a 30% stake in the group, but whether that comes directly from Malaysia Airlines isn't clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we're supposed to look for any associate with 30% equity shareholding where the parent is Malaysia airline.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, none of the companies listed are named \"Malaysia airline.\" The closest is \"malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd,\" which is a subsidiary. So perhaps the claim refers to whether any of the associates (Rows 10 and 12) have 30% equity from Malaysia Airlines.\n\nIn Row 12: LSG Sky Chefs has 30% in the group, but it's an associate, not necessarily a subsidiary. Also, it's incorporated in Malaysia. So if the group is Malaysia Airlines, then LSG Sky Chefs would be part of that group with 30% equity. But does that mean Malaysia Airlines (the parent) holds 30% in LSG? Or is LSG independent?\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key is to find any associate where the equity shareholding from the group is 30%, and see if it's under Malaysia Airlines.\n\nLooking at the table, only Row 12 (LSG Sky Chefs) has a 30% equity shareholding as an associate. So does that mean Malaysia airline holds 30% in LSG? Or is it part of a larger group?\n\nWait, perhaps the group refers to the entire Malaysia Airlines group. So if LSG Sky Chefs is part of that group and has 30% ownership, then Malaysia Airlines would have some equity in LSG through their group structure.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the claim is incorrect because Row 12 does have a 30% shareholding as an associate, so the statement \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate\" would be false because they do hold 30% in LSG Sky Chefs.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cell is Row 12 (row_index:11), column_name: \"group 's equity shareholding\".\n\nWait, wait. Let me check again. The claim is about Malaysia airline having 30% in none of the associates. So if any associate has 30%, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 10: 20%\n- Row 12: 30%\n\nSo yes, LSG Sky Chefs (Row 12) has a 30% equity shareholding as an associate. Therefore, the claim is false because Malaysia airline does have a 30% share in at least one associate.\n\nBut wait, does Malaysia Airlines own LSG Sky Chefs? Or is LSG independent but part of the group?\n\nI think I need to clarify: each row represents an associate within the group. So if the group is Malaysia Airlines, then the equity shareholding is how much of that group they have. Therefore, if LSG Sky Chefs has 30% in the group, it's part of Malaysia Airlines' group with that ownership.\n\nThus, the claim is false because there exists an associate (LSG) with a 30% shareholding from the group, which includes Malaysia Airlines.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"Malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in none of the associate\" is false. Specifically, LSG Sky Chefs (Row 12) holds a 30% equity shareholding as an associate within the group, indicating that Malaysia Airlines has a 30% stake in this associate.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cell:** Row 12 (row_index:11), column_name: \"group 's equity shareholding\"",
