    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"the royal house be unavailable for the state cao , chen , song , wey , and yan\". So, the claim states that the 'royal house' is unavailable for five specific states: Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, and Yan. My task is to check each of these states in the table and see if their royal house information supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a state with several attributes: state (which is the name of the state), type, name, title, and royal house. The relevant columns for checking the royal house are \"royal_house\" because that's where we need to verify the claim.\n\nNow, I'll list out the states mentioned in the claim and find their corresponding royal house in the table.\n\n1. **Cao**: Looking at Row 2: state is Cao, and the 'royal_house' is \"-\". So, it's unavailable.\n2. **Chen**: Row 3: state is Chen, and 'royal_house' is also \"-\", so unavailable.\n3. **Song**: Row 13: state is Song, and 'royal_house' is \"-\", thus unavailable.\n4. **Wey**: Row 14: state is Wey, but the 'royal_house' is \"-\", which means it's unavailable.\n5. **Yan**: Row 15: state is Yan, and the 'royal_house' is \"-\", so again unavailable.\n\nAll five states have a \"-\" in their 'royal_house' column. Since '-', according to the table, probably signifies that the royal house information isn't available or doesn't exist for that state. Therefore, the claim holds true because the royal house is indeed unavailable for all these states.\n\nI don't see any rows that contradict this. Each of the specified states has a \"-\" in 'royal_house', which aligns with the claim. So, there's no inconsistency here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"royal_house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the title be viscount for both xiong yan the elder and xiong yong\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two individuals: Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong. The claim states that both of them hold the title \"Viscount.\" So, my task is to check each of these individuals in the table and see if their titles are indeed Viscount.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different state (like cai, cao, etc.), but more importantly, it lists the type as sovereign, the name of the individual, their title, and their royal house. Since both Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong are associated with the same state \"chu,\" I should focus on rows 4 and 5.\n\nRow 4 has:\n- state: chu\n- type: sovereign\n- name: xiong yan the elder\n- title: viscount\n- royal house: mi\n\nSo, Xiong Yan the Elder is indeed a Viscount. Now, checking Row 5 for Xiong Yong:\n\nRow 5:\n- state: chu\n- type: sovereign\n- name: xiong yong\n- title: viscount\n- royal house: mi\n\nXiong Yong also holds the title of Viscount. Therefore, both individuals have the title \"viscount\" as claimed.\n\nWait a second, but I should make sure there's no mistake in row numbering. The table starts from Row 1 to Row 15. Let me count the rows again. Rows 4 and 5 are indeed for Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong respectively. So both have \"viscount\" as their title.\n\nI don't see any reason to doubt this information. The titles are clearly listed, so the claim seems to be correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong hold the title of Viscount. By examining rows 4 and 5 in the table, we confirm that both indeed have the title \"viscount.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. The claim has two parts: one about the Duke of Song and another about the Marquis of Wey. Both are supposed to have \"li\" as their name. So I should check each of these titles in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized with rows from 1 to 15. Each row represents a different state, title, and name. I need to find the specific rows where the titles \"Duke of Song\" and \"Marquis of Wey\" are mentioned.\n\nStarting with the Duke of Song: I'll scan through each row to see if any have the title \"duke\" and the state \"song\". Row 13 seems to fit: state is song, type is sovereign, name is li, and title is duke. So that's one part checked, and it does say the name is li.\n\nNow for the Marquis of Wey: I need a row where the title is \"marquis\" and the state is wey. Looking through the rows, row 14 matches this: state is wey, type is sovereign, name is li, and title is marquis. So both parts of the claim are referring to li as their respective titles in the table.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check that I'm not mixing up anything. The claim says \"li be the name for both,\" so each title should have \"li\" as the name. In row 13, it's the Duke of Song with name li, and in row 14, the Marquis of Wey also has name li. That matches perfectly.\n\nI don't see any other rows that would conflict or provide additional information that would change this conclusion. Both titles have \"li\" as their names, so the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey are named \"li\" according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that \"wu\" is NOT the Duke of Chen or Lu. So, I need to check if there's any entry in the table where \"wu\" holds the title of Duke for either the state Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- Row 1: wu has the title Marquis.\n- Rows 4 and 5: Both are from the Chu state with titles Viscount.\n- Rows 6,7,8: Jin state, with titles Marquis.\n- Rows 9: Qi state, Duke.\n- Rows 10-12: Qin state, Ruler.\n- Rows 13: Song, Duke.\n- Rows 14: Wey, Marquis.\n- Rows 15: Yan, Marquis.\n\nWait, in the table, I need to check specifically for \"wu\" in the name column and their corresponding titles when the state is Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- For Chen state (Row 3): Name is \"you\", title Duke. No wu here.\n- For Lu state (Row 8): Name is Shen, title Duke. So, does wu hold any Duke title in either Chen or Lu? It seems not.\n\nWait, the claim says that wu is NOT the Duke of either Chen or Lu. But from the table, there's no entry where wu is the Duke for Chen or Lu. In fact, looking at all rows:\n\n- The only time wu appears is in Row 1 (name: wu) with title Marquis, and Row 9 (Qi state, name: Wu, title Duke). But Qi isn't Chen or Lu.\n\nSo, since there's no instance where wu is the Duke of Chen or Lu, the claim that \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu\" would actually be TRUE because the statement is asserting that wu is not a Duke in those states, and indeed, he isn't. Therefore, the claim holds as TRUE.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. The claim says \"wu be not the duke of either chen or lu.\" So it's saying wu is not a Duke for Chen or Lu. From the table:\n\n- For Chen state (Row 3), name: you, title Duke.\n- For Lu state (Row 8), name: shen, title Duke.\n\nNeither of these are \"wu,\" so indeed, wu isn't a Duke in either Chen or Lu. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because it correctly states that wu is not holding the Duke title for those states.\n\nBut wait another angle: The claim could be phrased as \"wu be not the duke of either chen OR lu,\" meaning in both. Since it's an OR condition, if wu isn't a Duke in Chen or Lu individually, then the statement holds.\n\nAlternatively, if the structure was different, but based on the table, it seems clear that wu is not a Duke in either state mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"wu\" is not a Duke for either Chen or Lu. Checking the table, there's no entry where \"wu\" holds the title of Duke in those states.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the royal house be ji for the state jin , which have both jing and xi.\"\n\nBreaking this down, it mentions two things:\n1. The royal house for the state Jin is Ji.\n2. Within the state Jin, there are titles or names of individuals with the names Jing and Xi.\n\nFirst, I should verify if the royal house for Jin is indeed Ji. Looking at the table, rows correspond to different states. Let's find the row for state Jin.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Row 6: state: jin, type: sovereign, name: jing, title: marquis, royal house: ji.\n- Row 7: state: jin, type: sovereign, name: xi, title: marquis, royal house: ji.\n\nSo both entries for Jin have their royal house as Ji. That checks out the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check if there are individuals in the Jin state with names Jing and Xi. From the table:\n- Row 6 is jing.\n- Row 7 is xi.\n\nBoth these people are listed under state Jin, which supports the second part of the claim that both jing and xi exist within Jin.\n\nWait, but looking at the table's column structure: each row has state, type, name, title, royal house.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the royal house being available for the states of Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, and Yan is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part means.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. Each row represents a state, with columns like \"state\", \"type\", \"name\", \"title\", and \"royal house\". The claim says that for these five states (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, Yan), their \"royal house\" is available. So I need to check the \"royal house\" column for each of these states in the table.\n\nStarting with Cao: Looking at row 2, the state is Cao, and the royal house is listed as \"-\". Hmm, that might mean something specific. Maybe \"-\" indicates no information or not applicable? If so, does that count as available? I'm not sure yet.\n\nNext, Chen: Row 3 lists the state as Chen with a royal house of \"-\". Similar to Cao, this could be a blank or missing data. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nSong: Row 13 is Song, and the royal house is also \"-\". Again, similar situation.\n\nWey: Row 14 is Wey, but there's no entry for the royal house; it's \"-\".\n\nYan: Row 15 lists Yan with a \"-\" for the royal house as well.\n\nSo all five states have \"-\", which might indicate that their royal houses aren't specified or don't exist in this table. Does having a \"-\" mean they don't have a royal house, making the claim false? Or maybe it's just not listed here, and I should assume they do have royal houses?\n\nI need to check if any of these states have a non-empty \"royal house\" entry that might support the claim. But in the given table, all five states (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, Yan) have \"-\" for their royal house. None of them have a different value like \"ji\", \"ying\", or others mentioned in other rows.\n\nIf the claim is about whether the royal house is \"available\" for these states, and \"available\" means it's present and listed, then since all five have \"-\", they might not have an available royal house as per this table. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because none of them have a valid royal house specified.\n\nAlternatively, if \"-\" signifies that their royal house is considered available (like a default or no specific house), then it could be TRUE. But based on the context, I think \"-\" likely means no information or not applicable, which doesn't support the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the title be viscount for only xiong yan the elder and xiong yong.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. Looking at the table, each row has information about different states, types, names, titles, and royal houses. My goal is to check if the claim holds true based on this data.\n\nThe claim specifies that only two people have the title \"viscount\": Xiong Yan the Elder and Xiong Yong. So I need to look through each row of the table to see who has the title \"viscount.\"\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Title is marquis.\nRow 2: Title is count.\nRow 3: Title is duke.\nRow 4: Title is viscount (Xiong Yan the Elder).\nRow 5: Title is viscount (Xiong Yong).\nRow 6: Marquis.\nRow 7: Marquis.\nRow 8: Duke.\nRow 9: Duke.\nRow 10: Marquis.\nRow 11: Ruler.\nRow 12: Ruler.\nRow 13: Duke.\nRow 14: Marquis.\nRow 15: Marquis.\n\nSo from this, I can see that rows 4 and 5 have the title \"viscount.\" That's exactly the two people mentioned in the claim.

Looking through all the rows again, I don't see any other entries with \"viscount.\" So the claim seems accurate.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: The columns related here are \"title\" and possibly \"name,\" but since the claim is about titles, the key column is \"title.\" So each row where the title is viscount should be noted.

The claim says, \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that \"li\" is not used as a name exclusively for two specific titles: Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. So I need to check if in the table, \"li\" appears only in those two contexts or elsewhere as well.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a state with various attributes: type (sovereign), name, title, and royal house. My focus should be on the 'name' column because that's where the claim refers to \"li.\" \n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Name is wu.\nRow 2: Name is yi.\nRow 3: Name is you.\nRow 4: Name is xiong yan the elder.\nRow 5: Name is xiong yong.\nRow 6: Name is jing.\nRow 7: Name is xi.\nRow 8: Name is shen.\nRow 9: Name is wu.\nRow 10: Name is marquis (wait, that's a title, not a name. Hmm.)\nRow 11: Name is gongbo.\nRow 12: Name is qin zhong.\nRow 13: Name is li. Here we go, first occurrence of \"li\" in the 'name' column for Song state.\nRow 14: Name is li. Second occurrence, now for Wey state.\nRow 15: Name is hui.\n\nWait, so rows 13 and 14 have \"li\" as their names. The claim says that \"li\" is not the name for only those two titles. But according to the table, there are exactly two instances where \"li\" is used as a name: Duke of Song (Row 13) and Marquis of Wey (Row 14). So does that mean the claim is false because it's actually true? Or is the claim asserting that \"li\" isn't only for those two, implying it appears elsewhere too.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So if \"li\" appears as a name in exactly those two contexts, then the statement would be false because it is indeed used for only those two. But according to the table, yes, rows 13 and 14 have \"li\" as the name.\n\nBut wait, row 10 has 'name' as marquis, which is a title, not a name. So in terms of names, \"li\" appears twice: once for Song and once for Wey. Therefore, the claim says that \"li\" is not used only for those two, but according to the table, it's exactly those two. So the claim would be false because it's used for only those two.\n\nWait no, the claim is phrased as \"li be not the name for only...\" which might mean that \"li\" is not a name exclusive to those two. But if in reality, it is used only for those two, then the claim would actually be true because li is indeed only for Song and Wey. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me parse the claim again: \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" So does that mean that \"li\" is not the name used exclusively for those two titles? Or does it mean that \"li\" is a name that isn't limited to just those two?\n\nIn the table, \"li\" appears as the name for Song (Duke) and Wey (Marquis). So if the claim says li is not the name only for these two, then since in reality, li is exactly used for these two, the statement would be false. Because it's saying that li is not a name that's exclusive to those two. But actually, it is.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. The claim says \"li be not the name for only...\" which might mean that \"li\" cannot or does not serve as a name only for those titles. But in reality, li is used exactly for those two. So the statement would be false because li is indeed a name for only those two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is asserting that \"li\" is not a name that applies exclusively to Song and Wey, implying that it's also used elsewhere. But looking at the table, there are no other instances of \"li\" as a name except in rows 13 and 14.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"li be not the name for only...\" but in reality, li is the name for exactly those two. So the statement would be false because it's asserting that li isn't used for only those two, but in fact it is.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again: The claim is a bit confusingly phrased. It could mean that \"li\" is not exclusive to those titles, implying it's also used elsewhere. But according to the table, there are exactly two rows where name is li. So if the claim says that \"li\" is not a name for only those two, meaning that it can be elsewhere as well, then the claim would be false because in reality, it's only used for those two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check each cell where 'name' is li. They are rows 13 and 14, both with title: duke (Song) and marquis (Wey). So the claim says that \"li\" is not the name for only those two. But it's actually used for exactly those two. Therefore, the claim is false because it claims that li isn't a name exclusive to them, but in reality, it is.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim could mean that \"li\" cannot be a name that's limited to just those two titles. But if it's used only for those two, then the statement would be saying it's not a name for only them, which would be incorrect. So the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is asserting that \"li\" is not a name, but in reality, it is. Wait no, because rows 13 and 14 have 'name' as li.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is to check if \"li\" appears only for those two titles or elsewhere. In the table, yes, only those two. So the claim says that \"li be not the name for only...\" but in reality, it is used only for those two, so the statement would be false.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The claim's structure: \"li be not the name for only X and Y.\" Which could mean that li cannot be a name restricted to X and Y. So if li is indeed only a name for X and Y, then the statement would be false because it claims that li isn't a name used exclusively for them.\n\nTherefore, since in reality, li is exactly a name for those two titles, the statement would be false.\n\nSo the final answer is that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **false**. In the table provided, \"li\" appears as the name for both the Duke of Song (Row 13) and the Marquis of Wey (Row 14). Therefore, it is indeed used exclusively for those two titles, making the statement incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because \"li\" is used as a name for only the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the table data.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu.\" This means I'm looking for instances where \"wu\" holds the title of Duke in either the Chen or Lu states. \n\nI'll go through each row to find relevant information:\n\n1. **Row 1**: state: cai, type: sovereign, name: wu, title: marquis, royal house: ji.\n   - Here, \"wu\" is a name with the title of Marquis in state Cai.\n\n2. **Row 4**: state: chu, type: sovereign, name: xiong yan the elder, title: viscount, royal house: mi.\n   - \"xiong yan the elder\" is not \"wu,\" so this doesn't apply.\n\n3. **Row 5**: state: chu, type: sovereign, name: xiong yong, title: viscount, royal house: mi.\n   - Again, not relevant as it's another person.\n\n4. **Row 6**: state: jin, type: sovereign, name: jing, title: marquis, royal house: ji.\n   - \"jing\" is the name here, so this doesn't mention \"wu.\"\n\n5. **Row 7**: state: jin, type: sovereign, name: xi, title: marquis, royal house: ji.\n   - Not relevant as it's about Xi.\n\n6. **Row 8**: state: lu, type: sovereign, name: shen, title: duke, royal house: ji.\n   - Here, in Lu state, the name is \"shen\" with the title of Duke.\n\n7. **Row 9**: state: qi, type: sovereign, name: wu, title: duke, royal house: jiang.\n   - This row mentions \"wu\" as the name with the title of Duke in Qi state.\n\n8. **Rows 10-12**: These are about Qin state and don't mention \"wu.\"\n\n9. **Row 13**: state: song, type: sovereign, name: li, title: duke, royal house: -.\n   - Not relevant as it's Li.\n\n10. **Row 14**: state: wey, type: sovereign, name: li, title: marquis, royal house: -.\n    - Doesn't apply to \"wu.\"\n\n11. **Row 15**: state: yan, type: sovereign, name: hui, title: marquis, royal house: -.\n    - Not relevant.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim again: \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu.\" \n\nFrom the table:\n- In Chen state (Row 3), the name is \"you\" with the title of Duke. So \"wu\" isn't here.\n- In Lu state (Row 8), the title is Duke, but the name is \"shen,\" not \"wu.\"\n- However, in Qi state (Row 9), \"wu\" holds the title of Duke.\n\nSo, \"wu\" is a Duke, but only in Qi, not Chen or Lu. The claim says \"both chen or lu,\" which are two separate states. Since \"wu\" isn't a Duke in Chen or Lu, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu,\" we need to check if \"wu\" holds the title of Duke in both Chen and Lu states.\n\n1. **Chen State (Row 3)**: The name listed is \"you,\" not \"wu.\" Therefore, no relevant data here.\n2. **Lu State (Row 8)**: The name is \"shen,\" not \"wu.\"\n\nSince \"wu\" isn't a Duke in either Chen or Lu, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin , which do not have either jing and xi.\" Hmm, that's a bit convoluted. Let me parse it. It seems to be saying two things:\n\n1. The royal house for the state Jin is not Ji.\n2. The state Jin does not have either JIng or Xi.\n\nSo I need to check both these statements against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different state and provides details like type (sovereign), name of the ruler, their title, and their royal house. The relevant columns here are \"state\", \"royal house\", \"name\", etc.\n\nFirst, let's find all rows where the state is Jin. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 6: state: jin, royal house: ji.\n- Row 7: state: jin, royal house: ji.\n\nSo both instances of Jin have a royal house of Ji. Now, according to the claim, the royal house for Jin should not be Ji. But in reality, it is Ji in both cases. So that directly contradicts the first part of the claim.\n\nAdditionally, the second part says that Jin does not have either JIng or Xi as rulers. Let's look at the names in the Jin rows:\n\n- Row 6: name: jing\n- Row 7: name: xi\n\nSo, yes, the state Jin has rulers named Jing and Xi. Therefore, it does have both JIng and Xi.\n\nPutting this together, both parts of the claim are incorrect. The royal house is Ji for Jin, not something else, and Jin does have both JIng and Xi as rulers.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
