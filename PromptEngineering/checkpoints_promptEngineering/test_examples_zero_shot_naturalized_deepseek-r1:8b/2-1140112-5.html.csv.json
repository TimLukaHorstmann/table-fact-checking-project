    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"iv glover trophy be one of 2 race in the goodwood circuit in the 1956 formula one season.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It's a list of races with various details like race name, circuit, date, winning driver, and constructor. Each row is a different race. \n\nThe claim mentions \"iv glover trophy\" as one of two races at the Goodwood circuit in the 1956 F1 season. So I need to find if Goodwood hosted two races that year where the IV Glover Trophy was one of them.\n\nLooking through each row, I see that the circuit for some races is Goodwood. Let's go through the rows:\n\nRow 2: race name \"iv glover trophy\", circuit \"goodwood\". That's one race.\nNow, I need to find another race at Goodwood in 1956. But wait, the table doesn't specify the year of each race. Oh, that might be a problem because the claim refers to 1956.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't provided any specific years for the races beyond what's in the dates. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I need to look at all the Goodwood races and see if there are two of them in 1956, including the IV Glover Trophy.\n\nBut in the table, there are multiple Goodwood circuits:\n\nRow 2: IV Glover Trophy (Goodwood)\nRow 10: II Sussex Trophy (Goodwood)\n\nSo that's two races at Goodwood. However, I don't know if these were both in 1956 because the dates provided go from February to October but don't specify the year. For example, Row 2 is on April 2, which might be 1956, and Row 10 is September 8, possibly 1956 as well.\n\nIf both of these races occurred in 1956, then there are two races at Goodwood that year, including the IV Glover Trophy. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE because it says there are two races, and the IV Glover Trophy is one of them.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact years from the table, I'm assuming both races were in 1956. The dates given are 2 April and 8 September, which could be 1956. So it's possible that both these races happened in that year, making two races at Goodwood. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"iv glover trophy\" is one of two races at the Goodwood circuit in the 1956 F1 season, we check the relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 2**: race name \"iv glover trophy\", circuit \"goodwood\".\n- **Row 10**: race name \"ii sussex trophy\", circuit \"goodwood\".\n\nThese are both at Goodwood. Assuming their dates (2 April and 8 September) were in 1956, there are indeed two races that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"race name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"race name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"maserati be the highest - occur constructor in the 1956 formula one season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the related instructions. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Maserati was the highest occurring constructor in the 1956 Formula One season. So, I need to check if Maserati had the most wins or perhaps appeared more frequently as a constructor in races during that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a race with details like race name, circuit, date, winning driver, and constructor. The claim is about constructors, specifically Maserati's occurrence. So I need to look for all the rows where the constructor is Maserati and see if they are the most frequent.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Constructor is Lancia - Ferrari\nRow 2: Constructor is Maserati\nRow 3: Constructor is Lancia - Ferrari\nRow 4: Constructor is Maserati\nRow 5: Constructor is Vanwall\nRow 6: Constructor is Gordini\nRow 7: Constructor is Maserati\nRow 8: Constructor is Maserati\nRow 9: Constructor is Maserati\nRow 10: Constructor is Cooper - Climax\nRow 11: Constructor is Connaught - Alta\n\nNow, let's count how many times Maserati appears as the constructor:\n\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n- Row 7: 1\n- Row 8: 1\n- Row 9: 1\n\nThat's a total of 5 times. Now, I need to see if there are other constructors with higher occurrences.\n\nLooking through the other constructors:\n\n- Lancia - Ferrari appears in Rows 1 and 3: 2 times\n- Vanwall: once (Row 5)\n- Gordini: once (Row 6)\n- Cooper - Climax: once (Row 10)\n- Connaught - Alta: once (Row 11)\n\nNone of the other constructors appear more than Maserati's 5 times. So, Maserati indeed had the highest occurrence as a constructor in the races listed here.\n\nBut wait, I should consider whether these rows represent all the races in the 1956 season or just some. The table doesn't specify the year for each race, only the date. For example, row 1 has date 5 February, which could be 1956, but without knowing the exact years, it's unclear if all these races took place in 1956.\n\nHowever, assuming that all these races are from 1956, Maserati would have the highest occurrence as a constructor. If not, then maybe the claim isn't fully supported because the table doesn't specify the year for each race. But given the information at hand and the need to proceed with the data provided, I can only go based on the dates. Alternatively, if all races in 1956 are included here, then Maserati is leading.\n\nTherefore, based on the count from the table, Maserati has the highest occurrence as a constructor.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"maserati be the highest - occur constructor in the 1956 formula one season\" is supported by the table data. Maserati appears as the constructor in five races, more than any other constructor listed.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"2 of the race in the 1956 formula one season be hold in may.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that there were two races in May 1956. So, I need to look into each row and check if the date is May (5th month) for exactly two races.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a race with details like race name, circuit, date, winning driver, constructor, and report. The dates are given as day-month-year format, but in this case, only the month part is relevant because the claim is about May.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones have races in May 1956.\n\nRow 1: Date is February (2). Doesn't match.\nRow 2: April (4). No.\nRow 3: April. No.\nRow 4: April. No.\nRow 5: May (5). Yes, that's one.\nRow 6: May. That's two.\nRow 7: June. No.\nRow 8: July. No.\nRow 9: August. No.\nRow 10: September. No.\nRow 11: October. No.\n\nSo, rows 5 and 6 have races in May. That makes two races in May, which matches the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. \n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row that has a May date is relevant.

The claim is: \"the Lancia - Ferrari constructor occurs more often than the Gordini constructor.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The constructors are essentially the teams that built the cars. In the table, each row represents a race with details like race name, circuit, date, winning driver, and constructor. \n\nI need to count how many times Lancia - Ferrari appears as the constructor in the races listed. Then, do the same for Gordini. If Lancia - Ferrari occurs more frequently than Gordini, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Constructor is Lancia - Ferrari\nRow 3: Constructor is Lancia - Ferrari\nThat's two times.\n\nNow checking for Gordini:\nRow 6: Constructor is Gordini. So that's one occurrence.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other instances.

The claim says that the Caen Circuit is not as commonly used as the Aintree Circuit in that season.\n\nFirst, I should check what each row represents. Each row has a race name, circuit, date, winning driver, constructor, and report. So, for this task, I'm mainly interested in the circuits: which races were held at Caen and Aintree during the 1956 season.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Circuit is Mendoza - not relevant.\nRow 2: Goodwood - irrelevant.\nRow 3: Syracuse - irrelevant.\nRow 4: Aintree. So, Aintree was used here on April 21.\nRow 5: Silverstone - irrelevant.\nRow 6: Posillipo - irrelevant.\nRow 7: Aintree again on June 24.\nRow 8: Snetterton - irrelevant.\nRow 9: Caen on August 26.\nRow 10: Goodwood - irrelevant.\nRow 11: Brands Hatch - irrelevant.\n\nSo, from the table, in 1956, there were two races at Aintree and one race at Caen. The claim is that Caen isn't as commonly used as Aintree, which seems to be true because Aintree had more races (2 vs. 1).\n\nI need to find the relevant cells for this analysis.

The claim is: \"iv glover trophy be one of 2 race in the mendoza circuit in the 1956 formula one season.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts.\n\nThe key elements are:\n1. The race name is \"iv glover trophy.\"\n2. This race should be one of two races held at the Mendoza circuit.\n3. It should take place during the 1956 Formula One season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go through each row to find the relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 1: race name is \"x gran premio ciudad de buenos aires,\" which doesn't match our target race name.\n\nRow 2: race name is \"iv glover trophy.\" This matches. The circuit is Goodwood, not Mendoza. So this row doesn't support the claim regarding the Mendoza circuit.\n\nRow 3: race name is \"vi gran premio di siracusa,\" which doesn't match.\n\nRow 4: race name is \"xi barc aintree 200.\" Not matching.\n\nRow 5: \"vii brdc international trophy\" at Silverstone. No match.\n\nRow 6: \"ix gran premio di napoli\" at Posillipo. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 7: \"i aintree 100\" at Aintree. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: \"i vanwall trophy\" at Snetterton. No.\n\nRow 9: \"iv grand prix de caen\" at Caen. Doesn't apply.\n\nRow 10: \"ii sussex trophy\" at Goodwood. No match.\n\nRow 11: \"i brscc formula 1 race\" at Brands Hatch. Not relevant.\n\nSo, from the table, only Row 2 is about the \"iv glover trophy.\" However, its circuit is Goodwood, not Mendoza. Additionally, I need to check if it's in the 1956 season. The dates provided are:\n\nRow 2: April 2. Looking at real historical data, the 1956 Formula One season did have a race called the Glover Trophy, but I'm not sure exactly when it was held. However, Mendoza Circuit wasn't active in 1956; the first race there was in 1953 as the Gran Premio del Mundo. So, the Mendoza circuit didn't host two races in 1956.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there were any other races at Mendoza in 1956. From what I know, Mendoza Circuit had several races from 1952 onwards but not necessarily two in 1956. Also, the claim specifies that the \"iv glover trophy\" is one of two races there, which isn't accurate because the Glover Trophy was usually held elsewhere.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The table shows that the \"iv glover trophy\" was a race in 1956 (since its date is April 2, 1956), but it wasn't at Mendoza. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"race name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"maserati be the lowest - occur constructor in the 1956 formula one season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Maserati was the lowest occurring constructor in the 1956 Formula One season. So I need to check if Maserati had the fewest wins or appearances compared to other constructors that year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a race with details like race name, circuit, date, winning driver, and the constructor. The claim is about the 1956 season, so I need to filter the rows to only include races from that year.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't have a year column. Hmm, that's an issue. So maybe the user made a mistake or perhaps the data isn't structured properly. Alternatively, perhaps all these races are from different years, and I can infer based on the constructors and drivers known for 1956.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants me to look at the constructors mentioned in the table and see their occurrence relative to Maserati. Let's list out the constructors in each row:\n\nRow 1: Lancia - Ferrari\nRow 2: Maserati\nRow 3: Lancia - Ferrari\nRow 4: Maserati\nRow 5: Vanwall\nRow 6: Gordini\nRow 7: Maserati\nRow 8: Maserati\nRow 9: Maserati\nRow 10: Cooper - Climax\nRow 11: Connaught - Alta\n\nSo the constructors involved are Lancia-Ferrari, Maserati, Vanwall, Gordini, Maserati (again), Cooper-Climax, and Connaught-Alta.\n\nNow, the claim is about Maserati being the lowest occurring constructor. So I need to count how many times each constructor appears as a winner in these races. Since all rows are from different dates, perhaps they're spread across multiple years, but the claim is specifically about 1956.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes races from 1956, but without date columns, it's hard to confirm. Alternatively, if I assume that the earliest dates might correspond to 1956, like February and April could be part of that season.\n\nLooking at Row 1: 5 February \u2013 probably early 1956.\nRow 3: 15 April.\nRow 4: 21 April.\nRow 5: 5 May.\nRow 6: 6 May.\nRows after that are June, July, August, September, October. So perhaps these all fall within the 1956 season.\n\nSo I can consider all rows as races in 1956 for this analysis.\n\nNow, counting Maserati's constructors:\n\nRow 2: Maserati \u2013 1\nRow 4: Maserati \u2013 1\nRow 7: Maserati \u2013 1\nRow 8: Maserati \u2013 1\nRow 9: Maserati \u2013 1\n\nThat's a total of 5 times Maserati was the constructor in these races.\n\nNow, looking at other constructors:\n\nLancia-Ferrari: Rows 1 and 3 \u2013 2 wins.\nVanwall: Row 5 \u2013 1 win.\nGordini: Row 6 \u2013 1 win.\nCooper-Climax: Row 10 \u2013 1 win.\nConnaught-Alta: Row 11 \u2013 1 win.\n\nSo, Maserati appears more times than any other constructor in these races. Therefore, it's not the lowest; instead, it's one of the higher occurring constructors.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lowest\" and \"occur\", so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is that Maserati was the least frequent constructor in terms of wins? But from my count, Maserati actually had more constructor wins than others except for Lancia-Ferrari, which had 2.\n\nBut wait, other constructors like Gordini, Cooper-Climax, Vanwall, and Connaught-Alta each have only one win. So if Maserati had 5 wins, that's higher than the rest. Therefore, they weren't the lowest; they were among the highest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about participation rather than wins. If I count how many constructors participated, excluding Maserati:\n\nLancia-Ferrari (2 races), Maserati (5 races), Vanwall (1), Gordini (1), Cooper-Climax (1), Connaught-Alta (1). So Maserati was involved in 5 races, and others had only one each. So if the claim is about participation frequency, Maserati would have been more active, not less.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that Maserati had fewer constructor wins than others, but from my count, they had more. Therefore, the claim seems to be FALSE because Maserati was not the lowest occurring constructor; in fact, it was one of the higher ones.\n\nI think I've covered all possible interpretations. The data shows Maserati having more constructor wins and participation than other constructors listed, so the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"maserati be the lowest - occur constructor in the 1956 formula one season\" is FALSE because Maserati appears more frequently as a winning constructor compared to others in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that Lancia-Ferrari occurs less often than Gordini. To check this, I need to count how many times each constructor appears in the winning driver's column of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a race name, circuit, date, winning driver, and constructor. So the relevant columns for checking are \"winning driver\" (since we're looking at constructors) and \"constructor.\"\n\nI need to go through each row and tally the occurrences of Lancia-Ferrari and Gordini in the constructor column.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Constructor: Lancia - Ferrari\nRow 3:\n- Constructor: Lancia - Ferrari\nSo that's two times for Lancia-Ferrari.\n\nNow, looking for Gordini. I'll scan each row's constructor:\n\nRow 6 has Gordini as the constructor. So that's one occurrence so far.\n\nWait, are there more? Let me check all rows again.\n\nRows:\n1: Lancia - Ferrari\n2: Maserati\n3: Lancia - Ferrari\n4: Maserati\n5: Vanwall\n6: Gordini\n7: Maserati\n8: Maserati\n9: Maserati\n10: Cooper - Climax\n11: Connaught - Alta\n\nSo only Row 6 has Gordini, which is one occurrence.\n\nLancia-Ferrari appears in Rows 1 and 3, so two times. Gordini appears once.\n\nTherefore, Lancia-Ferrari occurs more often than Gordini. So the claim that it occurs less often is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells for each constructor.\n\nFor Lancia - Ferrari: rows 0 (Row 1) and 2 (Row 3). The columns are \"constructor\".\n\nFor Gordini: row 5 (Row 6), column \"constructor\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells will include these three entries.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we compared the occurrences of Lancia-Ferrari and Gordini constructors in the table. Lancia-Ferrari appeared twice, while Gordini appeared once. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the races in the 1956 Formula One season were held in May\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that every race during the 1956 F1 season took place in May. So, my task is to check each row of the table and see if all the dates listed are in May 1956.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has 11 rows, each representing a different race with details like race name, circuit, date, winning driver, constructor, etc. My focus here is on the \"date\" column to check whether all dates fall within May 1956.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Date is 5 February. That's in early 1956, but not May.\n2. **Row 2**: Date is 2 April. Also not May.\n3. **Row 3**: Date is 15 April. Still April, so not May.\n4. **Row 4**: Date is 21 April. Again, April.\n5. **Row 5**: Date is 5 May. That's within May.\n6. **Row 6**: Date is 6 May. Also in May.\n7. **Row 7**: Date is 24 June. That's after May.\n8. **Row 8**: Date is 22 July. Beyond May.\n9. **Row 9**: Date is 26 August. Definitely not May.\n10. **Row 10**: Date is 8 September. After May.\n11. **Row 11**: Date is 14 October. Also after May.\n\nFrom this analysis, most of the races took place in months other than May\u2014February, April, June, July, August, September, and October are all different from May. Only two races (Rows 5 and 6) were held in May, but the claim specifies that *all* races were held in May. \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because not every race in the 1956 season was held during May. There were races in other months as well.\n\nAdditionally, I should note which rows have dates relevant to this check. The dates in Rows 1 through 4 are all before May, so they show that some races were not in May. Rows 5 and 6 do fall in May, but the claim requires *all* races to be in May, making those two rows only partially supporting the claim.\n\nSo, in terms of relevant cells, I should include all rows where the date is not in May because they disprove the claim. That would be Rows 1 through 4 and Rows 7 to 11. However, since the claim is about whether *all* races were in May, including these dates shows that it's not true. But maybe the relevant cells should only include those that are on May? Wait, no\u2014since the claim is about all being in May, any race not in May makes the claim false, so all rows except Rows 5 and 6 would be relevant to disprove the claim.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to specify which cells are relevant. So perhaps each row's date needs to be checked against May. Therefore, all rows where the date is not May are relevant because they show that some races were held outside of May. So Rows 1 (Feb), 2 (Apr), 3 (Apr), 4 (Apr), 7 (Jun), 8 (Jul), 9 (Aug), 10 (Sep), and 11 (Oct) all have dates not in May, making them relevant.\n\nIn summary, the claim is FALSE because there were races held outside of May.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with information about various Formula One races from different years and circuits. The claim is that the Caen Circuit was commonly used as the Aintree Circuit in the 1956 Formula One season. My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's suggesting that during the 1956 season, the Caen Circuit was substituted for Aintree Circuit in some races. So, I should look for any reference to either \"Caen Circuit\" and \"Aintree Circuit\" in the same context within the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns: race name, circuit, date, winning driver, constructor, report. The key here is to find rows where the circuit might have been Aintree but was referred as Caen, or vice versa, especially if it's specific to 1956.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 1: Circuit is Mendoza. No relevance.\nRow 2: Goodwood. Not related.\nRow 3: Syracuse. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Aintree. This is the actual Aintree Circuit. So I'll note this as a possible reference.\nRow 5: Silverstone. Not relevant.\nRow 6: Posillipo, which is another circuit in Italy. No match.\nRow 7: Aintree again. Another race at Aintree.\nRow 8: Snetterton. No match.\nRow 9: Caen Circuit. This is the first mention of Caen. So this might be relevant if it's related to Aintree substitution.\nRow 10: Goodwood again. No.\nRow 11: Brands Hatch. Not relevant.\n\nSo, rows 4 and 7 are at Aintree Circuit, which is the actual circuit in question. Then row 9 is about Caen Circuit. Now, I need to check if there's a race at Aintree that was referred as Caen or vice versa, especially in 1956.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, all the dates are spread across different months and years. For example, row 4 is April 21, and row 9 is August 26, which would be 1956 if the year isn't specified. Wait, actually, in the table, the date doesn't mention the year\u2014just the day and month.\n\nBut the claim is about the 1956 season. So maybe rows from that time period are relevant. However, without the exact years in the table, I can only go by the data given. \n\nLooking at row 4: XI Barc Aintree 200 on April 21\u2014this might be a 1956 race because many historical races around that time were in April or May.\n\nRow 7: I Aintree 100 on June 24, which would also be 1956 if it's part of the same season.\n\nRow 9: IV Grand Prix de Caen on August 26\u2014could this have been a substitute for Aintree?\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is that Caen was used as Aintree in 1956. If row 9 is about Caen and rows 4 and 7 are about Aintree, maybe during 1956 some races were held at Caen instead of Aintree.\n\nBut looking at the data, I don't see any direct indication that Caen replaced Aintree specifically in 1956. The table doesn't show a direct substitution; it just lists different circuits for different races.\n\nAlso, the claim says \"commonly used as,\" implying that Caen was frequently substituted for Aintree during that season. But from the table, there's only one mention of Caen (row 9) and multiple mentions of Aintree (rows 4,7). There's no evidence that in 1956, Aintree was replaced by Caen.\n\nSo, without any specific reference to a substitution or a race where Caen stood in for Aintree in the same year, I can't confirm the claim. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
