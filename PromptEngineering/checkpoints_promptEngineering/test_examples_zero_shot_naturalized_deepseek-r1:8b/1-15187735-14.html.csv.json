    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim is: \"segment c for netflix s07e05 show as sandwich s cookie.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of this claim refers to. The structure seems to be about a specific segment (c) in a Netflix episode (s07e05). So I need to find the row where series ep is 14 - 05 and netflix: s07e05.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row until I find the one that matches. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: series ep: 14-01... not it.\nRow 2: 14-02... nope.\nRow 3: 14-03... no.\nRow 4: 14-04... still no.\nRow 5: 14-05... yes! This is the one. So the row index is 5 (since we start counting from 0, but wait\u2014no, actually, in the table, Row 1 is the first one, so if I'm looking for series ep: 14 - 05, that's Row 5 because it starts at 14-01 as Row 1, then increments by 1 each row. So series ep: 14-05 would be Row 5.\n\nNow, within this row, the segments are a to d. The claim is about segment c. Let me check what segment c in Row 5 says. The data for Row 5 (which is episode 174) has segment c as \"sandwich s cookie.\" So that matches exactly with the claim: \"segment c... sandwich s cookie.\"\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are satisfied by this row. There's no discrepancy or inconsistency here. The relevant cells are row_index 4 (since it starts at 0) and column_name \"segment c.\" Wait, actually, in the JSON example, row_index is given as an integer, but in the table, rows are numbered starting from 1 to 12. So for series ep:14-05, which is Row 5 in the table, the row index would be 4 (since it's zero-based). \n\nWait no, hold on. The user provided the table with Row 1 being 14-01, so each increment corresponds to a row number. Therefore, 14-05 is Row 5, which would have a row_index of 4 in JSON because the first row is index 0.\n\nBut actually, looking at the example given: for instance, the first row has series ep:14 - 01, so that's row index 0. Then each subsequent row increments by 1. So yes, Row 5 corresponds to 14-05 and would be row_index 4 in the JSON.\n\nSo the relevant cells are at row_index 4, column \"segment c.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"segment c\"}]}",
