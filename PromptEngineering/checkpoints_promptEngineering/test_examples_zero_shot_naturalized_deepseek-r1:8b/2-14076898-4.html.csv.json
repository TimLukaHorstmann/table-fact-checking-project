    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first understand what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be only 2 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down, I'm looking for rows where the game outcome is a draw (drawn: 1) and the goal difference matches either 34-25 or 36-29. The claim says there should be only two such instances.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table to check for these conditions.\n\nRow 1:\n- games: 7\n- drawn: 0 \u2192 Not a draw, so skip.\nRow 2:\n- drawn: 0 \u2192 Not a draw, skip.\nRow 3:\n- drawn: 0 \u2192 Skip.\nRow 4:\n- drawn: 1 \u2192 This is a potential candidate.\n- goal difference: 34 - 25. That's one of the values mentioned in the claim. So this is one instance.\n\nRow 5:\n- drawn: 1 \u2192 Potential candidate.\n- goal difference: 36 - 29. That's another value from the claim. So that's two instances now.\n\nContinuing to check the rest for completeness, but since the claim says only two, I can stop once I find more than two or confirm exactly two.\n\nRow 6:\n- drawn: 0 \u2192 Skip.\nRow 7:\n- drawn: 0 \u2192 Skip.\nRow 8:\n- drawn: 0 \u2192 Skip.\n\nSo, only Row 4 and Row 5 meet both conditions of being a draw and having the specific goal differences. Therefore, there are exactly two occasions as per the claim.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table are relevant. The columns involved are \"drawn\" and \"goal difference\". For each relevant row, I should note their row indices and column names.\n\nSo, Row 4 has drawn=1 and goal difference=34-25.\nRow 5 has drawn=1 and goal difference=36-29.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are at row indices 4 and 5 for both \"drawn\" and \"goal difference\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by exactly two instances in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 the point be 0.\" So, they're saying that when a team has a goal difference of 11 minus 71 (which is actually -60), their points would be zero.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row and see if any of them have both a goal difference of -60 and points equal to zero.

Let me start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be never a time when point be greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the point be less than 2.\" \n\nHmm, breaking this down, it's saying two things:\n\n1. There are no instances where points are greater than 12.\n2. There is exactly one instance where points are less than 2.\n\nSo, I need to check each row in the table for these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. The columns relevant here are 'points'. So, I should focus on the 'points' column across all rows.\n\nFirst condition: Are there any rows where points > 12?\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: points = 12 \u2192 not greater than 12.\n- Row 2: points = 12 \u2192 same as above.\n- Row 3: points = 10 \u2192 no.\n- Row 4: points = 7 \u2192 no.\n- Row 5: points = 7 \u2192 no.\n- Row 6: points = 6 \u2192 no.\n- Row 7: points = 2 \u2192 no.\n- Row 8: points = 0 \u2192 no.\n\nWait, so none of the rows have points greater than 12. So the first part of the claim is true because there are zero instances where points exceed 12.\n\nNow, the second condition: Only one occurrence where points < 2.\n\nLooking for points less than 2:\n\n- Row 7 has points = 2 \u2192 that's equal to 2, not less.\n- None of the other rows have points below 2. The lowest is 0 in Row 8, but that's only one instance.\n\nSo, there's exactly one row (Row 8) where points are less than 2.\n\nPutting it together: Both conditions are met.

So, it's stating that for teams with 12 points, their goal differences are 51-10 and 40-13. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the points column equals 12. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: points=12. Their goal difference is 51 - 10.\nRow 2: points=12. Their goal difference is 40 - 13.\n\nSo both these rows have points of 12 and their respective goal differences as per the claim. That seems to support the claim fully. \n\nI should check if any other rows with 12 points exist, but from the table, only Rows 1 and 2 have points=12.

Let's break down the claim: \"there be only 2 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table to see which ones are relevant. The columns mentioned in the claim are \"point\" and \"loss.\" So I should focus on those two.\n\nNow, I need to go through each row and check for rows where both points equal 7 and losses equal 3.

Row 4 lost 3 games. That's a match! So that's one instance.\n\nMoving on, Row 5: Points are 7 as well. Let's see the losses here. It says lost 3 times. Another match.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully analyzing both.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 3 occasions when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 -25 and 36 -29.\" So, I'm looking for rows where the number of drawn games (drawn) is at least 3? Wait, no. The wording says \"3 occasion,\" which might mean exactly three instances or at least three. But actually, reading it again: \"there be 3 occasions when a team drew and it have...\" So perhaps each occurrence refers to a row where the team drew some games, and in those rows, their goal difference includes specific numbers.\n\nWait, no. Let me parse it more accurately. The claim is about two specific goal differences: 34 -25 and 36 -29. So for each of these, we need to find rows where the team drew at least three times (drawn >=3), and in those rows, check if either 34-25 or 36-29 is present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's stating that there are three instances where a team drew, each with goal differences of 34-25 and 36-29. Wait, no. The wording isn't entirely clear. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 -25 and 36 -29.\" So perhaps each of those three occasions refers to a row where the team drew (i.e., drawn is non-zero), and in that same row, their goal difference includes both 34-25 and 36-29. But that seems unlikely because each row has only one goal difference.\n\nWait, maybe it's misphrased. Maybe it's saying that there are three instances where a team drew (drawn >=1) and their goal difference is either 34-25 or 36-29. So we need to count how many rows have both: drawn >0 and goal_diff is either 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 4: games:7, drawn:1, lost:3, goal_diff:34-25, points:7.\nRow5: games:7, drawn:1, lost:3, goal_diff:36-29, points:7.\n\nSo both Row4 and Row5 have drawn=1. Are there three such rows? Let's check other rows:\n\nLooking through all rows for drawn>=1 and goal_diff is 34-25 or 36-29.\n\nRow4: yes, as above.\nRow5: yes, same.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet me list out the relevant rows:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow1: games=7, drawn=0, lost=1. So no draws.\nRow2: same as Row1.\nRow3: drawn=0.\nRow4: drawn=1, goal_diff=34-25.\nRow5: drawn=1, goal_diff=36-29.\nRow6: drawn=0.\nRow7: drawn=0.\nRow8: drawn=0.\n\nSo only Rows 4 and 5 have both drawn>=1 (specifically drawn=1) and the goal differences mentioned. So that's two rows, not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim says there are three occasions where a team drew and has these specific goal differences. But in reality, it's only two rows. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo I need to create the JSON with answer as \"FALSE\" and list the relevant cells, which are Rows4 and Row5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three instances where a team drew games and had either a goal difference of 34-25 or 36-29.

The claim says: \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 , the point be 1\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The goal difference mentioned is \"11 - 71\", which would result in a negative number since 11 is subtracted from 71. Looking at the table, each row has several columns: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to see if any match both parts of the claim. The first part is the goal difference being \"11 - 71\". So I need to find a row where goal difference equals that value. The second part says the points should be 1 when this condition is met. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: games=7, drawn=0, lost=1, GD=51-10=41, Points=12. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: GD=40-13=27, Points=12. No.\n\nRow 3: GD=41-19=22, Points=10. No.\n\nRow 4: GD=34-25=9, Points=7. No.\n\nRow 5: GD=36-29=7, Points=7. No.\n\nRow 6: GD=32-27=5, Points=6. No.\n\nRow 7: GD=17-68=-51, Points=2. Wait, but the claim says 11-71, which is -60. So no match here either.\n\nRow 8: GD=11-71=-60, Points=0. Hmm, so in row 8, GD is -60 (which is 11-71) and points are 0, not 1 as the claim states. \n\nSo there's a discrepancy. The goal difference matches \"11-71\" but the points don't match; they're 0 instead of 1.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating GD for row 8? Let me double-check: if GD is listed as \"11 -71\", that would be 11 minus 71, which is indeed -60. So yes, row 8 has GD=-60 and points=0.\n\nSo the claim says when GD is 11-71 (which is -60), points should be 1. But in reality, points are 0. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no row where GD is 11-71 and points are 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table. Let me check again. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 8: games=7, drawn=0, lost=7, GD=11-71=-60, points=0. So yes, no match for points being 1 when GD is -60.\n\nWait, but let me see if any other rows have a goal difference that could be interpreted as 11-71. Let's check row 7: GD=17-68=-51. That's not the same as -60.\n\nSo the only row with GD=11-71 is row 8, and in that case, points are 0. So the claim is incorrect because it states points should be 1 when GD is 11-71, but it's actually 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there is no row where the goal difference is \"11 - 71\" with points being 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 2 times when the point be greater than 12 and no time when the point be less than 2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll examine the 'points' column in the table for each row. Let's list out the points:\n\n- Row 1: 12\n- Row 2: 12\n- Row 3: 10\n- Row 4: 7\n- Row 5: 7\n- Row 6: 6\n- Row 7: 2\n- Row 8: 0\n\nNow, I'll check each row to see where the points are greater than 12. Looking at the data:\n\nRows 1 and 2 both have points of 12. Since 12 is equal to 12, it's not greater than 12. So, there are no rows where points exceed 12. \n\nNext, I'll check if any row has points less than 2. The lowest points in the table are 0 (Row 8) and 2 (Row 7). Since both 0 and 2 are either equal to or above 2, there are no instances where points drop below 2.\n\nSo, analyzing these two parts:\n\n1. There should be 2 times when points >12: This is FALSE because no rows have points over 12.\n2. No time when points <2: This is TRUE because all points are at least 0 or 2.\n\nHowever, the claim combines both conditions with \"and\" (if A and B are true, then...). Since the first part is false, the entire statement is false. Alternatively, if considering only the second condition being true while ignoring the first, but logically, since it's an 'and' statement, both must be true for the claim to hold.\n\nWait, no, actually the claim says \"there be 2 times when points >12 AND no time when points <2.\" So both conditions need to be met. Since there are zero times where points >12, the first condition isn't satisfied, making the entire statement false. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misinterpret it as two separate claims: 2 times with points >12 and separately, no times with points <2. If that's the case, then the claim would be false because the first part is not true (no points >12) but the second part is true (no points <2). However, the wording says \"there be 2 times...\" implying two instances where both conditions are met together? Or as separate?\n\nLooking back: The claim says \"there be 2 time when the point be greater than 12 and no time when the point be less than 2.\" So it's an 'and' between two clauses. Both must hold for the claim to be true.\n\nTherefore, since points >12 never happen (only 12 and below), the first part fails, making the entire statement false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires two instances where points exceed 12 and no instances where points drop below 2. From the table, there are zero points over 12 and all points are at least 0 or 2, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when the point be 13 , the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that when the points are 13, there are two specific goal differences: 51-10 and 40-13. So I need to check if in the table, any row has points equal to 13 and also shows these goal differences.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team with various stats: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. The rows are numbered from 1 to 8. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Points are 12. Not 13, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Points are also 12. Again, not 13.\nRow 3: Points are 10. No.\nRow 4: Points are 7.\nRow 5: Points are 7.\nRow 6: Points are 6.\nRow 7: Points are 2.\nRow 8: Points are 0.\n\nWait, none of the rows have points equal to 13. So that part of the claim might not hold because there's no row with points at 13. \n\nBut just in case I'm missing something, maybe the 'when' part is about a hypothetical scenario where points could be 13, but looking at the table, the highest points are 12 (Rows 1 and 2). So it's impossible for any team to have 13 points here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to specific goal differences when points are 13. But since no rows have points at 13, this condition isn't met in the data provided.\n\nSo the claim seems to be incorrect because there's no row with 13 points. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that when a team has 13 points, their goal differences are 51-10 and 40-13. However, inspecting the table reveals no such row with 13 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 3 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's looking for rows where the points (points column) are exactly 7 AND the lost games (lost column) are exactly 3. The claim specifies \"3 times,\" so we need at least three such instances.\n\nNow, let me look through each row of the table to find these cases.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Points are 12, which is more than 7. So no.\nRow 2: Points 12 again. Not relevant.\nRow 3: Points are 10. Not 7.\nRow 4: Points are 7. Let's check lost games: 3. So this row meets both conditions\u2014points=7 and lost=3. That's one instance.\n\nMoving on, Row 5: Points are 7 again. Lost games here are 3 as well. This is the second occurrence where points=7 and lost=3.\n\nRow 6: Points are 6. Not relevant.\nRow 7: Points are 2. Nope.\nRow 8: Points are 0. Doesn't apply.\n\nSo, I found two rows (Row 4 and Row 5) that satisfy both conditions. The claim says \"there be 3 times,\" so since there are only two instances, the claim is not fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any other rows. Let me double-check:\n\nRows 1-8: Only Rows 4 and 5 have points=7 and lost=3. So yes, only two times. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
