The claim says, \"Mark Brook be the player who earns the most money.\" First, I should check how Mark Brooks's earnings compare to others in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'money' column which lists the earnings for each player. Mark Brooks is listed in Row 1 with a money value of 430000. Let me go through the other players to see if anyone has a higher amount.\n\nRow 2: Kenny Perry - $260,000\nRow 3-4: Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles - $140,000 each\nRows 5-7: Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Vijay Singh - all at $86,667\nRows 8-13: Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, Nick Price - all at $57,500\n\nSo, Mark Brooks has the highest money value at $430,000. None of the other players have a higher amount listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"mark brook and kenny perry tie for have the lowest to par.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. It looks like it's a leaderboard from some tournament, showing each player's performance. Each row has details like their place (like 1st, 2nd, etc.), their name, country, score, to par, and money.\n\nThe claim is specifically about two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry. It says they tie for the lowest to par. So I need to check what \"to par\" means in this context. From the table, each player has a number next to \"to par,\" which seems to indicate their score relative to par. Lower scores mean better performance, as in golf.\n\nLooking at the table, Mark Brooks is Row 1 and Kenny Perry is Row 2. Their scores are both 277. The \"to par\" for both is -11. Now, I need to check if these are indeed the lowest. Let's see the other players:\n\nRow 3 and 4 have a score of 278 with -10.\nRows 5-7 (t5) have 279 with -9.\nRows 8-12 (t8) have 280 with -8.\n\nSo Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry both have the lowest to par (-11), which is better than everyone else. Therefore, their \"to par\" is lower than all others, meaning they indeed tie for the lowest.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry have the same lowest \"to par\" score of -11.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tied for the lowest \"to par.\" By examining the table, both players have a \"to par\" of -11, which is lower than all other participants. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"nick price be the only player from zimbabwe\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has 13 rows, each representing a different player with various details like their place, name, country, score, to par, and money. My main focus here is on the 'player' column and the 'country' column because the claim is about the player's nationality.\n\nThe claim states that Nick Price is the only player from Zimbabwe. So, I need to check if any other players besides Nick Price have their country listed as Zimbabwe.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mark Brooks, United States\n- Row 2: Kenny Perry, United States\n- Row 3: Steve Elkington, Australia\n- Row 4: Tommy Tolles, United States\n- Row 5: Justin Leonard, United States\n- Row 6: Jesper Parnevik, Sweden\n- Row 7: Vijay Singh, Fiji\n- Row 8: Lee Janzen, United States\n- Row 9: Per-Ulrik Johansson, Sweden\n- Row 10: Phil Mickelson, United States\n- Row 11: Larry Mize, United States\n- Row 12: Frank Nobilo, New Zealand\n- Row 13: Nick Price, Zimbabwe\n\nNow, I'll go through each player's country. Starting from the top:\n\n1. Mark Brooks is from the United States.\n2. Kenny Perry is also from the US.\n3. Steve Elkington is Australian.\n4. Tommy Tolles, same as above, US.\n5. Justin Leonard, again US.\n6. Jesper Parnevik is Swedish.\n7. Vijay Singh is from Fiji.\n8. Lee Janzen, another US player.\n9. Per-Ulrik Johansson is Swedish.\n10. Phil Mickelson is US.\n11. Larry Mize, same as above, US.\n12. Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand.\n13. Nick Price is the only one from Zimbabwe.\n\nSo, in all 13 rows, only Row 13 lists a player from Zimbabwe, and that's Nick Price. There are no other players with the country \"Zimbabwe.\" Therefore, the claim seems to be true because Nick Price is indeed the sole player from Zimbabwe in this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there is only one player, Nick Price, listed as being from Zimbabwe.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"frank nobilo be the only player from new zealand.\" \n\nFirst, I should carefully check each row of the table to see if there's any other player from New Zealand besides Frank Nobilo.\n\nLooking through the table, each row has details about a player, their place, country, score, and money. The key columns here are 'player' and 'country'.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Mark Brooks is from the United States.\nRow 2: Kenny Perry is also from the U.S.\nRow 3: Steve Elkington is Australian.\nRow 4: Tommy Tolles is American.\nRow 5: Justin Leonard, another American.\nRow 6: Jesper Parnevik from Sweden.\nRow 7: Vijay Singh from Fiji.\nRow 8: Lee Janzen, American.\nRows 9 and 10: Per-Ulrik Johansson from Sweden.\nRow 11: Phil Mickelson, U.S.\nRow 12: Larry Mize, American.\nRow 13: Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand listed here.\n\nSo, in the entire table, Frank Nobilo is the sole player with a country of New Zealand. There are no other players from New Zealand mentioned. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because he's alone in that category.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the row where Frank Nobilo is listed and the 'country' column since we're checking his country against others. Looking at Row 12: place t8, player Frank Nobilo, country New Zealand.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are Row 12's 'country' column and perhaps any other rows that might have a New Zealander, but since none exist, only Row 12 is needed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand in the table. Checking each row, only Frank Nobilo's country is listed as New Zealand. No other players share this nationality.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** We need to check which players are from New Zealand.\n2. **Scan Each Row:** Look at the 'player' and 'country' columns for each row.\n3. **Find Frank Nobilo:** Found in Row 12 as the only player from New Zealand.\n4. **Check Others:** No other players share this nationality.\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim is TRUE because Frank Nobilo is indeed the sole player from New Zealand.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Only Row 12's 'country' column is relevant since it's the sole entry for New Zealand.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

For Kenny Perry (Row 2), his money is listed as $260,000. For Mark Brooks (Row 1), it's $430,000. \n\nThe claim says Kenny earned $170,000 less than Mark. So I should calculate the difference between Mark's and Kenny's earnings. Let me subtract Kenny's money from Mark's: 430,000 - 260,000 equals 170,000. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI don't see any other players mentioned in the claim, so only their rows (1 and 2) are relevant.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that Kenny Perry earns the most money among all the players listed. To verify this, I'll need to look at the \"money\" column for each player's row and compare their earnings. The highest amount should be associated with Kenny Perry if the claim is true.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different player with details like place, player name, country, score, to par, and money earned. I need to focus on the \"money\" column specifically for Kenny Perry's row.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find Kenny Perry's data. Starting from Row 1: Mark Brooks. Then Row 2: Kenny Perry. There it is\u2014Kenny Perry is in Row 2 with a money value of 260,000.\n\nNext, I should check the other players to ensure that no one else has a higher amount than Kenny. Let's go through each player:\n\n- Row 3 and 4 are Steve Elkington and Tommy Tolles, both at 140,000.\n- Rows 5, 6, 7 have Justine Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, and Vijay Singh, all at 86,667.\n- Rows 8 to 12 (Lee Janzen, Per-Ulrik Johansson, Phil Mickelson, Larry Mize, Frank Nobilo, Nick Price) are at 57,500 each.\n\nComparing these, the highest amount is indeed Kenny Perry's 260,000. None of the other players have a higher money value than that. Therefore, the claim that Kenny Perry earns the most money seems to be true.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant for verification. Since I'm focusing on the \"money\" column specifically for Kenny Perry, that's the key cell to check. So, in the table, Kenny Perry is in Row 2, and we look at the \"money\" column for that row.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to compare Kenny Perry's earnings with those of all other players.

Looking at Row 1, it's Mark Brooks with a score of 277 and a \"to par\" of -11. In Row 2, Kenny Perry also has a score of 277 and a \"to par\" of -11. So they both have the same score and the same to-par value.\n\nNext, I need to check if any other players in the table have a lower to-par than -11. The lowest to-par is considered better, so if no one has a lower number than -11, then Mark and Kenny are tied for the lowest.\n\nLooking through the rest of the table: Row 3 shows Steve Elkington with -10, Rows 4-7 also have -10 or worse. Starting from Row 8 onwards, most players have to-par values starting at -8 and going down. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the \"to par\" for Mark and Kenny is -11, which is better (lower) than others.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. The lower the number, the better, right? So if someone has -12, that's better than -11. But in this table, I don't see any players with to-par less than -11. Mark and Kenny have -11, which seems to be the lowest.\n\nSo the claim says they tie for the lowest to par.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Frank Nobilo is the sole player from Zimbabwe in the table. To verify this, I need to check each row of the table and see how many players are listed as being from Zimbabwe.\n\nLooking at the table, the first step is to find all rows where the country is Zimbabwe. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Player Mark Brooks, country United States.\nRow 2: Player Kenny Perry, country United States.\nRow 3: Steve Elkington, Australia.\nRow 4: Tommy Tolles, United States.\nRow 5: Justin Leonard, United States.\nRow 6: Jesper Parnevik, Sweden.\nRow 7: Vijay Singh, Fiji.\nRow 8: Lee Janzen, United States.\nRow 9: Per-Ulrik Johansson, Sweden.\nRow 10: Phil Mickelson, United States.\nRow 11: Larry Mize, United States.\nRow 12: Frank Nobilo, New Zealand. Hmm, wait, this is the first player from a different country. But I'm looking for Zimbabwe.\nRow 13: Nick Price, Zimbabwe. Okay, here's one from Zimbabwe.\n\nWait, but I need to check if there are any other players from Zimbabwe besides Frank Nobilo. From the table provided, only Row 12 and Row 13 have players with non-United States countries. But Row 12 is New Zealand, and Row 13 is Zimbabwe. So in the table, is Frank Nobilo the only player from Zimbabwe?\n\nLooking again, Row 13 is Nick Price, country: zimbabwe. So that's one player from Zimbabwe. Are there any others? Let me check all rows to be sure.\n\nI'll go through each row and list their countries:\n\n1. United States\n2. United States\n3. Australia\n4. United States\n5. United States\n6. Sweden\n7. Fiji\n8. United States\n9. Sweden\n10. United States\n11. United States\n12. New Zealand\n13. Zimbabwe\n\nSo, only Row 13 is from Zimbabwe, and the player there is Nick Price.

There's no entry for Frank Nobilo in the table except in Row 12, which is New Zealand.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The claim says \"Frank nobilo be the only player from zimbabwe.\" So according to the table, does Frank Nobilo exist there? Let me check each row's player name.\n\nLooking through the player names:\n\n1. Mark Brooks\n2. Kenny Perry\n3. Steve Elkington\n4. Tommy Tolles\n5. Justin Leonard\n6. Jesper Parnevik\n7. Vijay Singh\n8. Lee Janzen\n9. Per-Ulrik Johansson\n10. Phil Mickelson\n11. Larry Mize\n12. Frank Nobilo\n13. Nick Price\n\nYes, Frank Nobilo is listed in Row 12 as a player from New Zealand. So he's not from Zimbabwe; that's Nick Price.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because there is another player, Nick Price, also from Zimbabwe. But wait, looking back at the table, only Nick Price is from Zimbabwe, and the claim says Frank Nobilo is the only one. That makes the claim false because Frank isn't even from Zimbabwe; it's actually Nick Price.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread something. Let me confirm:\n\n- Row 12: place: t8, player: frank nobilo, country: new zealand\n- Row 13: place: t8, player: nick price, country: zimbabwe\n\nSo yes, Frank Nobilo is from New Zealand, and Nick Price is from Zimbabwe. Therefore, the claim that Frank is the only player from Zimbabwe is false because there's another player, Nick Price, also from Zimbabwe.\n\nBut wait, the table shows only one player from Zimbabwe, which is Nick Price. So does that mean Frank isn't from Zimbabwe at all? Because the claim says he's the only one, but in reality, it's Nick Price who is from Zimbabwe, and Frank is from New Zealand.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because there is another player (Nick Price) from Zimbabwe besides whoever the claim refers to. Wait, no, the claim specifically mentions Frank Nobilo as the only player from Zimbabwe. But according to the table, Frank is not from Zimbabwe; it's Nick Price. So actually, there is no other player besides Nick Price, but the claim incorrectly identifies Frank as the sole one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the person they're referring to isn't even from Zimbabwe\u2014they're from New Zealand\u2014and there is a player from Zimbabwe (Nick Price) who is not mentioned in the claim. So the claim's incorrect on two fronts: the wrong country for Frank and another player exists from Zimbabwe.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe, but upon reviewing the table:\n\n- Frank Nobilo is listed as being from New Zealand (Row 12).\n- Nick Price is listed as being from Zimbabwe (Row 13).\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there is another player, Nick Price, from Zimbabwe, and Frank Nobilo is not from that country.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"False\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Frank Nobilo is actually from New Zealand, not Zimbabwe. There is a player named Nick Price who is from Zimbabwe.\"\n}\n```",
