    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"201a be the production code of the 14a series and 1a season , title spontaneously combustible which be direct by igor kovalyov.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part means. The claim mentions three things:\n\n1. Production code is 201a.\n2. It belongs to series 14a and season 1a.\n3. The title is \"spontaneously combustible.\"\n4. Directed by Igor Kovalyov.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the production codes first, I see that Row 1 has production code 201a. So that part seems correct.\n\nNext, the series and season numbers are a bit trickier because the table uses \"no in series\" and \"no in season.\" For example, Row 1 says \"no in series: 14a, no in season: 1a.\" This likely means that this episode is the first in series 14 and the first in season 1. So yes, it's the 14a series and 1a season.\n\nThe title matches as well; Row 1 has the title \"spontaneously combustible.\"\n\nLastly, the director is Igor Kovalyov, which also matches Row 1.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row seems to represent an episode. So each production code corresponds to one episode, right? So 201a is assigned to the 14a series and 1a season's first episode, directed by Igor Kovalyov, with the given title. \n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are correctly supported by Row 1 of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"production_code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"series_no_in_series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"season_no_in_season\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
