    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"the net profit / loss - 1140000000 have a basic eps (sek) of -6.58 , and employee (average / year) larger than 31034.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts to check separately.\n\nThe first part mentions \"net profit / loss - 1140000000\". Looking at the table, net profit/loss is a column in each row. The number mentioned is -1140000000. I need to find which row this corresponds to. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 10: net profit/loss is -1140000000.\n\nSo, for the first part, the relevant cell is row_index 10 and the column \"Net Profit/Loss\".\n\nThe second part of the claim says that the employee (average/year) is larger than 31034. Looking at the table again:\n\n- Row 10 also mentions employees: 31035.\n\nWait, the number in the claim is 31034, but the actual value is 31035. So, 31035 is larger than 31034. That part seems correct because 31035 > 31034.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"larger than 31034\", which is true because 31035 is indeed larger. However, in the context of claims, sometimes it's about whether the statement is accurate or not. Since 31035 is greater, the employee count in row 10 meets that condition.\n\nNow, let me check if both parts are correct. The first part checks the net profit/loss and basic eps. Wait, no, the claim says that for the net profit/loss of -1140000000, the basic eps is -6.58. So I need to verify that in row 10.\n\nLooking at row 10: basic eps is -6.58, which matches the claim. So both conditions are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because:\n\n- The net profit/loss of -1140000000 (row 10) has a basic eps of -6.58.\n- The employees in row 10 average 31035, which is indeed larger than 31034.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Net Profit/Loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim and check each condition against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the net profit / loss (sek) 2273000000 have employee (average / year) larger than 18786 , a year end of 2000 , and passenger flown larger than 23239000\"\n\nLet's parse this into three conditions:\n\n1. Net Profit/Loss (sek) is 2,273,000,000.\n2. Employee (average/year) is larger than 18,786.\n3. Passenger flown is larger than 23,239,000.\n4. Year end is 2000.\n\nWait, actually, the claim seems a bit off because it mentions \"net profit / loss (sek) 2273000000 have employee...\", which might mean that for the specific net profit/loss value of 2,273,000,000, there are certain conditions about employees and passengers. Or perhaps it's stating that in a year where net profit/loss is this number, the employees and passengers meet certain criteria.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row represents a different year with various metrics: year ended, passengers flown, employees (average/year), net profit/loss (sek), basic eps (sek). So I think each row is a separate data point for each year from 2001 to 1999.\n\nNow, the claim seems to mix specific numbers. Let me see if there's a row where net profit/loss is exactly 2,273,000,000, which is 2,273 million sek (since it's written as 2273000000). Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 11: year ended 2000, net profit/loss: 2,273,000,000. So yes, this matches the first condition.\n\nNow, check the other conditions for this specific row (row 11):\n\n1. Employees (average/year): In row 11, it's 30,939.\n   Is 30,939 larger than 18,786? Yes, because 30k is definitely more than 18k.\n\n2. Passenger flown: In row 11, it's 23,240,000.\n   Is this larger than 23,239,000? Wait, 23,240,000 vs 23,239,000. The claim says \"larger than 23,239,000\", so 23,240,000 is indeed larger by 1,000.\n\n3. Year end: It's 2000, which matches the condition.\n\nSo all three conditions are met for row 11. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in row 11.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific year (2000) with exact figures for net profit/loss, employees, and passengers. Upon checking the table, row 11 matches all these criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"employees (average / year)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"passengers flown\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year ended\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"when the net profit / loss (sek) be larger than 4935000000 , and a basic eps (sek) larger than 1.06 the number of employee (average / year) be larger than 4\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand each part of the claim. It's saying that if two conditions are met\u2014net profit/loss exceeding 4,935,000,000 sek and basic eps being more than 1.06\u2014then the average number of employees per year should be higher than 4.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row where both net profit/loss exceeds 4,935,000,000 and basic eps is above 1.06. Then, compare the employee count in those rows to see if it's over 4 on average.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 5: \n- Year ended: 2006\n- Net profit/loss: 4,936,000,000 (which is just slightly above 4.935B)\n- Basic EPS: 28.10 (definitely more than 1.06)\n- Employees: 26,554\n\nSo this row meets both conditions. The employee count here is 26,554, which is way higher than 4.\n\nRow 6:\n- Year ended: 2005\n- Net profit/loss: 418,000,000 (way below 4.935B)\n- Basic EPS: 1.06 (exactly matches the condition, but since it's \"larger than\" 1.06, does equal count? Probably not; it needs to be larger.)\n\nSo Row 6 doesn't meet both conditions because net profit is too low and basic EPS is exactly 1.06.\n\nNow, are there any other rows where net profit/loss exceeds 4.935B and basic EPS >1.06?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows with Net Profit/Loss above 4.935B:\n- Row 5: 4.936B\n- Any others? Let me check all rows.\n\nRow 7: -1.813B (no)\nRow 8: -2.221B (no)\nRow 9: -0.736B (no)\nRow 10: -1.14B (no)\nRow 11: +2.273B (yes, but basic EPS is 11.79 which is >1.06, but net profit is above 4.935B as well? Wait, no\u2014wait, the claim says \"net profit / loss (sek) be larger than 4935000000\"\u2014so net profit/loss being positive and over 4.935B.\n\nSo Row 11: Net Profit/Loss is +2,273,000,000, which is less than 4.935B. So it doesn't meet the first condition.\n\nRow 5 is the only row where both conditions are met: net profit/loss >4.935B and basic EPS >1.06.\n\nIn Row 5, employees are 26,554, which is much higher than 4.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the number of employee (average / year) be larger than 4\". So, in this case, it's way more than 4. Therefore, the statement holds true for this row.\n\nAre there any other rows that meet both conditions? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at all rows again, only Row 5 meets net profit/loss >4.935B and basic EPS >1.06.\n\nSo, with just one data point, it's hard to make a general statement about the trend, but according to the claim's wording, when both conditions are met, the employee count is higher than 4. In this case, it is.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on Row 5.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where net profit/loss exceeds 4.935B and basic EPS >1.06, which only occurs in Row 5 with an employee count of 26,554.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"employees (average / year)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down what's being asked here.\n\nThe claim states two specific figures from the company's report: \"the company reported over 23,240,000 passengers flown in the year 2000 and a net profit/loss of -1,813,000,000.\" So, I need to check if these numbers match exactly with any row in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the year 2000 in the \"year ended\" column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 11: year ended 2000\n- Rows 12 onwards are from 1999 and earlier, so we can ignore those.\n\nSo, Row 11 is the one for the year 2000. Now, I need to check two things: passengers flown and net profit/loss.\n\nLooking at the \"passengers flown\" column for Row 11: it's 23,240,000. That matches exactly with the first part of the claim. Great start.\n\nNext, checking the \"net profit/loss (sek)\" for Row 11: according to the table, it's -1,813,000,000. The claim also states \"-1,813,000,000,\" which is a match as well.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, there might be discrepancies in formatting, like commas versus periods, but here both numbers use the same format: 23,240,000 and -1,813,000,000. No issues there.\n\nIs there any chance that another row could have these numbers? Let's see:\n\n- Row 11 is unique for year 2000.\n- The passenger count in 2000 is 23,240,000, which isn't repeated elsewhere as per the table. For example, in 1999 (Row 12), it's 21,991,000, which is less than 23 million.\n\nSimilarly, looking at net profit/loss for other years:\n\n- In 2001 (Row 10): -1,140,000,000\n- 2002: -736,000,000\n- 2003: -2,221,000,000\n- 2004: -1,813,000,000\nWait a minute. Hold on, Row 7 for 2004 also has a net profit/loss of -1,813,000,000. So that number is repeated in 2000 and 2004.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions year 2000, so we're only concerned with Row 11 here. The fact that it's also present in 2004 doesn't affect our current analysis since the claim is about 2000.\n\nSo, both numbers in the claim match exactly with Row 11 of the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI don't see any errors in my reasoning. Both passenger count and net profit/loss for 2000 are correctly stated.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"passengers flown\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"for the year between 2009 and 2007 , have a basic eps (sek) of - 6.58 , and employee (average / year) larger than 31035\".\n\nI should parse this carefully. The years in question are from 2009 down to 2007, so I'm looking at the rows for 2007, 2008, 2009, right? Wait, no, the range is between 2009 and 2007, which includes 2007, 2008, and 2009. So rows corresponding to these years: row 2 (2009), row 3 (2008), row 4 (2007).\n\nNext, the claim mentions two conditions:\n1. Basic EPS (sek) is -6.58.\n2. Employees (average/year) are larger than 31035.\n\nI need to check if for any of these years, both conditions hold true.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 2: 2009\n- basic eps: -18.20\n- employees: 18786\n\nRow 3: 2008\n- basic eps: -6.29\n- employees: 24635\n\nRow 4: 2007\n- basic eps: 3.87\n- employees: 26538\n\nNone of these rows have a basic EPS of -6.58. Row 4 has 3.87, which is positive, so that's not matching. The closest negative EPS in the range is row 2 and row 3, but they don't reach -6.58 either.\n\nNow, checking employees: 31035 is mentioned. Looking through the relevant rows (2007-2009), the employee numbers are 18786, 24635, and 26538. All of these are less than 31035. So none meet the second condition either.\n\nWait a minute\u2014could I have misread the row indices? Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices go from 0 (2001) up to 11 (1999). Wait, no\u2014the rows are ordered starting from 2010 as row 0, then going down to 1999 as row 11. So actually, row 4 is 2007, which is correct.\n\nSo in the range of 2007-2009 (rows 2,3,4), none have basic EPS -6.58 and employees over 31035.\n\nWait another thought: Is there any possibility that I'm missing a row? Let me count the rows again to make sure I didn't misindex them. The table starts with year ended 2010 as row 1 (since it's given in naturalized format starting from row 1), so:\n\nRow 1: 2010\nRow 2: 2009\nRow 3: 2008\n...\nRow 11: 1999\n\nYes, that's correct. So the years between 2007 and 2009 are rows 4 (2007), 3 (2008), 2 (2009). None of these have the required EPS.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a single year, but the wording says \"between 2009 and 2007,\" which I interpreted as including those years. But perhaps it's looking for all years in that range. However, since no individual row meets both conditions, the claim is false.\n\nWait again\u2014could there be any other interpretation? Maybe the user meant a period from 2007 to 2009 inclusive, but even then, none meet both criteria.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim is not supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that between 2007 and 2009, there's a year with basic EPS of -6.58 and employees exceeding 31035. Checking each relevant row (2007, 2008, 2009), none meet both conditions.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** The years between 2007 and 2009 correspond to rows 4 (2007), 3 (2008), and 2 (2009).\n\n2. **Check Basic EPS for Each Row:**\n   - 2007: 3.87\n   - 2008: -6.29\n   - 2009: -18.20\n\n   None of these equal -6.58.\n\n3. **Employee Numbers for Relevant Rows:**\n   - 2007: 26538\n   - 2008: 24635\n   - 2009: 18786\n\n   All are below 31035, so no row meets the employee condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Since none of the rows meet both conditions, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Answer JSON:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Basic EPS (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Basic EPS (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Basic EPS (sek)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Basic EPS (sek)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the company be more profitable in 2005 than 2006 , with a net profit of 4936000000",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the company was more profitable in 2005 than 2006 with a net profit of 4936000000.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific years: 2005 and 2006. It's comparing their profitability by looking at net profits. The exact figure given is 4,936,000,000 sek, which I think stands for Swedish krona. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year ending in a certain year, with various data points like passengers flown, employees, net profit or loss, and basic eps. So, to check the claim, I need to find the relevant rows for 2005 and 2006.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to 2005 and 2006. Scanning through the \"year ended\" column:\n\n- Row 6: year ended 2005\n- Row 5: year ended 2006\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The rows go from 2010 down to 1999. So row 1 is 2010, row 2 is 2009, and so on. So row number decreases as the year increases. Therefore, row 11 is 2000, row 12 is 1999.\n\nWait, actually, the first row (row 1) is 2010, then row 2 is 2009, up to row 12 which is 1999. So to find 2005 and 2006, I need to count backward from 2010.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n- Row 1: 2010\n- Row 2: 2009\n- Row 3: 2008\n- Row 4: 2007\n- Row 5: 2006\n- Row 6: 2005\n- Then rows 7 to 12 go down to 1999.\n\nSo, row 6 is 2005, and row 5 is 2006. That's correct because the claim mentions 2005 and 2006.\n\nNext, I need to check the net profit for both years. The claim states that in 2005, the net profit was 4,936,000,000 sek. Looking at row 6 (2005), the \"net profit / loss (sek)\" is 418000000. Wait, that's only 418 million, not 4,936 million. That doesn't match.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. The claim says 4936000000, which is 4,936,000,000. But in the table, row 5 (2006) has \"net profit / loss (sek): 4936000000.\" So for 2006, the net profit is over 4.9 billion, but for 2005, it's only 418 million.\n\nBut the claim says that the company was more profitable in 2005 than 2006. However, according to the table, 2006 had a higher net profit (4.9 billion) compared to 2005's 418 million. So the claim is actually stating the opposite of what the data shows.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"more profitable in 2005 than 2006,\" which would mean 2005's net profit was higher than 2006's. But according to the table, 2005 had a lower net profit than 2006. Therefore, the claim is false because the company was not more profitable in 2005; it was less profitable.\n\nAdditionally, the exact figure provided in the claim (4,936,000,000) matches row 5 (2006), but the claim attributes it to 2005, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, I need to check all relevant data points. The column for net profit is \"net profit / loss (sek)\". So for 2005 and 2006, I should extract that value.\n\nFor 2005 (row 6): net profit = 418,000,000 sek.\nFor 2006 (row 5): net profit = 4,936,000,000 sek.\n\nThe claim says that in 2005 the company had a net profit of 4,936,000,000, which is actually for 2006. Therefore, the claim is false because it misattributes the net profit year and the figure.\n\nMoreover, the claim's comparison is incorrect because 2005 was not more profitable than 2006; it was less profitable.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the company had a higher net profit in 2005 than in 2006. The data shows that 2006's net profit was significantly higher than 2005's. Additionally, the net profit figure for 2005 does not match what the claim states.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"net profit / loss (sek)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
