    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Ian Poulter is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Ian Poulter has never won a tournament despite participating in forty 4 separate tournaments.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table to see if there's any information related to Ian Poulter winning a tournament. Each row represents a different tournament, and the columns show various statistics like wins, top-5 finishes, etc.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It says \"masters tournament,\" but I don't know if that's related to Ian Poulter. Maybe it's about someone else with a similar last name, but I'm not sure. So, maybe the relevant column here is \"wins.\" But since it's zero, it doesn't help us because the claim is that he hasn't won any.\n\nRow 2: \"us open\" again, same situation as Row 1. I don't know if this refers to Ian Poulter or not. Again, \"wins\" column shows zero.\n\nRow 3: \"the open championship.\" Still, could be another event. The \"wins\" here are also zero. \n\nRow 4: \"pga championship.\" Same pattern. Zero wins again. So none of these rows directly indicate a win by Ian Poulter.\n\nThen there's Row 5: \"totals.\" This might be aggregating all his performances across the other tournaments listed in rows 1-4. The \"wins\" column here is zero as well. So, even when looking at totals, he hasn't won any tournaments according to this table.\n\nNow, I need to check if he participated in forty-four separate tournaments. Looking at each row, the \"events\" column adds up: Row 1 has 9, Row 2 has 10, Row 3 has 13, Row 4 has 12. Adding those up: 9+10=19, +13=32, +12=44. So yes, he's participated in forty-four tournaments.\n\nThe claim says he \"never won a tournament despite participating in forty-four separate tournaments.\" The table supports that he hasn't won any (all wins are zero), so the statement seems true based on the data given.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the provided table and compare it with the claim.\n\n**Claim Analysis:**\n- **Ian Poulter's Wins:** Across all listed tournaments and the totals row, the \"wins\" column is consistently 0. This aligns with the claim that he has never won a tournament.\n- **Number of Participations:** Summing the \"events\" columns across each row (9 + 10 + 13 + 12) equals 44. The claim states participation in forty-four tournaments, which is confirmed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe data supports the claim that Ian Poulter has not won any tournament despite participating in forty-four separate events.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"Ian Poulter placed in the top 5 one more time in the Open Championship than in the PGA Championship.\" \n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows for different tournaments, each having several columns like wins, top-5, top-10, etc. The first four rows are for specific tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship. The fifth row is a total.\n\nI need to find data related to Ian Poulter's performance in both the Open Championship and the PGA Championship, specifically how many times he was in the top 5 in each.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to The Open Championship. That's Row 3. In that row, the top-5 column has a value of 2. So Ian Poulter placed in the top 5 twice in The Open Championship.\n\nNext, I need to find his performance in the PGA Championship. That's Row 4. Looking at the top-5 column there, it says 1. So he placed in the top 5 once in the PGA Championship.\n\nThe claim states that he placed one more time in the top 5 in The Open Championship than in the PGA Championship. Let me do the math: 2 (Open) minus 1 (PGA) equals 1. Yes, that's correct\u2014he was one more time in the top 5 in the Open than in the PGA.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything else. The claim is only about the top-5 placements, so other columns like top-10 or events aren't relevant here. Also, it's comparing two specific tournaments: Open and PGA, so Rows 3 and 4 are the key ones.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would affect this comparison. The fifth row is a total but doesn't specify which tournament, so it's not directly related to the individual comparisons in the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we compare Ian Poulter's top-5 placements in both tournaments mentioned:\n\n1. **Open Championship (Row 3)**: Top-5 = 2\n2. **PGA Championship (Row 4)**: Top-5 = 1\n\nThe difference is indeed 1, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"top - 5\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"ian poulter make the same amount of cut at the open championship as he do at the pga tournament.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It compares two things: the number of cuts Ian Poulter made at the Open Championship and the number he made at the PGA Tournament.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a different tournament or total. Let me go through each relevant row.\n\nRow 1: masters tournament \u2013 not relevant because the claim is about Open Championship and PGA Tournament.\nRow 2: us open \u2013 this seems like the Open Championship. So, cuts made here would be the number of cuts at that tournament.\nRow 3: the open championship \u2013 another name for The Open, so this must be the same as the US Open in row 2. Wait, no, actually, it's a separate tournament. Hmm, I might need to clarify that. Maybe both are different tournaments, but the claim refers to \"the open championship\" and \"pga tournament.\" So, perhaps the Open Championship is one, and the PGA Tournament is another.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 2: us open \u2013 possibly the same as the Open Championship? Or maybe they're separate. The term \"the open championship\" in row 3 might be referring to the British Open. So, perhaps row 2 is the US Open, and row 3 is the Open Championship (i.e., The Open at St Andrews). \n\nSo, for the claim, we need two things: cuts made at the Open Championship (which would be row 3) and cuts made at the PGA Tournament.\n\nWait, but looking at the table:\n\nRow 4: pga championship \u2013 this is the PGA Championship, so that's the tournament in question for the second part of the claim. The \"cuts made\" here is 10.\n\nRow 2 and row 3 are both related to \"the open.\" Since the claim mentions \"the open championship,\" which is row 3, we need to check that.\n\nSo, cuts at Open Championship (row 3) is 10, and cuts at PGA Championship (row 4) is also 10. Therefore, they make the same number of cuts.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\nRow 2: us open \u2013 maybe this is a different tournament than the Open Championship. So perhaps row 3 is the Open Championship with 10 cuts, and row 4 is the PGA Tournament with 10 cuts. Therefore, the claim is true because both have 10 cuts.\n\nAlternatively, if row 2 is also the Open Championship, then that would complicate things, but I think they are separate. So yes, the cuts made at both tournaments are equal to 10.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ian Poulter made the same number of cuts at the Open Championship and the PGA Tournament. From the table:\n\n- Open Championship (row 3): Cuts made = 10\n- PGA Championship (row 4): Cuts made = 10\n\nSince both values are equal, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"At the US Open, Ian Poulter makes the least amount of cut out of any tournament.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. There are five rows, each representing a different tournament and some related statistics. Let's focus on Row 2 since it's about the US Open.\n\nRow 2 has these columns: tournament name, wins, top-5, top-10, top-25, events, cuts made. So for the US Open, Ian Poulter has 0 wins, 0 in top-5, 0 in top-10, and 3 in top-25. The total number of events is 10, and he made 7 cuts.\n\nNow, the claim is about making the least amount of cuts compared to any other tournament. So I need to compare Ian Poulter's cut count at the US Open with his performance in other tournaments listed in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Masters Tournament. Cuts made are 8.\nRow 3: The Open Championship. Cuts made are 10.\nRow 4: PGA Championship. Cuts made are 10.\nRow 5: Totals, which seems to aggregate all his cuts across tournaments, totaling 35.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the US Open compared to \"any tournament.\" Since Row 5 is the totals, it's about all his performances combined. So if Poulter made 7 cuts at the US Open, and in other individual tournaments he had more or less? Let me check each:\n\n- Masters: 8 cuts\n- US Open: 7\n- The Open Championship:10\n- PGA Championship:10\n\nSo at the US Open, he has the least number of cuts among these four. So the claim that \"at the US Open Ian Poulter makes the least amount of cut out of any tournament\" would be true because compared to all other tournaments listed, he made 7, which is less than 8,10, and10.\n\nWait, but Row 5 is the totals, so it's about total cuts. But in the claim, it's comparing across tournaments, not cumulative. So if I'm just considering individual tournaments, then yes, US Open has the lowest cut count among the listed ones.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that at the US Open, Ian Poulter made the least number of cuts compared to any other tournament listed. From the table:\n\n- Masters Tournament: 8 cuts\n- US Open: 7 cuts\n- The Open Championship: 10 cuts\n- PGA Championship: 10 cuts\n\nAmong these, 7 is indeed the lowest. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Ian Poulter making the cut in tournaments he participates in is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Ian makes the cut 79% of the time he competes. So I need to find if there's data supporting this percentage in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different tournament, and each has columns like \"tournament\" (which tells us which tournament it is), \"wins,\" \"top - 5,\" etc., up to \"cuts made.\" The last row is \"totals.\"\n\nI think I need to focus on the \"cuts made\" column because that's about how many times someone makes the cut in a tournament. The percentage comes from this data across all tournaments he participated in.\n\nSo, let me list out the number of cuts for each tournament:\n\nRow 1: Masters Tournament - 8\nRow 2: US Open - 7\nRow 3: The Open Championship -10\nRow 4: PGA Championship -10\nRow 5: Totals -35\n\nNow, to find the total number of participations, I can add up all the \"events\" across each tournament. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 9\nRow 2:10\nRow3:13\nRow4:12\nRow5:44 (this is the total events)\n\nSo adding those up: 9+10=19, +13=32, +12=44. Wait, that's already 44. So yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, to find how many times he made the cut out of all participations, we look at the \"cuts made\" in the totals row, which is 35.\n\nSo, total cuts = 35\nTotal events (participations) = 44\n\nCalculating the percentage: (35/44)*100 \u2248 79.55%. That's pretty close to 79%.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Ian makes the cut approximately 79% of the time seems accurate based on the data provided.\n\nI should check if I missed anything. The claim is about \"he participate in,\" so it's about participation across all tournaments, not just each individual one. Since the total cuts over total events give the overall percentage, this aligns with the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe calculation shows that Ian Poulter made the cut approximately 79% of the time he participated, which supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nThe claim says: \"Ian Poulter wins a tournament 3 times [and] participates in forty 4 separate tournaments.\" Wait, that wording seems a bit confusing. Maybe it means he won a tournament three times and participated in four separate tournaments? Or perhaps the original statement is miswritten. I'll assume it's trying to say that Ian Poulter has won a tournament three times and has participated in forty-four (fourty 4) separate tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows. The first four rows correspond to specific tournaments: Masters Tournament, US Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship. The fifth row is labeled as \"totals.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if Ian Poulter has won any tournament three times and participated in forty-four separate events.\n\nStarting with the wins: Each of the first four rows lists \"tournament\" as a specific event, and under each, \"wins\" are 0 except for the fifth row. Wait, no\u2014the fifth row is totals, so maybe the total wins across all tournaments are zero? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the table again.\n\nRow 1: Masters Tournament, wins: 0\nRow 2: US Open, wins: 0\nRow 3: The Open Championship, wins: 0\nRow 4: PGA Championship, wins: 0\nRow 5: Totals, wins: 0\n\nSo according to the table, Ian Poulter has not won any of these four major tournaments. Therefore, he hasn't won three times as claimed.\n\nNow, for participation: The \"events\" column shows the number of events participated in each tournament. For example:\n\nRow 1: Masters Tournament, events:9\nRow 2: US Open, events:10\nRow 3: The Open Championship, events:13\nRow 4: PGA Championship, events:12\n\nSo, if I sum up these events (excluding the totals row), it would be 9+10+13+12 = 44. So he's participated in 44 separate tournaments.\n\nTherefore, the claim says he won a tournament three times and participated in forty-four tournaments. Since the table shows zero wins across all four tournaments, the first part is false. However, the second part about participating in forty-four tournaments seems to be correct based on the sum of events from rows 1-4.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the entire claim is true or false. The claim has two parts: winning three times and participating in forty-four tournaments. Since one part is true and the other is false, but I think the key is that he won a tournament three times. If he didn't win any, then the first part is false, making the overall claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me re-read it: \"Ian Poulter win a tournament 3 time participate in forty 4 separate tournament.\" Maybe it's supposed to mean that he has won three tournaments and participated in forty-four others, but the way it's written is confusing. Perhaps it's intended to say he won one tournament three times? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nGiven that in the table, wins are zero across all four tournaments, he hasn't won any tournament at all, let alone three times. So the first part of the claim is false. The second part about participating in forty-four separate tournaments is true because 9+10+13+12=44. But since the overall statement combines both parts as if they are facts, and one part is false, the entire claim would be false.\n\nWait, but the problem says to check whether each condition in the claim is met. So I need to see if both conditions are true. If he hasn't won any tournaments (so 0 wins), then he can't have won three times. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ian Poulter has won a tournament three times and participated in forty-four separate tournaments. From the table:\n\n1. **Wins**: Across all four major tournaments, the \"wins\" column shows 0 each. This means he hasn't won any tournaments, let alone three times.\n2. **Participation**: Summing the \"events\" column for the four tournaments gives 9 + 10 + 13 + 12 = 44. He has participated in 44 tournaments.\n\nSince one part of the claim is true (participation) and the other is false (wins), but the claim combines both as conditions, it's overall false because he didn't win three times.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\nRelevant cells: All four events columns to confirm participation and all four wins columns to check for victories.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wins\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Ian Poulter placed in the top 5 2 less times in the Open Championship than in the PGA Championship.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant to this claim. Looking at the table, it has five rows. Rows 1-4 correspond to specific tournaments, while Row 5 is a total. The relevant tournaments here are the Open Championship (Row 3) and the PGA Championship (Row 4).\n\nThe claim refers to placements in the top 5, so I should look at the \"top - 5\" column for each of these tournaments.\n\nFrom the table:\n- In Row 3 (Open Championship), under \"top - 5\", it's 2.\n- In Row 4 (PGA Championship), under \"top - 5\", it's 1.\n\nWait, that seems off. The claim states Poulter placed in top 5 two less times in the Open than PGA. So if I subtract: 2 (Open) minus 1 (PGA) equals 1, which is not two less. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at how many times he was in the top 5 in each tournament. For example, in Row 3, \"top - 5\" is 2, meaning he made the top 5 twice. In Row 4, it's 1, so only once. So 2 vs 1: 2 is one more than 1, not two less.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck the numbers:\n\nRow 3: Open Championship, top - 5: 2.\nRow 4: PGA Championship, top - 5: 1.\n\nSo if he placed in the top 5 twice in the Open and once in the PGA, then he placed two more times in the Open than in the PGA. That would mean his placements are higher (more frequent) in the Open than in the PGA, not two less.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because he did not place two less times; he placed one more time in the Open compared to the PGA.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are for the Open Championship and the PGA Championship's top 5 placements.

Hmm, so there's a discrepancy between the claim and the table.\n\nWait, maybe I misread something else. Let me check all relevant rows again. The claim specifically mentions the US Open, so row 2 is definitely the right one. The column for cuts made in that row is 7, not 35. So the number of cuts doesn't match the claim.\n\nIs there any other row that might be relevant? For example, if there's a totals row (row 5) but that's overall totals, not specific to the US Open. Therefore, it's only row 2 that's relevant here.\n\nSo since the table shows 7 cuts made at the US Open, and the claim says 35, this must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Ian Poulter is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"Ian Poulter made the 2 more cut at the Open Championship as he did at the PGA tournament.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two specific tournaments: the Open Championship and the PGA tournament. Wait, actually, the original claim refers to \"the pga tournament,\" but looking back at the table, I see there's a row for the \"pga championship.\" Maybe that's a typo or different name? Hmm, perhaps it's referring to the same as the PGA Championship.\n\nNow, focusing on the Open Championship. The claim states that Poulter made 2 more cuts here compared to the PGA tournament. So I need to compare his performance in both tournaments regarding the number of cuts he made.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a tournament with various statistics like wins, top-5 finishes, top-10 finishes, and so on. The relevant columns for this analysis would be \"cuts made\" since we're comparing how many times Poulter made it into the cut in both tournaments.\n\nStarting with the Open Championship: According to Row 3 of the table, which is for \"the open championship,\" Ian Poulter had a total cuts made of 10. \n\nNext, I need to find his performance at the PGA tournament mentioned in the claim. But wait, the table doesn't have a row explicitly named \"pga tournament.\" Instead, there's Row 4: \"pga championship\" with 10 cuts made. Maybe this is the same as what the claim refers to as the \"PGA tournament\"? That would make sense if it's just a different name for the same event.\n\nSo, according to the table:\n- Open Championship: Cuts = 10\n- PGA Championship: Cuts = 10\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the claim. The claim says he made \"2 more cuts\" at the Open compared to the PGA. But here, both have the same number of cuts (10 each). So there's a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which tournaments are being referred to. Let me double-check:\n\nThe claim mentions two tournaments: the Open Championship and the PGA tournament. The table has entries for the Open Championship (Row 3) and the PGA Championship (Row 4). So if it's about comparing between these two, their cuts made are both 10 each.\n\nBut according to the table:\n- Open Championship: Cuts = 10\n- PGA Championship: Cuts = 10\n\nSo, Poulter made the same number of cuts in both tournaments. Therefore, he didn't make \"2 more cuts\" at the Open compared to the PGA. That would mean the claim is false because there's no increase; it's equal.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The table shows:\n\nRow 3: Open Championship, cuts made =10\n\nRow 4: PGA Championship, cuts made=10\n\nSo both have 10 cuts each. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because he didn't make more cuts at the Open; they are equal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ian Poulter made 2 more cuts at the Open Championship compared to the PGA tournament. However, according to the table, both tournaments have 10 cuts each. Therefore, there is no discrepancy as claimed.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Open Championship (Row 3)\n   - PGA Championship (Row 4)\n\n2. **Extract Cuts Made from Both Tournaments:**\n   - Open Championship: 10 cuts\n   - PGA Championship: 10 cuts\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers:**\n   - Both tournaments have the same number of cuts (10 each).\n   - Therefore, Poulter did not make more cuts at the Open Championship.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because there's no increase in cuts mentioned; both are equal.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says, \"Ian Poulter never made any cut in tournament he participates.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column means in the table. Let's look at Row 1: It mentions the Masters Tournament with 0 wins, 0 top-5 finishes, 2 top-10s, 5 top-25s, 9 events, and 8 cuts made. Similarly, other rows have similar data for different tournaments.\n\nThe key term here is \"cuts made.\" A cut means a player advanced to the next round or was eliminated but made it past the initial rounds. If a player didn't make any cuts, they would have been eliminated in the early stages without progressing beyond a certain point.\n\nNow, the claim states that Ian Poulter never made any cut in any tournament he participated in. So I need to check each row of his performance and see if he made any cuts.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Masters Tournament has 8 cuts made. If this is Poulter's performance, then he did make a cut here.\nRow 2: US Open has 7 cuts made.\nRow 3: The Open Championship has 10 cuts made.\nRow 4: PGA Championship has 10 cuts made.\nRow 5: Totals, which sums up his overall performance. It shows he made 35 cuts in total across all tournaments.\n\nSo if Poulter participated in these tournaments (Masters, US Open, The Open, and PGA), he did make cuts in each of them. Therefore, the claim is false because he did make cuts in some of the tournaments he played.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Ian Poulter made cuts in multiple tournaments as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
