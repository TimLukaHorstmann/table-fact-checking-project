    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"in the 9 - 6 game against the brewer, the attendance be 34240.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. They mention a specific game where the score was 9-6 against the Brewer. So, I need to find that game in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different date and details about the game on that date. The key columns here are \"opponent,\" \"score,\" and \"attendance.\" \n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find where the opponent is Brewers and the score is 9-6.\n\nStarting from Row 1: May 1 vs Giants, score 5-1.\nRow 2: May 2 vs Rockies, 7-4.\nRow3: May3 vs Rockies, 6-4.\nRow4: May4 vs Rockies, 5-4 (10).\nRow5: May5 vs Brewers, 5-3. Not the game we're looking for.\n\nContinuing:\nRow6: May6 vs Brewers, score 9-6. Here, opponent is Brewers and score is 9-6. So this must be the game in question.\n\nNow, check the attendance for Row6. The number given here is 34240. That matches exactly what's claimed.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported: correct date (May6), opponent (Brewers), score (9-6), and attendance (34240). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"On May 26, in the game against the pirate, the attendance was 40225.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The date mentioned is May 26, the opponent is the Pirates, and the specific figure given for attendance is 40,225.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different date, so I need to find the row where the date is May 26. Let me scan through the dates in the table. \n\nRow 25: May 26, opponent: pirates, score: 10 - 0. So this is the correct row for May 26 against the Pirates.\n\nNext, I'll check the attendance column for that specific row. The attendance listed is 40,225, which matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"On May 10, the Cardinals scored 3 - 2 (10), while Eldred has a loss of (2 - 1).\" \n\nOkay, so I need to verify two parts of this claim. The first part is about the score on May 10 by the Cardinals, and the second part is about Eldred's loss record.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, loss (pitcher), attendance, and record. \n\nStarting with the Cardinals' score on May 10. I'll go through each row to find the one where the opponent is the Cardinals and the date is May 10.\n\nRow 1: May 1 vs Giants\nRow 2: May 2 vs Rockies\n...\nContinuing until I find May 10. Looking at the table, Row 9 is May 10, opponent: Cardinals. So that's the relevant row for the Cardinals' score.\n\nIn Row 9, the score is listed as \"3 - 2 (10)\". That matches the first part of the claim, so this cell is relevant.\n\nNext, checking Eldred's loss. The claim says Eldred has a loss of (2 - 1). So I need to find in the table any game where the pitcher's name is Eldred and his loss record is 2 - 1.\n\nLooking through each row's 'loss' column:\n\nRow 1: Loss by Worrell (1-1)\nRow 2: Chac\u00f3n (4-1)\n...\nContinuing until I find a pitcher named Eldred with a loss of 2-1.\n\nIn Row 9, the loss is attributed to Eldred with a record of 2 - 1. So that's another relevant cell.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"34240 be the attendance in the game versus brewer with a score of 9 - 6 on may 7.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions three key pieces of information:\n1. Attendance is 34,240.\n2. The game was against the Brewers.\n3. The score was 9 - 6.\n4. The date was May 7.\n\nI need to find a row in the table that matches all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. I'll go through each row one by one, starting from Row 1 to Row 29, to see if any match May 7 against Brewers with a score of 9-6 and attendance of 34,240.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n- Row 1: May 1 vs Giants, score 5-1.\n- Row 2: May 2 vs Rockies, score 7-4.\n- Row 3: May 3 vs Rockies, score 6-4.\n- Row 4: May 4 vs Rockies, score 5-4.\n- Row 5: May 5 vs Brewers, score 5-3. Attendance is 35,304, which doesn't match.\n- Row 6: May 6 vs Brewers, score 9-6. The attendance here is 34,240 and the opponent is Brewers. The date is May 6, which is not May 7.\n\nContinuing:\n- Row 7: May 7 vs Brewers, score 2-1. Attendance is 37,574, so no match.\nWait, but the claim's attendance is 34,240, which matches Row 6, but that's on May 6. So maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The user mentioned Row 7 as May 7 vs Brewers with score 2-1 and attendance 37,574. The claim is about May 7, so perhaps the correct row isn't found in the table? Or did I misread something?\n\nLooking back at the claim, it's about a game on May 7 with a score of 9-6. Let me check all rows again carefully.\n\nI realize that Row 26 is May 27 vs Pirates, and Row 28 is May 30 vs Astros, so none of these are May 7. The only relevant row I see for Brewers is Row 5 (May 5), Row 6 (May 6), and Row 7 (May 7). But on May 7, the score was 2-1 with attendance 37,574. So there's no game on May 7 against Brewers with a score of 9-6.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any row in the table. Hence, it should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a game on May 7 versus the Brewers with an attendance of 34,240 and a score of 9 - 6. After reviewing each relevant row, no such entry exists in the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"40225 be the attendance on may 26 with a score of 9 - 6.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to. The number 40225 is mentioned as the attendance, so I need to find out which row corresponds to May 26 and whether the attendance there is 40225.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized with rows that list dates, opponents, scores, losses, attendance, and records. Each row has a date in the \"date\" column, so I can scan through each row to find the one that matches May 26.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\nRow 1: May 1\nRow 2: May 2\n...\nContinuing this way until I reach Row 25 which is May 26. Yes, Row 25 has the date May 26.\n\nNow, for Row 25, I need to check the attendance number. According to the table, Row 25 has an attendance of 40225, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, the score mentioned in the claim is 9 - 6. Let's look at the \"score\" column for Row 25. The score there is 10 - 0. Hmm, that doesn't match 9 - 6. So, even though the attendance matches, the score does not. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check Row 25. Yes, date: may 26, opponent: pirates, score: 10 - 0. So the score is definitely 10-0, not 9-6.\n\nTherefore, while the attendance number matches, the score doesn't, which means the claim isn't fully supported by both parts. But wait, the claim says \"attendance on may 26 with a score of 9 - 6.\" Since the attendance is correct but the score isn't, does that make the entire statement false?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The claim has two conditions: attendance = 40225 and score = 9-6.\n\nSince both must be true for the claim to hold, and while attendance is correct, the score in Row 25 is 10-0, not 9-6. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says to check each condition against the table. So if one of them doesn't match, it's false. But perhaps I should also consider if there's a row where both attendance and score are as mentioned. Let me scan through other rows to see if any have 40225 attendance with a 9-6 score.\n\nLooking at all the rows, only Row 25 has attendance of 40225 on May 26, but the score is 10-0. No other row has attendance 40225 or that particular date. So there's no match for both conditions in any single row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two specific pieces of information: the attendance number and the score. Upon checking the table:\n\n1. **Attendance Check**: The attendance on May 26 is indeed 40225, which matches part of the claim.\n2. **Score Check**: The score for May 26 is listed as 10-0, not 9-6, which does not match.\n\nSince both conditions must be met for the claim to be true and only one condition is satisfied, the overall claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the match on may 10 where brewer defeat kinney 2 - 4 record attendance less than 1500.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Date**: May 10\n2. **Opponent**: Brewers (since it's about a Brewer defeating someone)\n3. **Score**: 2 - 4 in favor of the Brewers.\n4. **Loss Details**: The opposing pitcher is Kinney, with a loss record of 0 - 1.\n5. **Attendance**: Less than 1500.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for May 10. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 9: May 10, opponent: cardinals, score: 3 - 2 (10), loss: eldred (2 - 1). So, it's Cardinals vs Brewers? Wait, no\u2014opponent is Cardinals here. The claim says \"Brewer defeat Kinney,\" so the opponent should be the opposing team that lost to Brewers. But in row 9, it's the Brewers defeating Cardinals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"brewer defeat kinney.\" So the Brewers (as the home team) defeated the opposing pitcher named Kinney. Let me check if any row matches May 10 where the opponent is someone else and the score is 2 - 4 with an attendance under 1500.\n\nBut in the table, row 9 on May 10 shows:\n\n- Opponent: Cardinals\n- Score: 3 - 2 (10)\n- Loss: eldred (2 - 1)\n\nThat doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the claim is about a game where the Brewers lost to someone named Kinney? No, because the claim says \"brewer defeat kinney,\" meaning the Brewers won against Kinney.\n\nWait, maybe I misread row 9. Let me check again: May 10, opponent Cardinals, score 3-2 (10), loss by eldred with a record of 2 - 1. So that's not matching.\n\nLooking further down, I don't see any other May 10 entries in the table beyond row 9. Wait, perhaps the table only goes up to May 31, and May 10 is row 9. So there's no game on May 10 where Brewers defeated someone named Kinney with a score of 2 - 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. The claim says \"brewer defeat kinney.\" So the pitcher for the opposing team (probably the visiting team) is Kinney, and he has a loss record of 0 - 1. But in row 9, the opponent is Cardinals, not Brewers, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, perhaps the claim is referring to a game where the opposing team (e.g., Cardinals) were defeated by the Brewers with a score of 2-4, and the pitcher for the Cardinals was Kinney. But in row 9, it's the Brewers defeating Cardinals 3 - 2.\n\nI'm getting confused. Let me re-express the claim: May 10, Brewers defeat [someone], 2 - 4, with attendance less than 1500.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the score is 2 - 4, and the team scored 2 runs, it's unlikely they defeated someone. Wait, maybe the claim has the score as 2 - 4 in favor of the Brewers, meaning Brewers won 4 to 2? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, no\u2014typically, the notation is home team first, so 2 - 4 would mean the Brewers scored 4 and defeated their opponent by 4 runs. So the claim says they defeated someone with a score of 2 - 4, which doesn't add up because if you defeat, your score should be higher.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Sometimes scores are written as visiting team first. So 2 - 4 could mean the Brewers (visiting) scored 4 and defeated the home team 4-2? No, that still doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo in the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the score is 2-4 in favor of the opponent against the Brewers, meaning the opponent won. But the claim says \"brewer defeat kinney,\" so it should be the Brewers winning.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try another approach: I'll check each row for May 10 and see if any match the claim.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 9: May 10, opponent Cardinals, score 3 - 2 (10), loss by eldred (2-1). Attendance: 40225, which is way over 1500. So doesn't match.\n\nIs there another row for May 10? No, the next rows are May 11 and onwards, so no other May 10 entries.\n\nTherefore, there's no game on May 10 in the table that matches all parts of the claim: Brewers defeating someone named Kinney with a score of 2 - 4 and attendance under 1500.\n\nWait, but in row 9, the opponent is Cardinals, not Brewers. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because such a match doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim has an error in the date or other details.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe \"brewer defeat kinney\" refers to the opposing pitcher (Kinney) being from the Brewers, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps it's a game where the Brewers lost, but that would contradict the wording.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is referring to May 10 as the date when the Brewers defeated someone with a score of 2-4, and attendance less than 1500.\n\nLooking again at the table:\n\nRow 9: May 10, opponent Cardinals, score 3 - 2 (10). So not matching the score.\n\nNo other May 10 games in the table. Therefore, the claim's details don't match any game on May 10, so it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect as there's no game on May 10 in the provided data that matches all criteria: date, opponent, score, pitcher loss, and attendance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
