    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the longest gap in time between year be 4 year from 2009 to 2013.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about a time gap of four years between 2009 and 2013, but the wording is a bit unclear. Maybe it's referring to a specific event or change that happened in those years. But looking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1990 to 2013, with information about singles and doubles winners.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"the longest gap in time between year be 4 year from 2009 to 2013.\" That doesn't quite make sense grammatically. Maybe it's supposed to say that there's a four-year gap between 2009 and 2013? But that would only be four years apart because 2013 minus 2009 is 4, not considering the intermediate years. However, I think the user might have meant something else, perhaps referring to a gap in participation or winners' continuity.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check if there's any relevant information that would support the claim about a four-year gap. Since each row represents a specific year and lists winners for different categories, maybe the claim is suggesting that between 2009 and 2013, some pattern or change happened in the winners that spans four years.\n\nI should go through the table rows to see if there's anything that jumps out as having a significant change over those years. Starting from row 18 (year 2009), let me check each year up to 2013:\n\n- Row 18: 2009\n- Row 19: 2013\n\nWait, the last relevant row given is row 19 for 2013. So between 2009 and 2013, there's a four-year gap. But in reality, from 2009 to 2013, it's exactly four years apart. However, if we consider each year, maybe the claim is about something that happened in 2013 versus 2009, like a change in winners or sponsors.\n\nLooking at row 19 (2013), I see entries like men's singles: riichi takeshita, women's singles: deng xuan, etc. In 2009 (row 18), the winners are chan yan kit, sayaka sato, and others. Comparing these to earlier years might show a shift or gap in winners.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to something like the first time a particular player won after a four-year absence. For example, if a player won in 2009 and then again in 2013, that's exactly four years apart. But I'm not sure if any such information is provided in the table.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps there's a four-year difference in the introduction of a new category or event. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is misphrased and actually refers to something else, like a four-year period where certain players dominated. But without specific information on player continuity, it's difficult to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the time gap between two consecutive wins by a player or in a category. For example, if a player won in 2009 and then again in 2013, that's four years, which matches the claim. So I need to check if any player had their next win after four years.\n\nLooking at row 18 (2009), men's singles winner is chan yan kit. Then in row 19 (2013), men's singles is riichi takeshita. If Chan didn't win again in those years, it might not be relevant. Alternatively, maybe another category shows a player winning in both 2009 and 2013.\n\nWait, women's singles: row 18 has sayaka sato, and row 19 has deng xuan. So no same winner over four years there either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about the gap between the years represented in the table. For example, if the last year in the table before 2009 was 2008 (row 17), then from 2009 to 2013 is a four-year span as per the table's data. But that seems off because 2013 minus 2009 is indeed four years.\n\nWait, no, 2013 - 2009 = 4 years, so a gap of four years would mean from 2009 up to but not including 2013? Or does it include both years? I'm confused about the terminology here. The claim says \"the longest gap in time between year be 4 year from 2009 to 2013.\" Maybe it's referring to the duration being four years, so if something happened in 2009 and then again in 2013, that's a four-year gap.\n\nBut without specific data on events happening at four-year intervals, I can't directly confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the claim is about the number of years between two entries, but since the table only goes up to 2013, it's unclear.\n\nI think the most straightforward approach is to consider that from 2009 (row 18) to 2013 (row 19), there's a four-year difference. So if the claim is about the time span between these years being four years, then it's accurate.\n\nBut wait, row 18 is 2009 and row 19 is 2013, so that's exactly four years apart. Therefore, the gap between 2009 and 2013 is four years. Thus, the claim would be TRUE if it refers to this time span.\n\nHowever, the phrasing of the claim is a bit unclear, but I think it's safe to assume it's referring to the duration between those two years being four years. So, the relevant cells would be row 18 (2009) and row 19 (2013). Therefore, the answer should be TRUE with these two rows as the relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a four-year gap between 2009 and 2013, which matches the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the claim \"li feng be the most common women's single, appear 3 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on a given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions that \"li feng\" appears three times in the women's singles column across the years listed in the table. So my task is to go through each row of the table and check how many times \"li feng\" appears in the women's singles section.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows from 1990 (Row 1) up to 2013 (Row 19). Each row includes information about men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. But for this claim, I'm only interested in the women's singles column.\n\nSo I'll start by going through each row one by one, focusing on the women's singles entries. Let me list out all the women's singles entries:\n\n- Row 1: 1990 - Not mentioned.\n- Row 2: 1991 - Anna Oi Chan Lao.\n- Row 3: 1992 - Julie Still.\n- Row 4: 1993 - Rhona Robertson.\n- Row 5: 1994 - Song Yang.\n- Row 6: 1995 - Song Yang.\n- Row 7: 1996 - Li Feng. That's the first occurrence.\n- Row 8: 1997 - Li Feng. Second occurrence.\n- Row 9: 1998 - Li Feng. Third occurrence.\n- Row 10: 2000 - Rhona Robertson.\n- Row 11: 2002 - Kim Ji-Hyun.\n- Row 12: 2003 - Lenny Permananta.\n- Row 13: 2004 - Huang Chia-Chi.\n- Row 14: 2005 - Adriyanti Firdasari.\n- Row 15: 2006 - Huang Chia-Chi.\n- Row 16: 2007 - Zhou Mi.\n- Row 17: 2008 - Zhou Mi.\n- Row 18: 2009 - Sayaka Sato.\n- Row 19: 2013 - Deng Xuan.\n\nFrom this list, \"Li Feng\" appears in Rows 7, 8, and 9, which correspond to the years 1996, 1997, and 1998. That's three times. Now, I need to check if she is indeed the most common women's singles player in the table.\n\nTo determine this, I should count how many times each women's singles player appears. Let me go through them again:\n\n1. **Anna Oi Chan Lao**: 1991 - 1 time.\n2. **Julie Still**: 1992 - 1 time.\n3. **Rhona Robertson**: 1993, 2000 - 2 times.\n4. **Song Yang**: 1994, 1995 - 2 times.\n5. **Li Feng**: 1996-1998 - 3 times.\n6. **Kim Ji-Hyun**: 2002 - 1 time.\n7. **Lenny Permananta**: 2003 - 1 time.\n8. **Huang Chia-Chi**: 2004, 2006 - 2 times.\n9. **Adriyanti Firdasari**: 2005 - 1 time.\n10. **Zhou Mi**: 2007, 2008 - 2 times.\n11. **Sayaka Sato**: 2009 - 1 time.\n12. **Deng Xuan**: 2013 - 1 time.\n\nLooking at these counts, \"Li Feng\" appears three times, which is more than any other player in the women's singles column. Therefore, she is indeed the most common, appearing three times.\n\nSo, the claim that \"li feng be the most common women's single, appear 3 times\" is supported by the data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"Women's singles\"}, {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"Women's singles\"}, {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"Women's singles\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Daniel Shirley John Gordon be the only men's double partner to appear more than 1 time.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are a specific pair who have appeared together in the men's doubles category more than once across the years listed in the table. So, my task is to check all the entries for men's doubles partners and see if this particular duo appears two or more times.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1990 to 2009, except for 2013 which is included but seems like it might be an error because the last rows jump from 2009 to 2013. I'll focus on the years up to 2009 since that's where most of the data is.\n\nI need to go through each row and look at the men's doubles entries. Let me list out all the men's doubles pairs:\n\nRow 1: Nicholas Hall & Dean Galt\nRow 2: Peter Blackburn & Darren McDonald\nRow 3: Dean Galt & Andrew Compton\nRow 4: Dean Galt & Kerrin Harrison\nRow 5: Michael Helber & Michael Keck\nRow 6: He Tim Chan & Siu Kwong (I think the last name might be missing, but assuming it's complete)\nRow 7: Ma Che Kong & Chow Kin Man\nRow 8: Ma Che Kong & Liu Kwok Wa\nRow 9: Daniel Shirley & Dean Galt\nRow 10: Daniel Shirley & John Gordon\nRow 11: Daniel Shirley & John Gordon\nRow 12: Ashley Brehaut & Travis Denney\nRow 13: Suichi Nakao & Suichi Sakamoto\nRow 14: Boyd Cooper & Travis Denney\nRow 15: Eng Hian & Rian Sukmawan\nRow 16: Chan Chong Ming & Hoon Thien How\nRow 17: Chen Hung Ling & Lin Yu Lang\nRow 18: Ruseph Kumar & Sanave Thomas\n\nNow, focusing on the claim about Daniel Shirley and John Gordon. Looking at the table:\n\n- In Row 10 (2008), men's doubles are Daniel Shirley and John Gordon.\n- In Row 11 (2009), again, it's Daniel Shirley and John Gordon.\n\nWait, hold on. The years in the table might be inconsistent because Row 10 is labeled as 2008, but when I look at the data, after Row 16 (2007), comes Row 17 as 2008, then Row 18 as 2009, and Row 19 as 2013. So, perhaps the years are correctly assigned.\n\nSo in 2008 (Row 10) and 2009 (Row 11), Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are paired together. That's two instances. Now, I need to check if any other men's doubles pair appears more than once.\n\nLooking at other pairs:\n\n- Row 1: Nicholas Hall & Dean Galt\n- Row 3: Dean Galt with different partners each time.\n- Row 4: Another partner for Dean Galt.\n- Row 5: Different pair.\n- Row 6: New pair.\n- Row 7: Ma Che Kong with two different partners (Rows 7 and 8).\n- Row 9: Daniel Shirley with a different partner.\n- Rows 10-11: Same pair as per the claim.\n\nSo, besides Daniel Shirley and John Gordon, are there any other men's doubles pairs that appear more than once? Let's see:\n\nRow 12: Ashley Brehaut & Travis Denney \u2013 only once.\nRow 13: New pair.\nRow 14: Boyd Cooper & Travis Denney \u2013 different from Row 12.\nRow 15: New pair.\nRow 16: Chan Chong Ming & Hoon Thien How \u2013 new.\nRow 17: Chen Hung Ling & Lin Yu Lang \u2013 new.\nRow 18: Ruseph Kumar & Sanave Thomas \u2013 new.\n\nSo, only Daniel Shirley and John Gordon appear twice in the men's doubles. Therefore, they are indeed the only pair to have appeared more than once. The claim seems correct based on this analysis.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Men 's doubles\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Men 's doubles\"}]}",

So my task is to check how many times Geoffrey Bellingham appears in the \"men 's singles\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year from 1990 to 2009 and beyond, up to 2013. Each row has several categories: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, etc. I need to focus only on the \"men 's singles\" cells.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1 (1990): Men's singles is Nicholas Hall.\n- Row 2 (1991): Wei Yan.\n- Row 3 (1992): Dean Galt.\n- Row 4 (1993): Dean Galt.\n- Row 5 (1994): Oliver Pongratz.\n- Row 6 (1995): Tam Kai Chuen.\n- Row 7 (1996): Tam Kai Chuen.\n- Row 8 (1997): Nicholas Hall.\n- Row 9 (1998): Geoffrey Bellingham.\n- Row 10 (2000): Geoffrey Bellingham.\n- Row 11 (2002): Geoffrey Bellingham.\n- Row 12 (2003): Shoji Sato.\n- Row 13 (2004): Andrew Smith.\n- Row 14 (2005): Sairul Amar Ayob.\n- Row 15 (2006): Lee Tsuen Seng.\n- Row 16 (2007): Andre Kurniawan Tedjono.\n- Row 17 (2008): Lee Tsuen Seng.\n- Row 18 (2009): Chan Yan Kit.\n- Row 19 (2013): Riichi Takeshita.\n\nNow, I'll count how many times Geoffrey Bellingham appears. From the above, he is listed in rows 9, 10, and 11, which are three instances. So that's three times.\n\nThe claim says \"appear 3 time,\" so it seems correct at first glance. However, I should check if there are any other years beyond 2013 because the table goes up to 2013. But looking at row 19 (2013), the men's singles is Riichi Takeshita, so no more after that.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rows again. Rows 9-11: yes, Bellingham is there three times. Are there any others? No, he doesn't appear in other years. So he appears exactly three times.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify if \"Geoffrey Bellingham\" appears three times in the men's singles column:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Cells**: Only cells in the \"men 's singles\" column are relevant for this check.\n2. **Count Occurrences**: Geoffrey Bellingham is found in rows 9, 10, and 11, totaling three occurrences.\n\nSince he appears exactly three times, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"men 's singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the most common women 's double be rhona robertson and tammy jenkins who appear 4 time.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's suggesting that in the table, Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are the most common women's doubles players, appearing four times each. So, my task is to check each row of the table for their appearances in the \"women 's doubles\" column.\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one, focusing on the \"women 's doubles\" entries. I need to count how many times Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together as women's doubles partners across different years.\n\nLet me list out the rows where these names might appear:\n\n- Row 1 (1990): women's doubles: rhona robertson lynne scutt. So, Rhona is here with Lynne Scutt.\n- Row 2 (1991): women's doubles: rhonda cator anna oi chan lao. No Rhona or Tammy here.\n- Row 3 (1992): women's doubles: rhona robertson tammy jenkins. Here, both are present together.\n- Row 4 (1993): women's doubles: rhona robertson liao yue jin. Only Rhona here.\n- Row 5 (1994): No Rhona or Tammy.\n- Row 6 (1995): women's doubles: rhona robertson tammy jenkins again.\n- Row 7 (1996): Same as above.\n- Row 8 (1997): Again, both present.\n- Row 9 (1998): Both together once more.\n- Row 10 (2000): No Rhona or Tammy.\n- Row 11 (2002): Tammy is here with others, but without Rhona.\n- Row 12 (2003): Nicole and Rebecca, so no.\n- Row 13 (2004): Rachel and Rebecca, not our pair.\n- Row 14 (2005): No Rhona or Tammy.\n- Row 15 (2006): Different names.\n- Row 16 (2007): Not them.\n- Row 17 (2008): Chien and Chin, nope.\n- Row 18 (2009): Annisa and Anneke, not relevant.\n- Row 19 (2013): No Rhona or Tammy.\n\nNow, let's count how many times each appears together:\n\nLooking at the rows where both are present: 1992, 1996, 1998. Wait, in my initial scan, I think I might have miscounted. Let me go through again more carefully.\n\nRow 1: Rhona with Lynne.\nRow 3: Both present.\nRow 6: Both present.\nRow 7: Both present.\nRow 8: Both present.\nRow 9: Both present.\n\nSo that's 1990 (Rhona only), and from 1992 onwards every even year up to 1998, both are together. Wait no, Row 3 is 1992, then 1996, 1998\u2014so each time they partner again. So in those rows, both appear together.\n\nWait, actually, the claim says \"appear 4 times.\" So I need to count how many times each of them appears across all women's doubles entries, not necessarily always together.\n\nLet me reevaluate that approach because perhaps I was too focused on their pairs.\n\nInstead, I should look for each occurrence where Rhona or Tammy is in the women's doubles column, regardless of who they're paired with.\n\nSo I'll count all rows where Rhona appears and all rows where Tammy appears, then see how many times each does so overall.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n\nRow 1: Rhona appears once.\nRow 3: Both appear.\nRow 4: Rhona appears again.\nRow 6: Both appear again.\nRow 7: Both appear again.\nRow 8: Both appear again.\nRow 9: Both appear again.\n\nWait, no, Row 9 is 1998. So let me list each occurrence:\n\nRhona's appearances:\n- 1990 (Row 1)\n- 1992 (Row3)\n- 1994? No, she's not in that row.\nWait, actually, looking back:\n\nRow 1: 1990: Rhona\nRow3: 1992: Both\nRow4: 1993: Rhona\nRow6: 1995: Both?\nWait no, Row6 is 1995: women's doubles: rhona robertson and tammy jenkins. So both are there.\n\nSimilarly, Row7 (1996): both again.\nRow8 (1997): both again.\nRow9 (1998): both again.\n\nSo Rhona appears in 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998. That's 7 times as part of the women's doubles.\n\nTammy's appearances:\nSame rows where she is present with Rhona: 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998. So that's 5 times.\n\nWait, no\u2014each time they are together, both count once for their individual appearances. So actually, each of these rows adds one to both counts.\n\nSo Rhona appears in:\n- 1990: 1\n- 1992: 1\n- 1993: 1\n- 1995: 1\n- 1996: 1\n- 1997: 1\n- 1998: 1\nTotal: 7 times.\n\nTammy appears in:\n- 1992: 1\n- 1995: 1\n- 1996: 1\n- 1997: 1\n- 1998: 1\nTotal: 5 times.\n\nSo Rhona appears more frequently than Tammy. The claim says both appear four times, but according to this, Rhona appears seven times and Tammy five times. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states they each appear four times when in fact Rhona appears more, and Tammy less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row where either is present:\n\nRhona:\n- 1990: yes\n- 1992: yes\n- 1993: yes\n- 1995: yes\n- 1996: yes\n- 1997: yes\n- 1998: yes\nThat's seven times.\n\nTammy:\n- 1992: yes\n- 1995: yes\n- 1996: yes\n- 1997: yes\n- 1998: yes\nThat's five times.\n\nSo the claim says both appear four times, but Rhona appears seven times and Tammy five. So it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the task is to determine whether each of them appears four times in the women's doubles.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining how many times each person (Rhona and Tammy) appears in the women's doubles column across the provided rows. Based on the analysis:\n\n- **Rhona** appears a total of 7 times.\n- **Tammy** appears a total of 5 times.\n\nSince both do not appear four times each, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect because Rhona and Tammy do not each appear four times in the women's doubles column. Rhona appears seven times and Tammy five times.",

So, my goal is to check how many times Song Yang won the women's singles and compare that number with the wins of other players in the same event.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different year from 1990 to 2009, except for some missing years like 1998, 2001, 2002, etc. Each row lists winners for men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find where Song Yang is listed as the winner of the women's singles. Let me go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1 (1990)**: Women's singles winner is Stephanie Spicer.\n- **Row 2 (1991)**: Women's singles winner is Anna Oi Chan Lao.\n- **Row 3 (1992)**: Women's singles winner is Julie Still.\n- **Row 4 (1993)**: Women's singles winner is Rhona Robertson.\n- **Row 5 (1994)**: Women's singles winner is Song Yang. So, that's one win for Song Yang in 1994.\n- **Row 6 (1995)**: Women's singles winner is Song Yang again. That's two wins so far.\n- **Row 7 (1996)**: Women's singles winner is Li Feng.\n- **Row 8 (1997)**: Women's singles winner is Li Feng.\n- **Row 9 (1998)**: Women's singles winner is Li Feng.\n- **Row 10 (2000)**: Women's singles winner is Rhona Robertson.\n- **Row 11 (2002)**: Women's singles winner is Kim Ji-Hyun.\n- **Row 12 (2003)**: Women's singles winner is Sayaka Sato.\n- **Row 13 (2006)**: Not sure if this row exists, but looking ahead, Row 15 mentions Song Yang again? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, the table provided goes up to Row 19, which seems to cover years up to 2013. So, let's list out the women's singles winners properly.\n\nI realize I might have skipped some rows, so I should list all relevant rows:\n\n- **Row 5 (1994)**: Song Yang\n- **Row 6 (1995)**: Song Yang\n\nAfter that, in Row 10 (2000), Rhona Robertson wins again. Then, the next mention of Song Yang is not until Row 19 (2013) where she's listed as a winner? Wait, no. Looking at Row 15 (2006), women's singles winner is Huay Chia, which might be Huang Chia-Chi or similar. But in Row 16 (2007), it's Zhou Mi, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the table, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine:\n\n- **Row 5 (1994)**: Song Yang\n- **Row 6 (1995)**: Song Yang\n\nThen in later years, like Row 19 (2013), it's Deng Xuan. So between 1994 and 1995, Song Yang won twice.\n\nNow, I need to check how many times Song Yang has won the women's singles compared to other players. Let me see if any other player has more than two wins in the same event.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rhona Robertson: She won in 1993 and 2000. So that's two wins.\n- Li Feng: She won from 1996 to 1998, so three times? Wait, Row 7 (1996), Row 8 (1997), Row 9 (1998) \u2013 yes, three wins for Li Feng.\n- Anna Oi Chan Lao: One win in 1991.\n- Julie Still: One win in 1992.\n- Sayaka Sato: One win in 2003.\n- Kim Ji-Hyun: One win in 2002.\n- Deng Xuan: One win in 2013.\n\nSo, Li Feng has three wins. Song Yang only has two wins. So according to the table, Li Feng has won the women's singles more times than Song Yang.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Song Yang win the women 's single more than any other player\" is FALSE because Li Feng has more wins.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Women's Singles\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Women's Singles\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the longest gap in time between new zealand open event be 3 year.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what's being asked. It seems like we're looking for the longest consecutive gap between two New Zealand Open events listed in the table and checking if that gap is exactly three years.\n\nLooking at the table, it spans from 1990 to 2009, then jumps to 2013, which is a big jump. So I need to focus on these larger gaps, especially between 2009 and 2013 because they might be the longest.\n\nLet me list out all the years in order:\n\n- Row1: 1990\n- Row2: 1991\n- Row3: 1992\n- Row4: 1993\n- Row5: 1994\n- Row6: 1995\n- Row7: 1996\n- Row8: 1997\n- Row9: 1998\n- Row10: 2000 (Wait, this skips 1999)\n- Row11: 2002 (Skips 2001)\n- Row12: 2003\n- Row13: 2004\n- Row14: 2005\n- Row15: 2006\n- Row16: 2007\n- Row17: 2008\n- Row18: 2009 (Skips 2010)\n- Row19: 2013 (Skipping 2011, 2012)\n\nSo between 1990 and 2000, the gap is 10 years. Then between 1998 and 2000, it's 2 years. Between 2000 and 2002, it's 2 years again. But the big jumps are:\n\n- From 2009 to 2013: That's a 4-year gap.\n- Wait, but from 2009 to 2013 is actually 4 years because we count the start year as part of the gap? No, wait, if it's from 2009 to 2013, that's 4 years apart (2013 - 2009 = 4). But let me clarify: If two events are in consecutive years, the gap is 1. So between 2009 and 2010 would be a 1-year gap. But here, from 2009 to 2013, there's no event in 2010, 2011, or 2012, so the next event is 2013, which is 4 years after 2009.\n\nBut wait, the table provided goes up to Row19: 2013. So between 2009 and 2013, the gap is 4 years. Is there any longer gap?\n\nLooking at other gaps:\n\n- From 1998 (Row9) to 2000 (Row10): that's a 2-year gap.\n- From 2002 (Row11) to 2003 (Row12): that's 1 year.\n- Similarly, Row17 is 2008, Row18 is 2009: that's a 1-year gap.\n- Then from Row18: 2009 to Row19: 2013 is the big one at 4 years.\n\nWait, but in the table, after Row10 (2000), the next event is Row11 (2002). So between 2000 and 2002, that's a 2-year gap. Then from 2002 onwards, events are yearly until 2009, then jumps to 2013.\n\nSo the gaps are:\n\n- Between 1998 and 2000: 2 years\n- Between 2000 and 2002: 2 years\n- Between 2002 and 2003: 1 year\n- ... and so on, until between 2009 and 2013: 4 years.\n\nSo the longest gap is 4 years. But the claim says \"the longest gap... be 3 years.\" So if the maximum gap is 4, then the claim is false because it's not exactly 3 years.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how gaps are calculated. For example, sometimes when determining event frequency, you count the difference between consecutive events. So from 2009 to 2013 is 4 years apart, which would mean a gap of 4 years, not 3. So that's longer than 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the number of years skipped. From 2009 to 2010: one year skip (if you consider events in 2009 and 2010 as consecutive). But I think the standard way is to count the difference between the later year and the earlier year.\n\nSo 2013 - 2009 = 4 years apart, so the gap is 4 years. Therefore, the longest gap isn't 3 years; it's longer.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the longest gap between New Zealand Open events is exactly three years, we need to examine the event years in the table:\n\n- The table spans from 1990 through 2009 and then jumps to 2013, which creates a significant gap of 4 years (2013 - 2009).\n\nThis gap exceeds three years, thus supporting the conclusion that the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim is: \"daniel shirley john gordon win the men 's double event 4 time as a team.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It mentions that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon won the men's doubles event four times together. So I need to look for any instance where both of them are listed in the men's doubles category across different years.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a year from 1990 to 2009 (and beyond, but since the claim is about their wins, I should focus on the years they might have participated together). \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row for Daniel Shirley and John Gordon in the men's doubles column.\n\nRow 1 to Row 18 are the relevant rows as per the table given. Wait, actually, looking at the rows, from year 1990 (row 1) up to 2013 (row 19), but the claim is about four times, so perhaps they were active over multiple years.\n\nI'll go through each row and check if both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are present in the men's doubles column for the same year. If I find such a case, it might indicate that they won together in that year. But since the claim says \"win... four time,\" I need to see if there are at least four instances.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Men's doubles has Peter Blackburn and Darren McDonald. Not Daniel or John.\nRow 2: Men's doubles have Peter Blackburn, Darren McDonald, but not them.\nRow 3: Men's doubles is Dean Galt and Andrew Compton.\nRow 4: Men's doubles is Dean Galt with Kerrin Harrison.\nRow 5: Michael Helber and Michael Keck.\nRow 6: He Tim Chan and Siu Kwong.\nRow 7: Ma Che Kong, Chow Kin Man.\nRow 8: Ma Che Kong, Liu Kwok Wa.\nRow 9: Daniel Shirley is paired with someone else (not John Gordon).\nWait, in row 9, the men's doubles are Daniel Shirley and someone. So that's one instance where Daniel is playing, but not with John.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 10: Not relevant as per the table provided? Wait, no, let me check again. The rows go up to 19, so perhaps I missed some. Wait, in row 15, men's doubles are Eng Hian and Rian Su kmawan. Not them.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all the years where Daniel Shirley is present in the men's doubles:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 9: Men's doubles have Daniel Shirley and someone else (not John).\nRow 10: Not sure if it's part of the table. Wait, the table provided has rows from 1 to 19, corresponding to years starting from 1990 up.\n\nWait, in the claim, the user mentioned \"row_index\":0 to \"row_index\":18? Or up to 19? Let me check the JSON example given by the user, which includes row indices up to 18. Wait, no, in the example, it's up to 1, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the table is from 1990 (row 1) to 2013 (row 19). So rows go from 1 to 19. But in the JSON example, the answer uses row indices starting at 0. Wait, but in the user's instruction, the example has {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"}, etc., so perhaps they are using 0-based indexing for rows. So row 0 is year 1990, row 1 is 1991, and so on.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the table, each row starts with a year. For example, row 1 corresponds to 1990. So in the JSON, \"row_index\" seems to start from 0 for 1990? Or does it start from 0 as the first data row? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that.\n\nBut regardless, I need to find the specific cells where both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are listed in the men's doubles column across different years. Each such occurrence would count towards their joint victories.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n- In row 9 (year 2008), men's doubles: Daniel Shirley and someone else.\n- Row 10 (2009): Not sure, but perhaps it's beyond the table provided by the user. Wait, in the table provided, up to row 19 is 2013.\n\nWait, let me check each year:\n\nRow 1: No\nRow 2: No\nRow 3: No\nRow 4: No\nRow 5: No\nRow 6: No\nRow 7: No\nRow 8: No\nRow 9: Yes, Daniel Shirley is there but not John.\nRow 10: Not provided in the table. Wait, perhaps I need to assume that the table is complete up to row 19 (2013). So after row 9, which is 2008, we have:\n\nRow 10: 2009\nRow 11: 2010\nRow 12: 2011\nRow 13: 2012\nRow 14: 2013\n\nWait, but the table provided goes up to row 19 (2013). So I'll need to check from row 9 (2008) onwards.\n\nIn row 10 (2009): men's doubles are Ruseph Kumar and Sanave Thomas. Not Daniel or John.\nRow 11: 2010\nRow 12: 2011\nRow 13: 2012\nRow 14: 2013\n\nNone of these have both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon together.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rows in between? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 9 (2008): men's doubles are Daniel Shirley and someone else.\n- Then, from 2009 onwards, no entries for both Daniel and John.\n\nSo the only occurrence where Daniel is paired with someone is once. Therefore, he didn't win four times with John. Thus, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check if there are any other instances where both are together. Let me scan again.\n\nWait, in row 15 (2006): men's doubles: Eng Hian and Rian Su kmawan. Not them.\nRow 16: 2007\nRow 17: 2008: Daniel Shirley with someone else.\nRow 18: 2009\nRow 19: 2013.\n\nSo, only once do I see Daniel Shirley in the men's doubles column without John Gordon. Therefore, they didn't win four times together. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon won the men's doubles event four times. By examining each row of the provided table, we find that Daniel is present only once (in 2008) without John. Thus, they did not achieve four victories together.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"type\": \"Answer\",\n    \"text\": \"The claim is false because Daniel Shirley and John Gordon only won the men's doubles event together once.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim states: \"Rona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins win the event more than any other team, winning 5 times.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which cells are relevant. Looking at the table, I see that each row represents a different year from 1990 to 2009, except for 2013. The relevant columns here are \"men's singles,\" \"women's singles,\" \"men's doubles,\" and \"women's doubles.\" However, since the claim is about a team winning more times, perhaps it refers to mixed doubles? Or maybe any of these events.\n\nWait, actually, the term \"event\" in the claim could refer to a specific category. But given that Rona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are names appearing across multiple years, I need to check their participation each year.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- In 1990: Mixed doubles include Brent Chapman and Tammy Jenkins.\n- 1991: No mention of Tammy Jenkins as a partner.\n- 1992: Mixed doubles have Grant Walker and Sheree Jefferson. Tammy isn't listed here.\n- 1993: Mixed doubles are Dean Galt and Liao Yue Jin, so no Tammy again.\n- 1994: Mixed doubles are Peter Blackburn and Rhonda Cator. No Tammy.\n- 1995: Mixed doubles include He Tim Chan and Oi Ni, not Tammy.\n- 1996: Tammy is with Tung Chau Man in mixed doubles.\n- 1997: Tammy pairs with Ma Che Kong, so that's two wins.\n- 1998: Dean Galt and Tammy Jenkins again, so three times.\n- 2000: No Tammy here.\n- 2002: No Tammy.\n- 2003 onwards: No Tammy.\n\nWait, but Rona Robertson is mentioned in the claim. Let me check her participation:\n\nRona Robertson appears in women's doubles starting from 1990, continuing through at least 1996 and 1997. So she was part of multiple teams over the years.\n\nBut the claim says \"Rona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins win the event more than any other team, winning 5 times.\" So I need to count how many times each pair won together or individually.\n\nLooking specifically for when Rona and Tammy were partners:\n\n- In 1990: Mixed doubles have Brent Chapman & Tammy. No Rona here.\n- 1996: Women's doubles have Chien Yu Chin & Chou Chia Chi, not Rona.\n- 1997: Women's doubles are Chien Yu Chin & Chou Chia Chi again, but no Rona.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about individual wins rather than team wins. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of times they each won in their respective categories.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is about a specific event category where both are present, like mixed doubles, then let's check how many times Tammy Jenkins was part of a winning team with any partner.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- 1990: Mixed doubles - Tammy wins (Brent Chapman)\n- 1996: Mixed doubles - Tammy wins (Tung Chau Man)\n- 1997: Mixed doubles - Tammy wins (Ma Che Kong)\n- 1998: Mixed doubles - Tammy wins (Dean Galt)\n\nThat's four times. Wait, but in 2009, there's a mention of Annisa Wahyuni and Anneke Feinya Agustin as women's doubles, not Tammy.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all the mixed doubles entries where Tammy is present:\n\n1990: Yes\n1996: Yes\n1997: Yes\n1998: Yes\n\nThat's four times. So if the claim says they won 5 times, that would be false. But wait, maybe I missed a year.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1990: Mixed doubles with Tammy.\n- 1991: No\n- 1992: No\n- 1993: No\n- 1994: No\n- 1995: No\n- 1996: Yes\n- 1997: Yes\n- 1998: Yes\n- 2000 onwards: No\n\nSo that's four times. Therefore, the claim stating they won five times would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in 1998. Let me check:\n\nIn 1998, row 18 (since rows start at 0 for 1990?), wait no, looking back, the table starts with year 1990 as row 0? Or is it that each row corresponds to consecutive years starting from 1990.\n\nWait, actually, the table has rows labeled from 0 to 19. So row 0 is 1990, row 1 is 1991, etc., up to row 19 being 2013.\n\nSo for mixed doubles with Tammy:\n\nRow 0 (1990): Yes\nRow 15 (2006): No\nRow 16 (2007): No\nRow 17 (2008): No\nRow 18 (2009): No\n\nWait, no. Wait, in row 17 (2008), mixed doubles are Chen Hung Ling and Chou Chia Chi.\n\nSo the mixed doubles with Tammy are:\n\n- 1990: Yes (Brent Chapman)\n- 1996: Yes (Tung Chau Man)\n- 1997: Yes (Ma Che Kong)\n- 1998: Yes (Dean Galt)\n\nThat's four times. So the claim says five, which would be incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, Rona Robertson appears in women's doubles from 1990 onwards:\n\nRow 0 (1990): Women's doubles with Chien Yu Chin.\nRow 1 (1991): No\nRow 2 (1992): Yes (Chien Yu Chin)\nRow 3 (1993): Yes (Chien Yu Chin)\nRow 4 (1994): Yes (Jiang Yanmei vs Li Yujia)\nRow 5 (2006): Yes (Jiang Yanmei vs Li Yujia)\nRow 6 (2007): No\nRow 7 (2008): No\nRow 8 (2009): No\n\nWait, that's six times. So Rona Robertson has won more times than Tammy Jenkins in their respective categories.\n\nBut the claim is about both of them winning together five times. Since Tammy only has four wins, and Rona has more, the claim would be false.\n\nMoreover, even if considering individual wins across all categories, Rona might have more than five, but the claim is specifically about a team winning five times, which isn't supported by the data as Tammy only won four times in mixed doubles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"year\": 1990, \"event\": \"Mixed Doubles\", \"winners\": [\"Brent Chapman\", \"Tammy\"]},\n    {\"year\": 1996, \"event\": \"Mixed Doubles\", \"winners\": [\"Tung Chau Man\", \"Tammy\"]},\n    {\"year\": 1997, \"event\": \"Mixed Doubles\", \"winners\": [\"Ma Che Kong\", \"Tammy\"]},\n    {\"year\": 1998, \"event\": \"Mixed Doubles\", \"winners\": [\"Dean Galt\", \"Tammy\"]}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Wait, no. Let me check Row 7:\n\nYear 1996:\nMen's singles: Tam Kui Chuen? No, wait. The row says \"men 's singles: tam kai chuen\" or not?\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nRow 6: year 1995, men 's singles: tam kai chuen\n\nRow 7: year 1996, men 's singles: tam kai chuen? Let me check.\n\nYes, Row 6 (1995) and Row 7 (1996): Tam Kai Chuen won in both years. Then in Row 8 (1997), the men's singles winner is Nicholas Hall again. So Tam has two wins by then.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 9: Year 2000? Wait, no, the table jumps from 1999 to 2013. Let me check the rows properly.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the provided data, it goes up to year 2013 in Row 19. So I need to go through each row's men's singles winner and tally how many times Tam Kai Chuen won.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 6: 1995 - Tam wins\nRow 7: 1996 - Tam wins\nRow 8: 1997 - Nicholas Hall\nRow 9: 1998 - Not provided, but perhaps not needed if there are no more Tam wins.\nWait, actually, the table doesn't show every year; it jumps from 1993 to 2013. So we have to look for any rows where Tam Kai Chuen is the men's singles winner.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Nicholas Hall - not Tam\nRow 2: Wei Yan - no\nRow 3: Dean Galt - no\nRow 4: Dean Galt again\nRow 5: Oliver Pongratz\nRow 6: Tam Kai Chuen (1)\nRow 7: Tam Kai Chuen (2)\nRow 8: Nicholas Hall\nThen, from Row 9 to Row 18, I don't see any mention of Tam Kai Chuen in men's singles; he appears in mixed doubles but not as the singles winner. For example:\n\nRow 6: Mixed doubles: Tam Kai Chuen and others.\nRow 7: Mixed doubles: same.\nWait, no, actually, looking at Row 7: Men's singles: Tam Kui Chuen? Or is it another player?\n\nWait, let me clarify each row carefully.\n\nEach row has several columns, but the relevant column for men's singles is \"men 's single event\".\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 6 (1995): men 's single: tam kai chuen\n\nRow 7 (1996): men 's single: tam kai chuen? Let me check.\n\nWait, in Row 7, it says: \n\n\"Year\": 1996,\n\"men 's single event\": \"tam kai chuen\"\n\nYes, so Tam won again in 1996. So that's two wins by 1996.\n\nThen, from 1997 (Row 8) onwards until 2013, I don't see any mention of Tam Kai Chuen winning men's singles again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check Row 17: 2008\n\nIn Row 17, Men's singles: Lee Tsuen Seng.\n\nNo, Tam isn't there.\n\nRow 19 (2013): Men's singles: Riichi Takeshita.\n\nSo Tam Kai Chuen only won in 1995 and 1996, giving him two wins. Now, I need to check if any other player has more than that or not. The claim is that he \"win the men 's single event more than any other player.\" So even if another player also has two wins but no more, then Tam hasn't won more than all others.\n\nBut looking at the table, many players have won the men's singles multiple times:\n\n- Nicholas Hall: 1990, 1997\n- Wei Yan: 1991\n- Dean Galt: 1992, 1993\n- Oliver Pongratz: 1994\n- Tam Kai Chuen: 1995, 1996 (two wins)\n- Then, from 2000 onwards, other players like Lee Tsuen Seng, etc., have won once or more.\n\nSo Tam has two wins. Let's see if anyone else has more than two.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1999, perhaps not shown here.\nWait, the table goes up to 2013, so let me check for any players who might have won multiple times beyond that.\n\nFor example, in Row 18 (2009): Men's singles: Chan Yan Kit.\n\nRow 19 (2013): Riichi Takeshita.\n\nSo it seems that each year is a different winner or at least not repeating as frequently. But wait, let me check if any player besides Tam has more than two wins.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Nicholas Hall: 1990 and 1997 \u2192 two wins\n- Wei Yan: 1991 \u2192 one\n- Dean Galt: 1992, 1993 \u2192 two\n- Oliver Pongratz: 1994 \u2192 one\n- Tam Kai Chuen: 1995, 1996 \u2192 two\n- Then from 2000 onwards, the winners are different each year or not repeating beyond two wins.\n\nWait, let me check if any player has more than two wins. For example:\n\nLooking at Row 15 (2006): Men's singles: Lee Tsuen Seng.\n\nRow 16 (2007): Not provided? Or maybe I need to check the data again.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, after Row 8 (1997), it goes up to Row 19 (2013). So from 1998 onwards, the winners are:\n\n- 1998: Not listed here\n- 2000: ?\nWait, perhaps I should not rely on that. Alternatively, each year is a different winner except for those who have two wins.\n\nSo if Tam has two wins and others like Nicholas Hall and Dean Galt also have two, then the claim that he \"win... more than any other player\" would be false because they have the same number.\n\nTherefore, since multiple players have at least two wins each, Tam does not have more than all of them. So the statement is incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some rows where a player has won three times or more?\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn the provided data, let's list all men's singles winners and their counts:\n\n1. 1990: Nicholas Hall (1)\n2. 1991: Wei Yan (1)\n3. 1992: Dean Galt (1)\n4. 1993: Dean Galt (2)\n5. 1994: Oliver Pongratz (1)\n6. 1995: Tam Kai Chuen (1)\n7. 1996: Tam Kai Chuen (2)\n8. 1997: Nicholas Hall (2)\n9. 2000: Not listed\n10. 2001: Not listed\n11. 2002: Not listed\n12. 2003: Not listed\n13. 2004: Not listed\n14. 2005: Not listed\n15. 2006: Lee Tsuen Seng (1)\n16. 2007: Possibly another winner not shown\n17. 2008: Lee Tsuen Seng again? Or different?\nWait, in Row 17, it's:\n\n\"Year\": 2008,\n\"men 's single event\": \"Lee Tsuen Seng\"\n\nSo Lee won in 2008.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 18 (2009), winner is Chan Yan Kit.\n\nRow 19 (2013): Riichi Takeshita.\n\nSo, each of these winners only has one or two wins. Wait, no: Nicholas Hall has two, Tam two, Dean Galt two, etc.\n\nWait, I think the key point is that multiple players have won twice. Therefore, if someone else also has two, then Tam isn't winning more than all others\u2014they tie with some.\n\nBut the claim is that he wins \"more than any other player,\" which would require him to have strictly more than every other player. Since at least one other (Nicholas and Dean) have two as well, the statement is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only shows up to 2013, so maybe in reality, no other player has won twice except Tam and those two. But even if that's the case, the claim would still be incorrect because others have the same number.\n\nWait, but actually, looking again:\n\nNicholas Hall: 1990, 1997 \u2192 two wins\nTam Kai Chuen: 1995, 1996 \u2192 two wins\nDean Galt: 1992, 1993 \u2192 two wins\n\nSo all three have two wins. Therefore, Tam doesn't have more than any other; he's tied with at least some.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect because there are other players who have won as many times or more than him.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me make a list:\n\n- Nicholas Hall: 1990, 1997 \u2192 two wins\n- Wei Yan: 1991 \u2192 one\n- Dean Galt: 1992, 1993 \u2192 two\n- Oliver Pongratz: 1994 \u2192 one\n- Tam Kai Chuen: 1995, 1996 \u2192 two\n- Lee Tsuen Seng: 2006, 2008 \u2192 two wins (if he won again in 2008)\nWait, wait. In Row 15: 2006, winner: Lee Tsuen Seng.\n\nRow 17: 2008, winner: Lee Tsuen Seng again? Or is it a different Lee?\n\nWait, looking at Row 17:\n\n\"Year\": 2008,\n\"men 's single event\": \"Lee Tsuen Seng\"\n\nSo if that's the same person who won in 2006, then he has two wins. So now, Lee also has two.\n\nSimilarly, others might have more than one.\n\nWait, but without knowing all the winners, it's hard to say for sure. However, based on the given data, Tam Kai Chuen has at least two wins. Similarly, Nicholas Hall and Dean Galt each have two, and possibly Lee Tsuen Seng as well. Therefore, the claim that he has more than any other is false.\n\nTherefore, the statement is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"You are guaranteed to win more than any other player\" is incorrect based on the analysis of the provided data. Multiple players, including Nicholas Hall, Dean Galt, and potentially others, have won two or more times, tying with Tam Kai Chuen. Thus, the claim that Tam wins more than all others is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is incorrect because multiple players, such as Nicholas Hall and Dean Galt, have also won two or more times, matching Tam's record.",
