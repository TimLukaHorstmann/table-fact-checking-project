    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the golden state game be play at the at&t center 18581 people attend.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions a game involving the Golden State team, which was played at the AT&T Center with 18,581 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific game. The first step is to find all games where the team is \"golden state.\" Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 67: Team is Golden State.\n- Any others? Let me check again... No, only Row 67 seems to have the Golden State team.\n\nNext, I need to verify that this game was played at AT&T Center with 18,581 attendees. In Row 67, the location attendance is listed as 18,278. That's different from what the claim states (18,581). \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row for \"golden state.\" Only Row 67 matches that team name. The attendance in that row is 18,278, not 18,581. So the number of attendees doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement about the attendance being 18,581 is incorrect. Thus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a Golden State game was played at AT&T Center with 18,581 attendees. However, in the table, Row 67 (the only Golden State game) has an attendance of 18,278 at AT&T Center.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 67, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the game number for cleveland be 71\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about a specific game where the team is Cleveland and the game number is 71. So I need to find in the table any row that matches both of these criteria.\n\nI'll start by scanning through all the rows one by one to check for the team \"Cleveland\" and the game number 71.\n\nRow 1: Team is New Orleans, not Cleveland.\nRow 2: New Orleans again, so no.\nRow 3: Memphis, not Cleveland.\nRow 4: Cleveland! Let's see what game number this is. It says game: 61. Hmm, that's not 71.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 5: New York.\nRow 6: Minnesota.\nRow 7: Los Angeles Clippers.\nRow 8: Miami.\nRow 9: Orlando.\nRow 10: Golden State.\nRow 11: Atlanta.\nRow 12: Oklahoma City.\nRow 13: Los Angeles Lakers.\nRow 14: Cleveland! Game number is 71. Yes, this matches both criteria.\n\nSo there's a row where the team is Cleveland and the game number is 71. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on this information.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other rows with Cleveland and game 71. Scanning through again, only Row 4 and Row 14 have Cleveland as the team, and among those, only Row 14 has game number 71. So that's the one relevant row.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the row index for Row 14 (which is 14) and the column name \"game\". That's because the game number is what we're checking.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in Row 14, which lists the game number as 71 for Cleveland.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the golden state game and the oklahoma game be both played at the at&t center with over 19,000 in attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. There are two specific games mentioned: one against the Golden State and another against Oklahoma City. Both of these games should have been played at the AT&T Center and had over 19,000 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several attributes like team, date, score, etc. My goal is to find the relevant rows for Golden State (GS) and Oklahoma (OK) games, then check their location and attendance.\n\nStarting with Golden State: I'll go through each row until I find where the opponent is Golden State. That should be Row 15, game 72, which was on March 28 against Boston. Wait, no, that's against Boston. Let me double-check: Row 12 is Oklahoma City (OK), so I need to look for Row 15? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"golden state game,\" so I need to find the row where the team is Golden State Warriors. Scanning through, Row 5 is against New York, Row 6: Minnesota, Row7: Clippers, Row8:Miami, Row9:Orlando, Row10:GS (Row10), opponent is Golden State.\n\nYes, Row10: game 67 on March19 vs Golden State. So that's the first relevant row.\n\nNow for Oklahoma City: Looking through the rows, it should be game 69, which was against Oklahoma City on March22. Let me confirm: Row12 is game69, opponent is Oklahoma City. So that's the second relevant row.\n\nNext, check if both games were played at AT&T Center. For Row10 (GS game), location is AT&T Center with attendance 18,281. That's over 19,000. So that checks out.\n\nFor Row12 (OK game), same location: AT&T Center with 18,203 attendees, which is also over 19,000.\n\nSo both conditions are met for both games. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
