    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim: \"On July 29, SK Brann host the Champion League (Q).\" Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The columns are Date, Home Team, Away Team, Venue, Attendance, and Tournament. Each row corresponds to a specific match date.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where the date is July 29, the home team is SK Brann, and the tournament is Champion League (Q).\n\nLooking at the rows one by one:\n\nRow 0: May 20 \u2013 No\nRow 1: May 25 \u2013 No\n...\nContinuing until I reach Row 24: August 5. That's about August, so not July.\n\nWait, actually, row numbers are 0-indexed? Or is it from 1 to 38? Wait, the first row is index 0 or 1? The user mentioned row_index as per the example, starting from 0 upwards. So Row 0 is May 20, and so on up to Row 38 which is November 2.\n\nI need to find a row where:\n\n- Date is July 29\n- Home Team is SK Brann\n- Tournament is Champion League (Q)\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 24: August 5 \u2013 No\n\nWait, I'm going too far. Let me list out all rows around July 29.\n\nLet me check from Row 22 onwards to see if any match on July 29.\n\nWait, maybe the row numbers are not in order? Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the data:\n\nLooking for Date: July 29\n\nIn the given table, I don't see a date of July 29. The closest is August 5 (Row 24) and then earlier dates like September 14 (Row 30). So, there's no row with Date as July 29.\n\nTherefore, there's no match on July 29 where SK Brann hosts the Champion League (Q).\n\nSo the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Tournament\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to check whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"In the match on July 29, FK Ventspils play as a visitor team against SK Brann at the Brann Stadion, Bergen.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the specific row and columns related to this information. The date mentioned is July 29, so I need to find that exact date in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: June 18\n- Row 1: June 25\n- ...\n- Continuing down, I notice that row 26 mentions August 13, and row 24 is August 9. Hmm, but after that, looking further, I see row 30 is September 14, and row 31 is September 18.\n\nWait, the claim is about July 29. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: June 18\nRow 1: June 25\nRow 2: June 30\nRow 3: July 3\nRow 4: July 10\nRow 5: July 17\nRow 6: July 24\nRow 7: July 31\n\nSo row 7 is July 31, which is after July 29. So the next possible date would be August, but I need to check each row until I find July 29.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it earlier. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- Row 0: June 18\n- Row 1: June 25\n- Row 2: June 30\n- Row 3: July 3\n- Row 4: July 10\n- Row 5: July 17\n- Row 6: July 24\n- Row 7: July 31\n\nNo, row 7 is July 31, but the claim is about July 29. So there's no row with July 29.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted or missed a row? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRows are numbered from 0 to 38. Each row has a date.\n\nI'll list them out sequentially:\n\nRow 0: June 18\nRow 1: June 25\nRow 2: June 30\nRow 3: July 3\nRow 4: July 10\nRow 5: July 17\nRow 6: July 24\nRow 7: July 31\nRow 8: August 7\n...\nWait, row 26 is August 13, and row 27 is August 24, row 28 is August 27, etc.\n\nSo the dates in July are rows 3 to 7: July 3, 10, 17, 24, 31.\n\nNo July 29 mentioned. So the claim's date of July 29 doesn't match any row in the table.\n\nAdditionally, I need to check whether FK Ventspils is visiting SK Brann at Brann Stadion, Bergen on that date.\n\nBut since there's no such row for July 29, the information isn't present in the table. Therefore, the claim cannot be fully supported by the data provided.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\" because there's no match on July 29 in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a match on July 29 between FK Ventspils and SK Brann at Brann Stadion. However, upon reviewing the table, there is no row corresponding to July 29. The closest dates are July 24 (row 6) and July 31 (row 7). Since no such match exists in the provided data, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to check the claim: \"Champion League (Q) be the tournament on April 21 hosted by Stab\u00e6k.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, each row has details about a match. The columns are important here: \"date,\" \"tournament,\" and \"host.\" I need to verify if there's a match in April where the host is Stab\u00e6k and the tournament is Champion League (Q).\n\nI'll go through the rows one by one starting from April. \n\nRow 0: March 21, Str\u00f8msgodset IF vs SK Brann, no relevant tournament.\nRow 1: April 4, SK Brann vs Str\u00f8msgodset IF, Tippeligaen.\nRow 2: April 7, SK Brann vs Str\u00f8msgodset IF, Norwegian Cup.\nRow 3: April 11, SK Brann vs Str\u00f8msgodset IF, Tippeligaen.\nRow 4: April 14, SK Brann vs Str\u00f8msgodset IF, Tippeligaen.\nRow 5: April 18, SK Brann vs Str\u00f8msgodset IF, Norwegian Cup.\nRow 6: April 21, SK Brann vs Stab\u00e6k, Champion League (Q). \nWait, that's a match on April 21 between SK Brann and Stab\u00e6k in the Champion League (Q).\n\nSo, there is indeed a match on April 21 hosted by Stab\u00e6k in the Champion League (Q). Therefore, the claim seems to be true.\n\nI should note the row where this happens. From the table, Row 6 has the tournament as Champion League (Q), date as April 21, and host as Stab\u00e6k.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"fk ventspils be the visitor of the match on april 20th\" is true based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that FK Ventspils was the visiting team in a match that took place on April 20th.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any matches that happened on April 20th. Scanning the dates provided, I see rows starting from April onwards. Specifically, looking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 1: April 20\n- Rows around there? Let me check. The first few rows are:\n\nRow 0: April 20\nRow 1: April 21\nWait no, let me count correctly. Actually, row numbering starts from 0. So the first row is index 0: April 20.\n\nSo only one match happened on April 20, which is Row 0.\n\nNow, in that row (index 0), the columns are: date, home team, visitor team. Let me see:\n\n- Date: April 20\n- Home Team: Str\u00f8msgodset IF\n- Visitor Team: SK Brann\n\nWait, so on April 20th, SK Brann was the visitor against Str\u00f8msgodset IF at Marienlyst Stadion in Drammen.\n\nBut the claim says FK Ventspils was the visitor. So that's a conflict because in Row 0, the visitor is SK Brann, not FK Ventspils.\n\nNow, I should check if there's another match on April 20th. Looking through the table:\n\nRow 0: April 20\nRow 1: April 21 (Lillestr\u00f8m SK vs SK Brann)\nAnd so on. So only one match on April 20.\n\nTherefore, FK Ventspils wasn't the visitor; it was SK Brann. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"fk ventspils be the visitor of the match on april 20th\" is FALSE because the table shows that SK Brann was the visitor in that match, not FK Ventspils.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"visitor team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
