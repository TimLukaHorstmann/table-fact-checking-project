    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the score on 15 / 04 / 07 in super league xii be 52 - 22\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the instructions and the data.\n\nFirst, the table has multiple rows with various dates, teams, scores, goals, and attendances. The claim specifies a specific date: April 15, 2007, in the Super League XII. The score is given as 52-22. I need to check if this exact score appears on that particular row.\n\nLooking through the table, each row has a \"date\" column and an \"away team\" which might be relevant. Wait, actually, let me see: each row's data starts with the date, then home team, score, goals for and against, attendance, and competition. So the columns are:\n\n1. Date\n2. Home Team\n3. Score\n4. Goals (for - by)\n5. Attendance\n6. Competition\n\nI need to find the row where the date is April 15, 2007, under Super League XII. Let me scan through each row.\n\nRow 0: April 9, 2007\nRow 1: April 14, 2007\nRow 2: April 21, 2007\nRow 3: May 5, 2007 (probably incorrect as the dates might be in another format)\nWait, looking closer, the date formatting isn't clear. Let me check for 15/04/07. Maybe it's April 15.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 4: 12/08/07\n- Row 5: 19/08/07\n- Row 6: 02/09/07\n- Row 7: 09/09/07\n- Row 8: 14/09/07\n- Row 9: 21/9/07\nWait, I might be missing something. Let me check each row's date more carefully.\n\nI think the dates are formatted as day/month/year. So April is month 4.\n\nLooking for 15/04/07:\n\nRow indexes go up to 32. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 0: 02/04/07 (April 2)\n- Row 1: 09/04/07 (April 9)\n- Row 2: 16/04/07 (April 16)\n- Row 3: 23/04/07 (April 23)\n- Row 4: 30/04/07 (April 30)\nThen May:\nRow 5: 07/05/07\nRow 6: 14/05/07\nRow 7: 21/05/07\nRow 8: 28/05/07\nJune:\nRow 9: 04/06/07\n...and so on until September and beyond.\n\nWait, I don't see a row with 15/04/07. The closest is April 16 (Row 2) and April 23 (Row 3). So maybe there's no exact match for 15 April.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dates are in another format, like month/day/year or day-month-year without slashes. Let me check if any row has 04/15/07 as date.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- Row 0: 02/04/07 (April 2)\n- Row 1: 09/04/07 (April 9)\n- Row 2: 16/04/07 (April 16)\n- Row 3: 23/04/07 (April 23)\n- Row 4: 30/04/07 (April 30)\n\nThen May starts at Row 5 as 07/05/07. So no April 15 date here.\n\nTherefore, the claim's date doesn't match any row in the table. Wait, but maybe I missed it. Let me check again:\n\nLooking from Row 0 to Row 32:\n\n- The earliest dates are early April, and then May onwards. There's no April 15 listed.\n\nSo if the date isn't present, the score can't be checked for that specific row. But according to the instructions, I need to check each condition in the claim against the table. If the date or competition doesn't match any relevant row, it's false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is looking at a different competition, but the claim specifies Super League XII, which matches column 6.\n\nSince there's no matching row for 15/04/07 in Super League XII, the score isn't present. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is that the Super League XI score on July 21, 2007 was 14-10. I need to check each relevant cell in the provided table to verify if this statement is true.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the rows to find any that mention the date July 21, 2007. Scanning down, I see row 23 which has a date of July 13, 2007, and row 24 with July 21, 2007. Wait, actually, looking again, row 24 is for July 28, 2007. Hmm, maybe I missed one. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 22: Date is July 6, 2007.\nRow 23: July 13, 2007.\nRow 24: July 21, 2007. Yes, here it is.\nRow 25: July 28, 2007.\n\nSo, row 24 is the one that matches the date July 21, 2007. Now, looking at the score for that row. The home team is Salford City Reds, and the away team is Bradford. The score is listed as 14-10 in favor of Salford. \n\nWait, but the claim says the score was 14-10. However, the away team (Bradford) scored 10, so the home team must have scored 14 to make it 14-10. That matches the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. The date is July 21, 2007, and the score is 14-10 for Salford against Bradford. So, all the necessary information is in row 24.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as TRUE because on July 21, 2007, Salford City Reds scored 14 against Bradford, resulting in a score of 14-10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says that on April 15, 2007, in Super League XII, the score was 52 to 22 with an attendance of 9000.\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant row in the table. The date in the claim is 15/04/07, which I think corresponds to April 15, 2007. Looking through the rows provided, I see that each row has a \"date\" column and a \"competition\" column. I need to find the row where the date is 15/04/07 and the competition is Super League XII.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Date 29/06/07, Competition: Super League XII \u2013 Not the date we're looking for.\nRow 1: 30/06/07, SL XII \u2013 No\nRow 2: 06/07/07, SL XII \u2013 No\nRow 3: 13/07/07, SL XII \u2013 No\n...\nContinuing this way would take too long. Maybe I can spot the date pattern. The dates are in day/month/year format? For example, row 15 is 15/04/07 \u2013 yes, that's April 15, 2007.\n\nSo, looking at row 15: Date is 15/04/07, Competition: Super League XII. The score there is Hull KR 10 - 28 Bradford. Wait, that doesn't match the claim of 52-22.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The table's rows go from row 0 to row 32. Each row has \"date\", \"home_team\", \"score\", etc. So, for row 15, the date is 15/04/07, home team is Hull KR, score is Hull KR 10 - 28 Bradford. The claim says the score was 52-22, which doesn't match.\n\nAdditionally, the attendance in that row (row 15) is 6695, not 9000 as claimed. So both the score and attendance don't align with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the score on 21 / 07 / 07 be 14 to 10 and the home team be bradford.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the date is July 21, 2007. Looking through each row, row 24 has the date 21/07/07. Wait, no, in the table provided, let me check again.\n\nWait, the rows go up to row 32. Let me see: row 23 is 13/07/07, row 24 is 21/07/07. So that's the one we need. Now, for row 24, the home team is Salford City Reds, according to \"home team\" column.\n\nThe claim says the home team is Bradford, so that's incorrect already. Also, the score mentioned in the claim is 14-10. Looking at row 24, the score is 14-10 for Salford City Reds vs. Bradford. So the score part is correct, but the home team is wrong because it's actually Salford, not Bradford.\n\nSo since the home team doesn't match, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
