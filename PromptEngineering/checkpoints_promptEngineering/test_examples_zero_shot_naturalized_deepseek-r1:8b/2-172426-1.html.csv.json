    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Princess Mary marry William II before she be 12.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's identify which rows and columns in the table are relevant. Looking at the rows, they list various princesses named Mary. Each row has details like their name, when they were a Princess Royal, their parents, and when they married along with their husband's details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: The first row talks about Mary, Princess Royal from 1631 to 1660. She was the daughter of Charles I. Her marriage date is 1641, and her husband was William II, Prince of Orange who was alive between 1626-1650. Since she married in 1641, which is before she turned 12 (assuming she was born around 1631), this seems to fit the claim.\n\nRow 2: The second row is about Anne, not Mary, so it's probably irrelevant for this claim.\n\nRow 3: This is Charlotte, again not Mary. So skip.\n\nRow 4: Victoria, not relevant.\n\nRow 5: Louise, not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Another Mary, but she was born in 1897 and married in 1922, which is way after she turned 12, so this isn't the one mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 7: Anne again, not Mary. Also, her marriage dates are later, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 8: Another Anne, same as above.\n\nSo only Row 1's data pertains to Princess Mary. In that row, she married William II in 1641. If we assume her birth year is around 1631 (based on her being a Princess Royal from 1631-1660), she was about 10 years old when she married. Therefore, she did marry before turning 12.\n\nThus, the claim is true based on this information.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 1 of the table, where Princess Mary married William II in 1641, which is before she would have turned 12 (assuming her birth year around 1631).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"date married\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"Princess Louise did not marry until she was around 38 years old\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It seems to be a list of eight rows, each representing a different princess with various details. The columns include order, name, name dates (which likely refer to her reign or active years), the period during which she was a princess royal, parent information, the date she married, and her husband's details.\n\nThe claim in question is about Princess Louise's marriage age. Specifically, it states that she didn't marry until she was around 38. To verify this, I need to locate the relevant row in the table that corresponds to Princess Louise.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mary, Princess Royal (1631-1660)\n- Row 2: Anne, Princess Royal (1709-1759)\n- Row 3: Charlotte, Princess Royal (1766-1828)\n- Row 4: Victoria, Princess Royal (1840-1901)\n- Row 5: Louise, Princess Royal (1867-1931)\n- Row 6: Mary, Princess Royal (1897-1965)\n- Row 7: Anne, Princess Royal (1950-present)\n\nI see that Row 5 is about Louise. So, the relevant row index is 5.\n\nNext, I need to check the specific columns for Row 5:\n\n1. **Name**: \"Louise, Princess Royal\"\n2. **Date Married**: This column will tell us when she married.\n3. **Husband's Details**: While this might not directly affect the claim, it could provide context if her husband was a factor in her marriage age.\n\nThe key piece of information needed is the date she married. According to the table, Row 5 has \"date married: 1889.\" \n\nCalculating her age at marriage would involve subtracting her birth year from 1889. The name dates for Louise are 1867-1931, so she was born around 1867 (exact details may vary, but assuming she was born in 1867). \n\nIf she married in 1889, her age would be 1889 - 1867 = 22 years old.\n\nThe claim states that she didn't marry until she was around 38. However, according to the table, she married at 22. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, I need to specify which columns were checked. The essential columns are \"name\" and \"date married.\" Additionally, her parent's details might be relevant if there's any inheritance or title issues, but in this case, it's about her age at marriage, so \"parent\" might not be directly relevant unless there's an inheritance affecting her marrying age, which isn't indicated here.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5, column \"name\"\n- Row 5, column \"date married\"\n\nThese columns provide the necessary information to verify the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Louise did not marry until she was around 38. However, according to the table, she married in 1889 at the age of 22. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II have have 2 husband\" is true or false based on the given table. First, I should look at the table structure and figure out which rows and columns are relevant.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different princess, starting with Mary in Row 1 and going up to Anne in Rows 7 and 8. The claim mentions Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II, so I'm focusing on Row 7 and possibly Row 8 since both have the name \"Anne\" and are labeled as \"princess royal.\"\n\nNow, each row has several columns: order, name dates, princess royal from (date) to (date), parent, date married, and husband dates. Since the claim is about having two husbands, I need to look at the 'husband dates' column for the relevant rows.\n\nRow 7: Anne's husband dates are listed as \"mark phillips 1948 -\". That seems like only one husband.\nRow 8: Wait, the order number is also 7 in Row 8, which might mean it's a continuation or a duplicate. Here, Anne's date married is given as \"1992\" and her husband is \"sir timothy laurence 1955 -\". So, she has another husband here.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because both Row 7 and Row 8 are for Anne, and the order numbers are both 7. That might be a mistake in the table, or maybe they're separate entries. If that's the case, then Anne would have two husbands: Mark Phillips and Timothy Laurence.\n\nBut looking back, the claim is about Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II having two husbands. From the table, in Row 7, she married Mark Phillips from 1973-1992, and in Row 8, she married Timothy Laurence starting in 1992. So that's two marriages, meaning two husbands.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in historical contexts, a princess might not count both as husbands if they're considered ceremonial or for other reasons. However, based on the table data, it shows two different husbands with their own dates, so it seems she has two husbands.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as Princess Anne has two recorded marriages.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have gotten a divorce\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each row represents.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to be about different princesses named \"Anne,\" each with their own details. The columns include order, name, various dates related to their time as Princess Royal and other roles, parent, marriage date, and their husband's details.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Princess Anne of Elizabeth being the only one in the list who got a divorce. Wait, actually, looking closer, it says \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have get a divorce.\" Hmm, that might be a typo or misstatement. It probably means \"Princess Anne of [some title] be the only...\" but perhaps it's referring to Princess Anne being the only one in the table who got a divorce.\n\nSo I need to check each row to see if any other princesses have been divorced.\n\nStarting with Row 1: Mary, Princess Royal from 1642-1660. Her parent is Charles I, and she married William II in 1641. No mention of a divorce here.\n\nRow 2: Anne, Princess Royal from 1727-1759. Her parent is George II, married to William IV in 1734. No indication of a divorce either.\n\nRow 3: Charlotte, Princess Royal from 1789-1828. Parent is George III, married in 1797. No divorce mentioned.\n\nRow 4: Victoria, Princess Royal from 1841-1901. Her parent is Victoria (maybe referring to Queen Victoria?), married in 1858. No divorce noted here.\n\nRow 5: Louise, Princess Royal from 1905-1931. Parent is Edward VII, married in 1889. No mention of a divorce.\n\nRow 6: Mary, Princess Royal from 1932-1965. Parent is George V, married in 1922. No sign of a divorce here.\n\nRow 7 and Row 8 both have entries for Anne as Princess Royal. Wait, that's interesting\u2014two rows for the same name? Let me check:\n\nRow 7: Anne, Princess Royal from 1987-present, parent Elizabeth II, married between 1973-1992. The husband is Mark Phillips, but it looks like the date might be a range because he was born in 1948. She got married around 1973 but maybe didn't stay married.\n\nRow 8: Anne again, same name and title, from 1987-present, parent Elizabeth II, married in 1992, husband is Sir Timothy Laurence (born 1955). So this seems to be a different Anne, perhaps another branch of the family? Or maybe the same person with different marriage details.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth.\" Maybe it's referring to Anne being the daughter of Elizabeth II. In that case, Row 7 and Row 8 are both about Princess Anne, but in different contexts\u2014maybe one is a miscalculation or mislabeling.\n\nBut looking at the details:\n\nIn Row 7: She married Mark Phillips but later divorced him. The date married is between 1973-1992, which might mean she married him in 1973 and divorced around 1992.\n\nIn Row 8: She married Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992. So if Row 7's Anne got a divorce before that, then yes, she had a divorce.\n\nSo based on the table:\n\n- Princess Anne of Elizabeth II (Row 7) married Mark Phillips but later divorced him. Then she remarried Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992.\n\nThe claim says \"the only princess... to have gotten a divorce.\" So I need to check if any other princesses in the list got a divorce.\n\nLooking at all rows, none of the others show any indication of a divorce. For example:\n\n- Mary (Row 1) was married to William II until his death, no mention of divorce.\n- Anne (Row 2) married William IV and died with him, so no divorce.\n- Charlotte (Row 3) was married until her death, no divorce.\n- Victoria (Row 4) was happily married until her death.\n- Louise (Row 5) was married for a long time until Edward VII's death, then she remarried but that's not mentioned as a divorce\u2014it's just a second marriage. Wait, actually, in Row 5, the husband is Alexander Duff, and she married him in 1889, but he died in 1912. She may have remarried later? But according to the table, it shows \"date married: 1889,\" not mentioning another marriage or divorce.\n\nMary (Row 6) was married until her death without any mention of a divorce.\n\nIn Row 7 and 8, both Annes are separate individuals, but only the one in Row 7 (Mark Phillips) seems to have had a divorce. The one in Row 8 is a different marriage after a possible annulment or separation, but it's unclear if she divorced her first husband.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify:\n\nRow 7: Anne married Mark Phillips in 1973, and they separated around 1992 when he left her for another woman. She then remarried Timothy Laurence in 1992. So technically, she got a divorce from Mark Phillips in 1992 or had an annulment.\n\nRow 8 seems to be about the same Anne (daughter of Elizabeth II) but with different marriage dates\u2014maybe it's a correction? Or perhaps it's another princess named Anne.\n\nWait, looking at the titles: Both Row 7 and 8 say \"Princess Anne, Royal Highness.\" That might mean both are referring to the same person. But that seems odd because having two entries for the same person is unusual in a table unless there's an error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they refer to different Annes\u2014maybe one from another branch of the family. But I'm not sure.\n\nIf it's indeed the same Anne, then she had a divorce (annulment) with Mark Phillips, so that counts as a divorce.\n\nAs for others: None show any signs of a divorce.\n\nTherefore, if the claim is that Princess Anne of Elizabeth II (i.e., Row 7) is the only one in the table who got a divorce, then it's correct because no other princesses mentioned have divorced. So the statement would be true.\n\nWait, but the user wrote \"You are tasked with verifying whether...\"\u2014so perhaps I need to confirm if this is accurate.\n\nYes, based on the table provided, only Row 7 indicates a divorce (from Mark Phillips), and the others do not show any indication of a divorce. So the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Anne of Elizabeth II is the only princess in the table who has undergone a divorce is supported by the information provided.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes, based on the data presented, Princess Anne (Row 7) is indeed the only individual listed who has experienced a divorce. None of the other princesses mentioned in the table have shown signs of a divorce.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"Princess Mary marry her husband William II after her 12th birthday.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find relevant information about Princess Mary and her marriage details. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 1: It mentions Princess Mary with dates 1631-1660. Her parent is Charles I, and she married William II in 1641. The husband's dates are 1626-1650. So this seems to be about the first Princess Mary, but I'm not sure if that's the one referred to in the claim.\n\nRow 6: It mentions another Princess Mary with dates 1897-1965. Her parent is George V, and she married Henry Lascelles in 1922. The husband's dates are 1882-1947. There's no mention of William II here, so this might not be relevant.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Princess Mary\" and \"William II.\" From Row 1, the first Princess Mary married William II in 1641, which was before her 12th birthday because she was born in 1631. That would make her 10 when married, so way below 12. So if the claim is about this princess, then it's false because she married before turning 12.\n\nBut I should check other rows to see if there are any other Princess Marys who married William II after their 12th birthday. Looking at the other rows:\n\nRow 7 and Row 8 mention Anne, not Mary, so they don't apply here. So the only relevant rows are Row 1 and possibly others, but none match the claim except Row 1, which contradicts it.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Princess Mary (from Row 1) married William II before her 12th birthday.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Princess Mary marrying William II after her 12th birthday. According to the table, the first Princess Mary (Row 1) was born in 1631 and married in 1641, which is at age 10. There are no other entries for a Princess Mary who meets both criteria of marriage to William II and occurring after her 12th birthday.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about a prince named Mary, who was related to Charles I, and she died before turning 40 years old. So, I need to look into the table provided to find any relevant information about such a person.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different princess with various attributes like their name, dates as a Princess Royal, marriage details, parentage, and husband's info. Each column seems to correspond to specific data points.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: This is about Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660. She was the daughter of Charles I (1600-1649), married in 1641 to William II. Her husband's dates are 1626-1650. But her death date isn't directly mentioned here.\n\nRow 2: This is Anne, Princess Royal from 1709-1759, daughter of George II, married in 1734 to William IV. Again, no death info here.\n\nRow 3: Charlotte, Princess Royal from 1766-1828, daughter of George III, married in 1797 to Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg. No death details provided.\n\nRow 4: Victoria, Princess Royal from 1840-1901, daughter of Queen Victoria, married in 1858 to Frederick III. Still no death info.\n\nRow 5: Louise, Princess Royal from 1867-1931, daughter of Edward VII, married in 1889 to Alexander Duff. No death details here either.\n\nRow 6: Mary, Princess Royal from 1897-1965, daughter of George V, married in 1922 to Henry Lascelles. Her dates go up to 1965, which is beyond 40, but the claim is about dying before age 40, so she's too old for this claim.\n\nRow 7: Anne, Princess Royal from 1950-present, daughter of Elizabeth II, married in 1973 to Mark Phillips, and later to Timothy Laurence. Her dates go up to present, so she's still alive, much younger than 40 when the claim would apply.\n\nWait a minute, I just noticed that Row 1 is about Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660, daughter of Charles I. The claim mentions \"prince mary of charles i.\" So this must refer to Row 1. Now, looking at her details: she was born in 1631 and died in 1660. That's a span of about 29 years, so she lived past 40? Wait, 1660 minus 1631 is 29, but if she died in 1660 at age 29, she never reached 40. So according to Row 1, Mary died before turning 40.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"die before age 40.\" If she was born in 1631 and died in 1660, that's 29 years old, which is indeed before 40. However, I should check if there are any other relevant rows or details that might affect this conclusion.\n\nLooking again at Row 1: Her name is Mary, Princess Royal from 1631-1660. Parent is Charles I (1600-1649), married in 1641 to William II. She died in 1660. So her age at death was 29, which is before 40.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40.\" Is Mary considered a prince? In British titles, princesses are styled as Royal Highness, and while they can be princes in certain contexts, particularly male princesses might be called Princes. However, in this case, it's about Mary, who is female, so she would typically be referred to as Princess, not Prince.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row starts with \"name dates: [Name], princess royal...\", so they are all Princesses Royal. So, perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to her as a \"prince,\" which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, she could be addressed as a prince, but I think that's less common.\n\nBut regardless of the title, the main point is whether Mary died before 40. According to Row 1, she was born in 1631 and died in 1660, which is indeed before turning 40 (since 40 would be around 1671). So, at age 29, she died.\n\nHowever, I should also check if there are other princesses named Mary in the table. Let's look:\n\nRow 6: Another Mary, Princess Royal from 1897-1965. She lived much longer and is still alive or dead after 40.\n\nSo, the only relevant row is Row 1, which supports the claim that Mary died before age 40.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there isn't another Mary in the table that's being referred to. Let me check again:\n\nRow 1: Mary (1631-1660)\nRow 6: Mary (1897-1965)\n\nSo, only two Marys. The first died at 29, so she definitely died before 40.\n\nBut now I'm thinking about the titles. The claim says \"prince mary of charles i.\" In reality, Mary was a princess, not a prince, as she was female. So there's an inaccuracy in the claim regarding her title. However, regardless of that, the fact remains that she died before 40.\n\nBut does that matter? The question is whether it's accurate to say \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40.\" Since Mary wasn't a prince, this statement is incorrect. So, perhaps the claim is wrong on two points: both in the title and in the assertion about her death age.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, in British titles, there are rare instances where princesses can be addressed as \"Princes\" if they hold certain offices or are styled that way in specific contexts, but generally, they are Princesses. So referring to her as a prince is incorrect.\n\nBut regardless of the title, whether she's a prince or princess, the fact remains that she died at 29, so before 40. But the claim incorrectly styles her as a prince, which may be important if the question is about the accuracy of the statement in terms of titles and facts.\n\nSo, to answer accurately: The claim is both incorrect in referring to her as \"prince\" and also correct in stating that she died before age 40.\n\nBut perhaps the main point is whether the death age is correct. So, focusing on that aspect, the answer would be yes, she did die before turning 40. However, since the title is wrong, maybe the overall statement is incorrect because it's inaccurately referring to her as a prince.\n\nAlternatively, if \"prince\" is a typo and they meant princess, then it's partially correct but still incorrect in the title. So, the answer depends on whether the title is material to the claim.\n\nIn any case, based on the information given, Row 1 supports that Mary died before turning 40. However, since she was not a prince, the claim has an error there as well.\n\nBut perhaps for the purpose of this task, we can assume that regardless of her title, the key fact is her age at death, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSo, in conclusion: The statement is partially correct because Mary died before turning 40, but it's incorrect in referring to her as a \"prince.\"\n</think>\n\nThe statement asserts that \"Princess Mary of Charles I died before reaching the age of 40.\" Based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Title Accuracy**: The claim incorrectly refers to Mary as \"Prince,\" whereas she was actually a Princess. This title discrepancy is a crucial error.\n   \n2. **Death Age Verification**: According to the data, Mary, Princess Royal, born in 1631, died in 1660 at the age of 29. This confirms that she indeed died before reaching the age of 40.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the assertion about her death age is accurate, the incorrect title of \"Prince\" makes the statement factually inaccurate overall.",

Row 7 says she was born in 1950 and married in 1973, while row 8 says she was married in 1992. Neither is Louise nor related to Edward VII.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions \"Princess Louise\" marrying Edward VII. Looking back at the table, there's a Row 5: name dates: louise , princess royal 1867 - 1931. So this is Princess Louise. Her husband in the table is Alexander Duff, not Edward VII.\n\nEdward VII was King of the United Kingdom from 1901 to 1910. Looking at the table, Victoria (Row 4) was married in 1858 to Frederick III, and her father was also named Victoria? Wait, no\u2014actually, Row 4's parent is listed as \"victoria 1819 - 1901,\" which might refer to Queen Victoria herself. But the husband is Frederick III.\n\nNow, Princess Louise, who was born in 1867, married in 1889. So she would have been 22 years old then. That means she did not marry before turning 20. Wait, no\u20141889: let me calculate her age. If she was born in 1867, in 1889, that's 22 years old. So she married at 22.\n\nBut the claim says she married before 20. That's incorrect because 22 is after 20. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again: Row 5: louise, princess royal born 1867, married in 1889. So 1889 minus 1867 is indeed 22 years old. So she didn't marry before 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Princess Louise married Edward VII before the age of 20 is incorrect based on the table provided. According to Row 5, Princess Louise was born in 1867 and married in 1889, making her 22 years old at the time, not under 20.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date_married\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii have only 1 husband\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II.\" Looking at the table, I see that there are multiple entries for \"Anne\" as a name. Each row corresponds to a different princess named Anne with various details.\n\nThe key is to find the specific entry for Princess Anne who was married and check how many husbands she had. The claim states only one husband, so we need to confirm if this is accurate.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Name is Mary.\nRow 2: Name is Anne. Her parent is George II, and she married William IV in 1734.\nRow 3: Name is Charlotte.\nRow 4: Name is Victoria.\nRow 5: Name is Louise.\nRow 6: Name is Mary (another entry).\nRow 7: Name is Anne (first occurrence). She was married from 1973-1992 to Mark Phillips. Then, in another row (row 8), the same name appears again with a different marriage (1992) to Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\nWait, but row 7 and row 8 both have \"Anne\" as the name. That could be confusing. Let me check if these are two separate entries for Princess Anne or perhaps the same person.\n\nLooking at their parents: Row 7's parent is Elizabeth II (1926-), while Row 8's parent is also Elizabeth II but with a different marriage date and husband. This suggests they might be the same person married twice, which would mean she has two husbands.\n\nWait, no. If it's the same person, then having two marriages would indeed make her have two husbands. But perhaps row 7 and row 8 are actually different entries. Let me check the columns:\n\nRow 7: order:7, name: Anne, princess royal from 1987-present, parent: Elizabeth II, date married: 1973-1992, husband: Mark Phillips.\n\nRow 8: order:7, same name: Anne, princess royal from 1987-present, parent: Elizabeth II, date married: 1992, husband: Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\nWait, the row indices are both 7. That's a problem because each row should have a unique index. Maybe it's a typo or error in the table. Assuming that they're separate entries, then Princess Anne could be marrying twice, which would make her having two husbands. Alternatively, if they are the same person, she remarried, making it two marriages.\n\nTherefore, the claim is that she only has one husband. If she had two marriages, then the statement is false. The table seems to indicate that she married Mark Phillips and then Sir Timothy Laurence, which would be two husbands.\n\nWait, but in the table, row 7's marriage dates are from 1973-1992, and row 8's marriage dates are 1992, suggesting that her first husband was Mark (until 1992) and then she married Tim in 1992. So that would mean she has two husbands.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the table lists different entries for the same person. If both rows are about the same Princess Anne, then yes, she had two marriages, thus two husbands, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, if they're separate princesses named Anne, then each only has one husband. But considering their parents (both Elizabeth II), it's likely the same person, making the claim false because she married twice.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that Princess Anne of Elizabeth the II had only one husband. However, according to the table, she married twice: first Mark Phillips and later Sir Timothy Laurence. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and instructions. The claim is: \"princess anne of elizabeth be 1 of 3 princess on the list who have a divorce.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to identify all relevant cells. The table has rows from 0 to 7. The claim mentions Princess Anne, but there are two entries for Anne in the table: Row 2 and Row 7.\n\nRow 2: Anne's parent is George II, married in 1734, husband William IV. I don't see a divorce mentioned here; she died in 1759 when her husband was still alive. So no indication of a divorce for Row 2.\n\nRow 7: This Anne married Mark Phillips in 1973 and later Sir Timothy Laurence in 1992. It's noted that her marriage to Mark ended in a divorce in 1992. So she did have a divorce.\n\nThe claim says she is \"1 of 3 princess on the list who have a divorce.\" Looking at the table, I need to check other rows for divorces among princesses.\n\nRow 4: Victoria married Frederick III and died in 1901; no mention of divorce.\nRow 5: Louise married Alexander Duff and died in 1931; no divorce mentioned.\nRow 6: Mary married Henry Lascelles and died in 1965; no divorce noted.\nRow 3: Charlotte married King Frederick I and died in 1828; no divorce.\nRow 1: Mary married William II, died in 1660; no mention of divorce.\nRow 2: As above, Anne didn't have a divorce.\n\nSo only Row 7's Anne has a divorce. The claim says she is one of three, but the table shows only her having a divorce. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it claims there are three princesses with divorces, but based on the given data, only one (Anne in Row 7) has a divorce.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"divorce\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns in the table are relevant. The claim mentions \"Princess Mary,\" so I'll look for any rows with that name. \n\nLooking at Row 1: It's about Mary, but her parent is Charles I. That seems to fit because the claim is about Princess Mary of Charles I.\n\nNow, I need to check when she died. The table provides the dates as \"name dates: mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\" So her life span was from 1631 to 1660.\n\nNext, I should figure out when she turned 25. She was born in 1631, so she would turn 25 in 1656. But she died in 1660, which is after 1656. Wait, that means she lived beyond 25 because 1660 is after 1656.\n\nWait, but the table says \"princess royal from (date) to (date): 1642 - 1660.\" So her princess royal role started in 1642 and ended in 1660. She was still alive in 1660, which is four years after she would have turned 25 in 1656. Therefore, she did live past the age of 25.\n\nSo, according to the table, Princess Mary of Charles I died after turning 25. That means the claim that she died before turning 25 is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Princess Mary lived beyond 25 years old.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
