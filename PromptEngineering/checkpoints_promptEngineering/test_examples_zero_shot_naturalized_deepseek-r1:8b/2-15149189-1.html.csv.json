    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim about Danny Cipriani is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"Danny Cipriani, born November 2, 1987, be a fly half.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant information about Danny Cipriani. Scanning each row, I spot that he's listed in Row 28. His details include position as \"fly - half,\" date of birth (age) November 2, 1987, and caps 0 with club/province Wasps.\n\nNext, I check if the claim matches this information. The claim mentions his birthdate correctly as November 2, 1987. It also specifies that he's a fly half, which aligns perfectly with his position in the table.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. Since the claim checks his position and birthdate, I'll look for those specific columns: \"position\" and \"date of birth (age)\". These correspond to Row 28's columns at their respective indices.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because all details in the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"the position of the player bear 2 november 1987 be fly - half , the only 1 for a sale player.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main points:\n1. There is a player with the date of birth (age) on 2 November 1987 who plays as a \"fly - half.\"\n2. This player is the only one from the club/province \"sale\" to have this position.\n\nI'll need to verify both parts using the table.\n\nStarting with the first part, I should search the table for players born on 2 November 1987. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 28: Player Danny Cipriani, born on 2 November 1987, position \"fly - half.\" This matches the first condition.\n\nNext, checking if there are any other players from Sale with the position of fly - half. Scanning the table for club/province \"sale\" and position \"fly - half\":\n\n- The only player listed under \"sale\" is Row 41: Mark Ceto, born on 26 December 1979, playing as a fullback.\n\nThere are no other players from Sale with the position of fly - half. Therefore, Danny Cipriani is indeed the only one.\n\nSo, both conditions of the claim are met.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 41, \"column_name\": \"club/province\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"prop steve borthwick be leicester's best known player in that position.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts to understand what needs to be verified.\n\n1. **Identity of the Player**: The player in question is Steve Borthwick.\n2. **Position**: He is a prop.\n3. **Club/Province**: Leicester.\n4. **Claim Attribute**: Being \"the best known\" or \"best known\" player at that position for Leicester.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check the cells related to Steve Borthwick and his position as a prop for Leicester.\n\nStarting with row 9: It lists Steve Borthwick as a prop playing for London Irish. That's interesting because it doesn't mention Leicester. So this cell might not be relevant unless there's more info elsewhere.\n\nNext, I should check if there's any row where Steve Borthwick is listed under Leicester and Prop position. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Rows 0 to 41 are all players with their respective details.\n- Looking specifically for \"Steve Borthwick\" in the Position column: It's at row 9 as a prop for London Irish.\n- Any other rows? No, seems only one entry.\n\nSo Steve Borthwick is indeed a prop but for London Irish, not Leicester. Therefore, he isn't playing for Leicester at all, let alone being their best-known player in that position.\n\nTherefore, the claim must be false because Steve Borthwick isn't associated with Leicester as a prop.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"Position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
