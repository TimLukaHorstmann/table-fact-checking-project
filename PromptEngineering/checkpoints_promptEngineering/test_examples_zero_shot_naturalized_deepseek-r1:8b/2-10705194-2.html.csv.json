    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the record of opponent jeremija sander be 8 - 2.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant rows in the table where the opponent is jeremija sanders. Looking through each row's opponent column:\n\n- Row 18: res: win, opponent: jeremija sanders\n- Row 19: res: loss, opponent: benji radach\n- Row 20: res: loss, opponent: fabio leopoldo\n- ... and so on. \n\nSo, only row 18 has jeremija sanders as the opponent. Now, looking at row 18's record column. It says \"record: 8 - 2.\" That matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no other instances of jeremija sanders. Scanning through all rows, only row 18 lists her as the opponent. So, that's the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, since the record in row 18 for jeremija sanders is indeed 8-2, the claim is fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because there's a row where the opponent jeremija sanders has an 8-2 record.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about Yeremija Sanders' opponent's record is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the record of jeremija sanders' opponent be 8 - 4.\" So I need to find the relevant row in the table where Yeremija Sandes is involved and check her opponent's record.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a fight event with details like the result (win or loss), the fighter's record before that fight, their opponent, method of victory, etc. So I need to search for the row where the fighter is Yeremija Sandes.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find her name. Starting from Row 1:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Curtistown?\nWait, no, that's Curtis Stout. Not her.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Travis Fowler. No.\n- Row 3: Opponent is Harvell Hunter. Hmm, not sure if that's her.\nWait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at Row 18: res: win, record: 8 - 2, opponent: jeremija sanders, method: tko (punches), event: ftp : global showdown, round: 1, time: 0:30, location: thackerville, oklahoma, united states.\n\nSo here, the fighter's name is jeremija sanders. Her opponent in this fight has a record of 8 - 2 before the match. Wait, but the claim says her opponent's record was 8 - 4. That doesn't match. So does that mean the claim is false?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps I need to look at all the fights where she fought, not just one. But usually, in such tables, each row represents a single fight event. So if her opponent in Row 18 had an 8 - 2 record, that's different from 8 - 4.\n\nBut let me check other rows to see if there are any other opponents with that record. Wait, no, the claim is specifically about \"jeremija sanders' opponent,\" meaning the person she fought against. So in her fight in Row 18, her opponent had a record of 8 - 2, not 8 - 4.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be incorrect because it claims her opponent's record was 8 - 4, but according to the table, it was 8 - 2.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing another row where she fought someone else. Let me check all rows again quickly:\n\nRow 18: opponent 8-2\nOther opponents in other rows: like Row 17: opponent 9-2; Row 16: opponent 8-2; etc. But for jeremija sanders, only Row 18 shows her fighting against someone with an 8 - 2 record.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the opponent's record was not 8 - 4 but 8 - 2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yeremija Sanders' opponent had a record of 8-4. Upon reviewing the table, we find that in Row 18, Yeremija Sanders fought an opponent with a 8-2 record. There is no other row indicating an opponent with a record of 8-4. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
