    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only 3 of the project have been completed so far\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about projects having their construction completed. So, I should look for rows where the 'construction completed' field is filled in. The claim says only 3 have been completed, so if there are more than 3, it's FALSE; otherwise, it's TRUE.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: cerclis id: msd004006995, name: american creosote works, inc, county: winston. The 'construction completed' field is '-', so that means the project hasn't been completed yet. So not counted.\n\nRow 2: cerclis id: msd008154486, name: chemfax, inc, county: harrison. Similarly, 'construction completed' is '-', so not completed.\n\nRow 3: davis timber company, lamar county. Construction completed is '-', so no.\n\nRow 4: flowood site, rankin county. Here, 'construction completed' is filled in as 09/17/1993. So this one is completed.\n\nRow 5: newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals, inc, marion county. Construction completed on 08/08/1997, so that's another completed project.\n\nRow 6: picayune wood treating, pearl river county. 'Construction completed' is '-', so not done.\n\nRow 7: potter co, copiah county. It's '-', so no.\n\nRow 8: sonford products, rankin county. Construction completed is '-', so not finished.\n\nRow 9: walcotte chemical co warehouses, washington county. Here, construction completed is 12/30/1982, and deleted on the same day. So this project was completed but then deleted. Wait, does that count as completed? The claim is about projects that have been completed, regardless of deletion. So I think it still counts.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the 'deleted' field might affect whether the site is active or not, but for the purpose of construction completion, if it's marked as done on 12/30/1982 and then deleted, does that mean it was completed? Or was the deletion after completion?\n\nLooking at the row, 'construction completed' is 12/30/1982, 'partially deleted: -' and 'deleted: 12/30/1982'. So I think this means the project was completed but then deleted entirely. So it's still counted as a completed project.\n\nSo counting the completed ones:\n\nRow 4: Yes\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 9: Yes\n\nThat's three so far. Wait, let me check again:\n\n- Row 1: No\n- Row 2: No\n- Row 3: No\n- Row 4: Yes (1)\n- Row 5: Yes (2)\n- Row 6: No\n- Row 7: No\n- Row 8: No\n- Row 9: Yes (3)\n\nSo that's three completed projects. But wait, looking back at the claim: \"only 3 of the project have been complete so far.\" The term 'project' might be ambiguous\u2014does it refer to each cerclis id as a separate project? If so, then yes, there are three completed.\n\nBut let me check if any others might be considered. For example, Row 4 was deleted but construction was completed in 1993. So that's counted. Similarly, Row 5 was completed in 1997 and deleted later. Row 9 was completed and deleted on the same day.\n\nSo total of three completed projects: Rows 4, 5, and 9.\n\nThus, the claim is saying only 3 have been completed, which matches. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if 'construction completed' being filled in is the indicator for completion regardless of deletion. Yes, because the instruction says to look at that field.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"2 of the project be propose , but never list and never complete.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's talking about projects that were proposed but never listed or completed. So, the claim is saying that there are two projects in the table where \"proposed\" is true, but both \"listed\" and \"construction completed\" are false.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row to see if any meet this condition. Each row has several columns: cerclis id, name, county, proposed date, listed date (if applicable), construction completed date (if applicable), partially deleted, and deleted.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: American Creosote Works Inc.\n- Proposed: 06/14/2001\n- Listed: 09/13/2001\n- Construction completed: -\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: -\n\nHere, \"proposed\" is true. But \"listed\" is also true because it's not null or dash. So this doesn't fit the condition.\n\nRow 2: Chemfax Inc.\n- Proposed: 06/23/1993\n- Listed: -\n- Construction completed: -\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: -\n\nProposed is true, but \"listed\" is empty. So it's proposed but not listed. But does it matter about construction? The claim says never completed. Here, both construction and partially deleted are dash, so I think this might fit. Wait, the claim says two projects, so maybe this is one.\n\nRow 3: Davis Timber Company\n- Proposed: 05/11/2000\n- Listed: 07/27/2000\n- Construction completed: -\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: -\n\nProposed is true, listed is also true. So doesn't fit.\n\nRow 4: Flowood Site\n- Proposed: 09/08/1983\n- Listed: 09/21/1984\n- Construction completed: 09/17/1993\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: 02/16/1996\n\nConstruction is completed, so it's proposed and completed. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 5: Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals Inc.\n- Proposed: 10/15/1984\n- Listed: 06/10/1986\n- Construction completed: 08/08/1997\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: 09/27/2000\n\nConstruction is completed, so no.\n\nRow 6: Picayune Wood Treating\n- Proposed: 03/08/2004\n- Listed: 07/22/2004\n- Construction completed: -\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: -\n\nProposed true, listed true. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 7: Potter Co.\n- Proposed: 05/10/1993\n- Listed: -\n- Construction completed: -\n- Partially deleted: -\n- Deleted: -\n\nProposed is true, listed empty. So similar to Row 2. But does this count as a second project?\n\nWait, the claim says \"two of the projects.\" So I need two projects where both proposed is true and listed and construction are false.\n\nLooking at Rows 2 and 7:\n\nRow 2: Chemfax Inc.\nProposed: Yes\nListed: No (empty)\nConstruction: No\n\nRow 7: Potter Co.\nProposed: Yes\nListed: No\nConstruction: No\n\nSo both these projects were proposed but never listed or completed. That makes two projects.\n\nWait, the claim says \"two of the project be propose...\" Maybe a typo, but assuming it means two projects.\n\nTherefore, there are at least two projects that fit the condition. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have more than one. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 7: Yes\n\nThat's two. So the claim is saying that there are two such projects, which is correct.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 2 project in rankin county , sonford product and flowood site.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being claimed here. It mentions two projects in Rankin County: Sonford Product and Flowood Site. I need to check if both of these are indeed projects listed in the table under Rankin County.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different project with various details like cerclis ID, name, county, proposed date, listed date, construction completion, partially deleted status, and deletion date.\n\nI'll go through each row to find projects related to Rankin County. \n\nRow 4: cerclis id msd980710941, name Flowood Site, county Rankin. So that's one project in Rankin County.\n\nRow 8: cerclis id msd086556388, name Sonford Products, county Rankin. That's the second project mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, I need to ensure both projects are indeed present in the table for Rankin County. Both Flowood Site and Sonford Products are listed under Rankin County in the table. Their details include proposed dates (1983 and 2006 respectively), listing dates, construction completion status, and deletion dates where applicable.\n\nAdditionally, checking other rows for Rankin County projects beyond these two doesn't seem necessary because the claim specifically mentions only these two. The table has more entries, but since the claim is about exactly two projects\u2014Sonford Product and Flowood Site\u2014I don't need to consider others unless there's a third that might affect the count.\n\nSo, both projects are present in Rankin County as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two projects in Rankin County: Sonford Products and Flowood Site. Checking the table, both projects are indeed listed under Rankin County, with cerclis IDs msd086556388 and msd980710941 respectively.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Projects:** The claim specifies two projects in Rankin County: Sonford Product and Flowood Site.\n2. **Locate Rows for Rankin County:** Scan each row to find entries where county is Rankin.\n3. **Check for Both Project Names:**\n   - Row 4: Flowood Site, Rankin.\n   - Row 8: Sonford Products, Rankin.\n4. **Confirm Presence:** Both projects are confirmed in the table under Rankin County.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is true as both specified projects exist in Rankin County.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the first project propose be potter co in copiah , but it have not yet be list.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It mentions that the first project proposed by Potter Co in Copiah hasn't been listed yet.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different company or project with various details like cerclis id, name, county, dates for proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, and deleted status.\n\nI need to identify which rows correspond to Potter Co. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: american creosote works inc in winston.\n- Row 2: chemfax inc in harrison.\n- Row 3: davis timber company in lamar.\n- Row 4: flowood site in rankin.\n- Row 5: newsom brothers/old reichhold chemicals in marion.\n- Row 6: picayune wood treating in pearl river.\n- Row 7: potter co in copiah.\n- Row 8: sonford products in rankin.\n- Row 9: walcotte chemical co warehouses in washington.\n\nSo, Potter Co is in row 7. Now I need to check the details for Potter Co.\n\nIn row 7, the columns are:\n- cerclis id: msd056029648\n- name: potter co\n- county: copiah\n- proposed: 05/10/1993\n- listed: -\n- construction completed: -\n- partially deleted: -\n- deleted: -\n\nThe claim says that Potter Co's first project hasn't been listed yet. Looking at the 'listed' column for row 7, it is empty (denoted by '-'). So, according to the table, as of the date the table was compiled, Potter Co's project in Copiah hasn't been listed.\n\nWait, but I should check if \"proposed\" and \"listed\" refer to the same thing. In the context, proposed might mean when the site was proposed for listing, while listed indicates whether it's officially on the list. So, since listed is '-', it means that as of the data's cutoff point, Potter Co's project hasn't been listed yet.\n\nTherefore, the claim stating that the first project proposed by Potter Co in Copiah hasn't been listed yet seems to be TRUE based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the first project proposed by Potter Co in Copiah has not yet been listed. From the table, Potter Co's row shows 'listed' as '-', indicating it hasn't been listed. This aligns with the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table structure.\n\nThe claim states: \"construction be complete in 1993 on the flowood site and in 1997 on the newsome brother / old reichhold chemical project.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts to check each individually.\n\n1. **Flowood Site Construction Completion in 1993**\n   - Looking at the table, specifically searching for \"flowood site.\"\n   - Scanning through each row:\n     - Row 4: cerclis id msd980710941, name flowood site.\n   - The relevant columns for construction completion are \"construction completed\".\n   - In Row 4, under \"construction completed,\" the date is listed as 09/17/1993. However, the claim states it was completed in 1993. Since September 1993 is within 1993, this part seems to check out.\n\n2. **Newsome Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemical Project Construction Completion in 1997**\n   - Now, looking for \"newsome brothers / old reichhold chemicals.\"\n   - Scanning the table:\n     - Row 5: cerclis id msd980840045, name newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals.\n   - Checking the \"construction completed\" column for this row:\n     - The date listed is 08/08/1997. The claim says construction was completed in 1997. August 1997 is indeed within 1997, so this part also seems correct.\n\nNext, I need to cross-verify these findings by identifying the exact rows and columns that support the claim. For Row 4, it's column \"construction completed.\" For Row 5, it's also the same column.\n\nI should ensure there are no discrepancies or missing information in the table entries that might affect the claim. In both cases, the relevant cells exist and provide the necessary dates that align with the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is fully supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}]}",

The claim is: \"all 3 of the complete project be complete between 1993 - 1997.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to say that three specific projects (presumably those marked as 'complete' in their status) were fully completed within the years 1993 through 1997.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different project with various details like cerclis id, name, county, proposed date, listed date, construction completed date, partially deleted, and deleted dates. \n\nI need to identify which rows are marked as 'completed' in their construction status. From the table:\n\n- Row 4: construction completed on 09/17/1993\n- Row 5: construction completed on 08/08/1997\n\nRow 9 also mentions \"cleanup completed before formal creation of npl,\" but I'm not sure if that counts as 'completed' in the same sense. It might refer to a different type of completion, so I'll exclude it for now.\n\nSo, rows 4 and 5 have construction completed between 1993-1997. That's two projects. The claim mentions \"all 3,\" which implies three projects. Therefore, there must be another project that I'm missing.\n\nLooking again, Row 6: construction completed is '-', so it wasn't completed yet. Row 2 and 7 are incomplete as well. Only rows 4 and 5 meet the condition of being completed between 1993-1997.\n\nSince only two projects were completed in that timeframe, the claim that all three complete projects were done during that period isn't accurate.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by analyzing the table provided. The claim states: \"2 of the project be proposed and listed during 1993, but never completed.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n1. There are two projects.\n2. Both were proposed and listed in 1993.\n3. Neither was completed.\n\nSo, my task is to check each row of the table to find any that match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- **Row 1**: Proposed on 06/14/2001. Not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: Proposed on 06/23/1993. Listed is not filled in, so probably not listed in 1993. Construction status unknown but incomplete. Partially deleted: No.\n- **Row 3**: Proposed on 05/11/2000. Not relevant.\n- **Row 4**: Proposed on 09/08/1983. Listed in 09/21/1984, construction completed in 09/17/1993. So this project was completed and listed before 1993? Wait, no\u2014construction completed in 1993, which is after 1984. But the listing was in 1984. So perhaps it was proposed earlier but completed later.\n- **Row 5**: Proposed on 10/15/1984. Listed in 06/10/1986 and construction completed in 08/08/1997. Not relevant for 1993.\n- **Row 6**: Proposed on 03/08/2004. Not relevant.\n- **Row 7**: Proposed on 05/10/1993. No listing date, so maybe not listed during 1993.\n- **Row 8**: Proposed on 09/27/2006. Not relevant.\n- **Row 9**: Proposed before formal creation of NPL but construction completed in 12/30/1982. So this project was completed before 1993.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: two projects proposed and listed in 1993 but never completed. Looking at Row 2: Chemfax Inc. was proposed on 06/23/1993. The 'listed' column is empty or not filled in, so it's unclear if it was indeed listed that year. However, construction status isn't marked as completed, and it's partially deleted. So maybe it wasn't completed.\n\nLooking for another project from 1993: Row 7 has a proposed date of 05/10/1993, but the 'listed' column is empty. Row 9 was completed in 1982, so not relevant.\n\nSo only Chemfax Inc. (Row 2) fits part of the criteria\u2014proposed in 1993. But since its listing status isn't clear and construction wasn't marked as completed, it might not fully support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim that two projects were proposed and listed during 1993 but never completed is likely FALSE because there's only one project (Row 2) that was proposed in 1993, and its completion status isn't definitively shown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"proposed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"rankin county be home to multiple project that be propose and list.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Rankin County has several projects that were both proposed and listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different company or site with various details, including their cerclis ID, name, county, proposed date, listed date, construction completion, partially deleted status, and deleted status. \n\nI need to focus on Rankin County projects because the claim is about that specific county. Let's go through each row one by one to see which ones are in Rankin County.\n\nRow 4: cerclis id msd980710941, name: flowood site, county: rankin. So this is a project in Rankin County. It was proposed on 09/08/1983 and listed on 09/21/1984. Construction completed on 09/17/1993, partially deleted status isn't filled, but it's marked as deleted on 02/16/1996.\n\nRow 8: cerclis id msd086556388, name: sonford products, county: rankin. Proposed on 09/27/2006 and listed on 03/07/2007. No construction completion date filled, but it's partially deleted as well, with a deletion status of N/A.\n\nSo there are two projects in Rankin County: flowood site and sonford products. Both were proposed and, for at least one, the listing date is provided. \n\nNow, the claim says \"multiple projects that be propose and list.\" From the table, both these projects have 'proposed' dates. Row 4's flowood site was proposed on 09/08/1983 and listed on 09/21/1984. So it both proposed and got listed. Similarly, sonford products was proposed in 2006 and listed in 2007. So both projects were not only proposed but also listed.\n\nWait, but let me check the other rows to make sure there aren't more Rankin County projects. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: Winston\nRow 2: Harrison\nRow3: Lamar\nRow4: Rankin (flowood site)\nRow5: Marion\nRow6: Pearl River\nRow7: Copiah\nRow8: Rankin (sonford products)\nRow9: Washington\nSo only two projects in Rankin County.\n\nTherefore, there are multiple projects (two) in Rankin County that were both proposed and listed. So the claim seems to be true based on this information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"listed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"proposed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"listed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what's being claimed.\n\nThe claim says: \"construct be complete during the same time frame of 1993 at the flowood site and the newsome brother.\" Wait, that seems a bit off. Maybe it's supposed to say something like both the Flowood site and Newsom Brothers had construction completed in 1993? Or maybe there's a typo, and \"newsome brother\" should be \"newsom brothers\"?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row where either \"flowood site\" or \"newsom brothers\" are mentioned.\n\nFirst, let's find the Flowood site. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 4: cerclis id: msd980710941, name: flowood site, county: rankin, proposed: 09 / 08 / 1983, listed: 09 / 21 / 1984, construction completed: 09 / 17 / 1993, partially deleted: -, deleted: 02 / 16 / 1996.\n\nSo the Flowood site had construction completed on September 17, 1993. That's one part of the claim.\n\nNow for \"newsome brothers.\" Looking through each row:\n\nRow 5: cerclis id: msd980840045, name: newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals, inc, county: marion, proposed: 10 / 15 / 1984, listed: 06 / 10 / 1986, construction completed: 08 / 08 / 1997, partially deleted: -, deleted: 09 / 27 / 2000.\n\nThe Newsom Brothers had their construction completed on August 8, 1997. So that's later than 1993.\n\nWait, the claim says both were completed during 1993. Since the Flowood site was completed in September 1993, but the Newsom Brothers were completed in 1997, that would mean only one of them was completed in 1993, not both.\n\nBut maybe I misread something. Let me double-check each row for any mention of \"newsome brothers\" without the \"old reichhold chemicals.\"\n\nIn Row 5, it's \"newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals.\" So that's the same entity as Newsom Brothers, which was completed in 1997.\n\nI don't see another row with \"newsom brothers\" or any similar names. So only Flowood site was completed in 1993, and Newsom Brothers were done later.\n\nTherefore, the claim is stating both were completed in 1993, but that's not true for both. Only one of them was completed during 1993.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify whether both the Flowood site and Newsom Brothers had their construction completed in 1993.\n\n1. **Flowood Site**:\n   - Found in Row 4, construction completed on September 17, 1993.\n   \n2. **Newsom Brothers**:\n   - Located in Row 5, construction completed on August 8, 1997, which is after 1993.\n\nSince only the Flowood site was completed in 1993 and Newsom Brothers were completed later, the claim that both were completed during the same time frame (1993) is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Row 4 for construction completion date.\n- Row 5 for construction completion date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"construction completed\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "potter co in copiah be the first project propose , but the last to be list",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"potter co in copiah be the first project propose, but the last to be listed.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that Potter Co in Copiah was the first company to propose a project, but it was the last one to have its project listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 9 rows with various companies and their details. Each row has fields like cerclis id, name, county, proposed date, listed date, construction completed, partially deleted, and deleted. \n\nI need to find Potter Co in Copiah. Scanning through the names, I see Row 7: cerclis id: msd056029648, name: potter co, county: copiah. So that's Potter Co.\n\nNow, let's check the \"proposed\" date for Potter Co. From the table, proposed is 05/10/1993. \n\nNext, I need to see when each project was proposed and listed to determine if Potter Co was first to propose but last to be listed.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 1: Proposed on 06/14/2001\nRow 2: Proposed on 06/23/1993\nRow 3: Proposed on 05/11/2000\nRow 4: Proposed on 09/08/1983\nRow 5: Proposed on 10/15/1984\nRow 6: Proposed on 03/08/2004\nRow 7: Proposed on 05/10/1993 (this is Potter Co)\nRow 8: Proposed on 09/27/2006\nRow 9: Cleanup completed before formal creation, so maybe proposed earlier?\n\nWait, Row 9 says \"cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL,\" but I'm not sure if that means it was proposed or listed. Maybe the proposed date isn't directly given here.\n\nLooking at other rows for the earliest proposed date: \n\nRow 4 has 09/08/1983, which seems to be the earliest. Row 5 is 10/15/1984, so after Row 4. Then Potter Co in 1993 (Row7), Row2 is June 1993, and others later.\n\nWait, no, Row4 is 1983, then Row5 1984, Row2 1993, Row7 also 1993, and then later years.\n\nSo the earliest proposed is Row4 on 09/08/1983. Potter Co in Row7 was proposed in 05/10/1993, which is after Row4 and Row5 but before some others.\n\nNow, to check if Potter Co was first to propose. But since Row4 has an earlier date, Potter Co isn't the first. So the claim might be false because it says Potter Co was first to propose, but actually, there's a company (probably Flowood site) that proposed earlier.\n\nBut wait, maybe the Flowood site is listed as having a construction completed date in 1993 and deleted in 1996. Its proposed date is 09/08/1983, which is before Potter Co's 05/10/1993.\n\nSo if Potter Co isn't first, then the claim is false because it claims they were first to propose but last listed.\n\nBut I also need to check their listing status. For Potter Co, in Row7, the \"listed\" date is -, meaning not listed yet? Or maybe it's blank. Wait, looking again: Row7 says listed: - , so no date provided. That suggests that Potter Co hasn't been listed yet.\n\nLooking at other companies, like Flowood site (Row4), listed on 09/21/1984. So they were listed before Potter Co? Or does it matter if Potter Co is last in being listed?\n\nWait, the claim says \"the last to be list.\" So is Potter Co's project still not listed, making it the last one to be listed?\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow1: listed on 09/13/2001\nRow2: listed as -\nRow3: listed on 07/27/2000\nRow4: listed on 09/21/1984\nRow5: listed on 06/10/1986\nRow6: listed on 07/22/2004\nRow7: listed as -\nRow8: listed on 03/07/2007\nRow9: listed as cleanup completed before formal creation.\n\nSo, the only one not listed is Potter Co (Row7) and Row2. So if Potter Co is still not listed, it's possible that they are among the last to be listed, but since there's another company in Row2 also not listed, then Potter Co isn't necessarily last.\n\nBut maybe the claim implies that all others have been listed except Potter Co, making them the last. However, looking at Row9: listed as \"cleanup completed before formal creation of NPL.\" That might mean it was listed or handled differently. I'm not sure if that counts as being listed or not.\n\nIn any case, since Potter Co is still unlisted in Row7, and others like Row2 are also unlisted, but the claim says they were last to be listed, which isn't necessarily true because there's at least one other company (Row2) also unlisted. So the claim might be false.\n\nBut wait, the key point is whether Potter Co was first to propose. Since there's a company with an earlier proposed date (Row4: 1983), then Potter Co wasn't first. Therefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly states Potter Co was first to propose.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"listed\"}]}",
