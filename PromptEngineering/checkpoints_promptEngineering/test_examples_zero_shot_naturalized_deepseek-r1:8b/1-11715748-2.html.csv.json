    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"season 13 be direct by william malone\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two things: the season number (Season 13) and the director (William Malone). The claim is asserting that Season 13 was directed by William Malone.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different episode with details like series number, season number, title, directors, writers, and original airdate. My goal is to find the specific cells in the table that relate to Season 13 and its director.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to Season 13. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 1: Series 23, Season 1\n- ...\n- Row 12: Series 34, Season 12\n- Row 13: Series 35, Season 13\n\nSo, Row 13 is the one for Season 13.\n\nNext, I'll look at the director information for this row. According to Row 13:\n- series: 35\n- season: 13\n- title: Easy Come, Easy Go\n- director(s): William Malone\n- writer(s): David Braff\n\nTherefore, the director listed for Season 13 is indeed William Malone, which matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other directors mentioned in the same row that might affect this. In Row 13, the director is clearly stated as William Malone, and no other directors are present. So there's no conflicting information here.\n\nAlso, checking other rows for Season 13: Since each season is unique, only Row 13 corresponds to Season 13. Thus, no confusion with other seasons or episodes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 13, which directly states that William Malone was the director for Season 13.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Season 13's director is William Malone as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"gilbert adler direct funhouse\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then check the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim has two main parts: \"gilbert adler\" as the director and \"funhouse\" as the title. So, I need to verify if Gilbert Adler was the director of an episode titled \"Funhouse.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different series with various details. The columns relevant here are \"director(s)\" and \"title.\" My goal is to find any row where the title is \"Funhouse\" and the director(s) includes Gilbert Adler.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find a match.\n\nRow 1: Series 23, Season 1, Title: Dream Come True. Director: George Kaczender. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Series 24, Season 2, Title: Heartbreak Hotel. Director: William Malone. No match.\nRow 3: Series 25, Season 3, Title: Welcome to Springwood. Directors: Ken Wiederhorn. Not a match.\nRow 4: Series 26, Season 4, Title: Photo Finish. Director: Tom Desimone. No match.\nRow 5: Series 27, Season 5, Title: Memory Overload. Director: Don Weis. No match.\nRow 6: Series 28, Season 6, Title: Lucky Stiff. Director: William Malone. No match.\nRow 7: Series 29, Season 7, Title: Silence is Golden. Director: Chuck Braverman. No match.\nRow 8: Series 30, Season 8, Title: Bloodlines. Directors: James Quinn. No match.\nRow 9: Series 31, Season 9, Title: Monkey Dreams. Director: Robert Englund. No match.\nRow 10: Series 32, Season 10, Title: Do You Know Where the Kids Are. Director: Bill Froelich. Not relevant.\nRow 11: Series 33, Season 11, Title: Dreams That Kill. Director: Tom De Simone. No match.\nRow 12: Series 34, Season 12, Title: What You Don't Know Can Kill You. Directors: Ken Wiederhorn. No match.\nRow 13: Series 35, Season 13, Title: Easy Come, Easy Go. Director: William Malone. No match.\nRow 14: Series 36, Season 14, Title: Prime Cut. Director: David Calloway. No match.\nRow 15: Series 37, Season 15, Title: Interior Loft. Directors: Ken Wiederhorn. No match.\nRow 16: Series 38, Season 16, Title: Interior Loft Later. Directors: Ken Wiederhorn. No match.\nRow 17: Series 39, Season 17, Title: Funhouse. Director(s): Gilbert Adler. Oh, here we go! This row matches both the title \"Funhouse\" and the director is listed as Gilbert Adler.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is TRUE because there's a row where Gilbert Adler directed an episode titled \"Funhouse.\"\n\nWait, just to double-check, I should ensure that no other rows have the same title or director. From my scan above, it seems only Row 17 has both \"Funhouse\" and Gilbert Adler as the director.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells pointing to row_index 17 and column_name \"director(s).\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 17 where Gilbert Adler is listed as the director of the episode titled \"Funhouse.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"interior loft be direct by ken wiederhorn and originally air on january 22 , 1990.\" \n\nLooking at this, there are a few parts to check. The title should be \"Interior Loft,\" the director should be Ken Wiederhorn, and the original airdate should be January 22, 1990.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row of the table for these specific details.\n\nRow 1: series 23, season 1... Doesn't match.\n...\nRow 15: series 37, season 15. The title is \"interior loft.\" So that's a match for the title part of the claim. Now, check the director and airdate.\n\nThe director listed here is Ken Wiederhorn. That matches the second part of the claim. The original airdate is January 22, 1990, which also aligns with what the claim states.\n\nNow, I need to make sure there are no other rows that might have \"Interior Loft.\" Looking through the table, Row 16 is titled \"interior loft later,\" so it's a different title. Therefore, only Row 15 matches all three criteria: title, director, and airdate.\n\nSince all the information in the claim corresponds correctly to Row 15, I can confirm that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"william malone never direct after season 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that William Malone did not direct any episodes after Season 6. From the table provided, I can see each row contains information about a series (like series: 23 up to 43), each with details like season number, title, director(s), writer(s), and original airdate.\n\nI need to check if there's any episode directed by William Malone that came after Season 6. Looking at the table:\n\n- Season 6 corresponds to Row 6 (series:28). The director for this row is William Malone.\n- Now, I should look for other episodes directed by William Malone beyond Series 28.\n\nLooking through the rest of the rows:\n- Row 7 (Season 7) has a director named Chuck Braverman. Not William Malone.\n- Row 8 (Season 8): James Quinn. No.\n- Row 9 (Season 9): Robert Englund. No.\n- Row10 (Season10): Bill Froelich. No.\n- Row11: Tom De Simone. No.\n- Row12: Ken Wiederhorn. No.\n- Row13 (Season13): William Malone again. So this is Series 35, Season13, which is after Season6.\n\nWait, so in Row13, he directed an episode after Season6, specifically Series35, Season13, titled \"easy come , easy go,\" aired January8,1990.\n\nThat means William Malone did direct after Season6. Therefore, the claim that he never directs after season6 is false because there's at least one episode he directed later on.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because William Malone directed an episode in Season 13, which is after Season 6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"funhouse be direct by al katz and write by gilbert adler.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row related to \"funhouse\" in the table. Scanning through each series number, I find that it's Row 17, series:39, title:\"funhouse.\"\n\nNext, I need to check two specific pieces of information from this row: the director(s) and the writer(s). \n\nLooking at the director column for Row 17: It says \"gilbert adler.\" So the claim mentions \"al katz\" as the director, but according to the table, it's Gilbert Adler. That doesn't match, so that part is incorrect.\n\nNow, checking the writers for Row 17: It lists \"a l katz and gilbert adler.\" The claim states both as \"al katz and gilbert adler,\" which matches exactly. So the writer part of the claim is correct.\n\nSince one part (director) is wrong and another part (writer) is right, the overall claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"writer(s)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
