    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the score of game 35 be l90 - 98 (ot)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which part of the claim needs verification. The claim specifically mentions the score for Game 35. So, my main focus will be on finding the relevant row and column in the table that corresponds to Game 35's score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, high points, etc. Each row is labeled with \"game: x\", where x is the game number. So, I need to find the row where game: 35 is mentioned.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I spot Game 35. \n\nRow 1: Game 33\nRow 2: Game 34\nRow 3: Game 35 \u2192 This is the row we're interested in.\nRow 4: Game 36\n...and so on.\n\nOnce I find Row 3, I need to check the score column. The claim says the score is \"l90 - 98 (ot)\". So, I look for the value under the \"score\" column in this row.\n\nLooking at Row 3, the score is indeed listed as \"l 90 - 98 (ot)\", which matches exactly with the claim. \n\nTherefore, there's a direct match between the claim and the table data. The information provided in the table fully supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
