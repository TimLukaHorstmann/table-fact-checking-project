    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"the crowd surpass 19000 for 3 match on 22 may 1926.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asking. It's about the crowd size at three different matches that occurred on May 22, 1926. So I need to find the crowd numbers for each of these three games from the table and check if all three crowds surpassed 19,000.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows, each representing a match between two teams with their respective scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The dates in all rows are May 22, 1926, so that part matches.\n\nNow, I need to find the crowd figures for three matches on that day. But wait, looking at the table, there are six games listed. So perhaps the claim refers to specific games, maybe the top three or any three, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. However, the way it's phrased is \"the crowd surpass 19000 for 3 match,\" which could mean that each of the three matches had crowds exceeding 19,000.\n\nLet me list out all the crowd numbers:\n\n1. Row 0: 15,000\n2. Row 1: 25,000\n3. Row 2: 14,000\n4. Row 3: 14,000\n5. Row 4: 22,000\n6. Row 5: 20,000\n\nNow, I need to identify three matches where the crowd surpassed 19,000. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: 15k \u2192 does not surpass.\n- Row 1: 25k \u2192 surpasses.\n- Row 2:14k\u2192 no.\n- Row3:14k\u2192no.\n- Row4:22k\u2192yes.\n- Row5:20k\u2192yes.\n\nSo the three matches that had crowds over 19,000 are Rows 1,4,5. Therefore, each of these three surpassed 19,000.\n\nWait, but does the claim say \"the crowd surpasses 19000 for 3 match,\" which could mean that there were three matches where the crowd did so on that day. So yes, the claim is TRUE because there are three matches with crowds over 19k on May 22,1926.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to make sure it's exactly three or at least three? The wording says \"the crowd surpasses 19000 for 3 match,\" which might imply that there were three matches where the crowd did so. Since all three of those rows have more than 19k, the claim is supported.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the ones with crowd numbers in those three matches: Row1 (25k), Row4 (22k), and Row5 (20k). Wait, but does \"3 match\" refer to exactly three or at least three? The wording isn't clear. But since all of them are over 19k, it's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones with crowd numbers for those three matches.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified as TRUE because there were three matches on May 22, 1926, where the crowd exceeded 19,000. The relevant cells correspond to these matches' crowd figures.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"for the 6 match the venue be never the same.\" Hmm, wait, I think there might be a translation issue here. Maybe it's supposed to say that for all six matches, the venues are different? Or perhaps it's trying to say something else. Let me look at the table again.\n\nThe table has six rows, each representing a match between two teams on May 22, 1926. Each row includes details like home team, away team, their scores, the venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nTo check the claim, I need to verify if all venues across these six matches are different. So I should look at the \"venue\" column for each row.\n\nRow 1: Victoria Park\nRow 2: Princes Park\nRow 3: Punt Road Oval\nRow 4: Arden Street Oval\nRow 5: Junction Oval\nRow 6: Western Oval\n\nNow, let me list them out to check for duplicates:\n- Victoria Park\n- Princes Park\n- Punt Road Oval\n- Arden Street Oval\n- Junction Oval\n- Western Oval\n\nI don't see any repeated venues here. Each venue is unique across the six matches. Therefore, the claim that \"the venue be never the same\" seems to hold true for all six matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones in the \"venue\" column for each row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for the 6 matches, the venues are never the same.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"richmond defeat hawthorn by 12 point at punt road oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has three main points: who defeated whom (Richmond vs Hawthorn), the score difference (by 12 points), and the venue (Punt Road Oval).\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the row where Richmond is the home team and Hawthorn is the away team, or vice versa. Since it's a football game, typically the home team is listed first, but sometimes the away team might be first depending on how the data is structured.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team - Collingwood vs Melbourne\nRow 2: Carlton vs South Melbourne\nRow 3: Richmond vs Hawthorn\nRow 4: North Melbourne vs Geelong\nRow 5: St Kilda vs Fitzroy\nRow 6: Footscray vs Essendon\n\nSo, Row 3 is Richmond against Hawthorn. That fits the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the scores. The home team's score is listed as \"16.16 (112)\" and the away team's score is \"14.16 (100)\". To find the difference, subtract the away team's points from the home team's points: 112 - 100 = 12 points. So Richmond won by 12 points.\n\nThe venue for this match is Punt Road Oval, which matches the third part of the claim.\n\nPutting it all together, all three aspects of the claim are met in Row 3 of the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"collingwood defeat melbourne by 5 point in front of 15000\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into key parts. The claim mentions:\n1. Collingwood (home team) defeats Melbourne (away team).\n2. The margin of victory is 5 points.\n3. The crowd present is 15,000.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details about home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date. I'll focus on Row 1 because it's the only one where Collingwood is the home team playing against Melbourne.\n\nIn Row 1:\n- Home Team: Collingwood\n- Score: 12.12 (84)\n- Away Team: Melbourne\n- Score: 12.7 (79)\n\nI need to calculate the margin of victory. The scoring system in Australian Rules Football is goals and behinds, where each goal is worth 6 points and each behind is 1 point. \n\nCollingwood scored 12 goals and 12 behinds, totaling 12*6 + 12 = 84 points.\nMelbourne scored 12 goals and 7 behinds, totaling 12*6 +7 = 79 points.\n\nThe difference between Collingwood's and Melbourne's scores is 84 - 79 = 5 points. So the margin is indeed 5 points.\n\nNext, checking the crowd number. The claim states 15,000 spectators. Looking at Row 1, the crowd is listed as 15,000. That matches.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that Collingwood is playing home and Melbourne is away in this match to confirm it's the correct game. From the table, Row 1 fits this description.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Home Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Away Team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Home Team Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"st kilda defeat fitzroy by 11 point at junction oval on 22 may 1926.\" Let me see how I can verify this using the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any that match the details in the claim. The claim mentions \"St Kilda\" as the home team, and they are playing against \"Fitzroy.\" So I need to scan through each row where the home team is St Kilda.\n\nLooking at Row 5: Home team is St Kilda with a score of 9.8 (62), away team is Fitzroy with 7.9 (51). The venue is Junction Oval, and the date is May 22, 1926. That seems to match exactly what the claim is saying.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The home team in Row 5 is indeed St Kilda, and their opponents are Fitzroy. The scores are 9.8 (62) for St Kilda and 7.9 (51) for Fitzroy. So the difference in points would be 62 minus 51, which is 11 points. That matches the claim's \"defeat by 11 point.\"\n\nThe venue is Junction Oval as per Row 5, and the date is May 22, 1926, so all details align.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any discrepancies between the claim and the table data for St Kilda vs. Fitzroy on that specific date and venue.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for a match where St Kilda is the home team playing against Fitzroy at Junction Oval on May 22, 1926.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** The claim specifies \"St Kilda\" as the home team and \"Fitzroy\" as the away team.\n2. **Search for St Kilda's Game:** Scanning through each row, Row 5 matches this criterion with St Kilda as the home team and Fitzroy as the opponent.\n3. **Check Scores:** The scores are 9.8 (62) for St Kilda and 7.9 (51) for Fitzroy, resulting in a difference of 11 points.\n4. **Venue and Date Match:** Junction Oval is listed as the venue, and the date is May 22, 1926.\n\nSince all details in Row 5 align with the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about the crowd size in a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the crowd be unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match on 22 may 1926.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. There are six rows, each representing a different match. Each row has details like home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd size, and the date.\n\nThe claim is specifically about three matches where the crowd couldn't surpass 19,000 on May 22, 1926. So I need to check the 'crowd' column for each of these three matches to see if they are all \u226419,999.\n\nLooking at the 'crowd' numbers:\n\nRow 1: 15,000\nRow 2: 25,000\nRow 3: 14,000\nRow 4: 14,000\nRow 5: 22,000\nRow 6: 20,000\n\nI need to find three rows where the crowd is \u226419,999. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0 (assuming it's index 0): 15k \u2192 yes.\n2. Row 1: 25k \u2192 nope, exceeds.\n3. Row 2: 14k \u2192 yes.\n4. Row 3: 14k \u2192 yes.\n5. Row 4: 22k \u2192 nope.\n6. Row 5: 20k \u2192 nope.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"unable to surpass 19,000 for 3 of the match.\" So three matches where crowd is \u226419,999.\n\nSo which rows have crowd \u226419,999?\n\nRows with index 0 (15k), 2 (14k), and 3 (14k). That's three rows. \n\nBut wait, row indices in the problem start at 1 or 0? The example given has the first row as index 0, so I think it's zero-based.\n\nSo for the claim to be true, these three rows (indices 0,2,3) should have crowd \u226419k. Let me check:\n\nRow 0:15k \u2192 yes\nRow 2:14k \u2192 yes\nRow 3:14k \u2192 yes\n\nYes, all three are below or equal to 19,999.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match.\" So if a crowd is exactly 20k, it's 20,000 which is more than 19k. So in rows with 20k and 22k, they can't be included.\n\nSo rows 5 (20k) and 4 (22k) are over. So only rows 0,2,3 meet the condition.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are three matches where the crowd didn't surpass 19,000.\n\nWait, but in row 1, it's 25k, which is way above. But the claim doesn't mention that; it just says that three of them couldn't surpass 19k. So focusing on the three rows with 15k,14k, and 14k.

The claim says: \"in 6 matches, only 1 venue was used more than once.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. There are six rows, each representing a match between two teams. Each row includes details like home team, away team, their scores, the venue, crowd size, and the date. The dates are all May 22, 1926, so they're all on the same day.\n\nThe claim is about the venues used across these six matches. Specifically, it says only one venue was used more than once. So I need to check how many times each venue appears in the table.\n\nLet me list out all the venues from each row:\n\n1. Victoria Park\n2. Princes Park\n3. Punt Road Oval\n4. Arden Street Oval\n5. Junction Oval\n6. Western Oval\n\nNow, I'll count how many times each venue appears:\n\n- Victoria Park: 1 time (Row 1)\n- Princes Park: 1 time (Row 2)\n- Punt Road Oval: 1 time (Row 3)\n- Arden Street Oval: 1 time (Row 4)\n- Junction Oval: 1 time (Row 5)\n- Western Oval: 1 time (Row 6)\n\nWait, that's only six venues, each used once. So none of the venues are repeated. That means no venue is used more than once across all six matches.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes venues might be named differently but refer to the same place. For example, Victoria Park could also be known as Melbourne Cricket Ground or something else? Looking at the names provided in the table: Victoria Park, Princes Park, Punt Road Oval, Arden Street Oval, Junction Oval, Western Oval. These all seem distinct based on their names.\n\nSo each venue is unique to each match. Therefore, no venue is used more than once. That means the claim \"only 1 venue was used more than once\" is false because actually, zero venues were used more than once.\n\nWait, but the original claim says \"only 1 venue be use more than 1 time.\" So it's suggesting that one venue was used twice or more. Since no venue was repeated, this makes the statement false.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE.\" Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant to verify this claim. The relevant columns would be the ones containing the venue names because we're checking how many times each venue appears.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"Richmond be unable to defeat Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see which ones are relevant. The key points in the claim are Richmond (home team), Hawthorn (away team), and the venue is Punt Road Oval. So I'm looking for a match where Richmond plays against Hawthorn at their home ground, Punt Road Oval.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Home team is Collingwood, so that's not relevant. Row 2: Carlton vs South Melbourne, no. Row 3: Home team Richmond vs Hawthorn. That seems relevant because the claim mentions both teams. The venue here is Punt Road Oval, which matches the venue in the claim. So this row could be important.\n\nRow 4: North Melbourne vs Geelong, not related. Row 5: St Kilda vs Fitzroy, nope. Row 6: Footscray vs Essendon, nothing to do with Richmond or Hawthorn. \n\nSo only Row 3 seems relevant because it's the only one where Richmond is playing against Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval.\n\nNow, looking at their scores. Richmond scored 16.16 (112) and Hawthorn scored 14.16 (100). So Richmond won that game with a score of 112 to Hawthorn's 100. That means Richmond did defeat Hawthorn on that day.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"Richmond be unable to defeat Hawthorn,\" but according to the table, they actually did defeat them. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"collingwood lose to melbourne by 5 point in front of 15000 spectator\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see how it relates to the information in the table.\n\n1. **Teams Involved**: The claim mentions Collingwood and Melbourne as the teams. Looking at the table:\n   - Row 0 (Row 1) has home team Collingwood vs away team Melbourne.\n   - So, this part of the claim is correct based on the first row.\n\n2. **Score Difference**: The claim says Collingwood loses by 5 points. I need to check the scores for both teams in their respective games. In Row 0:\n   - Collingwood's score: 12.12 (84)\n   - Melbourne's score: 12.7 (79)\n   \n   To find the point difference, subtract the lower score from the higher one. So, 84 - 79 = 5 points. This matches the claim.\n\n3. **Crowd Attendance**: The claim states there were 15000 spectators. Checking Row 0, the crowd is indeed listed as 15000. So this part is correct too.\n\nNow, putting it all together: All parts of the claim are supported by the data in Row 0 (which corresponds to the first row in the table). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "fitzroy lose to st kilda by 11 point at junction oval on 22 march 1926",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with six rows, each representing a different game on the same date, May 22, 1926. The claim I'm checking is about Fitzroy losing to St Kilda by 11 points at Junction Oval on March 22, 1926. \n\nFirst, I need to see if the dates match. In the table, all games are on May 22, but the claim mentions March 22. That's a problem because the dates don't align. Maybe it's a typo in the claim? But since the date in the table is May, not March, this might make the claim false.\n\nNext, looking at the teams. The claim says Fitzroy lost to St Kilda. In the table, I have to find where both these teams are playing each other. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: Collingwood vs Melbourne\nRow 2: Carlton vs South Melbourne\nRow 3: Richmond vs Hawthorn\nRow 4: North Melbourne vs Geelong\nRow 5: St Kilda vs Fitzroy\nRow 6: Footscray vs Essendon\n\nSo, in Row 5, St Kilda is the home team and Fitzroy is the away team. That's the game where they play each other.\n\nNow, checking the scores. St Kilda scored 9.8 (62), and Fitzroy scored 7.9 (51). The difference between these two scores is 62 - 51 = 11 points. So yes, Fitzroy lost by 11 points.\n\nThe venue in the claim is Junction Oval, which matches Row 5's venue.\n\nWait, but the date in the claim is March 22, while in the table it's May 22. That's a discrepancy. The same date applies to all games in the table, so if the claim uses an earlier month, that's incorrect.\n\nSo, even though the team names and the score difference match, the dates don't. Therefore, the claim is false because of the wrong date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the date as March 22 instead of May 22, which makes it false despite other accurate details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
