    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim is: \"Among the players in the df position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The table lists players with various attributes, including their name, position, and statistics like league apps (appearances) and league goals. The claim is specifically about the 'df' position (which stands for defender, I assume), and it's comparing how many league goals each player has scored.\n\nSo, my first step is to look through the table and find all players who are in the 'df' position. Then, among these players, check their total league goals to see if Dave Sutton indeed has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- Row 1: Jim Branagan - df\n- Row 2: Malcolm Brown - df\n- Row 3: David Cowling - mf (not df)\n- Row 4: Peter Fletcher - fw (not df)\n- Row 5: Keith Hanvey - df\n- Row 6: Peter Hart - mf (not df)\n- Row 7: Ian Holmes - mf (not df)\n- Row 8: Steve Kindon - fw (not df)\n- Row 9: Mick Laverick - mf (not df)\n- Row 10: Bernard Purdie - df\n- Row 11: Andy Rankin - gk (not df)\n- Row 12: Ian Robins - fw (not df)\n- Row 13: Fred Robinson - df\n- Row 14: Tommy Smith - fw (not df)\n- Row 15: Brian Stanton - mf (not df)\n- Row 16: Alan Starling - gk (not df)\n- Row 17: Dave Sutton - df\n- Row 18: Chris Topping - df\n\nSo, the players in 'df' position are Jim Branagan (Row 1), Malcolm Brown (Row 2), Keith Hanvey (Row 5), Bernard Purdie (Row 10), Fred Robinson (Row 13), and Dave Sutton (Row 17), along with Chris Topping (Row 18). Wait, let me double-check: Row 18 is Chris Topping, position df.\n\nNow, for each of these players, I need to find their league goals. \n\n- Jim Branagan: League goals = 0\n- Malcolm Brown: League goals = 2\n- Keith Hanvey: League goals = 2\n- Bernard Purdie: League goals = 0\n- Fred Robinson: League goals = 1\n- Chris Topping: League goals = 0\n- Dave Sutton: League goals = 6\n\nSo, looking at these numbers: 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, and 6 for Dave Sutton. Clearly, 6 is the highest among these. Therefore, Dave Sutton does have the most league goals among df players.\n\nNow, the relevant cells are those that contain the data needed to verify this claim. Specifically, I need to look at each player's row index and their 'League Goals' column.\n\nSo, for each df player:\n\n1. Row 1: Jim Branagan - League Goals (0)\n2. Row 2: Malcolm Brown - League Goals (2)\n3. Row 5: Keith Hanvey - League Goals (2)\n4. Row 10: Bernard Purdie - League Goals (0)\n5. Row 13: Fred Robinson - League Goals (1)\n6. Row 17: Dave Sutton - League Goals (6)\n7. Row 18: Chris Topping - League Goals (0)\n\nThese are the relevant cells because they directly show each player's league goal count, which is necessary to confirm whether Dave Sutton has the highest number.\n\nSo, in the JSON output, I need to list these rows with their indices and column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Dave Sutton has the highest number of league goals among all defenders listed. The relevant cells are those containing each defender's league goal count.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"League Goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the 2 player with the highest league apps be malcolm brown and peter hart.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what \"league apps\" mean. Looking at the table, each row represents a player's stats, including their name, position, and various app counts\u2014like league apps, fa cup apps, etc. So, \"league apps\" are the number of times each player has appeared in the league.\n\nThe task is to check if Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart have the two highest numbers in this column. I'll need to go through each row's \"league apps\" count and identify who has the top two.\n\nLet me list out all the players along with their \"league apps\":\n\n1. Jim Branagan: 0\n2. Malcolm Brown: 46\n3. David Cowling: 39 (but there's a note in parentheses, but I think it's just part of the number, so maybe 39)\n4. Peter Fletcher: 30 (8) \u2013 Wait, does that mean 30 or is it 30 with some notation? Maybe it's 30. Similarly, other numbers might have extra digits because of positions in brackets.\n5. Keith Hanvey: 33\n6. Peter Hart: 46\n7. Ian Holmes: 6 (4) \u2013 probably 6\n8. Steve Kindon: 22 (1)\n9. Mick Laverick: 45\n10. Bernard Purdie: 18 (4)\n11. Andy Rankin: 24\n12. Ian Robins: 45\n13. Fred Robinson: 30\n14. Tommy Smith: 0\n15. Brian Stanton: 41\n16. Alan Starling: 22\n17. Dave Sutton: 46\n18. Chris Topping: 13\n\nNow, I'll list the \"league apps\" in order:\n\n- Malcolm Brown: 46\n- Peter Hart: 46\n- Dave Sutton: 46\n- Mick Laverick: 45\n- Ian Robins: 45\n- Brian Stanton: 41\n- Peter Fletcher: 30 (but with (8), but I think it's just the number, so 30)\n- Keith Hanvey: 33\n- David Cowling: 39\n- Steve Kindon: 22\n- Bernard Purdie: 18\n- Ian Holmes: 6\n- Andy Rankin:24\n- Chris Topping:13\n- Tommy Smith:0\n\nWait, so Malcolm Brown has 46, Peter Hart also has 46, and Dave Sutton also has 46. So the top three have 46 each. The next is Mick Laverick with 45, then Ian Robins with 45.\n\nSo the two highest are both 46. But the claim says \"the 2 player\" (plural) which would be Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart. However, there's also Dave Sutton who has the same number of league apps as them. So does that affect the claim?\n\nThe claim is about the top two players with the highest league apps being Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart. But since three players have 46, they are all tied for first place. Therefore, it's not just the two but three. So the claim might be incorrect because there's another player (Dave Sutton) who also has 46.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If league apps are the same across multiple players, does that mean those players share the highest? In that case, Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart are among the top two, but not necessarily the sole top two. The claim says \"the 2 player with the highest,\" which might imply exactly two, so maybe it's FALSE because there's a third player tied at the top.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes in such contexts, when multiple players have the same max, they all share the highest. So the two players mentioned are correct as part of the top, but not necessarily the sole top two. However, the wording says \"the 2 player with the highest,\" which might imply exactly those two. Since there's a third, it would be incorrect.\n\nSo to verify, I need to check the cells for Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart's league apps to see their numbers. Their row indices are:\n\n- Malcolm Brown: row 1 (index 1)\n- Peter Hart: row 5 (index 5)\n\nI should also include Dave Sutton since his league apps are equal, but maybe that's not necessary unless the claim is about exactly two.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be for rows 1 and 5, checking their \"league apps\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart have the highest number of league appearances. However, Dave Sutton also has the same count, making three players tied at the top. Since there are more than two players with the highest league apps, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the player with the highest number of league goal be ian robin.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a player named Ian Robin who has the most league goals. So I should look for Ian Robin in the table and check his league goals compared to others.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 18 rows with players' names, positions, and various statistics. Let me scan through each row to see if there's someone named Ian Robin.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Jim Branagan, then Malcolm Brown, David Cowling, Peter Fletcher, Keith Hanvey, Peter Hart, Ian Holmes, Steve Kindon, Mick Laverick, Bernard Purdie, Andy Rankin, Ian Robins, Fred Robinson, Tommy Smith, Brian Stanton, Alan Starling, Dave Sutton, Chris Topping.\n\nWait, here in Row 12: name: ian robins. That's spelled as \"ian robins,\" but the claim says \"Ian Robin.\" The names seem similar but might be different spellings or variations. I need to check if it's the same person. Sometimes players have slight name variations, so I'm not sure if Ian Robins is the same as Ian Robin.\n\nAssuming they are the same person for now, I'll proceed. If they're not, then maybe the claim is false because there might be another player named Ian Robinson with higher league goals.\n\nLooking at Row 12: ian robins, position: fw, and his stats include league goals: 25. That's a pretty high number.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players have more than 25 league goals. Let me go through the rest of the table.\n\nRow 4: Peter Fletcher has 17 league goals.\nRow 6: Peter Hart has 4.\nRow 7: Ian Holmes has 3.\nRow 12: ian robins has 25.\nRow 14: Tommy Smith has 0.\nRow 15: Brian Stanton has 9.\nRow 16: Alan Starling has 0.\nRow 17: Dave Sutton has 6.\nRow 18: Chris Topping has 0.\n\nLooking at these, the highest number of league goals I see is 25 by ian robins. None of the other players have more than that. So if Ian Robin is indeed referring to ian robins, then he has the highest number of league goals.\n\nBut wait, there's a possible mix-up in the names. The claim says \"Ian Robin,\" but the table lists \"Ian Robins.\" Maybe they are different people or it's a typo. If it's a typo and the intended name is \"Ian Robins,\" then he does have the highest league goals.\n\nHowever, if the claim refers to someone else named Ian Robin who isn't in the table with higher league goals, then the statement would be false. Alternatively, maybe there's another player named Ian Robin elsewhere that I missed.\n\nLooking again through all rows, I don't see any other player with \"Ian\" and \"Robin\" or similar last names. Most have variations like \"Robins,\" \"Branagan,\" etc., but not exactly matching \"Robin.\"\n\nSo if the claim is specifically about a player named Ian Robin, and that person isn't in the table, then the claim is false. But if it's referring to ian robins, who does have 25 league goals, then it might be true.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the names are slightly different. I think the correct approach is to consider whether \"Ian Robin\" exists as a separate player or if it's a variation of \"Ian Robins.\" Without more information, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table has a typo and the name should be \"Ian Robin\" instead of \"Ian Robins.\" If that were the case, then he would indeed have the highest league goals, making the claim true.\n\nBut since the names don't exactly match, I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should check if any other players close to him have higher numbers, but from what I see, no one else has more than 25.\n\nIn conclusion, if \"Ian Robin\" is a typo for \"Ian Robins,\" then he does have the highest league goals, making the claim true. Otherwise, if \"Ian Robin\" isn't in the table, it's false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to verify whether \"Ian Robin\" is the player with the highest number of league goals based on the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify the Player**: Locate the player named \"Ian Robin\" in the table.\n2. **Check League Goals**: If found, compare their league goal count to others.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Scanning through all 18 rows, there is no direct match for \"Ian Robin.\" However, there's a row for \"Ian Robins\" (Row 12) with 25 league goals.\n- Assuming it's a possible variation or typo, if \"Ian Robins\" is intended, they have the highest number of league goals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIf \"Ian Robin\" refers to \"Ian Robins,\" then the claim holds true. Otherwise, without \"Ian Robin\" in the table, the claim is false.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, \"Ian Robin\" isn't listed, but \"Ian Robins\" exists with high league goals. This suggests a possible name variation or typo.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe claim is considered true if \"Ian Robin\" is intended to be \"Ian Robins,\" as they have the highest league goals. Otherwise, it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"league_goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three things: \"dave sutton,\" \"the list,\" \"league goal,\" and \"df position.\" I think the user might be referring to whether Dave Sutton has a certain number of league goals listed under his \"DF\" (defender) position in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with various statistics. The relevant columns for this claim would likely be \"name,\" \"position,\" and \"league goals.\" So I need to find Dave Sutton's row and check those specific cells.\n\nI'll start by scanning through all 18 rows to locate the one where the name is \"dave sutton.\" Let me go row by row:\n\n1. jim branagan\n2. malcolm brown\n3. david cowling\n4. peter fletcher\n5. keith hanvey\n6. peter hart\n7. ian holmes\n8. steve kindon\n9. mick laverick\n10. bernard purdie\n11. andy rankin\n12. ian robins\n13. fred robinson\n14. tommy smith\n15. brian stanton\n16. alan starling\n17. dave sutton\n18. chris topping\n\nThere it is, row 17: name: dave sutton, position: df.\n\nNow, I need to check the \"league goals\" cell for this player. According to the table, Dave Sutton has 6 league goals in total.\n\nThe claim says he \"have[s] the list league goal in df position.\" Assuming this means that under the DF position, his league goals are present and correct. Since we've found his row and his league goals, it seems accurate. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Dave Sutton is indeed a defender (DF position), and he has 6 league goals listed.

The claim is: \"the player with the highest number of total goal be ian robin.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The key points are:\n1. Identify who the player is: it's Ian Robins.\n2. Determine if he has the highest total goals among all players listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to find out how many total goals each player has scored. Then, compare that number with Ian Robins' total goals.\n\nI start by scanning through each row's \"total goals\" column:\n\n- Row 1: Total Goals: 0\n- Row 2: Total Goals: 3\n- Row 3: Total Goals: 10\n- Row 4: Total Goals: 18\n- Row 5: Total Goals: 2\n- Row 6: Total Goals: 5\n- Row 7: Total Goals: 4\n- Row 8: Total Goals: 14\n- Row 9: Total Goals: 4\n- Row 10: Total Goals: 0\n- Row 11: Total Goals: 0\n- Row 12: Total Goals: 27\n- Row 13: Total Goals: 1\n- Row 14: Total Goals: 0\n- Row 15: Total Goals: 9\n- Row 16: Total Goals: 0\n- Row 17: Total Goals: 7\n- Row 18: Total Goals: 0\n\nNow, I need to find the player with the highest total goals. The highest number here is 27, which is in row 12 for Ian Robins.\n\nWait a second\u2014does the claim say \"Ian Robin\" correctly? Because in the table, the name is spelled \"ian robins\" (all lowercase) without the 'd' at the end of \"Robbin.\" So there's a possible typo. If the claim says \"Ian Robins\" with an extra 's,' that would be incorrect because the actual name in the table is \"ian robins.\"\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions \"ian robin,\" which matches exactly what's in the table, except for the missing 's' in his last name. However, names can sometimes have slight variations, but here it's crucial because if the name doesn't match exactly, then it's a different person.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"the player with the highest number of total goal be ian robin.\" So the first part is about who has the most goals, and the second part is identifying that player as \"ian robin,\" which matches row 12. So even if there's a typo in the last name (missing 's'), as long as the claim refers to him correctly, it might still hold.\n\nBut actually, the exact name in the table is \"ian robins\" without an extra 's.' The claim uses \"ian robin,\" which is missing the 's' as well. So maybe that's a typo in both cases. Therefore, it's correct because it refers to the same person.\n\nSo, the highest total goals is 27 by Ian Robins, which matches what the claim says. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe player with the highest total goals is indeed Ian Robins, as per the table provided. The name \"ian robin\" in the claim corresponds to row 12 of the table, where his total goals are recorded as 27.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Total Goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that Peter Hart is the only player who does not have 0 FA Cup goals. That means, according to the claim, all other players should have 0 FA Cup goals, and Peter Hart has some non-zero number of FA Cup goals.\n\nSo I need to look at each row in the table and check the \"fa cup goals\" column for every player except Peter Hart. If any of them have a value greater than zero, then the claim is false because there's another player besides Peter who doesn't have 0 FA Cup goals.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Jim Branagan has fa cup goals 0.\nRow 2: Malcolm Brown also has 0.\nRow 3: David Cowling, 0.\nRow 4: Peter Fletcher, 0.\nRow 5: Keith Hanvey, 0.\nRow 6: Peter Hart.

Both Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart have 46 each. Now, checking if Chris Topping and Dave Sutton have this number. \n\nChris Topping has 13, which isn't the highest. Dave Sutton also has 46, but since there are others with the same value (Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart), it's not just the two of them; there are three players with 46 league apps.\n\nTherefore, Chris Topping doesn't have the highest, but Dave Sutton does share the highest with others. The claim says \"Chris Topping and Dave Sutton\" specifically. Since Chris doesn't have the highest, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"tommy smith has the highest number of league goals.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided and find Tommy Smith's data. Let me scan each row until I find his name.\n\nLooking at Row 14: name: tommy smith. That's Tommy Smith. His position is fw (forward), which makes sense for scoring goals.\n\nNow, I need to check how many league goals he has. The relevant column here is \"league goals.\" Looking at his stats in the table, under \"league goals\" it says 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right because other players have higher numbers. Let me double-check. For example, Row 2: malcolm brown has 2 league goals. Row 4: peter fletcher has 17, which is way higher. Even in the same position as Tommy Smith, like david cowling (10) and ian holmes (3), they have more. So Tommy Smith's 0 league goals are definitely not the highest.\n\nSo the claim must be false because there are multiple players with higher league goal counts than him.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Tommy Smith has 0 league goals, which is not the highest among all players in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the claim and check it against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 2 player with the highest number of total goal ian robin and chris topping.\" So, I'm looking for two players named Ian Robins and Chris Topping who have the highest total goals in their respective positions. \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the rows where the names are Ian Robins and Chris Topping.\n\nStarting with Ian Robins, I scan each row until I find his name. He's in Row 12. The columns related to total goals would be \"total goals.\" Looking at Row 12: total goals is 27. \n\nNext, I search for Chris Topping. His row is Row 18. Checking the \"total goals\" column here, it shows 0.\n\nNow, comparing their total goals: Ian Robins has 27, and Chris Topping has 0. The claim suggests that both have the highest number of total goals. However, since Chris Topping's total goals are zero, which is not the highest, the claim doesn't hold. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while Ian Robins does have a high number of total goals, Chris Topping does not.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that both Ian Robins and Chris Topping have the highest total goals, but upon checking, only Ian Robins meets this criterion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a given claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table provided. Each row represents a player with various statistics, including their name, position, and data for different competitions like league, FA Cup, League Cup, etc. The specific columns relevant to the claim are \"fa cup goals.\"\n\nThe claim is stating that there are two other players, besides Peter Hart, who have at least one FA Cup goal. So, I need to check each player's \"fa cup goals\" and see if exactly two of them (excluding Peter Hart) have a value greater than zero.\n\nLet me start by locating Peter Hart in the table. Looking through the rows, row 6 is Peter Hart. His position is midfielder (mf), and his FA Cup apps are 1, but his FA Cup goals are also 1. So he definitely has at least one FA Cup goal.\n\nNow, I need to go through each of the other players and check their \"fa cup goals\" column. Let's list them out:\n\nRow 1: Jim Branagan - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 2: Malcolm Brown - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 3: David Cowling - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 4: Peter Fletcher - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 5: Keith Hanvey - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 6: Peter Hart (already counted)\nRow 7: Ian Holmes - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 8: Steve Kindon - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 9: Mick Laverick - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 10: Bernard Purdie - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 11: Andy Rankin - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 12: Ian Robins - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 13: Fred Robinson - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 14: Tommy Smith - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 15: Brian Stanton - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 16: Alan Starling - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 17: Dave Sutton - fa cup goals: 0\nRow 18: Chris Topping - fa cup goals: 0\n\nLooking through all of these, I notice that every other player (excluding Peter Hart) has a FA Cup goals value of 0. So, there are zero players besides Peter Hart who have at least one FA Cup goal.\n\nThe claim says \"2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal.\" Since the actual number is zero instead of two, this claim is false.\n\nNow, to verify which cells are relevant, I need to identify each row and column that has a non-zero value in FA Cup goals. But since only Peter Hart has a value greater than zero (FA Cup goals:1), no other rows have any relevant data for the claim. Therefore, no other cells besides Peter Hart's FA Cup goals are relevant.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I need to list all relevant cells that check against the claim. Since the claim is about other players having FA Cup goals, and none of them do, perhaps the relevant_cells would be those with FA cup goals >0. But in this case, only Peter Hart has that, so maybe it's just his cell.\n\nBut the claim is specifically about two others, so I think any cells that show whether other players have FA Cup goals are relevant. So perhaps all rows' fa cup goals columns should be checked. However, since most of them are zero, only Peter Hart's is positive.\n\nSo in terms of the JSON response, the answer would be \"FALSE\" because there aren't two other players with FA Cup goals, and the relevant_cells would include all rows where fa cup goals are non-zero, but since only Peter Hart has that, it's just his cell.\n\nBut perhaps I should list all the cells, even if their value is zero, because they contribute to verifying that no other player meets the condition. However, according to the example given in the problem statement, the relevant_cells include both positive and negative checks? Or maybe not. Wait, the example includes cells with specific values but perhaps only those that are relevant to the claim.\n\nBut since the claim is about two players having FA Cup goals, I think any cell that has a non-zero value would be relevant because it contradicts or supports the claim. So in this case, only Peter Hart's fa cup goals are 1, which means others have zero. Therefore, all other rows' fa cup goals columns are also relevant as they show zero.\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating it. The instruction says to carefully check each condition against the table and determine which cells are relevant. So for verifying whether \"2 other player apart from peter hart have fa cup goal,\" I need to look at all players' fa cup goals, but since only Peter Hart has a positive value, others do not, so all other cells in the fa cup goals column would be 0, except Peter's.\n\nWait, no, because the claim is about two other players having FA Cup goals. So the relevant_cells are the rows where fa cup goals >0, which is just row 6 (Peter Hart). But since we're looking for two others, perhaps the cells of interest are those that show whether they have any goal or not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relevant_cells include all the rows' fa cup goals columns because each row's value contributes to determining if there are other players with FA Cup goals. So even though most are zero, they still need to be checked against the claim.\n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is that since the claim is about two other players having FA Cup goals, any cell in the fa cup goals column (excluding Peter Hart) that has a value >0 would make the statement true. Since none do, those cells are not present. So maybe the only relevant cell is Peter Hart's to confirm he does have a goal, but since others don't, it's still false.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to stick to the basic approach:\n\n- The claim says two other players besides Peter Hart have FA Cup goals.\n- Check each player's fa cup goals column.\n- Count how many non-zero values there are among them (excluding Peter Hart).\n- If exactly two, answer is TRUE; else, FALSE.\n\nSince none of the other players have FA Cup goals, the count is zero. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, for relevant_cells: all rows' fa cup goals columns, because each row's value affects whether the condition in the claim is met. Since only Peter Hart has a positive value, perhaps only his cell is relevant, but others are also part of the data that doesn't support the claim. However, since the instruction isn't entirely clear on this point, I think it's safer to include all cells that have FA cup goals, as they are directly related to verifying the claim.\n\nSo in the JSON response, answer would be \"FALSE,\" and relevant_cells would include each row's fa cup goals column because each of their values (including zero) contributes to determining whether two others have goals. However, since none do except Peter Hart, perhaps it's just his cell. But I'm not sure. To be thorough, I'll list all 18 rows' fa cup goals columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"fa cup goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
