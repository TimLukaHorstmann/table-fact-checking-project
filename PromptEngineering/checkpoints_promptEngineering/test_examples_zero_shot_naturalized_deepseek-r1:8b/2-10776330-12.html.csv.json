    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcg be the venue when the crowd be more than 29000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there's a match where the venue is McG and the crowd was over 29,000 people. So I need to look through each row of the table and check for any matches where the venue is McG and the crowd number exceeds 29,000.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: Venue is Western Oval with 16,648 crowd.\nRow 2: Venue is Windy Hill with 12,800.\nRow 3: Venue is Victoria Park with 20,700.\nRow 4: Venue is Princes Park with 14,636.\nRow 5: Venue is Lake Oval with 13,860.\nRow 6: Venue is McG with 29,947 crowd.\n\nSo, I need to focus on Row 6. The venue there is indeed McG and the crowd is 29,947 which is more than 29,000. That seems to fit the claim perfectly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if any other rows might have a crowd over 29k. Looking at all the other venues: Western Oval, Windy Hill, Victoria Park, Princes Park, Lake Oval\u2014all of these have crowds under 29k. The only row where the crowd exceeds 29k is Row 6 at McG.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 6. So, it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table has six rows with details about each match, including the home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It says that all matches were held on 8 July 1961. So, my goal is to check if every single match listed in the table took place on that specific date.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"date\" column.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"north melbourne be the away team when the crowd be least.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that on a particular date, North Melbourne was the away team and at the same time, it was the game with the least crowd attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, all rows have the same date: 8 July 1961. So we don't need to consider different dates; it's just that specific day.\n\nNext, I need to check each row to see if North Melbourne is listed as the away team and also verify the crowd number for those games.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Footscray, away is Richmond. So not North Melbourne.\n\nRow 2: Home is Essendon, away is North Melbourne. So here, North Melbourne is the away team. The crowd is 12800.\n\nRow 3: Collingwood home, Geelong away. Not North Melbourne.\n\nRow 4: Carlton home, St Kilda away. Not North Melbourne.\n\nRow 5: South Melbourne home, Hawthorn away. Not North Melbourne.\n\nRow 6: Melbourne home, Fitzroy away. Not North Melbourne.\n\nSo the only game where North Melbourne is the away team is Row 2, with a crowd of 12800.\n\nNow, I need to check if this was indeed the game with the least crowd attendance compared to others on that day. So I should look at all the other games for the same date and see what their crowds were.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n- Row 1: 16648\n- Row 2: 12800\n- Row 3: 20700\n- Row 4: 14636\n- Row 5: 13860\n- Row 6: 29947\n\nThe smallest crowd in these is 12800, which is the one in Row 2. So yes, when North Melbourne was away, that game had the least crowd.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because North Melbourne was indeed the away team and their game had the lowest attendance on that date.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: the claim mentions two parts\u2014North Melbourne being the away team and the crowd being the least. So I need to find which rows have \"north melbourne\" as the away team and also have a crowd value.\n\nLooking at Row 2: away team is North Melbourne, so that's one cell. The crowd in this row is 12800, which is the minimum. But since the claim is about both conditions (being away and least crowd), I need to note both aspects.\n\nWait, but in the instruction, it says to list relevant cells based on checking each condition against the table. So for \"north melbourne be the away team\", we look at row 2. For \"crowd be least,\" we have to see which game had the lowest crowd, which is also row 2.\n\nSo the relevant cells are both in row 2: one for the away team being North Melbourne and another for having the least crowd.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about when North Melbourne was away AND it's the least crowd. So maybe I need to consider all rows where North Melbourne is away and check if their crowd is indeed the least.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each condition refers to separate aspects: checking if North Melbourne is the away team (so row 2) and also checking the minimum crowd across all games on that date (which is in row 2 as well). So the relevant cells are both row 2's away team and its crowd.\n\nSo, to list them:\n\n1. For the away team being North Melbourne: row_index=2, column_name=\"away team\"\n2. For the least crowd: find which game had the minimum crowd, which is also row 2 with crowd=12800.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include both aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]}",

The claim says: \"away team score be 6.8 (44), when melbourne play home game in mcg\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. Away team score: 6.8 (44)\n2. Home team: Melbourne\n3. Venue: McG\n\nI need to verify each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has six rows. Each row lists home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date. The dates are all July 8, 1961, so that's consistent.\n\nStarting with the away team score: 6.8 (44). I'll scan each row to see if any away team scored this. \n\n- Row 0: Away team is Richmond with 4.9 (33)\n- Row 1: Away team is North Melbourne with 3.10 (28)\n- Row 2: Away team is Geelong with 8.10 (58)\n- Row 3: Away team is St Kilda with 3.12 (30)\n- Row 4: Away team is Hawthorn with 9.11 (65)\n- Row 5: Away team is Fitzroy with 6.8 (44)\n\nWait, in row 5, the away team is Fitzroy and their score is 6.8 (44). So yes, there's an away team that scored this. But wait, the claim says \"away team score be 6.8 (44), when melbourne play home game in mcg\". So does this fit?\n\nNow checking if Melbourne is playing a home game at McG. Let's look for rows where the home team is Melbourne.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team Footscray, venue Western Oval\n- Row 1: Home team Essendon, venue Windy Hill\n- Row 2: Home team Collingwood, venue Victoria Park\n- Row 3: Home team Carlton, venue Princes Park\n- Row 4: Home team South Melbourne, venue Lake Oval\n- Row 5: Home team Melbourne, venue McG\n\nAh, row 5 shows Melbourne as the home team at McG. So that's correct.\n\nNow, in this row (row 5), the away team is Fitzroy with a score of 6.8 (44). So both conditions are met: there's an away team scoring 6.8 (44) when Melbourne plays a home game at McG.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"away team score be 6.8 (44)\", so in row 5, that's true because Fitzroy is the away team with that score. But wait, the user might have meant that the away team in Melbourne's home game scores 6.8 (44), which is indeed Fitzroy in row 5.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are met. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would include the row where this happens, which is row 5, checking both the away team score and the venue.\n\nBut wait, the JSON structure requires to list the columns checked. So for the claim, we need to check two things: the away team's score and the home team and venue. \n\nSo in the table, I have to look at each relevant cell:\n\n1. The away team score: it's 6.8 (44) in row 5, so column \"away team score\" is checked.\n2. Home team: Melbourne is in row 5, so check \"home team\".\n3. Venue: McG is in row 5, so check \"venue\".\n\nBut the claim mentions all three together, so I need to include all three columns that are part of the claim.\n\nWait, the claim is about the away team's score when Melbourne plays at McG as a home game. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the away team's score: row 5, column \"away team score\".\n- For the home team: row 5, column \"home team\".\n- For the venue: row 5, column \"venue\".\n\nSo all three columns need to be checked in row 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE and the relevant cells are row 5 for these three columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim is: \"mcg be the venue where the crowd be under 20000\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the claim, it mentions two main points: the venue is McG, and the crowd size is less than 20,000. So I need to check both parts from the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd number, and date. My task is to find any rows where the venue is McG and then see if the crowd for that game was under 20,000.\n\nStarting with the venue column, I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Venue is Western Oval \u2013 not McG.\nRow 2: Venue is Windy Hill \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Victoria Park \u2013 not McG.\nRow 4: Princes Park \u2013 no.\nRow 5: Lake Oval \u2013 no.\nRow 6: McG \u2013 yes, this row's venue is McG.\n\nSo only Row 6 is relevant for the venue part of the claim. Now, checking the crowd number for that row. The crowd in Row 6 is 29947, which is way over 20,000. So even though the venue is McG, the crowd doesn't meet the under-20,000 condition.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim aren't fully supported by the table (venue is correct but crowd isn't), the entire statement should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that McG is the venue with a crowd under 20,000. Checking the table, only Row 6 has McG as the venue, but its crowd is 29,947, which exceeds 20,000.

So the task is to determine if the claim \"north melbourne be the home team where the attendance be lowest\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that North Melbourne is the home team with the lowest attendance. To verify this, I should look for the row where the home team is North Melbourne and check their crowd number. Then compare it with all other home teams' attendances to see if theirs is indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: home team, away team, home score, away score, venue, crowd, and date. Since the claim is about attendance, I'm focusing on the \"crowd\" column.\n\nNow, let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Footscray with a crowd of 16648.\nRow 2: Home team is Essendon with a crowd of 12800.\nRow 3: Home team is Collingwood with a crowd of 20700.\nRow 4: Home team is Carlton with a crowd of 14636.\nRow 5: Home team is South Melbourne with a crowd of 13860.\nRow 6: Home team is Melbourne with a crowd of 29947.\n\nWait, I don't see North Melbourne listed as a home team in any row.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify which cells in the table support this claim.\n\nThe claim is: \"the away team score be 9.9 (63) , when north melbourne play away at windy hill.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. The away team's score is 9.9 (63).\n2. The game involves North Melbourne playing away.\n3. The venue is Windy Hill.\n\nSo, I need to find a row in the table where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The rows are from 0 (first) to 5 (sixth).\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: Home team is Footscray with a score of 6.6 (42). Away team is Richmond with 4.9 (33). Venue is Western Oval. Doesn't match the away score or team.\n\n- **Row 2**: Home team Essendon scored 9.9 (63), away is North Melbourne with 3.10 (28). Venue is Windy Hill. Here, the away team is North Melbourne and their score is 3.10 (28). Not matching the claim's score of 9.9 (63).\n\n- **Row 3**: Collingwood vs Geelong at Victoria Park. Neither team has 9.9 (63), so no.\n\n- **Row 4**: Carlton vs St Kilda at Princes Park. No match for 9.9 (63) away score.\n\n- **Row 5**: South Melbourne vs Hawthorn at Lake Oval. Away team scored 9.11 (65). Not 9.9 (63), and the team is Hawthorn, not North Melbourne.\n\n- **Row 6**: Melbourne vs Fitzroy at MCG. Both teams have 6.8 (44). No match.\n\nWait a minute. Wait, in Row 2, the home team is Essendon with 9.9 (63). The away team is North Melbourne with 3.10 (28). So the away team's score here is 28, not 63. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHold on, perhaps I misread something. Let me check Row 2 again:\n\nRow 2: home team Essendon scored 9.9 (63), away North Melbourne scored 3.10 (28). Venue Windy Hill. So the claim says when North Melbourne plays away at Windy Hill, their score is 9.9 (63).\n\nLooking at the table, in Row 2, it's Essendon as home and North Melbourne as away. But their scores don't match. So no row in the table matches all three criteria: away team is North Melbourne, venue is Windy Hill, and their score is 9.9 (63). Because in that same row, the away team's score is lower.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says \"the away team score be 9.9 (63)\", so perhaps it's the home team's score? No, because the claim specifies the away team. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the table or the claim. Alternatively, maybe I need to check if any row has an away team with that score.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 2: North Melbourne (away) scored 3.10 (28).\nRow 5: Hawthorn (away) scored 9.11 (65), which is close but not exactly 9.9 (63). Also, the venue is Lake Oval, not Windy Hill.\nOther rows don't have away teams with that score.\n\nSo, no row in the table has an away team named North Melbourne playing at Windy Hill with a score of 9.9 (63). Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the actual away team's score in Row 2 is different, and there are no other rows matching all criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which column corresponds to what. Let me check the table again for clarity.\n\nIn Row 2:\n\n- Home team: Essendon\n- Home team score: 9.9 (63)\n- Away team: North Melbourne\n- Away team score: 3.10 (28)\n- Venue: Windy Hill\n\nSo, the away team's score is 3.10 (28), not 9.9 (63). Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that when North Melbourne plays away at Windy Hill, their score is 9.9 (63). But in reality, they scored lower.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is checking if the away team's score is 9.9 (63) when North Melbourne plays away at Windy Hill. Checking each row, only Row 2 matches North Melbourne as the away team at Windy Hill, but their score is 3.10 (28), not 9.9 (63). No other rows meet all criteria, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
