    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the location attendance for the 1 - 1 be boston garden.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a specific game where the series score was 1-1. So I should look for rows where the series column shows \"1-1\". \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Series is 0-1\nRow 2: Series is 1-1\nRow 3: Series is 2-1\nRow 4: Series is 2-2\nRow 5: Series is 2-3\n\nSo only Row 2 has a series score of 1-1. Therefore, the relevant row is row index 2.\n\nNext, I need to look at the \"location attendance\" column in this row. From Row 2, location attendance is listed as \"boston garden.\" \n\nThe claim says that for the game with series 1-1, the location attendance was boston garden. Since the data in the table matches exactly, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should make sure to only include the relevant cells. So the row index is 2 and the column name is \"location attendance.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true because the game with a series score of 1-1 had its location attendance at boston garden.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"With a final score of 75 - 86, B Shaw have 5 assist.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions a specific game's score and attributes about B Shaw, specifically the number of assists he had in that game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. I'll go through each row to see if any match the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 1: Game 1, date May 7, Detroit Pistons vs Boston Celtics. The score is L 75 - 86. High assists are listed as B Shaw with 5. So this matches both the final score and the number of assists by B Shaw.\n\nNow, I need to verify if the claim correctly references this game. The claim says \"with a final score of 75 - 86,\" which is exactly what Row 1 shows. Then it states that B Shaw had 5 assists, which also matches Row 1's data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 1, so the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are in Row 0 (since it's zero-indexed) and the columns \"score\" and \"high assists.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a specific location, \"boston garden,\" and claims that the series record there is 5-2. So I need to look into the table to see if any games were played at boston garden with a series record of 5-2.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: game 1 on May 7, location is Boston Garden, series is 0-1.\nRow 2: game 2 on May 9, same location, series is 1-1.\nRow 3: game 3 on May 11, different location (The Palace), series is 2-1.\nRow 4: game 4 on May 13, same as row 3's location, series 2-2.\nRow 5: game 5 on May 15, back to Boston Garden, series 2-3.\n\nWait, so in the table, all games at Boston Garden are only three instances. Specifically, game 1, game 2, and game 5. Let me list their series records:\n\n- Game 1: series 0-1\n- Game 2: series 1-1\n- Game 5: series 2-3\n\nSo the series record after each of these games is not 5-2. The highest series score at Boston Garden in the table is 2-3, which is after game 5.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is about a specific game or the overall series at that location? Let me think. The claim says \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2.\" Hmm, that phrasing is a bit confusing. Is it referring to a single game's series record within the context of the entire series, or is it about the cumulative record at that location?\n\nIf it's about a single game contributing to a 5-2 series record, then maybe each game contributes to the overall series, but in reality, each game's result affects the series record incrementally.\n\nBut looking at the table, after game 1, the series is 0-1. After game 2, it's 1-1. Then game 3 moves it to 2-1, game 4 keeps it at 2-2, and game 5 ends with 2-3.\n\nWait, but in the table, all games are for the Detroit Pistons, so perhaps this is a playoff series or something else where each game adds up towards a total series record. So after each game, the series has a certain score.\n\nBut in the claim, it's about \"the game at boston garden\" having a series record of 5-2. That doesn't quite make sense because each individual game contributes to the series. The series as a whole would be a total after all games played. So if someone says \"the game at boston garden have a series record of 5 - 2,\" perhaps they're referring to the overall series being 5-2 when considering only games played at Boston Garden.\n\nLooking at the games played at Boston Garden:\n\nGame 1: series 0-1\nGame 2: series 1-1\nGame 5: series 2-3\n\nSo if we consider only games at Boston Garden, the series would be 2-3 after game 5. That's not 5-2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misinterpreted and refers to a specific player or something else, but the instruction is about checking each condition in the claim against the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each part of the claim. The claim has two parts: location and series record.\n\nFirst, \"the game at boston garden\": so looking for games where the location is Boston Garden.\n\nSecond, \"have a series record of 5 - 2.\" So I need to see if any such games have that series score.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: series 0-1\nRow 2: series 1-1\nRow 3: series 2-1 (different location)\nRow 4: series 2-2 (different location)\nRow 5: series 2-3\n\nNone of these have a series record of 5-2. So the claim is FALSE because there's no game at Boston Garden with a series record of 5-2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"series record.\" Perhaps it refers to a particular player's performance, but the high points and rebounds are listed as per each row. But the claim specifically mentions \"series record,\" which is more likely about the overall series score rather than individual stats.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim is not supported by any of the table data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a game at Boston Garden has a series record of 5-2. After examining each row of the table:\n\n- Game 1: Series 0-1\n- Game 2: Series 1-1\n- Game 3: Different location, Series 2-1\n- Game 4: Different location, Series 2-2\n- Game 5: Series 2-3\n\nNone of the games at Boston Garden have a series record of 5-2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n  ]\n}",
