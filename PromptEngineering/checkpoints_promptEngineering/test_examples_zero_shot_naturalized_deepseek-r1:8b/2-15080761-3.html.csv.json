    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"the highest attendance of the manchester unite fc season be on 20 february , 1904.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to find any that match the date mentioned in the claim. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 1: 12 December 1903\nRow 2: 16 December 1903\nRow 3: 21 December 1903\nRow 4: 11 January 1904\nRow 5: 6 February 1904\nRow 6: 10 February 1904\nRow 7: 20 February 1904\n\nSo, only Row 7 matches the date given in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check what attendance was recorded for that specific match. Looking at Row 7, the 'attendance' column says 22051. \n\nNow, I should verify if this is indeed the highest attendance of the season. To do this, I'll compare this attendance number with all other attendances in the table.\n\nLooking at each row's attendance:\nRow 1: 10000\nRow 2: 5000\nRow 3: 3000\nRow 4: 9372\nRow 5: 12000\nRow 6: 18000\nRow 7: 22051\n\nComparing all these, the highest attendance is in Row 7 at 22,051. No other row has a higher number than this.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the highest attendance was on 20 February 1904 is TRUE. The relevant cells are from Row 7 and the 'attendance' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"3 out of 4 games played against small health result in a 1-1 outcome.\" Let me look at the table provided to check this.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the matches where the opponent is Small Heath. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Small Heath.\nRow 2: Opponent is Small Heath.\nRow 3: Opponent is Small Heath.\nRow 4: Opponent is Small Heath.\nRow 5 onwards: Opponent is not Small Heath, so they can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nSo there are four games against Small Heath. Now I need to check the results of these four matches.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: Result is 1-1.\n- Row 2: Result is 1-1.\n- Row 3: Result is 1-1.\n- Row 4: Result is 3-1, which isn't a draw.\n\nSo out of these four games, three resulted in a 1-1 draw. That means the claim that \"3 out of 4 game play against small health result in 1 - 1\" is true because three of them ended with a score of 1-1. The fourth game didn't, but the statement only requires three to be correct.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other rows where the opponent might be Small Heath. Rows 5 and beyond don't list Small Heath as the opponent, so they're irrelevant here.\n\nSo the relevant cells are rows 0, 1, 2, and 3 (since indexing starts at 0). Each of these has a result column that is either 1-1 or not. But for the claim, only three of them resulted in 1-1. So to verify this, I need to check those four rows' 'result f - a' columns.\n\nI think the relevant cells are all four where opponent is Small Heath because we're checking if each of those games indeed had a 1-1 result or not. But for the claim, it's about three out of four having that result, so maybe only three of these four need to be checked? Wait, no\u2014actually, the claim is stating that in their four games against Small Heath, three resulted in 1-1. So I have to verify each of those four to see if indeed three had a 1-1 result.\n\nTherefore, all four rows where opponent is Small Heath (rows 0 to 3) are relevant because we need to confirm the results for each game.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"small health be the opponent of manchester unite in the first 4 game of the fa cup.\" So I need to check if, within the first four games (FA Cup matches) for Manchester United, their opponents included Small Heath.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a match. The columns include date, round, opponents, h/a (which stands for home or away), result f-a, and attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows correspond to the first four games of the FA Cup. Since Manchester United is the team in question, I'll look through each row's opponents to see if Small Heath appears as their opponent in any of these matches.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: Opponents are small heath. The date is December 12, 1903, and it's an intermediate round. So this could be one of the early FA Cup games for Manchester United.\n\nRow 2: Again, opponents are small heath, but it's a replay in the intermediate round on December 16, 1903. This might be a subsequent match against Small Heath in the same competition.\n\nRow 3: The opponent is still small heath, but this time they're playing at Bramall Lane on December 21, 1903. So that's another game where Small Heath is the opponent.\n\nRow 4: Opponent is small heath again, but this match took place on January 11, 1904, and the result was a win for Manchester United (3-1). This seems to be part of their FA Cup run as well.\n\nNow, I need to check if these matches fall within the first four games. Given that FA Cup typically starts in November/December each year, having three matches against Small Heath by December 1903 would suggest that they are indeed early games. The fourth game would likely be the next match in February 1904, which is also against Small Heath (Row 4).\n\nWait, but Row 5 and onwards involve other opponents like Notts County and Wednesday. So Rows 1-4 seem to be within the first four FA Cup games for Manchester United.\n\nThe claim says \"in the first 4 game of the fa cup,\" so I need to confirm that in these four games, at least one opponent is Small Heath. But according to the table, all four matches (Rows 1-4) are against Small Heath except perhaps if Row 5 is within the first four.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. If Rows 1-4 are all against Small Heath, then yes, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The table seems to list multiple games, possibly including replays and different rounds. So the initial matches could be considered as part of the same FA Cup campaign.\n\nTherefore, in their first four games, Manchester United played against Small Heath three times (Rows 1-3) and then another match on January 11 (Row 4). So yes, all these are within the first four games, meaning Small Heath is indeed one of their opponents in those games. Thus, the claim seems to be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time , during the last game of the fc season.\" So, the claim has two main points:\n\n1. The Wednesday team appears only once as opponents.\n2. This happens in the last game of the FC season.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row related to \"The Wednesday\" to see if they fit these conditions.\n\nStarting with the table structure, each row seems to represent a match with details like date, round, opponents, h/a (home/away status), result, and attendance. \n\nNow, scanning through the opponents column for \"the wednesday.\" Let's go row by row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponents are small heath.\n- Row 2: Opponents are small heath.\n- Row 3: Opponents are small heath.\n- Row 4: Opponents are small heath.\n- Row 5: Opponents are notts county.\n- Row 6: Opponents are notts county.\n- Row 7: Opponents are the wednesday.\n\nSo, only in row 7 do the opponents match \"the wednesday.\" That means there's at least one instance where they appear as opponents. But according to the claim, it says they appear only once as opponents during the last game. \n\nNext, I need to determine which is the last game of the FC season. Typically, a season ends in May or June, but here we're looking up to February 1904. The latest date shown is February 20, 1904 (Row 7). So, that would be the last game.\n\nNow, checking if \"the wednesday\" appear only once as opponents in the last game. In this case, since they are opponents in Row 7 and nowhere else in the table, it seems to fit the claim that they appeared once during the last game.\n\nWait, but earlier rows (like Row 4) mention matches against small heath at different venues. So, \"the wednesday\" only appear once as opponents in the entire table, which is in the last game (Row 7). That would make the claim TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any other entries where \"the wednesday\" are opponents. Scanning through each opponent field again:\n\nRows 1-4: small heath.\nRows 5-6: notts county.\nRow 7: the wednesday.\n\nNo other instances, so yes, only once as opponents in the last game (February 20, 1904). Therefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where \"the wednesday\" appear as opponents. Only Row 7 meets this condition.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "only the last 3 list game have attendance of over 10000",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. The claim states: \"only the last 3 list game have attendance of over 10000.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table contains. It's a naturalized table with several rows, each representing a game. Each row has details like date, round (which includes intermediate rounds and replays), opponents, whether it's Home or Away (H/A), the result as F-A (goals for - against), and attendance.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the attendance figures in the games listed. It mentions that only the last three \"list game\" have attendance over 10,000. Hmm, I need to figure out which rows are considered the \"last 3 list games.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: December 12, 1903 - intermediate round vs Small Heath\n- Row 2: December 16, 1903 - intermediate round replay vs Small Heath\n- Row 3: December 21, 1903 - intermediate round 2nd replay vs Small Heath\n- Row 4: January 11, 1904 - intermediate round 3rd replay vs Small Heath\n- Row 5: February 6, 1904 - Round 1 vs Notts County\n- Row 6: February 10, 1904 - Round 1 replay vs Notts County\n- Row 7: February 20, 1904 - Round 2 vs The Wednesday\n\nI need to see which rows are the \"last three.\" Since there are seven rows, the last three would be Rows 5, 6, and 7. But wait, that's not correct because in a football league, games are usually played in rounds where earlier rounds come first, and higher rounds follow. So, Round 1 (Row 5) is likely before Round 2 (Row 7). Therefore, the last three games would be Rows 5, 6, and 7.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the actual order of the matches. The dates go from December 1903 to February 1904. So, Row 1 is Dec 12, Row 2 Dec 16, Row 3 Dec 21, Row 4 Jan 11, Row 5 Feb 6, Row 6 Feb 10, and Row 7 Feb 20. Therefore, the last three games in terms of date would be Rows 5, 6, and 7.\n\nNow, checking their attendances:\n\n- Row 5: 12,000 (over 10k)\n- Row 6: 18,000 (over 10k)\n- Row 7: 22,051 (over 10k)\n\nSo all three have attendance over 10k. Now, are there any other games beyond these last three that also have attendance over 10k? Let's check the earlier rows:\n\nRow 4: 9,372 (less than 10k)\nRow 3: 3,000 (much less)\nRow 2: 5,000 (less)\nRow 1: 10,000 (exactly 10k)\n\nWait, Row 1 has an attendance of exactly 10,000. The claim says \"over 10,000.\" So if the threshold is strictly above 10k, then Row 1 doesn't qualify. But if it's including 10k, then maybe it does.\n\nBut according to the claim, it's only the last three games that have attendance over 10k. So I need to check if any of the earlier rows (Rows 1-4) have attendance over 10k. Row 4 has 9,372 which is just below, and Row 1 is exactly 10k.\n\nSo, in the last three games (Rows 5,6,7), all have attendance above 10k. Are there any other games beyond these last three? No, because Row 7 is the last one. So the claim is that only these last three have attendance over 10k, and none of the others do.\n\nWait, but in the table, Row 4 has 9,372 which is close but below 10k. So the only games with attendance over 10k are Rows 5,6,7. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because only these last three have attendance over 10k, and no others do.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the last 3 list game.\" I'm assuming that \"list game\" refers to the games listed in the table. So yes, Rows 5,6,7 are the last three, and they all have attendance over 10k. The other rows either have less or exactly 10k (Row 1). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Rows 5,6,7. Let me check their columns:\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has: date, round, opponents, h/a, result f-a, attendance.\n\nThe column we need is \"attendance,\" which corresponds to the \"attendance\" column in the table. So for Rows 5,6,7, I should extract their attendance values and check if they are over 10k.\n\nRow 5: 12,000 (over)\nRow 6: 18,000 (over)\nRow 7: 22,051 (over)\n\nThus, the relevant cells are these three. So in the JSON, I need to include each row index for these rows and specify \"attendance\" as the column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to verify that only the last three games have attendance over 10,000. \n\n- **Rows 5, 6, and 7** are the last three games with attendance of **12,000**, **18,000**, and **22,051** respectively, all exceeding 10,000.\n- The other rows either have attendance below 10,000 or exactly 10,000 (Row 1).\n\nThus, the claim is supported as TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the highest attendance of the Manchester United FC season be on 10 February, 1904.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through the table provided. Let me go row by row to identify which ones relate to attendance numbers and dates.\n\nRow 1: Date is December 12, 1903. Opponents are small heath. The result is a draw, 1-1. Attendance is 10,000. So this is an earlier game.\n\nRow 2: Date is December 16, 1903. It's a replay, so same opponents but different attendance\u20145,000. Still lower than some later ones.\n\nRow 3: Date is December 21, 1903. Again, same opponent, but attendance drops to 3,000. So far, the highest I've seen in these rows is 10,000.\n\nRow 4: January 11, 1904. Opponent small heath again. The result is a win, 3-1. Attendance is 9,372. This is the first game in January of that year.\n\nRow 5: February 6, 1904. Against Notts County, it's a draw, 3-3. Attendance is 12,000. That's higher than the previous maximum I had, which was 10,000.\n\nRow 6: February 10, 1904. Again against Notts County but this time Manchester United wins 2-1. Attendance here is 18,000. This is even higher than the 12,000 from Row 5.\n\nRow 7: February 20, 1904. Opponent The Wednesday. Result is a loss, 0-6. Attendance is 22,051, which is the highest I've seen so far in the table.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the highest attendance being on February 10, 1904. Looking at Row 6, that date has an attendance of 18,000. However, Row 7 has a higher attendance of 22,051 on February 20, which is later. So does that mean the maximum attendance was on February 20 instead?\n\nI need to check if there are any games after February 10 with higher attendances. In this table, yes, Row 7 shows a higher attendance date. Therefore, the claim that the highest attendance was on February 10 isn't accurate because the game on February 20 had a higher number.\n\nSo the claim is false. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant for verifying this. The highest attendance is shown in Row 6 and Row 7. So the dates are important: 10 February 1904 and 20 February 1904.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be both Row 6 (with date 10 Feb) and Row 7 (with 20 Feb). Each has their own attendance numbers that contribute to determining whether the claim is true or false.\n</think>\n\nThe highest attendance in the table was on February 20, 1904, with an attendance of 22,051.

The claim says, \"notts county be the opponent of manchester unite in the first 4 games of the fa cup.\" So I need to check the table provided and see if there's evidence supporting this.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the table represents. It seems to be a record of football matches, with columns like date, round, opponents, home/away (h/a), result f-a, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific game.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the first 4 games of the FA Cup involving Manchester United and Notts County as opponents. So I need to look for both teams in the table within the first four rows that could be their matches.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Opponents are small heath.\nRow 2: Opponents are small heath again.\nRow 3: Opponents are small heath once more.\nRow 4: Opponents are small heath again.\nWait, all opponents in rows 1-4 are small heath. That doesn't include Notts County or Manchester United.\n\nThen Row 5: Opponents are notts county. So that's the first time Notts County is mentioned as an opponent. But who are they playing against? The opponents column says \"notts county,\" so they're playing against themselves? Or is the opponent the other team?\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the home/away status. In Row 5, h/a is 'a', meaning away. So Notts County is the away team. Who are they playing? The opponents column says \"notts county,\" which might be a bit confusing. Maybe it's a typo and should be another team.\n\nWait, looking further, in Row 6: Opponents are notts county again, but h/a is 'h', meaning home. So Manchester United (maybe) is at home against Notts County? Then the result is 2-1 for Man Utd.\n\nRow 7: Opponent is The Wednesday, so that's a different match.\n\nSo in Rows 5 and 6, Notts County are opponents to someone. In Row 5, they're away, and the opponent is listed as notts county, which might be incorrect or perhaps it's a typo for Manchester United? Wait, no, because in Row 5, the result is 3-3. If Notts County was playing themselves, that wouldn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table. Let me think again: each row has a match between two teams. The opponents column lists who they're playing against. So in Row 1: Manchester United (I assume) is playing Small Heath at home, result 1-1.\n\nIn Row 5: Notts County are away, opponents are listed as notts county. That seems odd\u2014maybe the opponent should be someone else, like Manchester United? But then the h/a would indicate where Notts County is playing. If it's 'a', they're away, so if they're away against Manchester United, that makes sense.\n\nWait, let me see: in Row 5, opponents are notts county. That suggests Notts County is playing against themselves, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the opponent should be another team. Maybe it's a typo and the opponent is actually Manchester United.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table lists only one team per row, but that wouldn't make sense either because you need two teams for a match.\n\nWait, looking at Row 5: opponents are notts county, h/a is 'a', result f-a 3-3. Maybe the home team is someone else, and Notts County is the away team against that other team. So perhaps the opponent in Row 5 isn't Manchester United but another team, like Small Heath again.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map this out.\n\nThe claim says Notts County vs Manchester United in the first four games of the FA Cup. So looking for when both teams are involved in the same match within the first four rows.\n\nLooking at Row 5: opponents are notts county, so perhaps that's Notts County away against someone else (maybe Man Utd), but the result is 3-3. If that's true, then it's a draw. Then in Row 6, opponents are notts county again, h/a is 'h', meaning home. So if they're at home and playing against someone, maybe Manchester United? The result is 2-1, so Man Utd wins.\n\nIf Rows 5 and 6 involve Notts County vs Manchester United, then those would be two games where they are opponents. But the claim says \"in the first 4 game of the fa cup.\" So if Row 5 is the third game (since the first four rows include Rows 1-4), but in Row 5, it's Notts County as away against someone else, not necessarily Man Utd.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. The table has seven rows, each a different game. So the first four games would be Rows 1-4.\n\nIn those first four rows, the opponents are all Small Heath. So Notts County isn't mentioned as an opponent until Row 5, which is the fifth game. Therefore, in the first four games (Rows 1-4), Notts County is not listed as an opponent of Manchester United.\n\nWait, but who is Manchester United playing against? The opponents column lists Small Heath for Rows 1-3 and then in Row 4, it's hyde road, which might be another team. So perhaps Man Utd is playing against different teams in the first four games, none of which are Notts County.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Notts County are the opponents of Manchester United in the first four FA Cup games would be false because Notts County only appears as an opponent starting from Row 5, which is the fifth game, not within the first four.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Notts County is not listed as an opponent of Manchester United in the first four games (Rows 1-4) of the FA Cup based on the provided table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"2 out of 4 game plays against small heath result in a 1-1 draw.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and see which rows relate to games against Small Heath. Let me scan through each row's opponents column. \n\nRow 1: Opponents are Small Heath.\nRow 2: Opponents are Small Heath again.\nRow 3: Still Small Heath.\nRow 4: Now it switches to Notts County, so not relevant for this claim.\nRow 5 onwards: Also against different opponents.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are rows 1, 2, and 3 because they all involve games against Small Heath. That's three games. The claim mentions 4 games, but maybe I missed one? Wait, row 4 is against Notts County, so that's not part of the four. So it's definitely three games involving Small Heath.\n\nNow, for each of these three games, I need to check if the result was a 1-1 draw. \n\nLooking at Row 1: The result is listed as \"f - a: 1 - 1.\" That seems like a draw.\nRow 2: Similarly, the result is also \"1 - 1.\" Another draw.\nRow 3: The result is \"1 - 1\" as well. So that's three draws.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"2 out of 4,\" which implies four games with Small Heath and two draws. But in the table, there are only three games against Small Heath, all resulting in a draw. That means actually all three games were draws, not just two.\n\nSo does this make the claim false? Because it's stating that two out of four were draws when actually three out of three were draws, which is more than two. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate as stated.\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any other relevant rows. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: Small Heath, result 1-1.\nRow 2: Small Heath, result 1-1.\nRow 3: Small Heath, result 1-1.\nRow 4: Notts County, so not part of the four games against Small Heath. So only three games, all draws.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because it states two out of four when actually all three were draws. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result f - a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"only the last 2 list game have an attendance of more than 10000.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table and check the attendance figures. The table has seven rows, so I'll go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1: Date is December 12, 1903. Attendance is 10,000. Wait, that's exactly 10,000. The claim says \"more than 10000,\" so this doesn't count because it's not more than, just equal to.\n\nRow 2: January 11, 1904? No, wait, Row 2 is December 16, 1903 with attendance 5,000. That's way below 10k.\n\nRow 3: December 21, 1903, attendance is 3,000. Still much lower.\n\nRow 4: January 11, 1904? Wait, no, it's actually January 11, 1904, but the date in Row 4 is written as \"11 january 1904.\" Attendance here is 9,372. That's less than 10k, so doesn't count.\n\nRow 5: February 6, 1904, attendance is 12,000. Okay, that's more than 10k.\n\nRow 6: February 10, 1904, attendance is 18,000. Definitely over 10k.\n\nRow 7: February 20, 1904, attendance is 22,051. Also way over.\n\nSo the claim says only the last two games (which would be Rows 5 and 6) have attendance over 10k. But wait, Row 1 also had exactly 10k. So if it's \"more than,\" then Row 1 doesn't count. But if the claim is considering equal to or more, then Row 1 should be included.\n\nWait, the original table shows Row 1 as 10,000. The claim says \"more than 10000.\" So strictly, only Rows 5 and 6 are over 10k. But in the claim, it's saying only the last two games have attendance more than 10k. However, in the table, there's another game (Row 1) with exactly 10k, which is not more than. So the claim would be true if it excludes that.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the dates. The claim says \"the last 2 list game.\" I think they mean the last two games in the list provided, which are Rows 5 and 6 (February 6 and 10). Both have attendance over 10k. So the claim is saying only these two have that.\n\nBut Row 7 also has attendance over 10k. Wait no, the last two would be 5 and 6, but 7 is after them. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list out the rows with their attendances:\n\nRow 1: 10,000\nRow 2: 5,000\nRow 3: 3,000\nRow 4: 9,372\nRow 5: 12,000\nRow 6: 18,000\nRow 7: 22,051\n\nSo the last two in the list are Rows 6 and 7. But Row 7's attendance is over 10k. So if the claim says only the last two have more than 10k, that would be incorrect because Row 1 also had exactly 10k, and Rows 5,6,7 have over 10k.\n\nWait no, the claim specifies \"the last 2 list game,\" which I think refers to the last two in the table. So if the table has seven games, the last two are 6 and 7. Both of these have attendance over 10k: Row 6 is 18k, Row 7 is 22k.\n\nBut then, what about Rows 5? It's also more than 10k but it's not in the \"last two.\" So the claim says only the last two (Rows 6 and 7) have attendance over 10k. But Row 5 does too. So the claim is false because there are more than just the last two games with attendance over 10k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant the last two games in terms of the entire season, but without more context, it's unclear. The key point is that both Rows 5 and 6 have attendance over 10k, as do Row 7. So the claim says only the last two (presumably 6 and 7) have it, which isn't true because Row 5 also does.\n\nWait no, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table again, the dates are:\n\n1. Dec 12, 1903\n2. Dec 16, 1903\n3. Dec 21, 1903\n4. Jan 11, 1904\n5. Feb 6, 1904\n6. Feb 10, 1904\n7. Feb 20, 1904\n\nSo in the order given, Rows 5 and 6 are the last two before Row 7. So if the claim is about \"the last two list games,\" it's referring to the most recent two, which would be 6 and 7.\n\nRow 5 is February 6, which is earlier than 10th and 20th. So Rows 5 has attendance over 10k as well. Therefore, the claim that only the last two (Rows 6 and 7) have attendance over 10k is incorrect because Row 5 also does.\n\nWait no, in the table, the order is from earliest to latest. So the \"last two list games\" would be Rows 6 and 7. But Row 5 comes before that, so it's a separate game. Therefore, only the last two (6 and 7) have attendance over 10k.\n\nBut wait, no: Row 5 is Feb 6, Row 6 is Feb 10, Row 7 is Feb 20. So if we consider \"last two list games\" as the most recent two, that would be Rows 6 and 7. However, Row 5 also had attendance over 10k.\n\nTherefore, the claim says only the last two (6 and 7) have attendance over 10k, but actually, Row 5 does too. So the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant \"last two games in the list provided,\" which are Rows 6 and 7. Then, in that case, both of those do have over 10k, but also Row 5. So the claim would be incorrect because it's excluding Row 5.\n\nWait no, the claim says only the last two (which are 6 and 7) have attendance over 10k, but Row 5 also does. Therefore, the claim is false because more than just the last two games had attendance over 10k.\n\nSo in conclusion, the claim is false because there are at least three games with attendance over 10k: Rows 5,6,7.\n</think>\n\nThe statement claims that only the last two listed games (February 10 and February 20) have attendance exceeding 10,000. However, this is inaccurate because another game on February 6 also had an attendance of over 10,000. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false because there are more than just the last two games with attendance exceeding 10,000; specifically, the game on February 6 also meets this criterion.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the wednesday only appear as an opponent 1 time, during the first game of the fc season.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of this claim means. The Wednesday are a football team, and the claim is stating that they only appear once as opponents in the first game of the season. \n\nLooking at the table, I need to check when The Wednesday played as opponents for any team in the first round or replay matches.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponents are Small Heath. So not The Wednesday.\nRow 2: Again, Small Heath, so no.\nRow 3: Still Small Heath.\nRow 4: Now we have Small Heath again.\nRow 5: Opponents are Notts County. Not The Wednesday.\nRow 6: Notts County again.\nRow 7: Here, the opponents are The Wednesday. \n\nWait, row 7 is in round 2, not the first game of the season. So the first occurrence of The Wednesday as an opponent isn't in the first game.\n\nNow, looking for any occurrence where The Wednesday is the opponent in the first game. From the table, I don't see any match where The Wednesday are opponents in the first round or its replay (rows 5 and 6). The first time they appear as opponents is in row 7, which is round 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim that The Wednesday only appear once during the first game of the season isn't correct because they didn't play as opponents in any first-round match.
