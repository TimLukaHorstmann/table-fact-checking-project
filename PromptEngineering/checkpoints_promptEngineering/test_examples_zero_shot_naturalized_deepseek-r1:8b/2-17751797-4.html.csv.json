Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 15: tie no: 11, home team: manchester united, score: 1 - 0, away team: bolton wanderers. So here, Manchester United is the home team, scored 1 goal, and Bolton Wanderers are the away team with 0 goals.\n\nSo this row matches all parts of the claim: score is 1-0 and away team is Bolton Wanderers.\n\nI don't see any other rows where the away team is Bolton Wanderers.

The key elements are:\n- Score is 2 - 3\n- Away team is Liverpool\n- Date is 30/01/1991\n\nSo, I should look for a match in the table where these conditions are met.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find any that match the date 30/01/1991. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 2: tie no: replay, home team: brighton & hove albion, score: 2 - 3, away team: liverpool, date: 30 / 01 / 1991.\n\nWait, that seems relevant because it has the exact date mentioned in the claim. Let's break down the row:\n\n- Tie no: replay\n- Home team: Brighton & Hove Albion\n- Score: 2 - 3\n- Away team: Liverpool\n- Date: 30/01/1991\n\nSo, this row directly matches all three criteria:\n- The score is 2 - 3.\n- The away team is Liverpool.\n- The date is 30/01/1991.\n\nSince the claim specifies that \"the score be 2 - 3 when the away team be liverpool on the date of 30 / 01 / 1991,\" this row supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we look for a match where:\n- The score is 2 - 3,\n- The away team is Liverpool,\n- The date is 30/01/1991.\n\nThis information is found in Row 2 of the table.

That matches the claim exactly. Now, I should check if there are any other relevant rows where Brighton is the away team with a different score or additional info. But from the table, only Row 1 and Row 2 mention Brighton as an away team, and only Row 1 has the score 2-2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by Row 1's data.

The columns include \"tie no:\", \"home team:\", \"score:\", \"away team:\", and \"date:\". \n\nI'll need to scan through each row to find any where the home team is Woking, tie number is 5, and score is 0-1.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Home team is Liverpool.

No.\nRow6: Replay, away team Luton Town. Home team West Ham. No.\nRow7: Tie no5, home Woking. Oh, this looks promising. So row7's home team is Woking, tie number 5.\n\nNow check the score: 0-1. Yes, the score column shows \"0 - 1\". So that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there are no other rows with Woking as home team and tie number 5. Looking ahead:\n\nRow8: Tie no6, home Shrewsbury Town.\n...\nI don't see any other Woking entries beyond row7. \n\nSo the only match where Woking is the home team with tie number 5 is Row7, which has a score of 0-1. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n\nWait another thing: the claim says \"tie number be 5\". In the table, tie numbers are denoted as \"tie no:\".

The claim is: \"the score be 1 - 0 when the home team be shrewsbury town.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is asking for. It's saying that there was a match where Shrewsbury Town was the home team and they scored 1-0 against their opponent. So, I need to find in the table any row where the home team is Shrewsbury Town with a score of 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. The rows are numbered from 1 to 24.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the relevant information.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Liverpool, not Shrewsbury.\nRow 2: Brighton & Hove Albion, nope.\nRow 3: Nottingham County, nope.\nRow 4: Crewe Alexandra, nope.\nRow 5: Luton Town, nope.\nRow 6: West Ham United, nope.\nRow 7: Woking vs Everton.

However, since the claim doesn't specify on which date or tie number, but just the specific score and home team, row 8 is the only one that fits.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be row 8, checking both the home team and the score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"2 - 3 be the score when the home team be liverpool after 30 / 01 / 1991.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It mentions a specific score of 2-3, a home team as Liverpool, and the date is after January 30, 1991.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has tie_no, home team, score, away team, and date. So I need to find rows where the home team is Liverpool and the date is on or after January 30, 1991.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: tie no 1, home team Liverpool, score 2-2, date 26/01/1991. The date here is earlier than 30/01, so it doesn't meet the 'after' criteria. So it's not relevant.\n\nRow 2: tie no replay, home team Brighton & Hove Albion, score 2-3, date 30/01/1991. Here, the home team isn't Liverpool, and the date is exactly 30/01, which might be considered 'after' depending on interpretation. But since the claim specifies \"after,\" maybe it's excluding that day.\n\nRows beyond this point are numbered up to Row 24, but I don't see any where the home team is Liverpool after January 30, 1991. \n\nIn the table, only Row 1 has Liverpool as the home team, and its date is before the required cutoff.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that in a match where Wimbledon is the home team, the score was 1-0. So I need to look through the table for any matches where the home team is Wimbledon and see if their score was exactly 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different match with details like tie no (probably a unique identifier), home team, score, away team, and date. There are 24 rows in total, so I'll have to scan through each one carefully.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Home team is Liverpool, not Wimbledon. So this doesn't apply.\n\nRow 2: Home team is Brighton & Hove Albion, again not Wimbledon.\n\nRows 3-5: The home teams here are Nottingham County, Crewe Alexandra, and Luton Town\u2014none of these are Wimbledon.\n\nRow 6: Home team is West Ham United. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Home team is Woking. No match for Wimbledon.\n\nRow 8: Home team is Shrewsbury Town. Still not Wimbledon.\n\nRows 9-10: Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest as home teams. Not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 11: Tottenham Hotspur. Not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 12: Coventry City. Nope.\n\nRows 13,14: Southamptom and Portsmouth are home teams. No Wimbledon here yet.\n\nRow 15: Manchester United. Not relevant.\n\nRow 16: Norwich City. Not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 17: Millwall. No match for Wimbledon.\n\nRow 18: Sheffield Wednesday as home team. Not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 19: Port Vale. Home team is Port Vale, not Wimbledon.\n\nRow 20: Arsenal. No match for Wimbledon.\n\nRows 21-23: Leeds United and Arsenal again. Still no Wimbledon matches.\n\nRow 24: Cambridge United vs Middlesbrough. Home team is Cambridge United. Not Wimbledon.\n\nWait a minute, I'm going through each row, but none of them have Wimbledon as the home team with a score of 1-0. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any rows where Wimbledon is listed as the home team.\n\nLooking back at the table, Row 8 says home team: Shrewsbury Town, and Row 19 mentions Port Vale. No Wimbledon in there. In fact, from the list provided, Wimbledon only appears once, as an away team against Shrewsbury Town on January 26th, 1991 (Row 8). So Wimbledon was not a home team in any of these matches.\n\nTherefore, since there's no match where Wimbledon is the home team with a score of 1-0, the claim must be FALSE. There are no relevant cells that support this because Wimbledon isn't listed as a home team with that exact score.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The score mentioned is \"1 - 0,\" which typically indicates a goal by the home team against the away team. So, looking for a match where the home team scored one goal and the away team zero.\n\nNext, the home team is specified as Bolton Wanderer. I'll need to check each row of the table to see if any have Bolton Wanderers as the home team with a score of 1-0.\n\nI should go through each row systematically. Each row has tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. Let me scan through them:\n\nRow 1: Tie No 1, Home: Liverpool vs Brighton & Hove Albion, Score: 2-2\nRow 2: Tie No Replay, Home: Brighton & Hove Albion vs Liverpool, Score: 2-3\nRow 3: Tie No 2, Home: Notts County vs Oldham Athletic, Score: 2-0\nRow 4: Tie No 3, Home: Crewe Alexandra vs Rotherham United, Score:1-0\nWait, here we have a home team Crewe Alexandra with a score of 1-0 against Rotherham. But the claim is about Bolton Wanderer as home team, so this isn't relevant.\n\nRow 5: Tie No 4, Home: Luton Town vs West Ham United, Score:1-1\nRow6: Replay, Home: West Ham United vs Luton Town, Score:5-0\nRow7: Tie No5, Home: Woking vs Everton, Score:0-1\nRow8: Tie No6, Home: Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon, Score:1-0\nRow9: Tie No7, Home: Newcastle United vs Nottingham Forest, Score:2-2\nRow10: Replay, Home: Nottingham Forest vs Newcastle United, Score:3-0\nRow11: Tie No8, Home: Tottenham Hotspur vs Oxford United, Score:4-2\nRow12: Tie No9, Home: Coventry City vs Southampton, Score:1-1\nRow13: Replay, Home: Southampton vs Coventry City, Score:2-0\nRow14: Tie No10, Home: Portsmouth vs Bournemouth, Score:5-1\nRow15: Tie No11, Home: Manchester United vs Bolton Wanderers, Score:1-0. Oh, wait! Here we have Manchester United as home team against Bolton Wanderers with a score of 1-0. That matches the claim except for the home team.\n\nWait, the claim says the home team is Bolton Wanderer, but in this row, Manchester United is the home team. So that's not matching. Did I miss any rows where Bolton Wanderers are the home team?\n\nLet me continue checking:\n\nRow16: Tie No12, Home: Norwich City vs Swindon Town, Score:3-1\nRow17: Tie No13, Home: Millwall vs Sheffield Wednesday, Score:4-4\nRow18: Replay, Home: Sheffield Wednesday vs Millwall, Score:2-0\nRow19: Tie No14, Home: Port Vale vs Manchester City, Score:1-2\nRow20: Tie No15, Home: Arsenal vs Leeds United, Score:0-0\nRow21: Replay, Home: Leeds United vs Arsenal, Score:1-1\nRow22: Replay, Home: Arsenal vs Leeds United, Score:2-0\nWait, in Row23: Tie No16, Home: Cambridge United vs Middlesbrough, Score:2-0\n\nI don't see any row where the home team is Bolton Wanderers with a 1-0 score. The only match with a 1-0 score I found was Crewe Alexandra against Rotherham, but that's not relevant because the home team isn't Bolton.\n\nWait, in Row15, the home team is Manchester United, and they scored 1-0 against Bolton Wanderers. So does this mean that Bolton Wanderers were the away team there? Yes, so the score would be 1-0 for Manchester United (home) against Bolton (away). But the claim says \"the home team be bolton wanderer,\" which is incorrect because in that match, Bolton was the away team.\n\nSo, to rephrase, the claim states that the home team's score was 1-0. Looking for a match where the home team is Bolton Wanderers with a 1-0 score. I don't see any such row. The only 1-0 score in favor of the home team is Crewe Alexandra, which isn't relevant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no match in the table where the home team is Bolton Wanderers and scored 1-0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the home team, Bolton Wanderers, had a score of 1-0. Upon reviewing each row, the only occurrence of a 1-0 score was for Crewe Alexandra against Rotherham, not involving Bolton Wanderers as the home team.

It's saying that in a match where the away team was Woking, the tie number (or match number) was 5. So I need to look for any matches where the away team is Woking and see if their tie number is 5.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like tie no, home team, score, away team, and date.

I've gone through all the rows and didn't find any match where the away team is Woking with tie number 5. Let me double-check because sometimes ties are replays. Maybe in the replay rows, there's a match involving Woking?\n\nLooking back at row 7: it's tie no 5, home team Woking, score 0-1 against Everton. So that's not away team Woking.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any other tie number (like a replay) has Woking as the away team with tie no 5? Let me see. The only other mention of Woking is in row 7 where they are the home team. So there's no match where Woking is the away team.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misinterpreted. Could it be that the tie number is 5 and the away team is Woking? But from the table, I don't see any such match. Therefore, the claim seems to be false because there's no entry where Woking is the away team with tie number 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE,\" and the relevant cells are the one in row 7 where tie no is 5 because it's the only time Woking is involved.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tie_no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "relevant_cells": [
      {
        "row_index": 7,
        "column_name": "tie_no"
      }
    ]
  }
