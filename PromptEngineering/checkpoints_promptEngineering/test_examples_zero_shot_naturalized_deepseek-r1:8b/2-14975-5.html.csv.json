    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"90 game be play for the series for the sawhorse dollar trophy\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. It mentions 90 games being played in a series related to the sawhorse dollar trophy. So I need to find in the table if there's a row where the number of games is 90 and the trophy is \"sawhorse dollar\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: teams are Columbia - Cornell, name is Empire State Bowl, trophy is Empire Cup. Games played: 98. Not 90.\n\nRow 2: Teams are Cornell - Penn, name is none, trophy is Trustees' Cup. Games played: 118. Not 90.\n\nRow 3: Teams Dartmouth - Princeton, name is none, trophy is sawhorse dollar, games played: 90. This matches both the number of games and the trophy mentioned in the claim.\n\nRows 4 and 5 don't have the sawhorse dollar trophy or 90 games, so they're not relevant here.\n\nSo since Row 3 has exactly 90 games for the sawhorse dollar trophy series, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a series with 90 games and the sawhorse dollar trophy. In row 3 of the table, Dartmouth vs. Princeton have 90 games played under the sawhorse dollar trophy.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"games played\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"more than 100 game be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.\" \n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to identify which rows are relevant. The table has five rows, each corresponding to a different series between two teams and their respective trophies, among other details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the \"sawhorse dollar\" trophy. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 3: teams: dartmouth - princeton, name: none, trophy: sawhorse dollar...\n\nSo, this row is directly related to the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy. The other rows mention different trophies like empire cup, trustee's cup, etc., which aren't relevant here.\n\nNow, I need to check the number of games played for this specific series. According to Row 3: games played: 90 games. \n\nThe claim says \"more than 100 games.\" Since 90 is less than 100, it doesn't meet the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant row is Row 3 because it's the only one with the sawhorse dollar trophy. The number of games played there is 90, which is not more than 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"games played\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
