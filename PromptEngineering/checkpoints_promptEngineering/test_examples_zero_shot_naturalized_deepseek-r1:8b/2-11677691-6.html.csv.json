    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"stanford have a linebacker from lessburg high school\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a player who went to Stanford and is a linebacker from Lessburg High School. The claim specifically mentions both the school (Lessburg High) and the position (linebacker), so I need to find someone in the table who fits both criteria while attending Stanford.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 1: Mario Edwards Jr. is on the defensive line, attended Florida State.\nRow 2: Ellis McCarthy is a defensive lineman from UCLA.\nRow 3: Noah Spence plays for Ohio State, so not relevant here.\nRow 4: Tommy Schutt is with Ohio State as well.\nRow 5: Darius Hamilton is at Rutgers.\nRow 6: Vince Biegel is a linebacker from Wisconsin to Wisconsin.\nRow 7: Scott Starr goes to Southern California (USC).\nRow 8: Noor Davis is a linebacker, but his college is Stanford. Wait, that's interesting. His school is Lessburg High School, and his position is linebacker, and he goes to Stanford. That seems to fit the claim exactly.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other players from Lessburg High who might be at Stanford. Scanning through again: Noor Davis is the only one listed with \"lessburg high school,\" so that's the relevant cell. \n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there is a player named Noor Davis who is a linebacker from Lessburg High School attending Stanford.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School.\" So, Stanford is the school in question, and the player comes from Norco High School. Also, the position mentioned is linebacker.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are 12 rows, each representing a player with various attributes like name, position, school, hometown, college, etc. My task is to find if any row matches all three criteria: being a Stanford student, a linebacker, and coming from Norco High School.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Player is Mario Edwards Jr., position Defensive Line, school Ryan HS, hometown Denton TX, college Florida State. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 2: Ellis McCarthy, position Defensive Line, school Monrovia HS, hometown Monrovia CA, college UCLA. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Noah Spence, position Defensive Line, school Bishop McDevitt HS, hometown Harrisburg PA, college Ohio State. No.\n\nRow 4: Tommy Schutt, position Defensive Line, school Glenbard West HS, hometown Glen Ellyn IL, college Ohio State. Not applicable.\n\nRow 5: Darius Hamilton, position Defensive Line, school Don Bosco Prep HS, hometown Ramsey NJ, college Rutgers. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 6: Vince Biegel, position Lineman (I think he's a linebacker?), school Lincoln HS, hometown Wisconsin Rapids WI, college Wisconsin. His college is Wisconsin, not Stanford, so no.\n\nWait, the claim says \"Stanford have a linebacker from Norco High School.\" So I'm looking for a player who attends Stanford, plays linebacker, and went to Norco HS.\n\nRow 7: Scott Starr, position Lineman, school Norco HS, hometown Norco CA, college Southern California (USC). His college is USC, not Stanford. So even though he's from Norco, his college isn't Stanford. Therefore, doesn't match.\n\nRow 8: Noor Davis, position Lineman, school Lessburg HS, hometown Leesburg FL, college Stanford. Hmm, Stanford here, but position is Lineman, and school is Lessburg HS, not Norco. So no.\n\nRow 9: Shaq Thompson, position Defensive Back, school Grant Union HS, hometown Sacramento CA, college Washington. Not relevant.\n\nRow 10: Landon Collins, position Defensive Back, school Dutchtown HS, hometown Geismar LA, college Alabama. No.\n\nRow 11: Leon McQuay III, position Defensive Back, school Armwood HS, hometown Seffner FL, college Southern California (USC). Doesn't match.\n\nRow 12: Tracy Howard, position Defensive Back, school Miramar HS, hometown Miramar FL, college Miami (FL). Not applicable.\n\nSo after going through all the rows, I don't see any player who is a linebacker from Norco High School attending Stanford. Wait, actually, looking back at row 7, Scott Starr is from Norco HS but attends Southern California, not Stanford. So there's no one in the table that fits all three criteria: Stanford, linebacker, Norco HS.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if any position is listed as linebacker or if it's just referred to differently. Let me look again.\n\nIn row 6: Vince Biegel is listed as a position of Lineman. Usually, linebackers are separate from defensive linemen. So perhaps in the table, \"position: linebacker\" is a specific role, while \"defensive line\" includes DT and DE, etc.\n\nSo looking back at the claim, it's about a linebacker from Norco HS at Stanford. From the table, none of the players fit that exactly. So the claim would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stanford has a linebacker from Norco High School. After examining each row in the table, no player matches all three criteria: attending Stanford, playing as a linebacker, and having attended Norco High School.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
