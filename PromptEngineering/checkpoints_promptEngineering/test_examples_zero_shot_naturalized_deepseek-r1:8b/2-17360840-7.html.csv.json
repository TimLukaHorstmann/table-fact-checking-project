    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false by checking the given table. The claim is: \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim refers to. The key elements are:\n1. Game against Buffalo Sabres.\n2. Attendance of 10,750.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the opponent is \"buffalo sabre\" and then check the attendance number.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Washington Capitals \u2013 not Buffalo Sabres.\nRow 2: Carolina Hurricanes \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Atlanta Thrashers \u2013 no match.\nRow 4: Phoenix Coyotes \u2013 no.\nRow 5: Anaheim Ducks \u2013 nope.\nRow 6: Los Angeles Kings \u2013 no.\nRow 7: San Jose Sharks \u2013 not Buffalo Sabres.\nRow 8: Philadelphia Flyers \u2013 no.\nRow 9: Florida Panthers \u2013 no.\nRow 10: Dallas Stars \u2013 nope.\nRow 11: Buffalo Sabres \u2013 yes! This is the game we're interested in. \nLooking at the attendance for row 11, it's 15,711.\n\nWait, the claim says attendance was 10,750. But in reality, it's 15,711. That doesn't match.\n\nI should double-check if I missed any rows. Scanning again, no other opponent is Buffalo Sabres except row 11. So the attendance is higher than claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the attendance for that game was not 10,750 but 15,711.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states an attendance of 10,750 for a game against Buffalo Sabres, but the table shows 15,711 attendees for that game. This discrepancy makes the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
