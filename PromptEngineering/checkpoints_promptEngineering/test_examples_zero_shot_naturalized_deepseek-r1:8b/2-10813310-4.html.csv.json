    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"at the venue the stoop , the score be 24 - 28\". \n\nFirst, I should identify which parts of the claim correspond to the table data. The claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the venue (the stoop) and the score (24 - 28). \n\nLooking through the table, each row represents a match with various details like date, competition, venue, result, score, and goals. I need to find if there's any row where the venue is \"the stoop\" and the score is \"24 - 28\". \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: venue is odsal stadium\n- Row 2: boundary park\n- ...\n- Continuing until I find a match.\n\nLooking at Row 22, the date is 31 / 8 / 97. The competition is super league ii, venue is the stoop, result is l (loss), score is 24 - 28. \n\nSo this row matches both the venue and the score mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Each row has multiple columns: date, competition, venue, result, score, goals. The relevant columns for the claim are 'venue' and 'score'. \n\nLooking at Row 22:\n- venue is \"the stoop\" (column index might vary)\n- score is \"24 - 28\"\n\nIn the JSON structure, each relevant cell should have row_index and column_name. Assuming the table is in order, Row 22 corresponds to row_index 22 (if rows start from 0 or 1). Wait, looking back at the initial table, it starts with Row 1 as index 1? Or are they zero-indexed?\n\nWait, the user's example shows row_index starting at 0. Let me check: in their example, the first relevant cell is row_index 0. So if Row 22 is the 22nd entry, then row_index would be 21 (if starting from 0). But in the table provided, the dates go from 14/3/97 to 31/8/97, and the rows are numbered from 1 to 23 or so.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check how many rows there are. Let me count: \n\nLooking at the table, it's presented with Row 1 up to Row 23. So if each row is an entry starting from 1, then Row 22 would be row_index 21 (if zero-based) or 22 (one-based). But in the example, they have row_index as 0 and 1 for their first two entries.\n\nSo perhaps in this context, the rows are indexed starting from 0. Therefore, Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc., up to Row 23 being index 22.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the example, they have row_index: 0 and 1 for two entries. So if the table has 23 rows, then row indices go from 0 to 22.\n\nSo in that case, Row 22 (as per the user's numbering) would be index 21, but in the actual data, Row 22 is the second last entry before the next date. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list out the rows as per their numbering:\n\nRows are numbered from 1 to 23.\n\nSo for row_index, if the user's example uses zero-based indexing, then Row 1 corresponds to index 0, Row 2 to 1, ..., Row 22 would be index 21, and Row 23 is index 22.\n\nTherefore, in the claim, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For venue: column_name \"venue\", which in row_index 21 (row 22) has value \"the stoop\".\n- For score: column_name \"score\", which in row_index 21 has value \"24 - 28\".\n\nSo both columns are present in that row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"mcnamara score 3 / 4 goal when the venue be the stoop.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two specific things:\n\n1. McNamara scored 3/4 goals.\n2. The venue was \"the stoop.\"\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking through each row of the table, I'll search for entries where the goals column has McNamara scoring 3/4 and the venue is \"the stoop.\"\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\n- Row 1: Goals for McNamara are 9/10. Venue is Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 2: McNamara scores 4/4. Venue is Boundary Park.\n- Row 3: McNamara 3/3, venue The Jungle.\n- Row 4: Mcnamara 3/3, venue Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 5: Cook scored, no McNamara here.\n- Row 6: Mcnamara 4/4. Venue Stade S\u00e9bastien Charl\u00e9ty.\n- Row 7: Mcnamara 4/5. Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 8: Mcnamara 7/10. Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 9: Mcnamara 7/7. Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 10: Mcnamara 5/7. Wilderspool Stadium.\n- Row 11: Mcnamara 5/8. Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 12: Goals for Loughlin and Mcnamara, not 3/4. Venue Thrum Hall.\n- Row 13: Mcnamara 6/7. The Willows.\n- Row 14: Mcnamara 6/6. Headingley Stadium.\n- Row 15: Mcnamara 5/6. Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 16: Mcnamara 5/7. Knowsley Road.\n- Row 17: Loughlin and Mcnamara, not 3/4. Venue Odsal Stadium.\n- Row 18: Mcnamara 3/4. Wait, this is in the goals column. Let me check the venue for row 18.\n\nLooking at row 18: date is 10 / 8 / 97, venue is Odsal Stadium, result is w, score 22 - 8, goals: mcnamara 3 / 4.\n\nSo here, Mcnamara scored 3/4 goals, but the venue was Odsal Stadium, not the stoop.\n\nContinuing to row 19: Mcnamara 6/6. Don Valley Stadium.\nRow 20: Mcnamara 6/14. Odsal Stadium.\nRow 21: Result is l, score 18-33. Venue Odsal Stadium. Goals for Mcnamara are 3/3.\nRow 22: Mcnamara 4/4, venue The Stoop. So here, the venue is the stoop, but his goals were 4/4, not 3/4.\n\nSo none of the rows have both Mcnamara scoring exactly 3/4 goals and the venue being the stoop.\n\nTherefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that McNamara scored a 3/4 goal when the venue was \"the stoop.\" Checking each row in the table, there's no instance where both conditions are met. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
