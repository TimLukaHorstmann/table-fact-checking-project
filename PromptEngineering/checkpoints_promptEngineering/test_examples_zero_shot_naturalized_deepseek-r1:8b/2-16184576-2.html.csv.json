    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the claim is that in 2001, the annual win-loss record was 9-9, and they didn't play in 1987.\n\nFirst, I need to check the table provided to verify these points.\n\nLooking at the table rows, each row corresponds to a different year or tournament. The relevant columns for the claim are probably \"annual win - loss\" and whether they played in 1987.\n\nStarting with the annual win-loss record in 2001: Scanning through the rows, I see Row 19 has an \"annual win - loss\" column. In 2001, it shows 9-9. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, checking if they didn't play in 1987. Looking for information about 1987, I find that in the row labeled \"1987\", specifically under \"annual win - loss,\" it says 0-0. But wait, does this mean they played or not? The column name is a bit unclear\u2014maybe it's indicating no matches played because the win-loss record is 0-0. Also, looking at Row 20, the year-end ranking for 1987 is listed as 824, which suggests they were ranked and possibly did play. Hmm, that contradicts the claim.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. If in 1987, their annual win-loss is 0-0, it could mean they didn't have any wins or losses because they didn't play any matches that year. So perhaps they didn't participate in 1987 tournaments, leading to a 0-0 record.\n\nBut then I see Row 19's annual win-loss for 2001 is indeed 9-9. However, the claim says \"they didn't play in 1987.\" If their 1987 win-loss is 0-0 because they didn't play, that supports the claim. But if they did play but had zero wins, it might not.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at other columns. For example, Row 19's \"annual win - loss\" for 2001 is 9-9, which is correct. Now, checking if they played in 1987, perhaps looking for a specific tournament or match. But the table doesn't provide detailed information beyond what's listed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in 1987, their annual win-loss was 0-0, as seen in Row 19, it's possible they didn't play any matches that year, hence no wins or losses recorded.\n\nSo putting it together: In 2001, the annual win-loss was indeed 9-9. And in 1987, since there were no wins or losses, they likely didn't play any tournaments that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe annual win-loss record for 2001 is correctly stated as 9-9 in Row 19. The information about not playing in 1987 aligns with the 0-0 record in that year's \"annual win - loss\" column, suggesting no participation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"1987\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim about the ATP Master Series in 1994 is correct. The claim says, \"in the ATP Master Series in 1994, the annual win-loss was 2-4.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided table to find any relevant information related to the ATP Master Series and specifically for the year 1994. The table has several rows, each representing a different tournament or series, along with some data about win-loss records and rankings.\n\nLooking at row 0, it's labeled as \"ATP Tour\" with various years from 1987 to 2003. Each cell probably represents the number of wins against losses for that year. So, I should check row 1994 here. But wait, looking at row 0, each column is a specific year, so in row 0, column 1994 would be the annual win-loss record.\n\nWait, but actually, row 18 is labeled \"Masters Series SR,\" which might refer to the Master Series standings. In row 18, for 1994, it says \"0 / 4\". I think this means 0 wins and 4 losses in that series. But does this directly relate to the annual win-loss record?\n\nThen there's row 19 labeled as \"Annual Win-Loss,\" which seems to be a summary of the player's total wins and losses each year. For 1994, it says \"2 - 4.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, I need to see where these numbers are stored in the table. The annual win-loss is probably in row 19 for 1994, which would be 2-4. Additionally, the Master Series SR data might also play a role because it's about how they performed in those specific tournaments that year.\n\nWait, but does the claim refer to their performance specifically in the ATP Master Series or overall? The claim says \"ATP Master Series,\" so I think row 18 is relevant because it's the Masters Series standings. But then again, row 19 gives their overall annual record, which might be a different metric.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify: The claim mentions \"annual win-loss\" for 1994 as 2-4. That seems to come from row 19, where each year has a win-loss tally. So that's one relevant cell.\n\nBut the claim also mentions \"ATP Master Series,\" so maybe I should look at row 18 for 1994. In row 18, it's \"0 / 4,\" which could indicate their performance in those series. However, if the annual win-loss is separate from the specific series results, then maybe the relevant cells are both: the annual record and the Master Series.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically refers to the annual win-loss as 2-4, not necessarily the Master Series. So perhaps only row 19's 1994 data is needed. But I'm not sure if \"annual\" implies the total of all tournaments, including both ATP Tour and Master Series.\n\nI think I need to include row 18 because it's about the Master Series specifically, and also row 19 for the annual record. So, the relevant cells would be both: row 18 (Master Series in 1994) and row 19 (annual win-loss in 1994).\n\nBut wait, looking at the instructions again, each cell is a specific piece of data. The claim mentions two things: ATP Master Series in 1994 and annual win-loss as 2-4. So both aspects are relevant.\n\nI think I should list both rows where these stats are found. So row 18 for the Master Series performance in 1994, which shows \"0 / 4,\" and row 19 for the annual record of 2-4 wins.\n\nWait, but does the claim state that they had a win-loss of 2-4 specifically in the Master Series? No, it just says in the ATP Master Series. So maybe only the annual record is directly relevant, which is in row 19. But I'm not entirely sure if \"annual\" refers to the entire year's performance across all tournaments or just within the Master Series.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. To be safe, perhaps both rows are relevant because the claim mentions two different aspects: the series and the overall annual record.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I should consider that the annual win-loss of 2-4 comes from row 19, and the performance in the ATP Master Series (which is \"0 / 4\" in row 18) might be a separate piece of data. But since the claim mentions both the series and the annual record, perhaps both are relevant.\n\nI think I'll include both rows as relevant cells to cover all bases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 18,\n      \"year\": 1994,\n      \"data\": \"0 / 4\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 19,\n      \"year\": 1994,\n      \"data\": \"2 - 4\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says that in 1995, 1996, and 1997, the annual win-loss for Grand Slam was all 5-4.\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find the relevant data. The table has a lot of rows, each corresponding to a year from 1987 onwards. Each row lists different statistics under various columns like \"annual win - loss\" and \"year end ranking.\"\n\nI need to focus on the years 1995, 1996, and 1997. Let me go through each of these years one by one.\n\nStarting with 1995: Looking at Row 19, which is labeled as \"annual win - loss.\" The data for 1995 here is listed as 4-4. That's not 5-4. So that's a problem because the claim says it should be 5-4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong column. Let me check Row 18, which is \"masters series sr.\" But in Row 18, the data for 1995 shows \"0 / 4.\" That doesn't seem relevant to annual win-loss for Grand Slam.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look again at Row 19. It's labeled as \"annual win - loss,\" and under 1995, it says \"4 - 4.\" So that directly contradicts the claim. The claim says 5-4 in 1995, but the data shows 4-4.\n\nNow for 1996: Looking at Row 19 again, 1996 is listed as \"2 - 6.\" That's not 5-4 either. So the claim would be false here as well.\n\nThen 1997: In Row 19, 1997 is \"5 - 7.\" Again, that's not 5-4. So all three years don't match the claim.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct columns. The claim refers to \"annual win - loss for grand slam,\" so I need to find cells that specifically mention this. \n\nLooking back, Row 18 is labeled as \"masters series sr.\" which might not be Grand Slam. But Row 19 clearly states \"annual win - loss\" across various years. So the data for 1995, 1996, and 1997 under this column doesn't support the claim.\n\nTherefore, since none of these three years have a 5-4 record as per the table, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"annual win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
