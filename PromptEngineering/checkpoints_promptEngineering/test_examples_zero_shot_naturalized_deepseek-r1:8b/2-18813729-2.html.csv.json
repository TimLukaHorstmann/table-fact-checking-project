    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about songs that are part of a \"remix dead guy remix\" and how many of those songs were released in a year other than 2003. The claim states that only one song from these remixes isn't in 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows, each with information like year, artist, song, album, and remix. My task is to identify which cells are relevant for verifying this claim.\n\nI should probably look at each row where the remix column mentions \"dead guys remix\" or similar terms because the claim refers to songs from that specific remix type. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: year 2003, artist Blondie, song Good Boys, album The Curse of Blondie, remix Dead Guys Remix.\nRow 2: year 2003, artist Chicane, song Locking Down, album The Best of Chican\u00e9 (19962008), remix Dead Guys Remix.\nRow 3: year 2003, artist Lamb, song Wonder, album Between Darkness and Wonder, remix Dead Guys Remix.\nRow 4: year 2005, artist Texas, song Can't Resist, album Red Book, remix Dead Guys Remix.\nRow 5: year 2010, artist Pixie Lott, song Turn It Up, album Turn It Up, remix Dee - Lux Remix.\nRow 6: year 2010, artist Perry Mystique, song Party Like Ur 18 feat Sway, album N/A, remix Dee - Lux Remix.\n\nWait a minute, so only Rows 5 and 6 have the remix as \"Dee - Lux Remix,\" while the others are \"Dead Guys Remix.\" So maybe I should focus on those two because the claim is about the dead guys remix.\n\nThe claim says that only one song from these remixes isn't in 2003. But looking at Rows 5 and 6, their years are 2010, not 2003. That means both of these songs are not in 2003. So that would mean there's more than one song outside of 2003.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guys remix be not in 2003.\" Maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Perhaps it's saying that among all the songs that are part of a dead guys remix, only one is not from 2003. So let me check how many of these have non-2003 years.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRows 1-3: Year 2003, so their remixes are dead guys remix, and they're in 2003.\nRows 4: Year 2005, but it's a dead guys remix.\nRows 5-6: Years 2010, with \"Dee - Lux Remix.\"\n\nSo the claim is specifically about the \"remix dead guys remix\" category. Therefore, looking only at that group:\n\nRow 1,2,3 are in 2003 and have dead guys remix.\nRow 4 is also in 2005 but has a dead guys remix.\n\nSo among the dead guys remixes, how many are not in 2003? It seems like Row 4 is in 2005, so that's one. The other rows with dead guys remix (1-3) are all in 2003. So only Row 4 is not in 2003.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guys remix be not in 2003.\" If there's only one such song (Row 4), then the statement would be true? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is considering all remixes with \"dead guy\" or similar terms. Let me check again:\n\nRows 1-3: Dead Guys Remix\nRow 4: Dead Guys Remix\nRows 5-6: Dee - Lux Remix\n\nSo in total, how many songs are from the dead guys remix? It's Rows 1-4.\n\nNow, among these four songs, three are in 2003 (Rows 1-3), and one is in 2005 (Row 4). So only one song is not in 2003. Therefore, the claim would be true because only one of these remix dead guy songs isn't from 2003.\n\nBut wait, Rows 5-6 are part of a different remix type, so they might not count towards this specific comparison. The claim specifically mentions \"remix dead guys remix,\" so I should only look at that group.\n\nSo yes, in the dead guys remix group (Rows 1-4), only Row 4 is not in 2003. Therefore, only one song is not in 2003, making the claim true.\n\nI think that's it. So the relevant cells would be Rows 1 through 4 because they are the ones with the dead guys remix. The cell for Row 4 has a different year, so that's the one to check.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003,\" we examine all entries where the remix is \"dead guys remix\" (Rows 1-4). Among these, only Row 4 is not in 2003, making the statement true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" Hmm, wait, let me parse that correctly. It probably means \"the year 2005 be the only year that does not have multiple songs.\" So I need to check if in 2005, there's only one song, and all other years have more than one song.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. Let me list out the years and the number of songs they have:\n\nRow 1: Year 2003, Song: good boys (so that's one song)\nRow 2: Year 2003, Song: locking down (one song)\nWait, but hold on. Does \"album: the best of chicane : 19962008\" mean anything here? I think each row has separate data points like year, artist, song, album, and remix. So for each year, how many songs are there? Let me check:\n\nEach row is a different song, right? So in 2003, there are three entries: Blondie, Chicane, Lamb. Each with their own song, so that's three songs in 2003.\n\nThen 2005: only one row, Texas, and the song is \"can't resist.\" So that's one song in 2005.\n\n2010 has two rows: Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique. So that's two songs in 2010.\n\nWait, but the claim says 2005 is the only year without multiple songs. But wait, in 2003, there are three songs. In 2010, two songs. So 2005 is indeed the only year with just one song, which aligns with the claim.\n\nBut I should double-check each row to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through them again:\n\nRow 1: 2003 - 1 song\nRow 2: 2003 - another song (so total two songs in 2003)\nWait no, that's incorrect. Each row is a separate entry for different songs in the same year? Or are they different years?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row is a separate record, but each can represent a song release in a particular year. So the table lists multiple releases from different artists across different years.\n\nSo for 2003, there are three entries: Blondie's \"good boys,\" Chicane's \"locking down,\" and Lamb's \"wonder.\" That means three songs released in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, only Texas's \"can't resist\" is listed. So that's one song.\n\nIn 2010, Pixie Lott's \"turn it up\" and Perry Mystique's \"party like ur 18 feat sway\" are two songs.\n\nSo the claim says that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs, meaning it's the only year with just one song. That seems to be true because all other years have more than one song: 2003 has three, 2010 has two.\n\nWait, but the user instruction says \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song.\" So perhaps they meant 2005 is the only year without multiple songs. That aligns with what I see.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all rows where the year is 2003, because to confirm that it does have multiple songs (to disprove the claim), but actually no, wait: the claim is about 2005 being the only one without multiple songs. So we need to check if in 2005 there's only one song and that other years have more than one.\n\nBut according to the table:\n\n- 2003 has three songs (Rows 1,2,3)\n- 2005 has one song (Row4)\n- 2010 has two songs (Rows5,6)\n\nSo yes, 2005 is the only year with one song. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that in each of these years, the number of songs corresponds correctly. Let me count:\n\nFor 2003: Rows1,2,3 \u2192 three songs\n2005: Row4 \u2192 one song\n2010: Rows5,6 \u2192 two songs\n\nTherefore, only 2005 has a single song, making the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in 2005 there's exactly one song, while all other years listed have multiple songs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The table lists several rows with details like year, artist, song, album, and remix. The claim is specifically about artists in the 'remix' column who are \"dead guys remix\" and whether only one of these artists has a name that's also a state.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Artist is Blondie.\n- Row 2: Artist is Chican\u00e9.\n- Row 3: Artist is Lamb.\n- Row 4: Artist is Texas.\n- Row 5: Artist is Pixie Lott.\n- Row 6: Artist is Perry Mystique.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"dead guys remix.\" I need to check if each of these artists has a remix called \"Dead Guy Remix\" or something similar. From the table:\n\n- Row 1: Remix is \"dead guys remix.\"\n- Row 2: Remix is also \"dead guys remix.\"\n- Rows 3,4,5,6 have \"dead guys remix\" and others like \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nWait, no. Looking back, actually, in the table provided by the user, only some rows have \"dead guys remix.\" Let me check each row:\n\nRow 1: remix: dead guys remix.\nRow 2: remix: dead guys remix.\nRow 3: remix: dead guys remix.\nRow 4: remix: dead guys remix.\nRow 5: remix: dee - lux remix.\nRow 6: remix: dee - lux remix.\n\nSo actually, rows 1-4 have \"dead guys remix\" and rows 5-6 have \"dee - lux remix.\" So the claim is about the 'dead guys remix' artists, which are Blondie, Chican\u00e9, Lamb, and Texas.\n\nNow, the claim says only one of these four has a name that's a state. So I need to check if any of these artists' names correspond to U.S. states.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n- Blondie: Not a state.\n- Chican\u00e9: This might be a play on \"Chicano,\" which is an ethnic term, but not a state.\n- Lamb: Definitely not a state.\n- Texas: Yes, that's a U.S. state.\n\nSo among the four artists with \"dead guys remix,\" only Texas is a state name. Therefore, the claim says \"only 1\" of them have state names, which seems to be TRUE based on this analysis.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other states. Let me think: are there any others? Chican\u00e9 might not be a state, and none of the others fit. So yes, only Texas.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because only Texas among the artists with \"dead guys remix\" corresponds to a U.S. state.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It seems to suggest that in the table, there's exactly one song released after 2003 which doesn't have an album listed under its name. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song with details like year, artist, song name, album, and remix information. The columns relevant here are \"year,\" \"artist,\" \"song,\" \"album,\" and \"remix.\" \n\nLet me go through each row to check if any song after 2003 doesn't have an album title listed.\n\nRow 1: Year 2003, artist Blondie, song Good Boys, album The Curse of Blondie. So the album is present.\nRow 2: Year 2003, artist Chicane, song Locking Down, album The Best of Chicane : 19962008. Album listed here as well.\nRow 3: Year 2003, artist Lamb, song Wonder, album Between Darkness and Wonder. Album exists.\nRow 4: Year 2005, artist Texas, song Can't Resist, album Red Book. Album is there.\nRow 5: Year 2010, artist Pixie Lott, song Turn It Up, album Turn It Up. So the album is present here too.\nRow 6: Year 2010, artist Perry Mystique, song Party Like Ur 18 feat Sway, album N / A. Here's something interesting\u2014the album is listed as \"N / A,\" which probably stands for \"Not Available\" or \"Not Applicable.\" So the album title isn't specified here.\n\nWait, so in Row 6, the album is listed as \"N / A.\" If that's considered a valid album name or just an indicator that there isn't one, then this might be the song without an album title. \n\nThe claim says \"do not have an album title list,\" which would mean no album is listed. Here, it's explicitly stated as N/A, so perhaps that's the case.\n\nBut let me double-check if any other rows after 2003 have missing albums. Row 5 in 2010 has an album, but Row 6 does not\u2014it's \"N / A,\" which could imply no album is listed. So that's one song after 2003 (since 2010 is after 2003) without an album.\n\nAre there any others? Let me see all the rows:\n\n- Rows 1-4: 2003, 2005\u2014albums are present.\n- Row 5: 2010 has an album.\n- Row 6: 2010 does not have an album listed as \"N / A.\"\n\nSo only one song after 2003 doesn't have an album title list. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, in Row 2, the album is \"The Best of Chicane : 19962008.\" That could be a bit confusing\u2014does that count as the album name or just additional info? It might still be considered an album, so it's listed.\n\nAlso, I need to confirm whether \"N / A\" is indeed missing. If \"N / A\" means no album, then yes, but if it's a placeholder for something else, maybe not. However, in the context of the table, I think it's used as an indicator that there's no album listed.\n\nSo with that reasoning, only Row 6 meets the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that among the rows provided, only one song after 2003 lacks a listed album (\"N / A\").

The claim says, \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I should look at each row in the table to see if any mention \"dee - lux remix\" and check their years. Wait, the claim is about songs from \"dee - lux,\" so I need to find all the rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: Remix is \"dead guys remix.\" So not dee-lux.\n\nRow 2: Also \"dead guys remix.\" Still not.\n\nRow 3: \"dead guys remix.\" Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: \"dead guys remix\" again. Nope.\n\nRow 5: Remix is \"dee - lux remix.\" That's the first one.\n\nRow 6: Also \"dee - lux remix.\" So two songs from dee-lux.\n\nNow, the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" Wait, that wording is a bit off. Maybe it means only one song from dee-lux was released in 2005 or something? Or perhaps it's trying to say that among the songs by dee-lux, only one wasn't in 2005.\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" So maybe it's saying that out of the songs by dee-lux, only one was released in a year other than 2005. Or perhaps the opposite?\n\nLooking at the table, rows 5 and 6 have \"dee - lux remix.\" Row 5 is from 2010, and row 6 is also 2010. So both of these songs are from 2010, not 2005.\n\nSo if the claim is saying that only one song from dee-lux wasn't in 2005, that would mean only one wasn't released in 2005, but actually both weren't (they were in 2010). Alternatively, maybe it's trying to say that only one of their songs was not released in a certain year.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is saying that among all the dee-lux remixed songs, only one isn't from 2005. But looking at the table, both are from 2010. So both are not from 2005. That would mean more than one song is not in 2005, so the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the claim. Let me parse it again: \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" Maybe it's saying only one song was released by dee-lux that isn't in 2005, but that doesn't make sense because both are in 2010.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is trying to say that only one song is from a different year besides 2005. But since both are from 2010, maybe it's implying that only one of them wasn't released in 2005, which would be false because both aren't from 2005.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's saying that among all songs, only one song from dee-lux isn't from 2005. But looking at the table:\n\n- Row 4: artist is texas, year 2005, remix dead guys. So that's a different artist.\n- Rows 5 and 6 are the only ones with \"dee - lux\" remix, both in 2010.\n\nSo there are two songs (from rows 5 and 6) by pixie lott and perry mystique that are remixed by dee-lux, both released in 2010. So neither of these was released in 2005. Therefore, the claim says \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" That would mean only one song wasn't in 2005, but actually both weren't. So that makes the claim false.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is that only one song from dee-lux isn't in 2005, implying that there are two songs and only one is not in 2005, which is incorrect because both are in 2010. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one song from \"dee - lux\" was released outside of 2005. However, upon examining the table, both \"turn it up\" (row 5) and \"party like ur 18 feat sway\" (row 6) are remixed by \"dee - lux\" and were released in 2010. Since both songs are not from 2005, the claim is false.\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim that \"the year 2003 have as many song as 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's comparing the number of songs in the year 2003 to the year 2005. So, I need to count how many entries are there for each year and see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a song with details like year, artist, song name, album, and remix. My task is to count the number of songs per year.\n\nStarting with 2003:\n- Row 1: blondie - good boys\n- Row 2: chicane - locking down\n- Row 3: lamb - wonder\nThat's three songs in 2003.\n\nNow for 2005:\n- Row 4: texas - can't resist\nOnly one song in 2005.\n\nSo, 2003 has 3 songs and 2005 has 1. Therefore, the claim that 2003 has as many songs as 2005 is FALSE because 3 doesn't equal 1.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any rows. Scanning through the table again:\nRows 1-3 are 2003, row4 is 2005, and then rows 5-6 are 2010, so yeah, only one song in 2005.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist and their associated song, album, and remix information. The relevant columns here are 'artist' and 'remix'. Specifically, the claim mentions \"dee - lux remix\" and states that only one artist under this remix has a name that is also a state.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, there are two types of remixes mentioned: \"dead guys remix\" and \"dee - lux remix.\" The claim is specifically about \"dee - lux remix,\" so I should focus on rows where the remix column is \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 5: remix is \"dee - lux remix\"\nRow 6: same.\n\nSo, we're looking at rows 5 and 6 for artists under the \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nNow, the next part is to check if these artists' names correspond to a state name. Let's look at each:\n\nRow 5: Artist is \"pixie lott.\" I don't think Pixie Lott is a state. She's a singer.\n\nRow 6: Artist is \"perry mystique.\" Again, Perry Mystique sounds like a stage name or a performer's name, not a state. There isn't a state named Perry Mystique that I'm aware of.\n\nSo, both artists under the \"dee - lux remix\" do not have names that are states. That would mean zero artists meet this criterion, not one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it says only 1 artist has a name that's a state when actually none do.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "there be 1 single artist that be produce after 2005 that have an album title list",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"there be 1 single artist that be produce after 2005 that have an album title list.\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear, but I think it means there is exactly one artist who released an album after 2005 and that album has a listed title. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist and their corresponding details. The columns are year, song, album, and remix. So, my focus should be on the 'year' and 'album' columns to check if any artist released an album after 2005.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Year 2003, so it's before 2005.\nRow 2: Also 2003, same as above.\nRow 3: 2003 again, not relevant.\nRow 4: Year 2005. So the artist is Texas, and they have an album called \"Red Book.\" Since 2005 is after 2005? Wait, the claim says \"after 2005,\" which would mean 2006 or later. So 2005 might not count here unless it's inclusive.\nRow 5: Year 2010. Artist Pixie Lott has an album titled \"Turn It Up.\" That fits as it's after 2005.\nRow 6: Year 2010. Artist Perry Mystique, but the album is listed as \"N/A\" which probably means there isn't a specific album title listed.\n\nSo, let me tally up:\n\n- Texas (Row4) in 2005: album exists, so depending on whether 2005 counts as after 2005 or not.\n- Pixie Lott (Row5): definitely after 2005 and has an album title.\n\nIf the claim requires after 2005, then Row4's 2005 might not qualify. So only Row5 would count. That means there is at least one artist (Pixie Lott) who released an album after 2005 with a listed title. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 single artist.\" So if Pixie Lott is that one, then it's true. But what about Texas in 2005? If the claim includes 2005 as \"after,\" then there are two artists: Texas and Pixie Lott. That would make the claim false because it specifies only one.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to clarify whether \"after 2005\" means strictly after or inclusive of 2005. If it's strictly after, then only Pixie Lott counts, making the claim true. But if 2005 is included, then Texas and Pixie Lott both qualify, making it false.\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"produce after 2005.\" The word \"after\" usually implies after a certain time, so maybe 2006 onwards. Therefore, only Pixie Lott would count, supporting the claim as true.\n\nBut wait, the table shows Row4 (Texas) in 2005 with an album. So if the claim includes 2005, then there are two artists, making it false. If not, only one, making it true.\n\nI think \"after\" typically means after a specific point, so 2005 isn't included. Therefore, only Pixie Lott qualifies. That would make the claim true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there's at least one artist (Pixie Lott) who released an album after 2005 with a listed title.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the song from the dee - lux remix be preform by the same art and the song be from different year",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"the song from the dee - lux remix be preform [sic] by the same art and the song be from different year.\"\n\nHmm, I think there might be a typo in \"preform\" probably meaning \"perform.\" So, it's likely saying that the songs remixed by \"dee - lux\" are performed by the same artist but released in different years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an album track with details like year, artist, song title, album name, and remix information. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"artist,\" \"song,\" and \"year.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there are any remixes by \"dee - lux\" where the same artist performs different songs in different years.\n\nStarting with Row 5: Year 2010, Artist: Pixie Lott, Song: Turn It Up. The album is also named \"Turn It Up,\" and the remix is by \"dee - lux.\" So that's one instance where a song from \"dee - lux\" remix is performed by Pixie Lott in 2010.\n\nRow 6: Year 2010, Artist: Perry Mystique, Song: Party Like Ur 18 feat Sway. The album name is \"n / a,\" and the remix is also by \"dee - lux.\" So another instance of \"dee - lux\" remixing different songs from the same year, 2010.\n\nNow, checking if these are the same artist or different. In Row 5, the artist is Pixie Lott, while in Row 6, it's Perry Mystique. They're two different artists. So both songs have \"dee - lux\" remixes but by different performers.\n\nWait, the claim says that the song (plural?) is performed by the same art and from different years. But looking at the relevant rows, both are from 2010, not different years. So the year part of the claim doesn't hold because both are in 2010.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, Row 5 is 2010, and Row 6 is also 2010. So both remixes are from the same year, not different ones as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: same artist performing different songs via \"dee - lux\" remixes from different years. However, in reality, both remixes are by \"dee - lux,\" but they're from the same year (2010) and performed by different artists. So the claim is incorrect on both counts.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the claim says the song is performed by the same artist and from different years. But in our table, for \"dee - lux\" remixes, there are two instances: 2010 with two different songs and same year, not different years. So the part about different years is false because both are in 2010.\n\nMoreover, each song is performed by a different artist\u2014Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique. So even if they were from different years, the artists would still be different. Therefore, the claim's assertion that the same artist performs these songs doesn't hold either.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"the song from the dee - lux remix be performed by the same art and the song be from different year.\" So maybe it's saying for each song remixed by \"dee - lux,\" that same artist performs multiple songs in different years.\n\nBut looking at the table, only Rows 5 and 6 have \"dee - lux\" as a remix. Both are from 2010, so no different years. Also, both are performed by different artists. So neither condition is met.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any single artist has multiple songs remixed by \"dee - lux\" across different years. Let me see the table again.\n\nRow 4: Year 2005, Artist: Texas, Song: Can't Resist, Album: Red Book, Remix: dead guys remix. That's a different remix name, so not relevant to \"dee - lux.\"\n\nRows 0-3 have \"dead guys remix,\" but that's another user. So only Rows 5 and 6 are for \"dee - lux\" remix.\n\nSo in the table, \"dee - lux\" has two remixes: one for Pixie Lott in 2010 and another for Perry Mystique also in 2010. So same year, different songs by different artists.\n\nTherefore, the claim is claiming that a song from \"dee - lux\" remix is performed by the same artist and released in different years. Since both are in 2010 and performed by different artists, the claim is false.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim might be misinterpreted as each song from \"dee - lux\" remix is performed by the same artist but from different years. But since all \"dee - lux\" remixes here are in 2010 and performed by different artists, that doesn't hold. So the claim's assertion isn't true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that songs remixed by \"dee - lux\" are performed by the same artist across different years. However, upon examining the table, both relevant entries from 2010 involve different artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique) and the same release year. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
