So I need to check if the table supports this.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like result, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. The locations vary across rows: Hammond, Indiana; Valparaiso, United States; Hoffman Estates, Illinois; etc.\n\nI'll focus on the \"location\" column since the claim mentions Hammond. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Location is Hammond, Indiana. That's relevant.\nRow 2: Location is Valparaiso, United States. Not Hammond, so not relevant for this claim.\nRow 3: Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Again, not Hammond.\nRow 4 and Row 5: Both are in Hammond, Indiana.\n\nNow, count how many times Hammond appears. Rows 1, 4, and 5 all list Hammond as the location. That's three games in Hammond, Indiana. \n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"3 game be play in hammond , in.\" It might have a typo\u2014maybe it should be \"in Hammond, Indiana.\" Regardless, based on the table, there are three games listed in Hammond.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because there are indeed three games recorded in Hammond, Indiana.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table as there are three games listed in Hammond, Indiana. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is true or false. The claim is: \"the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 game decide unanimously.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and see if it contains any information that can confirm or deny this claim.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a fight. Each row includes details like the result (win), record before the fight, opponent, method, round, time, and location. The key here is to check for any row where the opponent is Jonatas Novaes and whether the method was a unanimous technical decision in round 3.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright, not Jonatas Novaes.\nRow 2: Opponent is LC Davis, not relevant.\nRow 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes. The result is a win, record was 3-0 before the fight. The method is a decision (unanimous), round 3, time 5:00. Location is Hoffman Estates, Illinois.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"1 of 2 game decide unanimously.\" Does that mean in this specific game, it's the second game where the decision was unanimous? Or does it refer to being one of two games that ended with a unanimous decision?\n\nHmm, but looking at Row 3, the method is a decision (unanimous), which fits. However, the claim says \"the game against Jonatas Novaes be 1 of 2 games decide unanimously.\" So, if this is the first time such a decision happened, then it wouldn't be the second one. Or perhaps it's implying that there were two games where it was a unanimous decision, and this was one of them.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, only Row 3 has a unanimous technical decision. There are other wins, but none else specify a unanimous decision. So if the claim is about Jonatas Novaes' game being one of two that were decided unanimously, then maybe it's false because there's only one such row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is suggesting that in this particular game (against Novaes), it was the first or second time a unanimous decision occurred, but based on the table, there's only one instance.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the game against Jonatas Novaes be 1 of 2 games decide unanimously.\" So if this is referring to whether this specific game (against Novaes) was one of two games that ended with an unanimous decision. But looking at the table, Row 3 is the only one where method is unanimous technical decision.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be false because there's only one game in the table where a unanimous decision occurred, not two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to understand what's being asserted. The key points seem to be:\n1. It's a game against LC Davis.\n2. This game is one of two games.\n3. The duration of this specific game was 5 minutes.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight with various details like the result, opponent, method, round, time, and location. My goal is to find any relevant rows that might support or contradict the claim.\n\nStarting with the first part: the game against LC Davis. Scanning through each row, I see Row 2 has an opponent named \"lc davis.\" So that's definitely relevant because it directly mentions LC Davis as the opponent in a fight.\n\nNext, checking if this is one of two games. The table lists multiple fights for what appears to be a single fighter. Each row is a separate fight, so the presence of LC Davis only in Row 2 suggests there was at least one other game involving them\u2014maybe another opponent. However, without additional information about another fight against LC Davis, it's unclear if there are exactly two games. The claim specifies \"1 of 2,\" implying that there were specifically two such games. But based solely on the table provided, we only see Row 2 as a win against LC Davis. There might be more context outside the table, but since I'm only considering what's given, it's uncertain whether this is part of exactly two games.\n\nLastly, the duration. In Row 2, the time column says \"5:00.\" Assuming that refers to the total time of the fight, which would make the claim about the duration correct.\n\nPutting this together, while the opponent in Row 2 matches LC Davis and the time is 5 minutes, we don't have enough information to confirm if there were exactly two such games. However, since the claim doesn't specify needing confirmation on both points but only mentions the game's number (1 of 2) and duration, perhaps it's focusing solely on the duration.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the game against LC Davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute.\" So, it's asserting two things: that there was a specific game (against LC Davis) that lasted 5 minutes, and that this is one of two such games. \n\nLooking back at Row 2, the time is indeed 5:00, so that part is correct. However, without another row indicating another game with LC Davis or specifying two games in total, it's only partially supported.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim might just be stating a single game (against LC Davis) that lasted 5 minutes and isn't necessarily about having multiple such games. So, focusing on the duration: Row 2 has a time of 5:00, which aligns with the \"last 5 minute\" part.\n\nGiven this, even though there's uncertainty about it being one of two games, the time aspect is correct. However, since the claim includes both aspects, and only the time is directly supported by the table, maybe the overall claim isn't fully accurate. But perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the game against LC Davis was a particular type (one of two) which lasted 5 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"1 of 2\" refers to the total number of games he's had in some context, but without more data, it's hard to tell. However, since only Row 2 mentions LC Davis with a time of 5:00, that's sufficient for the duration part, and perhaps the rest is context outside the table.\n\nI think I'll have to conclude based on what's provided. The game against LC Davis did last 5 minutes, so that part checks out.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against LC Davis lasted 5 minutes and was one of two such games. \n\n- **Opponent**: Row 2 mentions LC Davis as the opponent.\n- **Duration**: Row 2's time is 5:00.\n\nWhile the duration is confirmed, the table doesn't provide info on it being one of two games. However, since the claim specifies both points, and only the duration is fully supported, the overall claim isn't fully TRUE based on the given data.\n\nBut upon closer review, maybe the \"1 of 2\" refers to something else not directly tied to the table. Given that, focusing solely on what's provided:\n\n- Opponent: Yes (Row 2)\n- Duration: Yes (5:00)\n\nThus, considering both points are met, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the game against Kori Trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if there's any information that relates to this claim.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright, method is technical decision. Doesn't mention anything about rear naked choke.\nRow 2: Opponent is LC Davis, method is split decision. No mention of rear naked choke.\nRow 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes, method is unanimous decision. Again, no submission involved.\nRow 4: Opponent is Mark Sinclair, method is submission (rear naked choke). So this fight ended with a rear naked choke in round 1.\nRow 5: Opponent is Kori Trussell, method is submission (rear naked choke) as well. So that's another rear naked choke in round 1.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the game against Kori Trussel. Looking at Row 5, that fight was a submission via rear naked choke. Now, the claim says \"1 of 2\" which end by this method. That implies there should be two such fights.\n\nFrom the table, Mark Sinclair (Row 4) and Kori Trussell (Row 5) both ended with rear naked choke submissions. So that's two games. But wait, in the table, there are five rows, each indicating a win for someone. Are all these opponents of the same fighter? It seems like each row is a different opponent, possibly from different events or fights.\n\nAssuming these are sequential wins by the same fighter, and each fight is against a new opponent. So if the claim refers to two games where the opponent was Kori Trussel, but according to Row 5, it's only one game against Kori Trussell. The other submission was against Mark Sinclair in Row 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the game against Kori Trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission.\" So the fighter has two games where they ended via rear naked choke, one being against Kori Trussell and another against someone else.\n\nLooking at the table again, only Row 4 (Mark Sinclair) and Row 5 (Kori Trussell) have submissions. So that's two instances of rear naked choke endings. Therefore, the claim is saying that among these games, the one against Kori Trussel was one of two such submissions.\n\nSince both Mark Sinclair and Kori Trussell's fights ended with rear naked chokes, the claim is correct. The game against Kori Trussel is indeed one of two where it ended via that method.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for mentions of Kori Trussell and rear naked choke submissions.\n\n- **Row 5** shows a win against Kori Trussell via rear naked choke in round 1.\n- **Row 4** also shows a submission (rear naked choke) against Mark Sinclair.\n\nSince there are two such fights, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify what each part means. The key terms here are \"game against cliff wright,\" \"1 of 3,\" and \"go for 3 round.\"\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several fight records with details like opponent, method, rounds, time, etc. Let's focus on row 1 because that's where Cliff Wright is mentioned as the opponent.\n\nRow 1: res: win, record: 5 - 0, opponent: cliff wright, method: technical decision (unanimous), round: 3, time: 2:26, location: hammond , indiana , united states.\n\nSo, this fight was a 3-round match. Now, the claim says that this is one of three games that go for 3 rounds. To verify this, I need to check if there are two other fights in the table where the opponent's name might indicate a third and possibly another, but wait\u2014only row 1 mentions Cliff Wright. The other rows have different opponents: LC Davis, Jonatas Novaes, Mark Sinclair, and Kori Trussell.\n\nSo, looking at each of these opponents, I need to see if any others are involved in 3-round matches. \n\nRow 2: Opponent is LC Davis, method: decision (split), round: 3. So this was a 3-round match as well.\n\nRow 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes, method: decision (unanimous), round: 3. Another 3-round fight.\n\nRow 4 and 5 are both submission wins in round 1, so those don't add to the count of 3-round matches.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 rounds.\" So if there are three such games, then it's true. But from the table, I see only three rows: row 1 (Cliff Wright), row 2 (LC Davis), and row 3 (Jonatas Novaes). Each of these has a round count of 3.\n\nBut wait, the original instruction says that each opponent is a different person. So does the claim mean that there are exactly three games in total where the opponents went to 3 rounds? Or is it about how many times Cliff Wright fought?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse the claim again: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round.\" So, out of three games, one was against Cliff Wright, and each went to 3 rounds.\n\nSo in the table, are there two other opponents (apart from Cliff Wright) who also had 3-round matches? From the table:\n\nCliff Wright: row1, 3 rounds.\n\nLC Davis: row2, 3 rounds.\n\nJonatas Novaes: row3, 3 rounds.\n\nMark Sinclair and Kori Trussell: only 1 round each.\n\nSo that makes three opponents with 3-round fights. Therefore, if the claim is that against Cliff Wright was one of three such games, then it's true because there are two more in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about how many times a fighter had 3-round matches. But each row seems to be individual fights, so each win corresponds to a different opponent and possibly different rounds.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be row1 (Cliff Wright), row2 (LC Davis), row3 (Jonatas Novaes). Each of these has a round count of 3.\n\nBut the claim is specifically about Cliff Wright's fight. So I need to confirm if this particular game was one of three that went to 3 rounds. Since there are indeed two others, it would make the statement true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against Cliff Wright is one of three that go for three rounds. From the table, we see that Cliff Wright's fight (row1) and two others (rows2 and row3) all had 3-round matches. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"3 game be play in hammond , indiana and they all have 3 round.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. I think it might be trying to say something like \"three games were played in Hammond, Indiana, and each had three rounds.\" So my goal is to verify if the table supports this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a game or event. Each row has several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, round, time, and location. The location for all the games in the first four rows is Hammond, Indiana. The fifth row's location is also Hammond, Indiana.\n\nThe claim mentions \"3 round,\" which likely refers to each game having three rounds. So I need to check if each of these three games (assuming they are referring to the first three rows) has a 'round' value of 3.\n\nLet me look at each relevant cell:\n\nRow 1: The round is listed as 3.\nRow 2: Round is also 3.\nRow 3: Round is 3 again.\nRows 4 and 5 have rounds of 1, but since the claim refers to three games, maybe they are referring to rows 1-3. But I should check if all three have round 3.\n\nSo, for each relevant row (rows 0, 1, 2 in zero-based indexing), the 'round' column is 3. That seems to support the claim.\n\nNow, considering that the location is Hammond, Indiana for these games, but the fifth game's opponent and method don't matter here because the claim only refers to three games with three rounds each.\n\nWait, but in the table, there are five rows, so maybe the term \"3 game\" refers to three games. So I need to check if those three have round 3.\n\nYes, rows 1, 2, and 3 (if we consider row 0 as the first) all have round 3. So each of these three games had three rounds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because all relevant cells in the table support it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the game against jonatas novaes be 1 of 2 games decided unanimously and the only victory method that occur more than 1 time.\"\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Each row represents a fight, with details like result, record, opponent, method, round, time, and location.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the game against jonatas novaes.\" Looking through each row, I see Row 3 has the opponent as Jonatas Novaes. So that's relevant. The column for that would be \"opponent.\"\n\nNext, the claim says it's \"1 of 2 games decided unanimously.\" Unanimous decisions are technical decisions or split decisions? Wait, no\u2014unanimous is a type of decision where all judges agree. In the table, the method columns list either 'technical decision (unanimous)' or 'decision (split)' and others like 'submission.' So I think the term might be slightly different. But for now, I'll note that in Row 1, the method is 'technical decision (unanimous).'\n\nThen it says \"the only victory method that occur more than 1 time.\" That part needs careful checking. The claim is saying that there's only one method used for victories that happened more than once.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Win, opponent Cliff Wright, method technical decision (unanimous).\n- Row 2: Win, opponent LC Davis, method decision (split).\n- Row 3: Win, opponent Jonatas Novaes, method decision (unanimous).\n- Row 4: Win, opponent Mark Sinclair, method submission (rear naked choke).\n- Row 5: Win, opponent Kori Trussell, method submission (rear naked choke).\n\nSo, the methods used are:\n\n1. Technical Decision (Unanimous)\n2. Decision (Split)\n3. Decision (Unanimous)\n4. Submission (Rear Naked Choke)\n5. Submission (Rear Naked Choke)\n\nNow, looking for methods that occur more than once:\n\n- Submission (Rear Naked Choke) appears twice: Rows 4 and 5.\n- Decision (Unanimous) also appears in Row 1.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only victory method that occurs more than 1 time.\" So if both submissions and decisions are used twice each, then there's more than one method that occur multiple times. That would mean the claim is incorrect because it claims only one method does so.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. The claim specifies \"the only victory method,\" which suggests that among all methods, only one occurs more than once. However, in reality, both submission and decision (unanimous) occur twice each. So the claim's assertion is false because there are two different methods used multiple times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect, so the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we analyze the table for the specified conditions. The claim states that against Jonatas Novaes, the fight was one of two games decided unanimously, and only one victory method occurred more than once.\n\n- **Jonatas Novaes Fight (Row 3):** It's a win by a unanimous decision, making it one of two such cases.\n- **Victory Methods:** Two different methods (submissions) each occur twice, contradicting the claim that only one method does so.\n\nSince both submissions and decisions occurred multiple times, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a game is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the game against lc davis be 1 of 2 which last 5 minute and 1 of 2 that take place in the united state.\" So, I'm looking for a game involving LC Davis where it's one of two games, it lasts five minutes, and also one of two games that happen in the United States.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different fight. Let me go through each row to see if any match the criteria mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright. No mention of LC Davis here.\nRow 2: Opponent is LC Davis. This seems relevant because the claim mentions \"game against lc davis.\" So, this row could be the one we're looking for.\nRow 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes. Not LC Davis.\nRow 4: Opponent is Mark Sinclair. Not LC Davis.\nRow 5: Opponent is Kori Trussell. Also not LC Davis.\n\nSo, only Row 2 involves LC Davis. Now, let's check the details of this fight against LC Davis.\n\nIn Row 2, the method is a decision (split), round is 3, time is 5:00, and location is Valparaiso, United States.\n\nThe claim says that the game \"lasts 5 minute.\" Hmm, in the row, the time is listed as 5:00. But in mixed martial arts or similar competitions, the term \"minute\" could be ambiguous. It might refer to the duration of the round or the total time for the match. Let's think about it.\n\nIn many combat sports, each round is typically five minutes. So a round lasting five minutes would mean that the fight went into the third round but ended in the third round at 5:00. However, sometimes the term \"time\" could refer to how long the fight actually lasted before the decision was made. For example, if a fighter wins by a split decision after 5 minutes of fighting, that might be different from a fight that went all five minutes (which is the standard for a round).\n\nWait, in Row 2, the method is a split decision. So perhaps the fight didn't last the full five minutes because it was decided earlier. But let me check the exact wording of the claim: \"lasts 5 minute.\" It might mean that the game lasted exactly five minutes, but if it ended early, then maybe it's less than five minutes.\n\nWait, actually, in a split decision, the fight could have gone the full five minutes or maybe ended earlier. The time listed is 5:00, which I think refers to the duration of the round, meaning that it lasted five minutes before ending with a split decision. So the total time might be exactly five minutes.\n\nSo that part seems to fit. Now, about the location: Valparaiso, United States. So this fight took place in the US, making it one of two games (since only Row 2 meets the criteria) that take place in the US.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"1 of 2 which last 5 minute and 1 of 2 that take place in the united state.\" So for this specific game against LC Davis, it should be both: one of two games (involving LC Davis) that last five minutes and also one of two that take place in the US.\n\nLooking at the table, let's see if there are multiple fights involving LC Davis. From the table, only Row 2 involves LC Davis as an opponent. So perhaps the claim is saying that among these games against LC Davis (assuming there are more), this is one that lasted five minutes and took place in the US.\n\nBut from the table, there's only one fight against LC Davis. Therefore, maybe the claim is implying that this particular game is both 1 of 2 in terms of time and location, but since it's only one, perhaps the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe claim is about a game against LC Davis which is \"1 of 2\" that last five minutes and \"1 of 2\" that take place in the US. So it should satisfy both conditions.\n\nLooking at Row 2, the fight lasted five minutes (as per the time: 5:00) and took place in Valparaiso, US. So yes, this satisfies both being one of two games that last five minutes (if there's another game against LC Davis with similar timing) and one of two that take place in the US.\n\nWait, but from the table, there is only one fight against LC Davis. Therefore, if the claim says it's \"1 of 2\" which implies there are at least two such games, but the table shows only one. So that would make the claim FALSE because there aren't two such games; there's only one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"game\" refers to any game involving LC Davis in the US and also another in a different location, but in this case, all other opponents' locations are either Indiana or Illinois, so perhaps the fight with LC Davis is the only one in the US. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, in the table, all games are in the United States except possibly if any are outside. Let me check:\n\nRow 1: Hammond, Indiana\nRow 2: Valparaiso, US\nRow 3: Hoffman Estates, Illinois\nRow 4 and 5: Hammond, Indiana\n\nSo all fights take place in the US. Therefore, for Row 2, it's one of two games that take place in the US (but since all are in the US, this doesn't make sense). Wait, but if the claim is about the specific game against LC Davis being \"1 of 2 which last 5 minute and 1 of 2 that take place in the united state,\" then maybe it's considering only games involving LC Davis.\n\nBut from the table, there's only one fight against LC Davis. So the claim can't be TRUE because it requires this to be one of two such fights when actually, it's just one.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully reading both the table and the claim.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a fight. Each row includes details like the result (win/loss), record before the fight, opponent's name, method of victory, round, time, and location. The claim says: \"the game against kori trussel be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission in 3 round.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to verify each condition.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game against Kori Trussell.\" Looking at the table, I need to find rows where the opponent is Kori Trussell. Scanning through the opponents: Row 1 - Cliff Wright, Row 2 - LC Davis, Row 3 - Jonatas Novaes, Row 4 - Mark Sinclair, and Row 5 - Kori Trussell. So only Row 5 matches this.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"be 1 of 2 which end by a rear naked choke submission.\" This means that in two games (the first two), the opponent was defeated via a rear naked choke submission. However, from the table, I need to check if each relevant game indeed ended with a rear naked choke.\n\nLooking at Row 5: Opponent is Kori Trussell, method is submission (rear naked choke). So that's one game. Now, I need to see if there's another game where this happened. Scanning through the methods:\n\nRow 1: Technical decision (unanimous)\nRow 2: Decision (split)\nRow 3: Decision (unanimous)\nRow 4: Submission (rear naked choke)\nRow 5: Submission (rear naked choke)\n\nSo Rows 4 and 5 both end with rear naked choke submissions. That makes two games where this happened. Therefore, the claim is saying that against Kori Trussell, it's one of two such games, which seems correct because Row 5 is indeed one, and there's another in Row 4.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the game against Kori Trussel be 1 of 2...\" So the game against Kori is one of two, which fits since there are two rear naked choke submissions (Rows 4 and 5). \n\nNow, checking the round: the claim specifies \"in 3 round.\" Looking at Row 5, the round is 3. So that matches.\n\nPutting it all together: The game against Kori Trussell ended in a rear naked choke submission in round 3, and there was another such fight (against Mark Sinclair). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data. There are two rear naked choke submissions in round 3: one against Kori Trussell and another against Mark Sinclair.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round and all 3 of those games be in hammon, indiana.\" Hmm, I think there might be a typo here\u2014probably should be \"Hammond\" instead of \"hammon,\" but the table does have \"Hammond, Indiana.\" So, moving on.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with different opponents. The relevant information for each row includes: result (res), record, opponent, method, round, time, and location.\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cliff Wright.\nRow 2: Opponent is LC Davis.\nRow 3: Opponent is Jonatas Novaes.\nRow 4: Opponent is Mark Sinclair.\nRow 5: Opponent is Kori Trussell.\n\nNow, the claim mentions three games that go to 3 rounds. So I need to check which of these opponents' fights went to round 3 and whether all of them were in Hammond, Indiana.\n\nLet's look at each row:\n\n- Row 1: res: win, opponent: Cliff Wright, round: 3. Location is Hammond, Indiana.\n- Row 2: res: win, opponent: LC Davis, round: 3. Location: Valparaiso, United States. So this one isn't in Hammond.\n- Row 3: res: win, opponent: Jonatas Novaes, round: 3. Location: Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Not Hammond.\n- Rows 4 and 5: Both have round 1, so they don't go to 3 rounds.\n\nSo the claim is talking about three games that go to 3 rounds. From the table, only Row 1 (Cliff Wright) meets both conditions: a 3-round fight and located in Hammond, Indiana.\n\nThe claim says \"all 3 of those games be in Hammond, Indiana.\" But from the table, only one game (Row 1) is in Hammond. The other two that went to round 3 (Rows 2 and 3) were in different locations\u2014Valparaiso and Hoffman Estates.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement is incorrect because not all three games against opponents who went to round 3 were in Hammond. Only one was.\n\nWait, but does the claim say \"1 of 3 that go for 3 rounds\"? Let me re-read: \"the game against cliff wright be 1 of 3 that go for 3 round and all 3 of those games be in hammon , indiana.\" So it's saying that there are three games that went to 3 rounds, including the one against Cliff Wright, and all three were in Hammond.\n\nBut according to the table, only Row 1 is in Hammond. The other two (Rows 2 and 3) are not. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because not all three of those games were in Hammond.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three games going to three rounds, including the one against Cliff Wright, and all such games are in Hammond, Indiana. However, only Row 1 meets both conditions. The other two games (against LC Davis and Jonatas Novaes) were not in Hammond.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
