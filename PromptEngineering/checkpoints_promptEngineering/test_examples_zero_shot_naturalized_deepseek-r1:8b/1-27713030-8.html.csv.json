    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a team's score against Detroit is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"the team 's score against detroit be w 97 - 72 (ot)\". So, the team in question scored 97 points and allowed 72 points in an overtime game against Detroit.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details like date, opponent, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and record. My goal is to find which rows match the criteria of the claim.\n\nThe key elements from the claim are:\n1. The team's score was a win (denoted by 'w').\n2. The score against Detroit was 97 - 72 in overtime.\n3. Therefore, I need to look for a game where the opponent is Detroit with that exact score and overtime notation.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to check these conditions:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Detroit. Score is W 97-72 (OT). This matches exactly what the claim states.\nRows 2-14: The opponents vary, so only Row 1 is relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in Row 1 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 1 where the team faced Detroit with a score of W 97 - 72 (OT).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
