    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"prince park venue have the largest crowd in the 1965 VFL season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which row and column are relevant to the claim. The claim mentions \"Prince Park venue,\" so I need to find that in the table. Looking at the table, each row has a 'venue' column. I'll scan through each row's venue name to see if any match \"Prince Park.\"\n\nRow 1: Venue is McG\nRow 2: Venue is Windy Hill\nRow 3: Venue is Victoria Park\nRow 4: Venue is Princes Park\nRow 5: Venue is Lake Oval\nRow 6: Venue is Western Oval\n\nOkay, so Prince Park is the venue in Row 4. Now I need to check the crowd number for that row. In Row 4, the crowd is listed as 34,945.\n\nNext, I should compare this with all other venues' crowds on April 24, 1965. So I'll list out the crowd figures from each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: 21,744\n- Row 2: 20,500\n- Row 3: 31,370\n- Row 4: 34,945\n- Row 5: 23,979\n- Row 6: 16,998\n\nNow, I need to find the largest crowd. Let me arrange these numbers:\n\n16,998 (Row 6)\n21,744 (Row 1)\n20,500 (Row 2)\n23,979 (Row 5)\n31,370 (Row 3)\n34,945 (Row 4)\n\nThe highest is Row 4 with 34,945. So Prince Park indeed has the largest crowd.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we identified that \"Prince Park\" corresponds to Row 4 and checked its crowd number against all others. The crowd at Prince Park (34,945) is the highest among all listed venues on April 24, 1965.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on a table provided. The claim is: \"Hawthorn be the away team with the lowest score in the 1965 VFL season.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's stating that Hawthorn was an away team and had the lowest score in the entire 1965 VFL season according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game where one team is home and the other is away. Each row has several pieces of information: home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date. The date for all these games is April 24, 1965, so they're all from the same day, which might mean it's a particular round or event in the season.\n\nNow, to verify the claim, I need to check two things: first, whether Hawthorn was an away team in any of these games, and second, whether their score was the lowest among all away teams across the entire table.\n\nStarting with the first part: Checking if Hawthorn is listed as an away team. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Melbourne, away is North Melbourne.\nRow 2: Home is Essendon, away is Hawthorn. So yes, Hawthorn is here as the away team in this game.\n\nSo, that's relevant because the claim says \"Hawthorn be the away team.\" Therefore, row_index 1 (since rows are 0-indexed) and column_name \"away team\" is relevant.\n\nNext, I need to see if Hawthorn's score was the lowest among all away teams. To do this, I have to look at every other away team's score in each row and find out which one had the lowest.\n\nLet me list out all the away teams and their scores:\n\nRow 1: Away team North Melbourne scored 10.12 (72).\nRow 2: Hawthorn scored 6.8 (44).\nRow 3: Richmond scored 9.10 (64).\nRow 4: Geelong scored 9.11 (65).\nRow 5: St Kilda scored 12.12 (84).\nRow 6: Fitzroy scored 9.4 (58).\n\nNow, let's convert these scores to numerical values for easier comparison because the format is \"goals.behinds(total).\" For example, 10.12 would be 10 goals and 12 behinds, totaling 22 points. Similarly:\n\n- North Melbourne: 10 + 12 = 22\n- Hawthorn: 6 + 8 = 14\n- Richmond: 9 + 10 = 19\n- Geelong: 9 + 11 = 20\n- St Kilda: 12 + 12 = 24\n- Fitzroy: 9 + 4 = 13\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check:\n\nActually, in Australian rules football, the scoring system is goals (worth 6 points each) and behinds (worth 1 point each). So the total score is calculated as Goals x 6 + Behinds.\n\nSo for each away team's score:\n\nRow 1: North Melbourne: 10 goals and 12 behinds. Total = (10*6) +12=60+12=72\nRow 2: Hawthorn: 6 goals and 8 behinds. Total = 36 +8=44\nRow3: Richmond:9g,10b \u2192 54 +10=64\nRow4: Geelong:9g,11b\u219254 +11=65\nRow5: St Kilda:12g,12b\u219272 +12=84\nRow6: Fitzroy:9g,4b\u219254+4=58\n\nSo listing all away team scores:\n- North Melbourne:72\n- Hawthorn:44\n- Richmond:64\n- Geelong:65\n- St Kilda:84\n- Fitzroy:58\n\nNow, looking for the lowest score among these. The scores are 44 (Hawthorn), 58 (Fitzroy), 64 (Richmond), 65 (Geelong),72 (North Melbourne), and 84 (St Kilda). So the lowest is Hawthorn with 44.\n\nWait, but wait: Is that correct? Let me check each calculation again:\n\n- North Melbourne:10.12 \u2192 10*6=60 +12=72\n- Hawthorn:6.8\u21926*6=36 +8=44\n- Richmond:9.10\u219254+10=64\n- Geelong:9.11\u219254+11=65\n- St Kilda:12.12\u219272+12=84\n- Fitzroy:9.4\u219254+4=58\n\nYes, that's correct. So the away teams' scores are as above. Therefore, Hawthorn has the lowest score of 44.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any other away team. The claim says \"in the 1965 VFL season,\" and the table seems to be a subset of games on April 24, 1965. So maybe there are more games in the season, but since the table only has these six rows, perhaps it's all the relevant games for that day or a particular round.\n\nAssuming the table represents all the necessary data for verifying the claim within this context, then yes, Hawthorn is indeed the away team with the lowest score (44).\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Hawthorn is listed as an away team and has the lowest score among all away teams in the provided table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}]}",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table and the claim. The table has six rows, each representing a different match with details like the home team, their score, the away team, etc. The claim is specifically about Essendon's performance as a home team, so I need to focus on that aspect.\n\nLooking through the table, I see that Essendon is listed in Row 2. Their home team score is given as 20.18 (138). My task is to check if this is the highest among all the home teams in the season.\n\nI'll go through each row to extract the home team and their scores:\n\n- Row 1: Home team Melbourne scored 11.14 (80)\n- Row 2: Essendon scored 20.18 (138)\n- Row 3: Collingwood scored 11.13 (79)\n- Row 4: Carlton scored 8.11 (59)\n- Row 5: South Melbourne scored 7.9 (51)\n- Row 6: Footscray scored 8.6 (54)\n\nNow, comparing all the home team scores:\n\n- Essendon: 20.18 (138)\n- Melbourne: 11.14 (80)\n- Collingwood: 11.13 (79)\n- Carlton: 8.11 (59)\n- South Melbourne: 7.9 (51)\n- Footscray: 8.6 (54)\n\nEssendon's score is clearly the highest among all home teams in this table.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing two venues: McG and Victoria Park. The claim states that McG has a smaller crowd than Victoria Park. So, I need to find the crowd numbers for both of these venues from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with multiple rows, each representing a game. Each row has details like home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd number, and date.\n\nI'll start by identifying which rows correspond to McG and Victoria Park.\n\nRow 1: Venue is McG, crowd is 21744.\nRow 3: Venue is Victoria Park, crowd is 31370.\n\nSo, the two relevant cells are Row 1 (mcg) with a crowd of 21,744 and Row 3 (victoria park) with a crowd of 31,370.\n\nNow, comparing these numbers: 21,744 (McG) versus 31,370 (Victoria Park).

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Geelong get a lower score than North Melbourne as an away team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part of the claim and cross-referencing it with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into key points:\n1. Geelong is being referred to as the away team.\n2. Their score as an away team needs to be compared against North Melbourne's score as a home team or away team? Wait, no, the claim says \"as an away team,\" so both teams need to be away teams on that particular date.\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit confused here. The term \"away team\" can sometimes be ambiguous because each match has a home team and an away team. So in this case, when comparing Geelong's score as an away team to North Melbourne's, we need to see if Geelong is listed as the away team in any row where North Melbourne is also the away team or the home team.\n\nWait no, that doesn't make sense because each row represents a single match between a home team and an away team. So for Geelong to be the away team, there must be a row where the home team is someone else, and Geelong is the away team. Similarly, North Melbourne would have their own rows as either home or away.\n\nSo first, I need to find the relevant rows for both Geelong (as an away team) and North Melbourne (also as an away team, perhaps? Or maybe as a home team? Wait, no, the claim is about Geelong as away vs North Melbourne as away. Wait, that can't be because in each match, only one team is away and one is home.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim says \"Geelong get a lower score than North Melbourne as an away team.\" So it's comparing Geelong (away) to North Melbourne (also away). But wait, that's not possible because in a single game, each team has a designation of home or away. Therefore, maybe the claim is actually comparing Geelong as away against North Melbourne when they are home, or vice versa.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me read it again: \"Geelong get a lower score than North Melbourne as an away team.\" So maybe both teams are away on that day? But in reality, each game has one home and one away. Therefore, Geelong could be away against some other home team, but North Melbourne would also have their own games where they might be away or home.\n\nWait, no. The claim is specifically about Geelong as an away team and North Melbourne as an away team. But that's not possible because each game has a distinct pair of home and away teams. So perhaps the claim is actually comparing Geelong when they are away against their score when North Melbourne is away in another game.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is structured incorrectly, but I need to stick strictly to what it says. It says \"Geelong get a lower score than North Melbourne as an away team.\" So that would mean both teams are away on the same date, which isn't possible because each game has one home and one away. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that Geelong's score when they are away is compared to North Melbourne's score when they are away in their own games.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, identify all rows where Geelong is the away team. Then, find all rows where North Melbourne is the home or away team, and extract their scores accordingly. Then compare Geelong's score as an away team to North Melbourne's score (whether they are home or away). The claim says that Geelong's score as an away team is lower than North Melbourne's as an away team.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is comparing Geelong's away score to North Melbourne's home score. Because usually, when you compare a team's performance, it's against another team in their role (home or away). So maybe the correct comparison is between Geelong's away score and North Melbourne's home score on that date.\n\nBut the original claim says \"as an away team,\" so perhaps both are being considered as away teams. But that would require them to be in different games, which isn't how it works. Each game has one home and one away.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at each relevant row for Geelong and North Melbourne.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: home team melbourne, away north melbourne\nRow 2: home essendon, away hawthorn\nRow 3: home collingwood, away richmond\nRow 4: home carlton, away geelong\nRow 5: home south melbourne, away st kilda\nRow 6: home footscray, away fitzroy\n\nWait, in Row 4, Geelong is the away team. So their score is 9.11 (65). Now, for North Melbourne, I need to see if they are an away team on that same date. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: home melbourne, away north melbourne \u2013 so North Melbourne is away here, but in this row, their score is 10.12 (72).\n\nBut wait, the claim is about Geelong's score as away compared to North Melbourne's as away. So if both are away on the same date, we can compare them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more accurate that the claim refers to when North Melbourne is home and Geelong is away, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but let's see: In Row 1, North Melbourne is the away team, with a score of 10.12 (72). Geelong, in Row 4, is the away team with 9.11 (65). So if we're comparing their scores as away teams on that same date, then Geelong scored lower than North Melbourne.\n\nBut wait, is that the correct interpretation? Because each match has a different set of home and away teams. So when Geelong is away in Row 4, they are playing against Carlton at Princes Park. Meanwhile, North Melbourne is away in Row 1, playing against Melbourne at the McG.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is saying that as an away team, Geelong scored lower than North Melbourne did when they were away on the same date. If that's the case, then yes, because Geelong scored 9.11 (65) and North Melbourne scored 10.12 (72).\n\nBut wait, in Row 4, Geelong is away with 65 points, and in Row 1, North Melbourne is away with 72 points. So Geelong as an away team scored lower than North Melbourne as an away team on the same date.\n\nTherefore, the claim would be TRUE because 65 < 72.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The claim says \"Geelong get a lower score than North Melbourne as an away team.\" So yes, both are away teams on that date, and Geelong's score is lower.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim meant that when Geelong is away, their score is lower than when North Melbourne is home or something else, but based on the wording, it seems like both are being considered as away teams.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be TRUE because Geelong scored 65 as an away team, and North Melbourne scored 72 as an away team on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is **TRUE**. On the given date, Geelong scored 9.11 (65) when they were away, while North Melbourne scored 10.12 (72) when they were also away. Therefore, Geelong's score as an away team was lower than North Melbourne's score as an away team on that day.\n\nAnswer: True",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Prince Park venue having the least crowd in the 1965 VFL season is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that \"Prince Park venue have the least crowd to show up in the 1965 VFL season.\" So, I need to check if Prince Park had the smallest crowd among all the venues listed in the table for that specific date, which is April 24, 1965.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like home team, away team, their scores, the venue name, the crowd size, and the date. Since the claim refers to 1965, I should focus only on rows where the date is April 24, 1965.\n\nSo, first step: identify which rows correspond to matches played on April 24, 1965. From the table:\n\n- Row 1: Date is 24 April 1965\n- Row 2: Same date\n- Rows 3 through 6 also have the same date.\n\nTherefore, all six rows are relevant for this analysis since they all took place on the specified date.\n\nNext, I need to extract the crowd numbers from each row:\n\n1. Row 0 (Row 1 in original): Crowd is 21,744\n2. Row 1 (Row 2): Crowd is 20,500\n3. Row 2 (Row 3): Crowd is 31,370\n4. Row 3 (Row 4): Crowd is 34,945\n5. Row 4 (Row 5): Crowd is 23,979\n6. Row 5 (Row 6): Crowd is 16,998\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest crowd number from these. Let's list them out numerically:\n\n- 16,998\n- 21,744\n- 20,500\n- 31,370\n- 34,945\n- 23,979\n\nThe smallest number here is 16,998, which corresponds to Prince Park (Row 5 in original table). Therefore, the claim that Prince Park had the least crowd is TRUE.\n\nI should also note down which row and column contain this information. In the table, each row has several columns like home team, away team, score, venue, crowd, and date. So, for Row 5 (which is the sixth row in the original numbering), the relevant column is \"crowd\".\n\nWait, no: in the JSON example given, the relevant cells are specified by their row_index and column_name. Let me check how the rows are indexed.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the table has six rows, each with home team, away team, etc. The first row is Row 1 (row_index=0?), or maybe it's zero-indexed? Wait no, in the example provided by the user, the relevant cells start from 0 as row_index. Let me clarify:\n\nThe JSON example given had two relevant cells: row indices 0 and 1. So I think that each row is indexed starting at 0 for the first one.\n\nIn our case, the first row is Row 1 (home team Melbourne), which would be row_index=0, second row is Essendon vs Hawthorn, row_index=1, and so on up to row_index=5 for the last row (footscray vs Fitzroy).\n\nSo, Prince Park is in Row 4 of the original table, but in the JSON format, it's at row_index=3? Wait, no. Let me recount.\n\nWait, let me list out the rows with their row indices as per zero-based indexing:\n\nRow 1: Melbourne vs North Melbourne \u2192 row_index=0\nRow 2: Essendon vs Hawthorn \u2192 row_index=1\nRow 3: Collingwood vs Richmond \u2192 row_index=2\nRow 4: Carlton vs Geelong \u2192 row_index=3\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs St Kilda \u2192 row_index=4\nRow 6: Footscray vs Fitzroy \u2192 row_index=5\n\nSo, Prince Park is the venue for Row 5 (South Melbourne vs St Kilda), which is row_index=4. The column in question is \"crowd,\" which corresponds to the value 23,979.\n\nWait no, earlier I thought that Prince Park had 16,998, but looking back:\n\nRow 6: Footscray vs Fitzroy \u2192 venue is Western Oval, crowd 16,998\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs St Kilda \u2192 venue is Lake Oval, crowd 23,979\nRow 4: Carlton vs Geelong \u2192 venue Princes Park, crowd 34,945\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait in the table:\n\nRow 1 (original) \u2192 Melbourne at McG \u2192 21,744\n\nRow 2 \u2192 Essendon at Windy Hill \u2192 20,500\n\nRow 3 \u2192 Collingwood at Victoria Park \u219231,370\n\nRow 4 \u2192 Carlton at Princes Park \u219234,945\n\nRow 5 \u2192 South Melbourne at Lake Oval \u219223,979\n\nRow 6 \u2192 Footscray at Western Oval \u219216,998\n\nSo, the smallest crowd is in Row 6 (original row) with venue Western Oval. Therefore, Prince Park is Row 4, which has a crowd of 34,945.\n\nWait this contradicts my earlier conclusion. I think I confused the venues.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- The claim is about Prince Park having the least crowd.\n\nLooking at the table, each match's venue and crowd are listed.\n\nRow 4 (Carlton vs Geelong) is at Princes Park with a crowd of 34,945.\n\nNow, the claim says Prince Park has the least crowd. So I need to check if 34,945 is indeed the smallest among all venues in April 1965.\n\nLooking at all the crowd numbers:\n\n21,744 (Row1)\n20,500 (Row2)\n31,370 (Row3)\n34,945 (Row4)\n23,979 (Row5)\n16,998 (Row6)\n\nThe smallest is 16,998 at Western Oval. Therefore, Prince Park isn't the least; it's Western Oval.\n\nWait that can't be right because the claim says Prince Park has the least. So if Prince Park had a crowd of 34,945, which is higher than many others, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list all the venues and their crowds:\n\n- McG:21,744\n\n- Windy Hill:20,500\n\n- Victoria Park:31,370\n\n- Princes Park:34,945\n\n- Lake Oval:23,979\n\n- Western Oval:16,998\n\nSo the order from least to most:\n\n16,998 (Western Oval), 20,500 (Windy Hill), 21,744 (McG), 23,979 (Lake Oval),31,370 (Victoria Park),34,945 (Princes Park).\n\nTherefore, Prince Park is the highest. So the claim that Prince Park had the least crowd is incorrect; it's actually Western Oval.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be that the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait but earlier I thought the claim was TRUE because I misassigned the venues. So now I need to correct myself.\n\nSo in conclusion:\n\n- The claim that Prince Park (Princes Park) had the least crowd in April 1965 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is False.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Prince Park had the least crowd in April 1965 is **false** because Western Oval actually hosted the smallest attendance of 16,998 spectators.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{False}",

The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team score,\" and the date, which is April 24, 1965 for all matches.\n\nI'll go through each row to identify where Hawthorn is listed as the away team. \n\nRow 1: Home team is Melbourne, away is North Melbourne. Not Hawthorn.\nRow 2: Home is Essendon, away is Hawthorn. Okay, so Hawthorn is an away team here with a score of 6.8 (44).\nRow 3: Collingwood vs Richmond. Hawthorn isn't involved here.\nRow 4: Carlton vs Geelong. No Hawthorn.\nRow 5: South Melbourne vs St Kilda. No Hawthorn.\nRow 6: Footscray vs Fitzroy. Not Hawthorn.\n\nSo, the only match where Hawthorn is the away team is Row 2, where they scored 6.8 (44).\n\nNow, I need to check if any other away teams have a higher score than 44 on that day. Let's list all the away team scores:\n\nRow 1: North Melbourne scored 10.12 (72)\nRow 2: Hawthorn scored 6.8 (44)\nRow 3: Richmond scored 9.10 (64)\nRow 4: Geelong scored 9.11 (65)\nRow 5: St Kilda scored 12.12 (84)\nRow 6: Fitzroy scored 9.4 (58)\n\nLooking at these scores, the highest away team score is St Kilda with 12.12 (84) in Row 5. Hawthorn's score of 44 is much lower than that.\n\nTherefore, since Hawthorn isn't the away team with the highest score on April 24, 1965, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Hawthorn did not have the highest away team score on that date; St Kilda scored higher.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

First, I'll look at the table provided.\n\nThe table has several rows, each representing a different game. Each row lists the home team, their score, the away team, and other details like venue, crowd, and date. The dates in the table are all April 24, but the year isn't specified except for the claim mentioning \"1977 season.\" Wait, actually, looking back at the claim, it's about the 1977 season, so maybe I need to check if the data corresponds to that season.\n\nWait a second, the table shows games with dates like 24 April 1965. That doesn't match 1977. So the data in the table is from 1965, not 1977. This might be a red flag because the claim refers to 1977. If the table only has games from 1965, then there's no way to verify the 1977 season scores based on this data.\n\nSo, if the table doesn't include any information about 1977, especially since all dates are in 1965, the claim can't be verified as TRUE because we don't have the necessary data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table only contains games from 1965, while the claim refers to the 1977 season. Without relevant data for 1977, the claim cannot be supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says, \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find where Geelong and North Melbourne are listed as away teams. Since the home team is on one side and the away team on the other, I need to identify their scores.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Home team is Melbourne with a score of 11.14 (80), and the away team is North Melbourne with 10.12 (72). So Geelong isn't mentioned here, but North Melbourne is an away team.\n\nMoving down, in Row 4: The home team is Carlton scoring 8.11 (59), and the away team is Geelong with a higher score of 9.11 (65). This seems relevant because it's about Geelong as an away team scoring against Carlton.\n\nNow, the claim is specifically about Geelong getting a higher score than North Melbourne as an away team. In Row 4, Geelong scored 65 points, and in Row 1, North Melbourne scored 72 points when they were away. So in Row 4, Geelong's score is lower than their own game but not compared to North Melbourne.\n\nWait, the claim is about Geelong as an away team versus North Melbourne. But from the table, I don't see a direct comparison between Geelong and North Melbourne on the same day or in the same game. Instead, they are playing different home teams (Carlton and Melbourne). So Geelong's 65 points vs. North Melbourne's 72 points aren't directly comparable because they're against different opponents.\n\nTherefore, there's no data in the table that shows Geelong as an away team scoring higher than North Melbourne. The highest score for Geelong as an away team is 65, and North Melbourne scored 72 when they were away, but those are separate games.\n\nSo the claim isn't supported by the table because it doesn't provide a direct comparison between Geelong's performance against North Melbourne on the same occasion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Away team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Away team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the McGraw-Hammons venue having the second highest attendance in the 1965 season is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season.\" I think this means that McGraw-Hammons (or McG) venue had the second highest attendance during the 1965 season. So, I need to check if that's reflected in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different game. The columns include home team, away team, their scores, venue, crowd number, and date. Since all the dates are April 24, 1965, it looks like these are all from the same season, specifically the 1965 Victorian Football League season or something similar.\n\nMy task is to find out which games were played at McGraw-Hammons (which I think might be referred to as \"mcg\" in the table). From the table:\n\n- Row 1: venue mcg\n- Rows 2,3,4,5,6: other venues like Windy Hill, Victoria Park, etc.\n\nSo, only Row 1 is at McGraw-Hammons with a crowd of 21,744. Now, I need to determine if this was the second highest attendance that season.\n\nTo do that, I should compare the attendances across all games in the table and see where McG ranks. Since the claim says it's second, I have to check if there's another venue with higher attendance than McG and whether McG is indeed next.\n\nLooking at the crowd numbers:\n\n- Row 1: 21,744\n- Row 2: 20,500\n- Row 3: 31,370 (highest so far)\n- Row 4: 34,945 (even higher)\n- Row 5: 23,979\n- Row 6: 16,998\n\nSo, the highest attendance is at Row 4, Princes Park with 34,945. The next highest would be Row 3, Victoria Park with 31,370. Then comes McG with 21,744.\n\nWait, that means McG isn't even in the top two. The top two are Victoria Park (Row3) and Princes Park (Row4). So the claim says McG is second, but according to this data, it's actually third or lower.\n\nBut I should make sure if all games from the 1965 season are included here. The table has six rows, but it's possible that there were more games at other venues not listed here. However, based on what's given in the table, McG is third with 21k, and the highest two are Victoria Park (31k) and Princes Park (34k). So if the claim says McG was second, then the statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, I need to check all rows where crowd is higher than McG. So Rows3 and Row4 have higher attendances than Row1.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: The claim talks about McG's attendance being second. So I should include Row1 (mcg) as it's the home venue in question. Also, to verify whether McG was indeed second, we need to know which venue had the highest. From the table, that seems to be Princes Park with 34k.\n\nSo, to confirm the claim, we need to check if any other venue has a higher crowd than McG. Since Princes Park does (34k >21k), and Victoria Park is next at 31k, so McG isn't second. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, regarding relevant cells: The key columns are \"crowd\" for each row. So to verify the claim, we need the crowd numbers of all rows where venue is mcg and others.\n\nBut since only Row1 is McG, we need to check if any other venue had higher attendance than Row1. That would mean checking all other venues' crowd numbers. So in this case, I should look at all other venues (Rows2-6) and find the highest attendance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the second highest overall, not per team. So McG has 21k, which might be among the top attendances but not necessarily second.\n\nWait, let me re-examine: The claim says \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season.\" It's a bit unclear if it's referring to attendance overall or per game. But given the way it's phrased, I think it refers to McG being the second highest attended venue in the entire season.\n\nSo in that case, since Princes Park had higher attendance (34k) and Victoria Park had 31k, McG is third. So the claim would be false because it's not second; it's third.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\". Now, for relevant cells: We need to identify which rows are relevant to verify this claim. The claim is about McG having the second highest attendance, so we need to check all other venues' attendances to see if any exceeded McG's 21k.\n\nSo, in the table, for each row except Row1 (mcg), I should note down their crowd numbers and see which ones are higher than 21,744. Then, identify that Princes Park had a higher attendance, so McG isn't second. Therefore, the relevant cells would be all rows where the crowd is higher than McG's, but since we only need to confirm if McG was second, I think only the highest attendees matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just checking the top two attendances would suffice. So Rows4 and Row3 have higher attendance. So their row indices are 4 and 3.\n\nSo, in terms of JSON, relevant_cells should include all rows where the crowd is higher than McG's (Row1). Since Princes Park (Row4) has 34k, which is higher, and Victoria Park (Row3) has 31k, which is also higher. So both are higher, making McG third.\n\nThus, the claim is false because McG didn't have the second highest attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season\" is false based on the table data provided. The highest attendances were at Princes Park (34,945) and Victoria Park (31,370), making McG third in attendance rather than second.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
