    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the Houston Texans lose all the game play in October\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions that the Houston Texans lost all their games in October. So, I'm looking for any games listed in October where the Texans might have lost.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it seems to list games from Weeks 1 through 17 of the 2003 season. Each row has details like the date, opponent, result, and other information. My task is to find if there are any October games (month of October) in which the Texans lost.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: September 7, 2003. That's September, so not October.\n- Row 2: September 14, also September.\n- Row 3: September 21, again September.\n- Row 4: September 28, still September.\n- Row 5: The date is missing, so I can't determine the month here.\n- Row 6: October 12, 2003. That's October.\n- Row 7: October 19, also October.\n- Row 8: October 26, which is October.\n\nNow, looking at these October games (Rows 6, 7, and 8), I need to check the results. \n\nRow 6: Result is \"l 17 - 38\". The Texans lost this game.\nRow 7: Result is \"l 14 - 19\". They lost again.\nRow 8: Result is \"l 21 - 30\". Another loss.\n\nSo in October, the Texans lost all three games. But wait, I should check how many games they played in October. The dates are Oct 12, Oct 19, and Oct 26, which are three weeks apart, so that's three games. All three resulted in losses for the Texans.\n\nNow, considering the claim is \"the Houston Texans lose all the game play in October.\" Since all their October games were losses, this seems to be true based on the table data provided.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other row related to October that might affect this conclusion. The only rows with dates in October are 6,7,8, and each of those shows a loss. There doesn't seem to be any game in October where they didn't lose or didn't play at all.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is true because the Texans lost all their games in October as per the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the game with the lowest attendance be played at alltel stadium.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table and find the attendance numbers. Attendance is given in the 'attendance' column. The goal is to identify which games have the lowest attendance because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nLet me list out the attendances for each game:\n\nRow 1: 73010.0\nRow 2: 68390.0\nRow 3: 70487.0\nRow 4: 70041.0\nRow 5: NaN (Not a Number, so we can ignore this)\nRow 6: 68809.0\nRow 7: 70623.0\nRow 8: 56132.0\nRow 9: 70052.0\nRow 10: 50437.0\nRow 11: 72677.0\nRow 12: 70719.0\nRow 13: 70388.0\nRow 14: 43363.0\nRow 15: 65124.0\nRow 16: 70758.0\nRow 17: 70680.0\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest attendance value. Looking at these numbers, the smallest number is in Row 8 with 56132.0 and Row 14 with 43363.0.\n\nWait, actually, let me check again. 43363 is smaller than 56132. So, Row 14 has 43,363 attendees, which seems to be the lowest.\n\nNext, I need to see where these games were played. The claim mentions \"alltel stadium,\" so I should look at the 'game site' column for both the lowest-attendance game and see if any other relevant games are at Alltel Stadium.\n\nLooking at Row 14: opponent is Jacksonville Jaguars, result is a loss (0 - 27), game site is alltel stadium. So that's one game at Alltel Stadium with low attendance.\n\nNow, I should check if there are other games with lower attendance than this. Let me see:\n\nRow 15 has attendance of 65,124 which is higher.\nRow 14 is the lowest so far at 43,363.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any lower ones. Let's list them in order from lowest to highest:\n\n43,363 (Row14), 50,437 (Row10), 51,632 (Row8), 65,124 (Row15), etc. So yes, Row14 has the lowest attendance.\n\nNow, does this game with the lowest attendance take place at Alltel Stadium? Yes, according to the 'game site' column for Row14, it's alltel stadium.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the game with the lowest attendance be play at alltel stadium.\" It doesn't specify that only one such game exists. So if there are multiple games with low attendances, does each of them have to be at Alltel Stadium? Or is it sufficient that the game with the lowest attends is at Alltel?\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"the game with the lowest attendance be play at alltel stadium.\" The wording seems to suggest that the game with the lowest attendance is played there. It doesn't necessarily say that only Alltel has games with low attendance, but rather that the specific game with the lowest attendances is played at Alltel.\n\nSo, since Row14's game (with the lowest attendance) was indeed held at alltel stadium, the claim holds true.\n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other games with lower attendance than Row14. Let me make sure:\n\nRow14: 43,363\nOther rows: 50k+, except for Row8 which is 56k. So yes, 43k is indeed the lowest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the game with the lowest attendance (Row14) was played at Alltel Stadium.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that the Houston Texans won 5 games during the 2003 season. Let me start by looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the data comes from. The table has multiple rows, each representing a week of a game in the 2003 season for the Houston Texans. Each row includes details like the opponent, result, and other statistics like attendance and TV time.\n\nMy task is to check if they won exactly 5 games that season. So I need to count how many times their result was a win (W) versus a loss (L). \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Result is W\n- Row 2: Result is L\n- Row 3: Result is L\n- Row 4: Result is W\n- Row 5: No game data, so not counted\n- Row 6: Result is L\n- Row 7: Result is L\n- Row 8: Result is L\n- Row 9: Result is W\n- Row 10: Result is L\n- Row 11: Result is W\n- Row 12: Result is L (OT doesn't count as a win)\n- Row 13: Result is W\n- Row 14: Result is L\n- Row 15: Result is L\n- Row 16: Result is L\n- Row 17: Result is L\n\nNow, let's count the wins:\n\nRows 1,4,9,11,13 are wins. That makes 5 wins in total.\n\nWait, but row 5 has no data and rows 6 to 17 after that add more losses. So yes, exactly 5 Ws.\n\nBut I should also check if any other columns might affect this, like record or attendance. The 'result' column is key here because it directly shows win/loss. The 'record' column shows the cumulative wins and losses each week, which can help confirm the total.\n\nLooking at the 'record' column:\n\n- Week 1: 1-0 (after first game)\n- Week 2: 1-1\n- Week 3: 1-2\n- Week 4: 2-2\n- Week 5: missing data\n- Week 6: 2-3\n- Week 7: 2-4\n- Week 8: 2-5\n- Week 9: 3-5\n- Week 10: 3-6\n- Week 11: 4-6\n- Week 12: 4-7\n- Week 13: 5-7\n- Week 14: 5-8\n- Week 15: 5-9\n- Week 16: 5-10\n- Week 17: 5-11\n\nSo by week 17, they had 5 wins and 11 losses. That matches the total of 5 wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there are exactly 5 Ws in their 2003 season.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

The claim says that the Houston Texans scored more points on September 28, 2003, than they did on November 16, 2003.\n\nFirst, I need to check the table provided. Let me go through each row carefully to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It's September 7, so not the date in question. Then, Row 2 is September 14, which is still before September 28. \n\nRow 4 is September 28, 2003. That's the first game in question. So I'll note down the opponent and the result here.\n\nNow, moving on to November games. The claim mentions November 16, so I need to find that row. Let me scan through the weeks: week 11 corresponds to November 16, as listed in Row 11.\n\nSo now, I have two rows: Row 4 (September 28) and Row 11 (November 16). I need to compare their 'result' column values.\n\nRow 4's result is a win with the score 24-20. So the Texans scored 24 points that day.\n\nRow 11's result is also a win, but the score is 12-10. That means the Texans only scored 12 points in that game.\n\nComparing the two scores: 24 (September) vs. 12 (November). Clearly, September 28 had a higher point total than November 16.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because the Texans scored more points on September 28 compared to November 16.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are Row 4 for September 28 and Row 11 for November 16.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that in the year 2003, the Houston Texans played 8 games at Reliant Stadium. So, my task is to verify how many times they played at that venue during that season.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a week of the season with various details like opponent, result, game site, and record. The game site column will tell me where each home game was played.\n\nI need to go through each row and check if the game site is \"reliant stadium.\" Additionally, I should make sure that these games are part of the 2003 season, which seems to be covered in the table.\n\nLet's list out all the rows where the opponent is a known team (since home games would typically have them playing away teams) and check if the game site is Reliant Stadium.\n\nStarting from row 1:\n- Week 1: Opponent is Miami Dolphins, result W21-20. Game site is Dolphin Stadium.\nNot Reliant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Opponent New Orleans Saints, L10-31. Louisiana Superdome. Not Reliant.\n\nRow3:\n- Kansas City Chiefs, L14-42. Reliant Stadium. That's one game.\n\nRow4:\n- Jacksonville Jaguars, W24-20. Reliant Stadium. Second game.\n\nRow5: Missing data, so probably not a home game in week 5.\n\nRow6:\n- Tennessee Titans, L17-38. LP Field. Not Reliant.\n\nRow7:\n- New York Jets, L14-19. Reliant Stadium. Third game.\n\nRow8:\n- Indianapolis Colts, L21-30. RCA Dome. Not Reliant.\n\nRow9:\n- Carolina Panthers, W14-10. Reliant Stadium. Fourth game.\n\nRow10:\n- Cincinnati Bengals, L27-34. Paul Brown Stadium. Not Reliant.\n\nRow11:\n- Buffalo Bills, W12-10. Ralph Wilson Stadium. Not Reliant.\n\nRow12:\n- New England Patriots, L20-23 (OT). Reliant Stadium. Fifth game.\n\nRow13:\n- Atlanta Falcons, W17-13. Reliant Stadium. Sixth game.\n\nRow14:\n- Jacksonville Jaguars, L0-27. Alltel Stadium. Not Reliant.\n\nRow15:\n- Tampa Bay Buccaneers, L3-16. Raymond James Stadium. Not Reliant.\n\nRow16:\n- Tennessee Titans, L24-27. Reliant Stadium. Seventh game.\n\nRow17:\n- Indianapolis Colts, L17-20. Reliant Stadium. Eighth game.\n\nSo, from rows 3 to 17 (weeks 3 to week 17), each time they played at Reliant Stadium. Let me count how many that is:\n\nWeek 3: 1\nWeek4:2\nWeek7:3\nWeek9:4\nWeek12:5\nWeek13:6\nWeek16:7\nWeek17:8\n\nWait, that's eight games in total. But the claim says they played 8 times at Reliant Stadium. However, I should check whether all these are home games for the Texans.\n\nBut wait, the table might list both home and away games. For example, when the Texans play at Reliant Stadium, their opponents would be listed as visiting teams. So in each of those rows where the game site is Reliant Stadium, it's a home game for the Texans.\n\nSo from the count above, that's eight home games at Relient Stadium in 2003.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because they played 8 times there.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that the Houston Texans played 8 home games at Reliant Stadium during the 2003 season.

The claim says: \"the game with the lowest attendance be played at rca dome.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that the game with the lowest number of attendees was held at the RCA Dome. So, to verify this, I need to identify which games had the lowest attendance and check where those games were played.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different week and provides details about the game for that week, including the date, opponent, result, game site, record, TV time, and attendance. The key here is the \"attendance\" column, so I should look at all the values there to find which games had the lowest attendance.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance 73010.0\n- Week 2: 68390.0\n- Week 3: 70487.0\n- Week 4: 70041.0\n- Week 5: NaN (Not a Number, so we can ignore this)\n- Week 6: 68809.0\n- Week 7: 70623.0\n- Week 8: 56132.0\n- Week 9: 70052.0\n- Week 10: 50437.0\n- Week 11: 72677.0\n- Week 12: 70719.0\n- Week 13: 70388.0\n- Week 14: 43363.0\n- Week 15: 65124.0\n- Week 16: 70758.0\n- Week 17: 70680.0\n\nNow, I need to find the lowest attendance value here. Let's list them out numerically:\n\n- 50437.0 (Week 10)\n- 56132.0 (Week 8)\n- 43363.0 (Week 14) \u2013 this looks like the lowest so far.\n- 65124.0, 68809.0, 70388.0, 70487.0, 70523.0, 70680.0, 70719.0, 73010.0, etc.\n\nSo Week 14 has an attendance of 43,363, which seems to be the lowest. Now, where was this game played? Looking at the \"game site\" column for Week 14: it's the Alltel Stadium.\n\nWait a minute. The claim says the game with the lowest attendance was played at the RCA Dome. But according to the table, Week 14 (the lowest attendance) was played at Alltel Stadium, not the RCA Dome. So that means the claim is incorrect because the game with the lowest attendance wasn't held at the RCA Dome.\n\nI should also check if any other games were at the RCA Dome and had lower attendance than others, but in this case, Week 14's game is the only one with the lowest attendance at a different venue. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we identified the game with the lowest attendance (Week 14) and verified its location.

From the data provided, each row corresponds to a week of games, and each has details like opponent, result, game site, record, etc.\n\nI notice that the claim is about losing 5 games. So I need to find how many times the Texans lost during the season based on the table. The season seems to run from Week 1 through Week 17, as per the table's rows. \n\nLooking at each row:\n- Week 1: Result is a win (W 21 - 20), so no loss.\n- Week 2: Result is a loss (L 10 - 31), that's one loss.\n- Week 3: Loss (14 - 42), two losses.\n- Week 4: Win, remains at two losses.\n- Week 5: Missing data (row 5 has all NaNs), so probably didn't play or result isn't recorded. Maybe not counted?\n- Week 6: Loss (17 - 38), three losses.\n- Week 7: Loss (14 - 19), four.\n- Week 8: Loss (21 - 30), five.\n\nWait, but the claim is about losing five games in total during the season. So up to Week 8, they have lost five times. Then in later weeks:\n- Week 9: Win, so no additional loss.\n- Week 10: Loss (27 - 34), six losses.\n- Week 11: Win, still six.\n- Week 12: Loss (20 - 23 OT), seven.\n- Week 13: Win, still seven.\n- Week 14: Loss (0 - 27), eight.\n- Week 15: Loss (3 - 16), nine.\n- Week 16: Loss (24 - 27), ten.\n- Week 17: Loss (17 - 20), eleven.\n\nWait, that seems way more than five losses. But perhaps the table is incomplete or only shows some games? Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in counting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount from the data:\n\nLooking at each row, let's count the number of times the result starts with 'L':\n\nRow 2: L\nRow 3: L\nRow 6: L\nRow 7: L\nRow 8: L\nRow 10: L\nRow 12: L\nRow 14: L\nRow 15: L\nRow 16: L\nRow 17: L\n\nThat's 11 losses. But the claim is about losing five games, so that would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the data. Let me check each row again:\n\nWeek 1: W (no loss)\nWeek 2: L (1)\nWeek 3: L (2)\nWeek 4: W\nWeek 5: missing\nWeek 6: L (3)\nWeek 7: L (4)\nWeek 8: L (5)\n\nSo by Week 8, they've lost five times. Then in Weeks 9-17, the Texans might have played more games where we don't see losses or wins? Or perhaps only certain weeks are shown.\n\nBut wait, the table goes up to Week 17, and each week's result is either a win or loss. So let me count all L results:\n\nWeek 2: L\nWeek 3: L\nWeek 6: L\nWeek 7: L\nWeek 8: L\nWeek 10: L\nWeek 12: L\nWeek 14: L\nWeek 15: L\nWeek 16: L\nWeek 17: L\n\nThat's a total of 11 losses. So the claim that they lost five games is incorrect; it's actually 11. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut I'm confused because the user might have intended something else. Alternatively, perhaps the table only includes certain weeks, but the data shows 11 losses.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Houston Texans lost five games during the 2003 season. By examining each week's results in the provided table, it is evident that they experienced more than five losses\u2014specifically eleven. This contradicts the claim, leading to the conclusion that the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "in 2003 the houston texans play 8 time at louisiana superdome",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim that the Houston Texans played 8 times at the Louisiana Superdome in 2003 is true or false by looking at the given table. Let's start by breaking down what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"the Houston Texans.\" Looking at the table, I see that all the games listed are for one team. The opponents vary, so it's possible this is the home team's schedule. The opponents include teams like the Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, Kansas City Chiefs, etc., which are all other NFL teams, so it makes sense that these would be away games for the Houston Texans.\n\nNext, the claim says they played \"8 times at Louisiana Superdome.\" So I need to check how many times the Texans played their game at that venue. From the table, each row has a \"game site,\" which is where the game was held. Let me look through each row to see if any mention Louisiana Superdome.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Dolphin Stadium (Miami)\n- Row 2: Louisiana Superdome\n- Row 3: Reliant Stadium (Houston)\n- Row 4: Reliant Stadium\n- Row 5: Missing data, so probably a bye week or not played.\n- Row 6: LP Field (Nashville)\n- Row 7: Reliant Stadium\n- Row 8: RCA Dome (Indianapolis)\n- Row 9: Reliant Stadium\n- Row 10: Paul Brown Stadium (Cincinnati)\n- Row 11: Ralph Wilson Stadium (Buffalo)\n- Row 12: Reliant Stadium\n- Row 13: Reliant Stadium\n- Row 14: Alltel Stadium (Jacksonville)\n- Row 15: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa Bay)\n- Row 16: Reliant Stadium\n- Row 17: Reliant Stadium\n\nSo, the Louisiana Superdome appears only once in row 2. That's one game.\n\nWait, but the claim is about eight times at that venue. So according to this, they only played once there. But maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check if \"Louisiana Superdome\" is correctly identified.\n\nLooking back, row 2 is week 2 against New Orleans Saints at Louisiana Superdome. That's one game. No other rows list that venue except maybe others, but from the table provided, only row 2 does. So that would mean they played once there, not eight times.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting or missing something. Let me check again. The claim is about the Houston Texans playing 8 times at Louisiana Superdome in 2003. From the table, the team plays in week 2 against the Saints at that venue. That's one game. So the count is one, not eight.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing some rows or perhaps the table doesn't list all 17 weeks correctly. Looking at the table, row 5 is missing data, which could mean a bye week where they didn't play. Also, sometimes teams have home games and away games, but in this case, it's about playing at a specific venue.\n\nSo, only one game was played at Louisiana Superdome by the Houston Texans in 2003 according to the table provided. Therefore, the claim that they played eight times there is incorrect.\n\nBut I should also check if \"Houston Texans\" is the correct team in all rows. For example, row 2 has opponent as New Orleans Saints, which would mean it's a home game for them (Texans) in Houston? No, wait, no. If they are playing away games, then the opponent's home stadium is where the game is held.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing home and away. Let me clarify: When a team plays an away game, the game is at their opponent's home stadium. So for example, if the Texans are playing the Saints, the game would be in New Orleans at the Louisiana Superdome. But if the Texans are playing at home, it would be at Reliant Stadium.\n\nSo row 2: Texans vs Saints at Louisiana Superdome \u2013 that's an away game for Texans, so they played there once.\n\nAre there any other games listed as being at Louisiana Superdome? Looking through all rows, only row 2 has that venue. So total of one game.\n\nThus, the claim stating they played eight times is false.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that the Houston Texans played only once at the Louisiana Superdome in 2003, based on the provided table. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"game site\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the Houston Texans score more points on November 16, 2003 than on September 28, 2003.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows correspond to these dates in the table. Let me look through each row:\n\nRow 1: September 7, 2003\nRow 2: September 14, 2003\nRow 3: September 21, 2003\nRow 4: September 28, 2003\nRow 5: Missing information\nRow 6: October 12, 2003\nRow 7: October 19, 2003\nRow 8: October 26, 2003\nRow 9: November 2, 2003\nRow 10: November 9, 2003\nRow 11: November 16, 2003\nRow 12: November 23, 2003\nRow 13: November 30, 2003\nRow 14: December 7, 2003\nRow 15: December 14, 2003\nRow 16: December 21, 2003\nRow 17: December 28, 2003\n\nSo, the game on September 28, 2003 is Row 4. The game on November 16, 2003 is Row 11.\n\nNext, I need to find the points scored in each of these games. Looking at the table, the 'result' column shows the score as \"W\" for wins and the actual points. For example, in Row 4: result is w 24 - 20, so the Texans won by 24-20. Similarly, in Row 11: result is w 12 - 10.\n\nSo, in September 28, they scored 24 points, and on November 16, they scored 12 points. The claim says they scored more on November 16 than on September 28. But wait, 12 is less than 24, so that would mean the claim is false. \n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Row 4's result is w 24 - 20, which means the Texans scored 24 points in their win. Row 11's result is l 17-38? Wait no, looking again: Row 11 says 'result: w 12 - 10'. So they won that game by 12-10, meaning they scored 12 points. \n\nTherefore, on November 16, they scored 12, and on September 28, they scored 24. Since 12 is less than 24, the claim that they scored more on November 16 is incorrect. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
