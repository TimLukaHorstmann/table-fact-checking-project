So, first, I should find track number 9 in the table. Looking through each row, track 9 is at row 9. The details there are: track 9, recorded on 7/22/73, original issue: raised on rock, song title: just a little bit, time: 2:31.\n\nSo the song title for track 9 is indeed \"just a little bit\". That matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells, I need to look at which columns are important here. The key information in the claim is about the song title and the track number. So, from the table, for track 9 (row 9), the relevant columns would be \"track\" and \"song title\". \n\nSo, the relevant_cells should include both of these. Their row indices are 9 for both since it's all in one row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"track\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"song title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"track 23 have a title : just a little bit.\" Let me start by understanding what each part of this means.\n\nFirst, I should locate track number 23 in the table provided. Each row represents a track with details like track number, recorded date, original issue, song title, and time. So I'll scan through each row to find where track 23 is.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: Track 1\nRow 2: Track 2\n...\nContinuing this way, I get to Row 23: track: 23, recorded: 10 / 30 / 76, original issue: moody blue, song title: he'll have to go, time: 4:30.\n\nSo, track 23 has the song title \"he'll have to go.\" The claim says the title is \"just a little bit.\" That doesn't match. Therefore, the claim seems false because the actual title for track 23 isn't \"just a little bit.\"\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other relevant cells. Each row has the necessary information: track number and song title. So, the only relevant cell here is row 23 with the column_name \"song title.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"song title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
