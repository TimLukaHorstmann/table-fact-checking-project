    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Australia and united state both have 2 former winner.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each country mentioned in the claim and see if they indeed have two players who won in their respective years.\n\nStarting with Australia. Looking through the table:\n\nRow 1: England\nRow 2: Scotland\nRow 3: Australia - Greg Norman won in 1986.\nRow 4: Australia - Ian Baker-Finch won in 1991.\n\nSo, that's two wins for Australia (Norman and Baker-Finch). Now, checking if the claim says both Australia and the United States have two former winners. \n\nLooking at the United States entries:\n\nRow 5: Mark Calcavecchia, country: united states, year(s) won: 1989.\nRow 6: Lee Trevino, country: united states, year(s) won: 1971, 1972.\n\nSo, that's two wins for the United States as well (Calcavecchia and Trevino). \n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are exactly two winners each. Australia has Greg Norman in 1986 and Ian Baker-Finch in 1991, so yes, two. The US has Mark Calcavecchia in 1989 and Lee Trevino in 1971 and 1972. Wait, hold on: the claim says \"2 former winner\" but Lee Trevino won twice, so does that count as one or two? \n\nI think each individual is a former winner regardless of how many times they've won. So, if a player won multiple times, it still counts as one for their country's total. Therefore, Australia has Greg Norman and Ian Baker-Finch (2), and the US has Mark Calcavecchia and Lee Trevino (also 2). \n\nSo both countries have exactly two former winners each.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"greg norman finish better than either united state former winner\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify all relevant cells that relate to Greg Norman and the other US winners mentioned in the claim. The claim refers to \"either united state former winner,\" which likely means looking at players from the United States who have won Masters titles.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Nick Faldo (England)\nRow 2: Sandy Lyle (Scotland)\nRow 3: Greg Norman (Australia) \u2013 this is our target, as he's mentioned in the claim.\nRow 4: Ian Baker-Finch (Australia)\nRow 5: Mark Calcavecchia (United States) \u2013 a US winner\nRow 6: Lee Trevino (United States) \u2013 another US winner\n\nSo, I need to look at Greg Norman's finish and compare it with the other US winners mentioned in the claim. However, the claim specifies \"either united state former winner,\" which seems to be Mark Calcavecchia and Lee Trevino.\n\nWait, but in the table, Mark Calcavecchia is row 5, and Lee Trevino is row 6. But in the claim, it's phrased as \"either... former winner.\" I need to check how many US winners there are that Greg Norman outperformed.\n\nIn the table:\n\n- Greg Norman (row 3) has a finish of 18.\n- Mark Calcavecchia (row 5) has a finish of t28.\n- Lee Trevino (row 6) has a finish of t39.\n\nSo, Greg Norman's finish is 18. Now, I need to see if this is better than both Mark and Lee. Better in golf terms usually means a lower numerical value because lower scores are better. For example, finishing in the top 10 is better than finishing further down.\n\nComparing Greg Norman's finish (18) to Mark Calcavecchia (t28) and Lee Trevino (t39):\n\n- 18 is better than t28 and t39. So, Greg Norman did finish better than both of them.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that the claim is about \"either\" meaning just one or all. Since he finished better than both, the statement holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Greg Norman finished better than either US former winners. From the table, Greg Norman's finish is 18, while Mark Calcavecchia and Lee Trevino have finishes of t28 and t39 respectively. A lower numerical value indicates a better finish in golf, so 18 is indeed better than both t28 and t39.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: Look for Greg Norman (row 3) and US winners Mark Calcavecchia (row 5) and Lee Trevino (row 6).\n2. **Check finish positions**: Compare their finishes.\n   - Greg Norman: 18\n   - Mark Calcavecchia: t28\n   - Lee Trevino: t39\n3. **Determine if Greg's finish is better**: Since 18 < 28 and 18 < 39, his finish is indeed better than both.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"finish\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"lee trevino be the most former winner in the 1992 open championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim itself. It mentions Lee Trevino being the most former winner in the 1992 Open Championship. So I need to check if Lee Trevino won the 1992 Open and if he has more wins than any other player in that year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a different player with various details like their name, country, years they won, total scores, to par, and finish positions. The columns relevant here are \"player\", \"year(s) won\", \"total\", etc.\n\nNow, I'll check the rows for Lee Trevino. Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 6: player: lee trevino, country: united states, year(s) won: 1971 , 1972, total: 287, to par: +3, finish: t39.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 6, Lee Trevino's years won are 1971 and 1972. There's no mention of him winning in 1992. The claim says he was the most former winner in the 1992 Open, but according to this table, he didn't win that year.\n\nSo, does anyone else have a win in 1992? Let me check all rows for any player who won in 1992.\n\nRow 1: nick faldo, years won:1987 ,1990\nRow 2: sandy lyle, 1985\nRow 3: greg norman,1986\nRow4:iab-finch,1991\nRow5: mark calcavecchia,1989\nRow6:1971,1972\n\nNone of the other players in this table won in 1992. So if Lee Trevino didn't win in 1992, and no one else did either, then he can't be the most former winner for that year.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a row? Let me double-check. The rows are numbered from Row1 to Row6, each with different players as per their names. None of them have 1992 in their \"year(s) won\". So it's safe to assume that no one in this table won the 1992 Open Championship.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Lee Trevino was the most former winner in 1992 is incorrect because he didn't even win that year. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. Each row represents a different player with various details like their name, country, the years they won, total scores, to par, and finish positions. The claim mentions \"ian baker - finch\" as the most recent winner in 1992, so my focus is on this specific player and the year 1992.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has a 'year(s) won' column. Let's scan through these to find if \"ian baker - finch\" is listed. Scanning Row 1: nick faldo, not our guy. Row 2: sandy lyle in 1985. Row 3: greg norman in 1986. Row 4: ian baker-finch in 1991. Hmm, so he won in 1991, but the claim is about 1992. There's no row for 1992. So does that mean he didn't win in 1992?\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there's a player who won in 1992. Let me look through each row again. Row 5: mark calcavecchia won in 1989. Row 6: lee trevino in 1971 and 1972. So no one else won in 1992 besides perhaps ian baker-finch, but he's only listed as having won in 1991.\n\nThe claim is specifically about 1992, so if he didn't win that year, then the claim would be FALSE. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The table doesn't show anyone winning in 1992 except perhaps ian baker-finch, but according to his row, he won in 1991 only.\n\nSo, putting this together: the table shows ian baker-finch won in 1991, not 1992. There's no entry for a winner in 1992, so the claim that he was the most recent winner in 1992 is incorrect because someone else might have won that year, or he didn't win at all.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. Looking back, Row 4 has ian baker-finch's details, specifically his 'year(s) won' as 1991. The column name here would be \"year(s) won\". So the relevant cell is row index 4 and column \"year(s) won\".\n\nSo in conclusion, the claim is FALSE because he didn't win in 1992, and no one else is listed as winning that year based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year(s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"sandy lyle finish with a score 5 stroke better than mark calcavecchia's score.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. Let me see who Sandy Lyle and Mark Calcavecchia are in the table.\n\nLooking at Row 2, it's Sandy Lyle from Scotland. His year(s) won are 1985, total is 280, to par is -4, finish: t12.\n\nNow, looking for Mark Calcavecchia, that's Row 5. He's from the United States, won in 1989 with a total of 285, to par +1, and his finish is t28.\n\nThe claim says Sandy Lyle finished 5 strokes better than Mark Calcavecchia. So I need to compare their total scores because \"stroke\" in golf terms usually refers to the difference in scores between two players. \n\nSandy's total is 280, and Mark's total is 285. To see how many strokes better Sandy is compared to Mark, I subtract Mark's score from Sandy's: 280 - 285 = -5. Wait, that means Mark is 5 strokes better than Sandy because his score is lower. But the claim says Sandy is 5 strokes better, which would mean her score is lower by 5.\n\nWait, no. In golf, a lower score is better. So if Sandy has 280 and Mark has 285, the difference is indeed 5 strokes in favor of Sandy. Because 285 - 280 = 5, so Mark is 5 strokes worse than Sandy. Therefore, Sandy's finish is 5 strokes better (i.e., lower by 5). \n\nSo the claim is correct. Now I need to check which cells are relevant. The key columns here are \"player\", \"total\" for both Sandy Lyle and Mark Calcavecchia. So the relevant rows are Row 2 (Sandy) and Row 5 (Mark), specifically their \"total\" scores.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because the claim holds based on their total scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Sandy Lyle's total score of 280 is indeed 5 strokes better than Mark Calcavecchia's total of 285.

Not Australia.\nRow 2: Sandy Lyle is from Scotland. Not Australia.\nRow 3: Greg Norman is Australian. So that's one win for Australia.\nRow 4: Ian Baker-Finch is also Australian, so that's two wins for Australia. That's already two, so I can note that down.\n\nNow for Scotland:\n\nLooking at the rows again:\nRow 2: Sandy Lyle is from Scotland. That's one win.\nI don't see any other players from Scotland in the table. So Scotland has only one former winner here.\n\nSo Australia has two winners (Greg Norman and Ian Baker-Finch), but Scotland only has one (Sandy Lyle). The claim says both countries have two, which isn't true for Scotland.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other Scottish players. Scanning through the list: Row 2 is Sandy Lyle, and others like Row 1,3,4,5,6 are from England, Australia, etc. No other Scottish names.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"greg norman finish lower rank than either united state former winner\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and then check the table accordingly.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Greg Norman finishing lower than \"either\" United States' former winners. That probably means comparing his rank to all the US players who won before him. Looking at the table, the players from the US are Mark Calcavecchia and Lee Trevino.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the US players listed are Mark Calcavecchia (row 5) with a finish of t28 and Lee Trevino (row 6) with a finish of t39. So Greg Norman's finish is given as row 3: finish 18. \n\nNow, I need to see how these finishes compare. In golf terminology, lower numbers mean better positions, right? So a finish of 1 would be first place, 18th is worse than 28th and 39th. But wait, the claim says Greg Norman's finish is lower (worse) than either US winners. That means I should check if 18 is lower than both t28 and t39.\n\nWait, but \"t\" in front of a number like t12 probably stands for tied, so it's a tie at position 12. So his actual rank is 18th. Now, comparing that to the US winners: Mark Calcavecchia finished t28 (so rank 28), and Lee Trevino finished t39 (rank 39). \n\nSo Greg Norman finished in 18th place. Is 18 lower than both 28 and 39? Well, 18 is less than 28 and 39, so yes, he did finish higher (better) than the US winners. But wait, the claim says he finished lower than either of them, which would mean worse than both. So if his rank is better (lower number), then the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I might be getting confused between \"lower\" as in numerically lower or as in positionally lower. In golf, a lower numerical finish means a better position. So finishing 18th is better than 28th and 39th. Therefore, Greg Norman's finish is higher (better) than both US winners, which would mean the claim is false because it says he finished lower.\n\nSo to check this, I need to look at the relevant columns in the table for Greg Norman and the US players. For each player, their row has \"player\", \"country\", year(s) won, total, to par, finish.\n\nThe relevant cells would be Greg Norman's finish and the finishes of the US winners. So for Greg Norman, it's row 3 with finish:18. The US players are Mark Calcavecchia (row5, t28) and Lee Trevino (row6, t39). \n\nTherefore, I should include these three cells in relevant_cells to compare their finishes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Greg Norman finished higher than both US winners.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"finish\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself: it's stating that Greg Norman was the most former winner in the 1992 Open Championship. So I need to check two main things: whether Greg Norman won the 1992 Open and whether he is indeed the \"most former winner\" there.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a player with their details. Let's scan through the rows for Greg Norman. In Row 3, his details are: year(s) won: 1986. So he won in 1986. The claim mentions the 1992 Open, which is a different year.\n\nNow, I need to see if any other players won the 1992 Open or if Greg Norman is indeed the most frequent winner around that time. Wait, but looking at all the rows, none of them have 1992 as a winning year. The closest is Mark Calcavecchia in 1989 and Lee Trevino in 1971-72. So, no one won in 1992 according to this table.\n\nThis means that the claim might be incorrect because Greg Norman didn't win in 1992. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"most former winner.\" Perhaps it's not about being the most frequent overall, but rather having a notable victory or something else? No, the term \"most former winner\" suggests he was one of the main winners, perhaps multiple times.\n\nBut since Greg Norman didn't win in 1992 at all according to the table, the claim seems false. However, maybe there's more to it. Let me double-check each row for any player with a year that includes 1992 or if someone else won in 1992. Scanning again: Row 1 is Nick Faldo (1987,90), Row 2 Sandy Lyle (1985), Row3 Greg Norman (1986), Row4 Ian Baker-Finch (1991), Row5 Mark Calcavecchia (1989), and Row6 Lee Trevino (1971-72). No one won in 1992.\n\nSo the claim is definitely false because Greg Norman didn't win in 1992. Also, since no one else did, he can't be the most former winner if he never won that year. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is true or false, we analyze the table to see if Greg Norman won the 1992 Open Championship and if he's the most frequent winner around that time.\n\n- **Check for Greg Norman in 1992**: Row 3 shows Greg Norman won in 1986 but not 1992.\n- **No other winners in 1992**: All other rows do not list any player winning in 1992, indicating no one else did either.\n\nSince Greg Norman didn't win the 1992 Open and there's no evidence of others winning that year, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The relevant columns here seem to be \"year(s) won,\" \"total,\" \"to par,\" and \"finish.\" But for this claim, we're focusing on the total scores of Sandy Lyle and Mark Calcavecchia.\n\nLooking through the rows, I find Sandy Lyle in Row 2.

To check this, I subtract Mark's total from Sandy's total: 280 - 285 equals -5. That means Sandy actually scored five strokes better (or Mark is five strokes worse). The claim mentions seven strokes better, which doesn't match the numbers here.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check to avoid any mistakes. So, Sandy Lyle has 280 and Mark has 285. The difference is indeed 5 strokes (since a lower score is better in golf). So Sandy's finish was five strokes better, not seven. \n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"nick faldo be the most recent winner in the 1992 open championship\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the information provided.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Nick Faldo as the most recent winner of the 1992 Open Championship. So I need to check if he won that year and whether he was indeed the most recent at that time. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row provides details about different players. The relevant columns here are probably \"player\", \"year(s) won\", and maybe \"total\" or \"to par,\" but more importantly, \"finish\". \n\nI need to check if Nick Faldo is listed as having won in 1992 and whether he was the most recent at that point. Let me scan each row:\n\n- Row 1: Player is Nick Faldo, country England, years won 1987, 1990, total 272, etc. So he won in '87 and '90 but not in '92.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the claim says he was the winner in 1992. So if his last win was before '92, then maybe he didn't win in '92. Let me confirm: his years won are 1987, 1990. That means he didn't win in 1992.\n\nIf that's the case, then the claim is incorrect because Nick Faldo didn't win the 1992 Open. But wait, I should double-check if there might be any other information in the table that could affect this conclusion.\n\nLooking further: \n\n- The table has six rows, each with a player who won certain years. For example, Lee Trevino won in '71 and '72, Mark Calcavecchia in '89, Greg Norman in '86, Sandy Lyle in '85, Ian Baker-Finch in '91. None of these are Nick Faldo.\n\nWait, but the table doesn't have a row for 1992 at all. So if Nick Faldo didn't win in 1992 and isn't listed as winning any years after that, then he couldn't have been the most recent winner in '92 because someone else might have won later.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"most recent\" in 1992. So perhaps I need to check who won in 1992 according to the table. Since no one is listed as having won in '92, maybe Nick Faldo didn't win that year, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, if someone else won in '92 but isn't in the table, the information provided doesn't confirm it. But since the claim is about whether Nick Faldo was the most recent winner in 1992 based on this table, and he didn't even win that year according to his own row (he stopped at 1990), then the answer would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again: Row 1 is Nick Faldo with years won as 1987, 1990. So no mention of 1992. Therefore, he didn't win in '92. Hence, the claim that he was the most recent winner in '92 would be false because he didn't even win that year.\n\nMoreover, the table doesn't show anyone else winning in '92 either, so it's possible that the Open was won by someone not listed here, but based on the data given, Nick Faldo didn't win in 1992. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Nick Faldo was the most recent winner of the 1992 Open Championship. However, according to the table, Nick Faldo's last victory was in 1990. There is no information indicating he won the 1992 event, making the claim false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** The table provides details about players, their countries, years won, and other statistics.\n2. **Check Nick Faldo's Wins:** Nick Faldo's wins are listed in 1987 and 1990, not including 1992.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since he didn't win in 1992, the claim that he was the most recent winner for that year is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"year (s) won\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
