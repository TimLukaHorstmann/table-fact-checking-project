    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table is showing. The table has five rows, each representing different classes and seasons, along with some statistics like race count, podiums, and poles. The claim specifically mentions \"moto2 class\" and says there are 0 poles there.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row that corresponds to the moto2 class. Let's scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: class is 125 cc \u2013 not moto2.\nRow 2: class is 250 cc \u2013 also not moto2.\nRow 3: class is motogp \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: class is moto2 \u2013 this is the one we're interested in.\nRow 5: class is total, which seems to aggregate data across classes.\n\nSo, Row 4 is the relevant row for the claim about moto2. Now, checking the \"pole\" column for that row. According to the table, the pole count for moto2 is 0.\n\nSince the claim states there are 0 poles in moto2 and the table confirms this with a pole count of 0, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "4 pole have a moto2 class",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. \"4 pole\" probably refers to 4 instances where someone achieved a pole position. A pole position is when a rider starts at the front of the race grid. The phrase \"have a moto2 class\" means that these 4 poles were achieved in races belonging to the Moto2 class.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there are any rows or columns related to the number of pole positions and the class being Moto2. The table has five rows, each corresponding to different classes: 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and a total.\n\nThe claim is specifically about \"pole\" in the context of Moto2, so I should focus on the row that corresponds to the Moto2 class. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: 125 cc, season 2001, race 1, podiums 0, pole 0.\nRow 2: 250 cc, seasons 2002-2008, races 65, podiums 7, pole 0.\nRow 3: motogp, season 2009, races 7, podiums 0, pole 0.\nRow 4: moto2, season 2010-, races 62, podiums 4, pole 0.\nRow 5: total, seasons 2002-present, races 135, podiums 11, pole 0.\n\nWait, I see that each row has a \"pole\" column. For Row 1, the pole is 0; same for Rows 2 and 3. But Row 4, which is Moto2, also shows pole as 0. So in total, the number of poles for Moto2 is 0.\n\nBut the claim says there are 4 poles in Moto2. Since the table shows 0, that would mean the claim is false.\n\nHowever, I should double-check to make sure I'm interpreting correctly. Maybe \"4 pole\" refers to something else, like 4 riders who have achieved a pole each in Moto2 races. But the table doesn't specify individual riders; it's about the class as a whole.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of pole positions for Moto2 is 0, so claiming there are 4 would be incorrect.\n\nI don't see any other relevant cells that would affect this conclusion. The claim is specifically about poles in Moto2, and the table shows 0. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that in the Moto2 class (Row 4), the number of pole positions is 0, not 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
