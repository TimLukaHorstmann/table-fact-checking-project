    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the result of the away match versus the wightlink raider be a 5 - 4 loss.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about an away match against Wightlink Raiders and the result being a loss with a score of 5-4. So I need to find in the table if there's such a game.\n\nLooking at each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Slough Jets, venue home, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Opponent is Slough Jets, away, but result is lost 5-6 (OT), so it's a loss but the score isn't 5-4. So maybe this could be relevant if I'm checking all possibilities, but doesn't match exactly.\nRow 3: Opponent Swindon Wildcats, away, won 6-3, not Wightlink.\nRow 4: Swindon again, home, won 4-2.\nRow 5: Sheffield Scimitars, away, won 7-4.\nRow 6: Milton Keynes Lightning, home, lost 2-4.\nRow 7: Romford Raiders, home, won 6-2.\nRow 8: Wightlink Raiders, away, result is lost 5-4. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo Row 8 has the opponent as Wightlink Raiders, venue is away, result is a loss with score 5-4. So that's relevant.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The other rows don't have Wightlink Raiders except Row 8. So only Row 8 is relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there is an away match versus Wightlink Raiders with a 5-4 loss.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in Row 8 where the result is a 5-4 loss against Wightlink Raiders when playing away.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"stuart potts be the man of the match during the league / cup competition on the 22nd\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions Stuart Potts being the Man of the Match (MoM) during a League/Cup competition on the 22nd. So I need to check each row in the table to see if there's a match on the 22nd where Stuart Potts was the MoM.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows from Row 1 to Row 11. Each row has details like date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition type, and MoM. \n\nI need to find the row where the date is the 22nd. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: 1st\n- Row 2: 2nd\n- Row 3: 8th\n- Row 4: 9th\n- Row 5: 15th\n- Row 6: 16th\n- Row 7: 19th\n- Row 8: 22nd\n- Row 9: 23rd\n- Row 10: 29th\n- Row 11: 30th\n\nSo, Row 8 is the one on the 22nd. Now I'll check what the MoM was for that row. According to the table, in Row 8, the MoM is Stuart Potts.\n\nAlso, the competition type for that match is listed as \"league / cup\", which matches the claim's condition of it being a league/cup competition.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the relevant cell. So the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"man of the match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking each condition against the table provided.\n\nThe claim is: \"the wightlink raider be the opponent at on away game on the 22nd.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts:\n1. Opponent: Wightlink Raiders\n2. Venue: Away game\n3. Date: 22nd\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific date and opponent. Let's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 8 is date: 22nd, opponent: wightlink raiders, venue: away, result: lost 5 - 4... So this matches all three parts of the claim:\n- Opponent is Wightlink Raiders\n- Venue is away\n- Date is 22nd\n\nSo the relevant cells are row_index 8 (since rows start at 0, but in the table above, it's actually the 9th row as per the user's numbering). Wait, no, in the table provided by the user, Row 1 is index 0, so Row 8 would be index 7. But I need to check how the rows are numbered in the actual data.\n\nWait, the user's table starts with Row 1: date: 1st, etc., up to Row 11: date: 30th. So each row is a separate entry. Therefore, the claim refers to the opponent being Wightlink Raiders on an away game on the 22nd.\n\nLooking at the table, in Row 8 (which would be index 7), the details are:\n- Date: 22nd\n- Opponent: wightlink raiders\n- Venue: away\n\nSo this matches exactly what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are row 8 and the columns for date, opponent, and venue.\n\nI need to make sure I'm capturing the correct row index. The user's instruction says row_index should be an integer, so since Row 1 is 0, Row 8 would be 7 (since 22nd is the 8th row in their count starting from 1). Wait no, actually, looking back at the table, it's written as:\n\nRow 1: date: 1st\n\n...\n\nRow 8: date: 22nd\n\nSo if each Row x corresponds to a specific date, then Row 8 (which is the 8th row) has all the details for the 22nd. Therefore, in terms of array indices starting at 0, it's index 7.\n\nBut in the JSON example provided by the user, they have row_index as an integer, so if the table has 11 rows, each with their own date, then Row 8 is indeed the 8th entry, which would be index 7. Wait, no, that's not correct because typically arrays are zero-indexed, so Row 1 would be index 0, Row 2 index 1, etc., up to Row 11 being index 10.\n\nTherefore, for the claim, looking at Row 8 (which is date:22nd), it's actually row_index 7 in the array. So the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:7\n- column_name: opponent\n- and maybe venue and date as well? Or does the claim only specify the opponent?\n\nWait, the claim has three parts: opponent, venue, and date. All of them need to match for it to be true.\n\nSo I should check each relevant cell that corresponds to these three attributes.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has:\n- date\n- opponent\n- venue\n- result\n- attendance\n- competition\n- man of the match\n\nTherefore, the relevant columns are 'opponent', 'venue', and 'date'.\n\nSo for Row 8 (index 7), all three attributes match the claim. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. row_index:7, column_name:'opponent' \u2192 wightlink raiders\n2. row_index:7, column_name:'venue' \u2192 away\n3. row_index:7, column_name:'date' \u2192 22nd\n\nBut wait, in the JSON example, the relevant cells are a list of objects each with 'row_index' and 'column_name'. So for each matching cell, we need to include it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones for date, opponent, and venue on row 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Wightlink Raiders were the opponent in an away game on the 22nd as per the table. The relevant cells confirm all parts of the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim has three main parts: playing in a league/cup competition against Swindon Wildcats, losing 4-2, and having Neil Liddiard as the man of the match.\n\nStarting with the opponent: Swindon Wildcats. Looking at the table, I need to check each row to see which game was against Swindon Wildcats.

Now I need to check if any of these rows involve a loss with the score 4-2.\n\nLooking at Row 3: Date is 8th, venue is away, result is won 6-3.\nRow 4: Date is 9th, venue is home, result is won 4-2. Wait, that's a win, not a loss, and the score is 4-2.\n\nWait, the claim says \"be lost 4 - 2.\" So I need to see if there's any row where against Swindon Wildcats, they lost with a score of 4-2.\n\nBut in Row 3, they won 6-3. In Row 4, they won 4-2. So none of the games against Swindon Wildcats resulted in a loss with a 4-2 score.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: Lost to Slough Jets at home.\nRow 2: Lost to Slough Jets away, score 5-6 OT.\nRow 3: Won against Swindon Wildcats away, 6-3.\nRow 4: Won against Swindon Wildcats home, 4-2.\nRow 5: Won against Sheffield Scimitars away, 7-4.\nRow 6: Lost to Milton Keynes Lightning at home, 2-4.\nRow 7: Won against Romford Raiders home, 6-2.\nRow 8: Lost to Wightlink Raiders away, 5-4.\nRow 9: Won against Telford Tigers home, 4-2.\nRow 10: Won against Romford Raiders home, 7-2.\nRow 11: Won against Bracknell Bees away, 4-0.\n\nSo the only loss is in Rows 1, 2, 6, 8. But none of these are against Swindon Wildcats with a score of 4-2. The Swindon Wildcats games (Rows 3 and 4) resulted in wins for the team, not losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that they lost to Swindon Wildcats 4-2 is incorrect because there's no such game in the table. Additionally, the man of the match should be Neil Liddiard, as per the claim. Let's check who was Man of the Match for those games.\n\nRow 3: Man of the Match is Lukas Smital.\nRow 4: Man of the Match is Neil Liddiard.\n\nWait a minute! So in Row 4, against Swindon Wildcats at home, they won 4-2 with Neil Liddiard as MoM. But that's a win, not a loss. The claim says \"be lost 4 - 2,\" which doesn't match because it was a win.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect on two counts: the result and the man of the match, but wait, no\u2014 actually, the only part where Neil Liddiard is MoM is in Row 4, which was a win. The claim is about losing, so even though Neil was MoM, the game wasn't a loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that they lost to Swindon Wildcats 4-2 with Neil Liddiard as MoM is FALSE because there's no such game in the table where they lost to Swindon Wildcats with those specifics.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that the team lost against Swindon Wildcats in a league/cup competition with a score of 4-2 and that Neil Liddiard was the man of the match. However, upon reviewing the table, the game against Swindon Wildcats (Rows 3 and 4) resulted in wins, not losses. The only loss involving Swindon Wildcats isn't listed as 4-2. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"man of the match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
