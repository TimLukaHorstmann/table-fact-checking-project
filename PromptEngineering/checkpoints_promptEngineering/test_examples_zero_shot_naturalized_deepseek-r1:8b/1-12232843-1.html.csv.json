    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the womens double team, kerry ann sheppard and caroline harvey compete in the same year as when jamie van hooijdonk compete in men single.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this to understand what it's asking. It\u2019s about two events happening in the same year: one is a women's doubles competition involving Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey, and the other is a men's singles competition by Jamie Van Hooidonk.\n\nSo, I need to find out if there exists a single season where both of these events occurred. That means checking each row for both mentions and seeing if they are in the same year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different season from 2000 to 2010. Each row has information about various competitions: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nFirst, I need to find where Jamie Van Hooidonk competes in the men's singles. Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 10 (2009): Mens singles: jamie van hooijdonk. So, Jamie competes in 2009.\n\nNext, I need to find Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey competing together in women's doubles. Looking through the rows for any combination of \"kerry ann sheppard\" and \"caroline harvey\" in the women's doubles column.\n\nChecking each row:\n\n- Row 8 (2007): Womens doubles: jo muggeridge rachele phillips.\n- Row 9 (2008): Womens doubles: vikki jones nicole walkley.\n- Row 10 (2009): Womens doubles: kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey. Here, we have both Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey in the women's doubles for 2009.\n\nSo, both Jamie Van Hooidonk in men's singles (2009) and Kerry Ann Sheppard/Caroline Harvey in women's doubles (also 2009) occur in the same year, 2009.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 10, column \"Mens singles\" for Jamie Van Hooidonk.\n- Row 10, column \"Womens doubles\" for Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check if these are indeed in the same row. Yes, both events in row 10 (2009), so they are in the same year. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- Row 10, \"Mens singles\" for Jamie Van Hooidonk.\n- Row 10, \"Womens doubles\" for Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in row 10 where both events occur in the same year. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Mens singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Womens doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main points: one about a women's doubles team composed of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey, and another about Jamie Van Hooijdonk competing in the men's singles.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with rows representing different seasons from 2000 to 2010. Each row lists various categories like men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, etc., along with the participants.\n\nI need to verify if there's a season where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is in the men's singles and simultaneously, in that same season, Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey are part of the women's doubles team. \n\nStarting with Jamie Van Hooijdonk: I'll scan each row to see who has \"mens singles\" as Jamie Van Hooijdonk. Checking row 10 (season 2009), yes, that's where I see \"jamie van hooijdonk\" listed under men's singles.\n\nNow, looking for Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey in the women's doubles column in season 2009. In row 10, under womens doubles, it says \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" So that matches: both Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey are part of the women's doubles team in 2009.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions \"carolina harvey,\" but the table uses \"caroline harvey\" in row 10. Is that a typo? Or maybe it's a different person? Hmm, I need to be precise here. The claim says \"Kerry Ann Sheppard and Carolina Harvey,\" but the table has \"Caroline Harvey.\" If the name is different, then perhaps it's not the same person. But in the context of the problem, I think we should take the names as they are in the table.\n\nWait no, the claim might have a typo, but I shouldn't make that assumption. The table lists \"caroline harvey\" in row 10, while the claim says \"carolina harvey.\" If the names are different, then the claim's part about Carolina Harvey isn't supported by the table. But maybe it's just a typo and they're referring to the same person.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is whether in season 2009, Jamie Van Hooijdonk is playing men's singles and whether the women's doubles team includes Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey. From row 10, both conditions are met: Jamie Van Hooijdonk is indeed in men's singles for 2009, and the women's doubles team that year includes both Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nWait no, looking again at row 10: womens doubles is \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey,\" which aligns with the claim. So yes, all conditions are satisfied in season 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from season 2009 where Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles and Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey form a women's doubles team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"men's singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be zero woman's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that when Jamie Van Hooidonk competes, there are no women's doubles teams competing. So I need to check if in any row where Jamie Van Hooidonk is listed as a men's singles player, the corresponding women's doubles team is empty or non-existent.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a season from 2000 to 2010. Each row lists various categories like mens singles, womens singles, etc., including womens doubles and mixed doubles if applicable.\n\nFirst, I'll need to find all rows where Jamie Van Hooidonk is competing in the mens singles. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 10 (2009) has \"mens singles: jamie van hooijdonk\" and in the same row, \"womens doubles: kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\". So in this case, there is a womens doubles team competing alongside Jamie Van Hooidonk.\n\nSince there's at least one row where he competes and a womens double team exists, that directly contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competes, there are women's doubles teams present.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
