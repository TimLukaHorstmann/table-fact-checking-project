    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the greatest number of lap complete in the table be 40\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what exactly needs to be checked.\n\nFirst, the claim is talking about the \"greatest number of lap complete.\" So I'm looking for the maximum number of laps any driver completed in the race. The term \"complete\" might mean that they finished the race, so their lap count would be how many laps they actually did before finishing or retiring.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: Jim Clark - 40 laps\nRow 2: Jackie Stewart - 40 laps\nRow 3: John Surtees - 40 laps\nRow 4: Denny Hulme - 40 laps\nRow 5: Graham Hill - 39 laps (retired after 1 lap less)\nRow 6: Jo Siffert - 39 laps\nRow 7: Mike Spence - 39 laps\nRow 8: Lorenzo Bandini - 36 laps (accident, so completed 36 laps)\nRow 9: Bob Anderson - 34 laps (fuel system issue)\nRow 10: Bruce McLaren - 23 laps (suspension)\nRow 11: Jo Bonnier - 21 laps (alternator)\nRow 12: Chris Amon - 20 laps (fuel system)\nRow 13: Innes Ireland - 18 laps (gearbox)\nRow 14: Dan Gurney - 16 laps (engine)\nRow 15: Richie Ginther - 9 laps (ignition)\nRow 16: Ronnie Bucknum - 4 laps (ignition)\n\nFrom this, the highest number of laps completed is 40, achieved by Jim Clark (Row 1), Jackie Stewart (Row 2), and John Surtees (Row 3). So the maximum is indeed 40.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are drivers who completed 40 laps.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"the greatest number of lap complete in the table be 40,\" we need to check if any driver completed 40 laps. \n\n- **Relevant Rows**: Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3 all have 40 laps completed.\n- **Conclusion**: Since there are drivers who completed 40 laps, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"2 of the driver go by the name of jo\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and understanding what each column represents.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a driver. The relevant columns for this claim are likely the \"driver\" column because it's specifically about the names of the drivers. So I need to go through each row and check if any two drivers have the name \"jo\".\n\nLet me list out all the drivers from the table:\n\n1. jim clark\n2. jackie stewart\n3. john surtees\n4. denny hulme\n5. graham hill\n6. jo siffert\n7. mike spence\n8. lorenzo bandini\n9. bob anderson\n10. bruce mclaren\n11. jo bonnier\n12. chris amon\n13. innes ireland\n14. dan gurney\n15. richie ginther\n16. ronnie bucknum\n17. jochen rindt\n\nNow, I'll go through each driver's name to see if any are named \"jo\".\n\n- Row 1: jim clark \u2192 No\n- Row 2: jackie stewart \u2192 No\n- Row 3: john surtees \u2192 No\n- Row 4: denny hulme \u2192 No\n- Row 5: graham hill \u2192 No\n- Row 6: jo siffert \u2192 Yes, starts with \"jo\"\n- Row 7: mike spence \u2192 No\n- Row 8: lorenzo bandini \u2192 No\n- Row 9: bob anderson \u2192 No\n- Row 10: bruce mclaren \u2192 No\n- Row 11: jo bonnier \u2192 Yes, starts with \"jo\"\n- Row 12: chris amon \u2192 No\n- Row 13: innes ireland \u2192 No\n- Row 14: dan gurney \u2192 No\n- Row 15: richie ginther \u2192 No\n- Row 16: ronnie bucknum \u2192 No\n- Row 17: jochen rindt \u2192 No\n\nSo, looking at the driver column, I can see that both jo siffert (Row 6) and jo bonnier (Row 11) have names starting with \"jo\". That's two drivers. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I should make sure if the name is exactly \"jo\" or just starts with it. In Row 6, it's \"jo siffert\", which is \"jo\" as a first name. Similarly, in Row 11, it's \"jo bonnier\". So both have \"jo\" as their first name. That means there are two drivers named \"jo\", so the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me first understand what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that the smallest number of laps completed by any driver in the table is 3. So, I should look through each row to find the number of laps each driver has completed and identify the minimum value among them. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: 40 laps\nRow 2: 40 laps\nRow 3: 40 laps\nRow 4: 40 laps\nRow 5: 39 laps\nRow 6: 39 laps\nRow 7: 39 laps\nRow 8: 36 laps\nRow 9: 34 laps\nRow 10: 23 laps\nRow 11: 21 laps\nRow 12: 20 laps\nRow 13: 18 laps\nRow 14: 16 laps\nRow 15: 9 laps\nRow 16: 4 laps\nRow 17: 3 laps\n\nNow, I need to find the minimum number of laps.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instruction. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So, I need to check the 'time / retired' column for any entries that say \"accident\" and see if there's a second occurrence where it mentions \"26.3 secs.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a driver, constructor, laps, time or reason for retirement, and grid position.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Time is 2:41:38.4 \u2013 no accident.\nRow 2: Time is +26.3 secs \u2013 this mentions 26.3, but the cause is listed as \"26.3 secs,\" not explicitly \"accident.\"\nRow 3: Time is +2:33.5 \u2013 no accident.\nRow 4: Time is +2:53.1 \u2013 no accident.\nRow 5: Time is +1 lap \u2013 no accident.\nRow 6: Time is +1 lap \u2013 no accident.\nRow 7: Time is +1 lap \u2013 no accident.\nRow 8: Time is \"accident\" \u2013 that's one occurrence of the cause being an accident.\nRow 9: Time is fuel system \u2013 no.\nRow 10: Suspension \u2013 no.\nRow 11: Alternator \u2013 no.\nRow 12: Fuel system \u2013 no.\nRow 13: Gearbox \u2013 no.\nRow 14: Engine \u2013 no.\nRow 15: Ignition \u2013 no.\nRow 16: Ignition \u2013 no.\nRow 17: Accident \u2013 that's the second occurrence of accident.\n\nSo, there are two instances where \"accident\" is listed as the cause of retirement, in row 8 and row 17. But I need to check if any other rows mention \"26.3 secs.\" Only row 2 has \"+26.3 secs,\" but it's not explicitly saying \"accident.\"\n\nThe claim says \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So, are there two times when accident is listed? Yes, in rows 8 and 17. But does one of them also mention \"+26.3 secs\"? No, only row 2 has that, but it's not an accident.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is saying that the second occurrence (after the first accident) is related to \"+26.3 secs.\" But that doesn't make sense because the time is separate from the cause.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misphrased and meant to say that there are two accidents in the table. In that case, it's true because rows 8 and 17 both have \"accident\" as the retirement cause.\n\nBut looking back at the exact wording of the claim: \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So it might be saying that there are two times where \"accident\" is listed, which is correct. However, the second mention is not related to \"+26.3 secs.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So it's about having two accidents as causes, and the second one perhaps relates to time? No, because the time is separate.\n\nBut according to the data, there are two rows where the cause is accident: row8 and row17. So the claim is true in that aspect.\n\nWait, but the instruction says to look for cells relevant to verify the claim. The claim mentions \"accident be list 2 time,\" so I need to find if any rows have both \"accident\" as the cause and a specific time, which might relate to \"+26.3 secs.\"\n\nLooking again, only row2 has \"+26.3 secs.\" But it's not an accident; that was Jackie Stewart's issue.\n\nSo maybe the claim is trying to say that in two instances where \"accident\" caused retirement, but also one of them had a time of \"+26.3 secs,\" which isn't the case. So actually, no row has both \"accident\" and \"+26.3 secs.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim might be false because there are only two accidents, but none of those have \"+26.3 secs.\" Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the original table's 'time / retired' column sometimes shows reasons like \"accident,\" and other times it shows specific times or issues like fuel system, ignition, etc.\n\nThe claim says: \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So I think it means that there are two rows where the cause is accident, and also in those rows, their 'time / retired' mentions \"+26.3 secs\" twice? But no, only row2 has \"+26.3 secs,\" and that's not an accident.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is false because while there are two accidents (rows8 and17), neither of them have \"+26.3 secs.\" Therefore, the second part of the claim isn't met.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If the claim says \"accident be list 2 time,\" meaning that accident occurs twice as a cause, which is true because rows8 and17 both have accidents. So perhaps the claim is true in that aspect.\n\nBut the original wording of the claim isn't entirely clear. It could mean that there are two instances where the retirement was due to accident and also related to \"+26.3 secs,\" but since only one row has \"+26.3\" and it's not an accident, that part doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe the user is asking whether the table lists \"accident\" as a cause twice, which it does (rows8 and17). Therefore, the claim is true because there are two accidents listed as causes.\n\nBut I think I need to stick strictly to the wording. The exact words: \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So, are there two times where accident is the cause? Yes, rows8 and17. Therefore, the claim is true because there are two instances of accident being listed as causes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that in two separate races, a driver retired twice due to accidents and each time had a specific time, but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer depends on whether \"accident be list 2 time\" refers to having two accident causes or something else. If it's about having two accident causes, then yes. But if it's implying that each of those accidents had a specific time (like \"+26.3 secs\"), which isn't true because only row2 has that, then the claim is false.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the claim is partially true but not entirely accurate because while there are two accidents as causes, only one row mentions a specific time (\"+26.3 secs\"). So overall, the answer might be that the statement is false because there's no instance where both accident and \"+26.3 secs\" apply.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should just confirm the exact wording of the claim. It says: \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" So it's about having two accidents as causes, which is true. The rest might be additional information that's not necessary.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is that the statement is correct because there are two instances where accident is listed as the cause.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"accident be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement\" is **true**. There are two entries in the table where \"accident\" is recorded as the cause of a driver's retirement: \n\n1. Row 8 (Lance Arnold) with the cause listed as \"accident.\"\n2. Row 17 (Bob Wolcott) with the cause also listed as \"accident.\"\n\nEach of these instances reflects an occasion where the race retirement was due to an accident, fulfilling the condition stated in the claim.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the claim \"the greatest number of lap complete in the 1965 French Grand Prix be 39\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's about the maximum number of laps completed in the 1965 French Grand Prix being 39. So I need to find out if any driver in that race completed 39 laps.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a driver and their performance in the race. The relevant columns for this claim are likely \"laps\" and maybe others like \"time / retired\" or \"grid,\" but mostly \"laps.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Driver Jim Clark completed 40 laps.\n2. **Row 2**: Jackie Stewart did 40 laps too.\n3. **Row 3**: John Surtees finished 40 laps as well.\n4. **Row 4**: Denny Hulme also made it to 40 laps.\n5. **Row 5**: Graham Hill completed 39 laps, and he retired after that.\n6. **Row 6**: Jo Siffert also did 39 laps before retiring.\n7. **Row 7**: Mike Spence finished 39 laps as well.\n8. **Row 8**: Lorenzo Bandini only managed 36 laps due to an accident.\n9. **Row 9**: Bob Anderson completed 34 laps with a fuel system issue.\n10. **Row 10**: Bruce McLaren had 23 laps before suspension.\n11. **Row 11**: Jo Bonnier made it to 21 laps.\n12. **Row 12**: Chris Amon was on 20 laps with a fuel system problem.\n13. **Row 13**: Innes Ireland finished 18 laps due to gearbox issues.\n14. **Row 14**: Dan Gurney completed 16 laps with an engine failure.\n15. **Row 15**: Richie Ginther managed 9 laps, and so did Ronnie Bucknum in Row 16.\n\nSo, looking at the \"laps\" column, the highest number mentioned is 40 by Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart, John Surtees, and Denny Hulme. Then Graham Hill, Jo Siffert, and Mike Spence completed 39 laps each.\n\nThe claim says the greatest number of laps completed was 39. However, from the data, I see that some drivers actually did more than 39\u2014they did 40. So the maximum was 40, not 39. Therefore, the claim is false because 40 is higher than 39.\n</think>\n\nTo verify if the greatest number of laps completed in the 1965 French Grand Prix is 39, we examine each driver's lap count:\n\n- **Jim Clark**: 40 laps\n- **Jackie Stewart**: 40 laps\n- **John Surtees**: 40 laps\n- **Denny Hulme**: 40 laps\n- **Graham Hill, Jo Siffert, Mike Spence**: 39 laps each\n\nSince some drivers completed 40 laps, the maximum is higher than 39. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 of the driver go by the name of jim\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing each part.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that there are two drivers in the table whose names are \"Jim.\" So my task is to check how many times \"Jim\" appears as a driver in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Driver is Jim Clark. That's one.\nRow 2: Driver is Jackie Stewart. Not Jim.\nRow 3: John Surtees. No.\nRow 4: Denny Hulme. Nope.\nRow 5: Graham Hill. Not Jim.\nRow 6: Jo Siffert. No.\nRow 7: Mike Spence. Not Jim.\nRow 8: Lorenzo Bandini. No.\nRow 9: Bob Anderson. No.\nRow 10: Bruce McLaren. Not Jim.\nRow 11: Jo Bonnier. No.\nRow 12: Chris Amon. No.\nRow 13: Innes Ireland. Nope.\nRow 14: Dan Gurney. No.\nRow 15: Richie Ginther. No.\nRow 16: Ronnie Bucknum. No.\nRow 17: Jochen Rindt. Not Jim.\n\nFrom this, I can see that only Row 1 has a driver named Jim Clark. So there's only one Jim, not two. Therefore, the claim is saying there are two Jims when in reality there's just one. That would make the claim FALSE.\n\nNow, to check if any cells are relevant for verification. The relevant cells should be those that list drivers whose names might be \"Jim.\" In this case, only Row 1 has a driver named Jim Clark, so I need to mark that row as relevant.\n\nI think that's all. Only one occurrence of \"Jim,\" so the claim is definitely FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the least number of lap complete in the 1965 french grand prix be 4",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the least number of lap complete in the 1965 french grand prix be 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating that in the 1965 French Grand Prix, the minimum number of laps completed by any driver was 4. So I need to look through the table for the driver(s) who completed only 4 laps and confirm if such a driver exists.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different driver along with their constructor, number of laps, time or reason for retirement, and grid position. My main focus here is on the \"laps\" column because that's what directly relates to the number of laps completed.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Jim Clark completed 40 laps.\n2. **Row 2**: Jackie Stewart completed 40 laps.\n3. **Row 3**: John Surtees finished with 40 laps.\n4. **Row 4**: Denny Hulme also did 40 laps.\n5. **Row 5**: Graham Hill completed 39 laps.\n6. **Row 6**: Jo Siffert had 39 laps.\n7. **Row 7**: Mike Spence also did 39 laps.\n8. **Row 8**: Lorenzo Bandini managed 36 laps before an accident.\n9. **Row 9**: Bob Anderson finished with 34 laps due to fuel issues.\n10. **Row 10**: Bruce McLaren completed only 23 laps because of suspension problems.\n11. **Row 11**: Jo Bonnier had 21 laps with an alternator issue.\n12. **Row 12**: Chris Amon managed 20 laps, his car had a fuel system problem.\n13. **Row 13**: Innes Ireland finished 18 laps due to a gearbox failure.\n14. **Row 14**: Dan Gurney completed 16 laps, engine trouble.\n15. **Row 15**: Richie Ginther did 9 laps because of ignition issues.\n16. **Row 16**: Ronnie Bucknum only managed 4 laps, also due to ignition problems.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 16, Ronnie Bucknum is listed as having completed 4 laps. That's exactly what the claim says\u2014the least number of laps completed was 4. So that seems to support the claim.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are any drivers with fewer than 4 laps. Looking through all the rows, the lowest number before 4 would be 3 or less. Let me check each driver:\n\n- Jim Clark:40\n- Jackie Stewart:40\n- John Surtees:40\n- Denny Hulme:40\n- Graham Hill:39\n- Jo Siffert:39\n- Mike Spence:39\n- Lorenzo Bandini:36\n- Bob Anderson:34\n- Bruce McLaren:23\n- Jo Bonnier:21\n- Chris Amon:20\n- Innes Ireland:18\n- Dan Gurney:16\n- Richie Ginther:9\n- Ronnie Bucknum:4\n\nSo the lowest is indeed 4 laps by Ronnie Bucknum. Therefore, the claim that the least number of laps completed was 4 is TRUE.\n\nI should also consider if any other driver might have even fewer laps, but from the data, no one has less than 4. The next lowest after 4 would be Richie Ginther with 9 laps, which is higher than 4. So there's no contradiction here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Ronnie Bucknum completing exactly 4 laps.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"laps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that \"lotus - climax\" appears more times as a constructor in the table than any other constructor. To verify this, I need to count how many times each constructor appears and see if \"lotus - climax\" has the highest frequency.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a driver with details like their name, constructor, laps, time or reason for retirement, and grid position. My focus is on the \"constructor\" column. So I need to list out all the constructors in the table.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Constructor - lotus - climax\n2. Row 2: Constructor - brm\n3. Row 3: Constructor - ferrari\n4. Row 4: Constructor - brabham - climax\n5. Row 5: Constructor - brm\n6. Row 6: Constructor - brabham - brm\n7. Row 7: Constructor - lotus - climax\n8. Row 8: Constructor - ferrari\n9. Row 9: Constructor - brabham - climax\n10. Row 10: Constructor - cooper - climax\n11. Row 11: Constructor - brabham - climax\n12. Row 12: Constructor - lotus - brm\n13. Row 13: Constructor - lotus - brm\n14. Row 14: Constructor - brabham - climax\n15. Row 15: Constructor - honda\n16. Row 16: Constructor - honda\n17. Row 17: Constructor - cooper - climax\n\nNow, I'll count the occurrences for each constructor.\n\nStarting with \"lotus - climax\":\n- Row 1: yes (1)\n- Row 7: yes (2)\nSo that's two times.\n\nNext, \"brm\":\n- Row 2: yes\n- Row 5: yes\nThat's two times.\n\n\"ferrari\":\n- Row 3: yes\n- Row 8: yes\nTwo times as well.\n\n\"brabham - climax\":\n- Row 4: yes (1)\n- Row 9: yes (2)\n- Row 11: yes (3)\nSo that's three times.\n\n\"cooper - climax\":\n- Row 10: yes\n- Row 17: yes\nTwo times.\n\n\"honda\":\n- Row 15: yes\n- Row 16: yes\nTwo times.\n\n\"brabham - brm\":\n- Only in Row 6: yes (1)\n\n\"lotus - brm\":\n- Row 12: yes\n- Row 13: yes\nSo two times.\n\nNow, compiling the counts:\n- lotus - climax: 2\n- brm: 2\n- ferrari: 2\n- brabham - climax: 3\n- cooper - climax: 2\n- honda: 2\n- brabham - brm: 1\n- lotus - brm: 2\n\nFrom this, \"brabham - climax\" appears three times, which is more than the others. Therefore, it's not \"lotus - climax\" that appears the most frequently\u2014it's actually \"brabham - climax.\"\n\nSo the claim that \"lotus - climax\" is the most frequent constructor in the table is false.\n</think>\n\nThe constructor \"brabham - climax\" appears three times, which is more than any other constructor.

The claim states: \"suspension be list 2 time in the table as the cause of the race retirement.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems to suggest that there are two instances where suspension caused a driver to retire from the race, and this information should be present in the table.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row represents a driver with details like laps, time retired, constructor, grid position, etc. The columns relevant here would likely be \"time / retired\" since that's where the cause of retirement is indicated.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for mentions of 'suspension' as the cause. \n\nStarting from Row 1: Jim Clark - no mention of suspension.\nRow 2: Jackie Stewart - no, he retired due to +26.3 secs.\nRow 3: John Surtees - retired due to +2:33.5.\nRow 4: Denny Hulme - retired due to +2:53.1.\nRow 5: Graham Hill - +1 lap.\nRow 6: Jo Siffert - +1 lap.\nRow 7: Mike Spence - +1 lap.\nRow 8: Lorenzo Bandini - accident.\nRow 9: Bob Anderson - fuel system.\nRow 10: Bruce McLaren - suspension.
