The claim is: \"when the home team score 12.15 (87), the game be hold at moorabbin oval.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the data. Each row represents a different match with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions two specific things: the home team's score is 12.15 (87), and the game was held at Moorabbin Oval. So I need to check if any row in the table matches both of these conditions.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110). Not matching the score, so skip.\nRow 2: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33). No match.\nRow 3: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74). Not 12.15.\nRow 4: St Kilda is the home team here. Their score is 12.15 (87), which matches the first part of the claim. Now check where this game was held. The venue for Row 4 is Moorabbin Oval, which matches the second condition.\n\nSo Row 4 has both the required conditions: home team scored 12.15 (87) and the game was at Moorabbin Oval.\n\nNow, to make sure there are no other rows that might match, I'll check the remaining rows.\nRow 5: Richmond scored 5.10 (40).

The rows are from Row 1 to Row 6. The columns relevant here are \"home team,\" \"away team,\" \"home team score,\" \"away team score,\" \"venue,\" and \"crowd.\" But for this claim, I'm mainly concerned with the home team being St Kilda, their score, and the venue.\n\nStarting with the home team: I need to see if there's a row where the home team is St Kilda. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Hawthorn\n- Row 2: Collingwood\n- Row 3: South Melbourne\n- Row 4: St Kilda\n- Row 5: Richmond\n- Row 6: Geelong\n\nYes, Row 4 has St Kilda as the home team. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking their score. The claim states that St Kilda scored 12.15 (87). Looking at Row 4's \"home team score\" column, it says 12.15 (87). That's a direct match.\n\nNow, checking the venue. The claim mentions Moorabbin Oval. In Row 4, the venue is listed as Moorabbin Oval. So that's correct too.\n\nPutting it all together: All aspects of the claim are satisfied by Row 4 in the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified through checking each aspect against the corresponding row and columns in the table.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a crowd size of 7912 attending Melbourne's away game. So I need to find in the table if there's an entry where Melbourne is the away team and the crowd was 7912.\n\nLooking at the table structure: Each row has home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The dates are all August 29, 1981, so it's a single day of matches.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check for Melbourne as the away team with a crowd of 7912.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Hawthorn, away is Melbourne, crowd 7912. That seems to match the claim exactly because Melbourne is the away team and the crowd is 7912. So this cell directly supports the claim.\n\nBut I should also check other rows to ensure there's no other instance that might affect the outcome. Let me look at Row 6: Home team Geelong, away Essendon. Crowd is 75221, which doesn't match. The rest of the rows don't have Melbourne as the away team either.\n\nSo only Row 1 has Melbourne as the away team with a crowd of 7912.

The claim is: \"when the away team score 15.17 (107) the home team scored10.14 (74)\". \n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the data given. There's a table with six rows, each representing a game between a home and an away team. Each row has several pieces of information: home team, their score in the format x.y (z), away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim seems to be about a specific situation where one particular away team's score is 15.17 (107) and the corresponding home team's score is 10.14 (74). So I need to check if in any row of the table, the away team has scored 15.17 (107) and the home team has scored 10.14 (74).\n\nLet me look at each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110), away team Melbourne scored 8.9 (57). Neither of these match the scores mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 2: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33) as home, Fitzroy as away scored 8.11 (59). Still not matching.\n\nRow 3: Home South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74), away North Melbourne scored 15.17 (107). Wait a minute, here the away team's score is exactly 15.17 (107) and the home team's score is 10.14 (74). That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo that means the claim is true because in Row 3 of the table, when the away team scored 15.17 (107), the home team indeed scored 10.14 (74).\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows with these scores to ensure it's not a duplicate or another instance, but from the data provided, only Row 3 matches this condition.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be Row 3, specifically the columns for home team score and away team score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because in Row 3, the away team's score of 15.17 (107) corresponds to a home team score of 10.14 (74). \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"10.14 (74) be the team 's score when the away team score 15.17 (107)\". So, the claim is asserting that there's a game where one of the teams scored 10 goals and 14 behinds, totaling 74 points, while the opposing team scored 15 goals and 17 behinds, totaling 107 points.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to see if such a game exists. The table has six rows, each representing a match with details like home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd size, and date. Each row lists two team scores, one for the home team and one for the away team.\n\nI need to check each row's away and home team scores against the claim. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110), away team Melbourne scored 8.9 (57). Neither of these matches the claim's numbers.\nRow 2: Collingwood (home) scored 4.9 (33), Fitzroy (away) scored 8.11 (59). Again, no match.\nRow 3: South Melbourne (home) scored 10.14 (74), North Melbourne (away) scored 15.17 (107). Wait a minute, here we have the home team scoring 10.14 (74) and the away team scoring 15.17 (107). That exactly matches the claim.\n\nSo, in Row 3, the home team's score is 10.14 (74), which is one of the teams in the game, and the away team has 15.17 (107). The wording in the claim is a bit confusing because it uses \"the team\" without specifying if it's the home or away. However, since the claim mentions that the away team scored 15.17 (107), which aligns perfectly with Row 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are row_index 3 for both scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data in Row 3 where the home team's score is 10.14 (74) and the away team's score is 15.17 (107).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"when the away team score 15.17 (107) the home team be north melbourne.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. The key elements are the away team's score and the corresponding home team's identity. So, I should look through the table for any row where the away team scored exactly 15.17, which equates to 107 points. Then, check if in that same row, the home team is listed as North Melbourne.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a game: home team, their score, away team, the away team's score, venue, crowd size, and date. The claim specifically refers to the away team's score being 15.17 (107). \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Away team is Melbourne with 8.9 (57 points). Not matching.\nRow 2: Away team is Fitzroy with 8.11 (59 points). Not matching.\nRow 3: Away team is North Melbourne with 15.17 (107 points). This seems to match the claim's away team score. Now, check the home team in this row. The home team here is South Melbourne. Wait, that doesn't match because the claim says the home team should be North Melbourne.\n\nHmm, so there's a mismatch. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other rows. Row 4: Away team Footscray scored 5.8 (38). No. Row 5: Carlton scored 9.13 (67). No. Row 6: Essendon scored 6.11 (47). No.\n\nSo, the only row where the away team's score is exactly 15.17 (107) is Row 3. However, in that same row, the home team is South Melbourne, not North Melbourne as stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true because the home team listed for that game isn't North Melbourne.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check Row 3: Home team is indeed South Melbourne and away team is North Melbourne with the score of 15.17 (107). So yes, when the away team scored 15.17, the home team was South Melbourne, not North Melbourne. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the away team scores 15.17 (107), the home team is North Melbourne. However, upon reviewing the table, we find that on August 29, 1981, the away team scored 15.17 against South Melbourne at Lake Oval, not North Melbourne.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Away Team Score**: The claim specifies an away team score of 15.17 (107 points).\n2. **Locate Rows with this Score**: Check each row to find where the away team scored exactly 15.17.\n3. **Row 3 Matches the Score**: In Row 3, the away team is North Melbourne with a score of 15.17 (107).\n4. **Check Home Team in That Row**: The home team for that game is South Melbourne, not North Melbourne.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since the home team isn't North Melbourne when the away team scored 15.17, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The columns seem to be: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe claim specifically refers to an away team's score of 15.17 (107). I need to find this exact score in the table and check whether it's associated with the McGraw Hambden venue.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20, but that's the home side. The away team Melbourne scored 8.9.\nRow 2: Collingwood (home) scored 4.9, Fitzroy (away) scored 8.11.\nRow 3: South Melbourne scored 10.14, North Melbourne scored 15.17 (107). Wait, that's an away team score of 15.17 (107) at Lake Oval.\nRow 4: St Kilda scored 12.15, Footscray scored 5.8.\nRow 5: Richmond scored 5.10, Carlton scored 9.13 (67).\nRow 6: Geelong scored 7.13, Essendon scored 6.11.\n\nFrom this, the only away team that scored 15.17 is North Melbourne in Row 3. Now, checking where that game took place\u2014venue is Lake Oval, not McGraw Hambden (mcg).\n\nSo, the claim says the score was at mcg, but it actually happened at Lake Oval. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNext, I need to find which cells are relevant to verify this. The claim involves two pieces of information: the away team's score and the venue.\n\nThe away team score is 15.17 (107), which is in Row 3 under \"away team score.\" So row_index is 2 (since rows start at 0) and column_name is \"away team score.\"\n\nThe venue is mcg, so I need to check the \"venue\" column in Row 3, which is at row_index 2 and column_name \"venue.\"\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n\nI think that's it.

The user is referring to a specific game where the home team scored 12.15 (87). They're also specifying that the venue was McG. My task is to check if such a game exists in the provided table and at which row it appears.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows. Each row has information about the home team, their score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim mentions the home team's score as 12.15 (87), so my first step is to scan each row for a home team with this exact score.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Hawthorn, score 15.20 (110). That's not 12.15.\nRow 2: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33). Not matching.\nRow 3: South Melbourne with 10.14 (74). Nope.\nRow 4: St Kilda scored 12.15 (87).

Yes, in row 4, home team St Kilda scored 12.15 (87), and the venue is Moorabbin Oval, not McG.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"lake oval be the venue of the game that the home team score 15.20 (110)\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's making two points:\n\n1. Lake Oval is the venue where the game took place.\n2. At that same game, the home team scored 15.20 (110).\n\nI need to check both parts against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date. The rows are numbered from 0 to 5.\n\nStarting with the second part of the claim: the home team scored 15.20 (110). So I need to find any row where the home team's score is exactly that. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team Hawthorn scored 15.20, which is 110 points. That matches.\nRow 2: Collingwood scored 4.9 (33), no match.\nRow 3: South Melbourne scored 10.14 (74), no match.\nRow 4: St Kilda scored 12.15 (87), nope.\nRow 5: Richmond scored 5.10 (40), not matching.\nRow 6: Geelong scored 7.13 (55), so no.\n\nSo only Row 1 has the home team's score as 15.20 (110). Now, I need to check if Lake Oval is the venue for that game. Looking at Row 1, the venue is Princes Park. Wait, but the claim says Lake Oval. That doesn't match. So even though the score matches in Row 1, the venue doesn't.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check the venues for each row. Let me list them again:\n\nRow 1: Princes Park\nRow 2: Victoria Park\nRow 3: Lake Oval\nRow 4: Moorabbin Oval\nRow 5: MCG\nRow 6: VFL Park\n\nSo Row 3 is Lake Oval, but the home team there is South Melbourne vs. North Melbourne, with scores 10.14 (74) and 15.17 (107). The score in Row 1 is 15.20 (110), so that's not matching to Row 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: venue and score. I found a row where the score matches, but it's at Princes Park, not Lake Oval. So the venue part doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is false because even though there is a game with 15.20 (110), it's not held at Lake Oval.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see: in Row 1, home team Hawthorn scored 15.20 (110). The venue was Princes Park, which is correct. So the claim says Lake Oval, but that's not where that game was played. Therefore, both conditions are not met. So the answer should be false.\n\nWait again, maybe I confused rows. Let me check Row 3: South Melbourne at Lake Oval scored 10.14 (74). That doesn't match the score part of the claim either because it's 74 points, which is less than 110.\n\nSo in no row does the home team have both the venue as Lake Oval and a score of 15.20 (110). Therefore, the claim is false because both conditions must be met, and they aren't found together in any single row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Lake Oval was the venue where the home team scored 15.20 (110). Checking each row, only Row 1 has the correct score but at Princes Park. Lake Oval isn't listed as a venue for that score.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n  ]\n}",
