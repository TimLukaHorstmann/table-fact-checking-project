    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the number of student enrol at st andrew university be 600.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate St Andrew University in the table. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Anderson University\nRow 2: Appalachian State University\nRow 3: Catawba College\nRow 4: Coker College\nRow 5: East Carolina University\nRow 6: Elon University\nRow 7: Guilford College\nRow 8: High Point University\nRow 9: Lenoir-Rhyne University\nRow 10: Longwood University\nRow 11: Mars Hill College\nRow 12: Newberry College\nRow 13: University of North Carolina at Pembroke\nRow 14: Presbyterian College\nRow 15: Queens University of Charlotte\nRow 16: St Andrews University\nAh, here it is. Row 16 is about St Andrew's University.\n\nNow, I need to find the enrollment number for this institution. Looking at the columns in each row, the relevant column for enrollment is \"enrollment.\" \n\nSo, for Row 16, the columns are:\n- institution: st andrews university\n- location: laurinburg , north carolina\n- founded: 1958\n- type: private\n- enrollment: 600\n- nickname: knights\n- joined: 1988\n- left: 2012\n- current conference: aac (naia)\n\nWait, the enrollment number is directly listed as 600. So according to this row, St Andrew's University has an enrollment of exactly 600 students.\n\nThe claim says that the number of student enrol at St Andrews is 600. Since the table shows enrollment as 600 for that institution, the claim seems to be accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down what the claim says and then check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim is: \"the college team whose nickname be blue hose join the conference in the year 1965.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse this out. The claim mentions a college team with the nickname \"blue hose\" that joined a conference in 1965.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find any institution with the nickname \"blue hose.\" Then, check when they joined the conference and whether it was in 1965.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Nickname is Trojans.\nRow 2: Mountaineers.\nRow 3: Indians.\nRow 4: Cobras.\nRow 5: Pirates.\nRow 6: Phoenix.\nRow 7: Quakers.\nRow 8: Panthers.\nRow 9: Bears.\nRow 10: Lancers.\nRow 11: Lions.\nRow 12: Wolves.\nRow 13: Braves.\nRow 14: Blue Hose. Oh, here we go. This is Presbyterian College in Clinton, SC, founded in 1880, private, etc. Their nickname is \"blue hose,\" and they joined the conference in 1965.\n\nWait, looking at Row 14's 'joined' column: it says 1965. So yes, they joined the conference in that year.\n\nSo the claim matches this row. The team with nickname blue hose (Presbyterian College) did join the conference in 1965.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"nickname\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about a college conference is true or false. The claim says: \"the conference for the college that left in 1974 and again in 1989 be the AAC (NAIA).\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim carefully. It mentions a college that left its conference in both 1974 and 1989, and it's asserting that this college's current conference is the AAC, which is part of NAIA.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different institution with various attributes like location, founding year, type (public or private), enrollment, nickname, joining and leaving years of their previous conferences, and their current conference.\n\nI need to identify which colleges left their conference in both 1974 and 1989. I'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Anderson University left in 2010.\n- Row 2: Appalachian State left in 1967.\n- Row 3: Catawba College left in 1989 but not mentioned for 1974.\n- Row 4: Coker College left in 2013.\n- Row 5: East Carolina University left in 1962.\n- Row 6: Elon University left in 1989.\n- Row 7: Guilford College left in 1988.\n- Row 8: High Point University left in 1997.\n- Row 9: Lenoir-Rhyne University has multiple join and leave dates: joined in 1930, left in 1974 and 1985, and again in 1989.\nWait, the data says for Row 9: joined: 1930, left: 1974, 1989. Wait, no, looking back: It says \"joined: 1930 , 1985, left: 1974 , 1989\". So Lenoir-Rhyne left in both 1974 and 1989. That's the first college that fits.\n\nRow 10: Longwood University left in 2003.\nRow 11: Mars Hill College left in 1975.\nRow 12: Newberry College left in 1972.\nRow 13: UNC Pembroke left in 1992.\nRow 14: Presbyterian College left in 1972.\nRow 15: Queens University left in 2013.\nRow 16: St. Andrews left in 2012.\nRow 17: Western Carolina left in 1976.\n\nSo the only college that left in both 1974 and 1989 is Lenoir-Rhyne University, which is Row 9.\n\nNow, I need to check what conference Lenoir-Rhyne is currently in. Looking at Row 9's \"current conference\" column: it says \"sac\". So the current conference is SAC (South Atlantic Conference), not AAC (which is part of NAIA).\n\nThe claim states that this college's conference is AAC (NAIA). But according to the table, Lenoir-Rhyne is in SAC. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE\". The relevant cells are row 9 and column \"current conference\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"current conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim. The claim mentions three main things about the college:\n\n1. Nickname: Blue Hose\n2. Joined in 1972\n3. Member of SAC\n\nI need to find a college from the table that matches all these criteria.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one and see if any match.\n\nRow 1: Anderson University - nickname is Trojans, so no.\nRow 2: Appalachian State University - nickname is Mountaineers, no.\nRow 3: Catawba College - nickname Indians, nope.\nRow 4: Coker College - nickname Cobras, not Blue Hose.\nRow 5: East Carolina University - Pirates, no.\nRow 6: Elon University - Phoenix, nope.\nRow 7: Guilford College - Quakers, no.\nRow 8: High Point University - Panthers, no.\nRow 9: Lenoir-Rhyne University - Bears, not Blue Hose.\nRow 10: Longwood University - Lancers, nope.\nRow 11: Mars Hill College - Lions, no.\nRow 12: Newberry College - Wolves, nope.\nRow 13: UNC Pembroke - Braves, not matching.\nRow 14: Presbyterian College - Blue Hose. Wait, this matches the nickname. Let me check the joined and conference.\n\nPresbyterian College's founded in 1880, type is private, enrollment 1300, nickname Blue Hose. Joined: 1965, left: 1972, current conference: Big South (Division I). \n\nThe claim says the college joined in 1972 and is a member of SAC. Wait, Presbyterian joined in 1965 and left in 1972. Also, their current conference is Big South, not SAC. So they were members of Big South during 1965-1972.\n\nLooking at other rows:\n\nRow 15: Queens University - Royals, nope.\nRow 16: St Andrews - Knights, no.\nRow 17: Western Carolina - Catamounts, no.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check Row 14 again. It says joined 1965, left 1972, so it was in SAC from 1965-1972? Or did they join another conference after leaving?\n\nLooking at the table, Presbyterian College's current conference is Big South (Division I). So they are not part of SAC anymore.\n\nSo none of the colleges have the nickname Blue Hose and joined in 1972 as a member of SAC. Wait, but let me see if any other college matches these criteria.\n\nWait, maybe another college? Let me check Row 14 again: Presbyterian College, Blue Hose, joined 1965, left 1972. So their membership ended in 1972. If the claim says they \"join in 1972\", that's incorrect because they actually joined in 1965 and left in 1972.\n\nWait, could it be a typo? Maybe the college joined in 1972 as a member of SAC. Let me see if any other colleges have Blue Hose nickname and joined in 1972.\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nRow 14: Presbyterian College - Blue Hose, joined 1965, left 1972. So they were in SAC until 1972.\n\nRow 9: Lenoir-Rhyne University - Bears, not Blue Hose.\n\nIs there another college with Blue Hose? Let me check Row 16: St Andrews - Knights, nope. No others mentioned with Blue Hose.\n\nSo the only college with Blue Hose is Presbyterian College. But they joined in 1965 and left in 1972. The claim says they joined in 1972, which is incorrect. Also, their current conference is Big South, not SAC.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect on both points: the joining year and the membership in SAC.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the college that has Blue Hose as a nickname and joined SAC in 1972 is Presbyterian College, but according to the table, they left SAC in 1972, so they were no longer members by then. So they couldn't have joined in 1972 as a member of SAC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another college with Blue Hose joined SAC in 1972. But looking at the table, only Presbyterian has Blue Hose, and their joining was in 1965.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because the college didn't join in 1972 but in 1965, and it's not a member of SAC anymore.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac\" is false. Presbyterian College has the Blue Hose nickname but joined SAC in 1965, not 1972, and left the conference in 1972. Therefore, no college satisfies all the criteria stated in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Nickname\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Join Year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
