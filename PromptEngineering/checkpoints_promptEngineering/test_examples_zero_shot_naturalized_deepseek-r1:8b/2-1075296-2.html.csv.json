    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"Michael Schumacher be the driver whose constructor be Ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retire of 1:32:35.101.\"\n\nHmm, I think the key points here are that Michael Schumacher is a driver, his constructor is Ferrari, and he has an average grid number of 1 with a specific retirement time.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the relevant rows for Michael Schumacher and check each condition.\n\nFirst, let's locate Michael Schumacher in the table. Scanning through the 'driver' column:\n\nRow 1: driver: michael schumacher. That's him. So his row index is 0 (since it starts at 0). \n\nNow, checking his constructor: It says 'ferrari', so that matches the second part of the claim.\n\nNext, let's look for his average grid number. Wait, the term \"average\" isn't in the table; instead, each driver has a single grid number. So maybe the claim is saying he started from grid 1? Let me check: In Row 1, under 'grid', it says 1. So that part matches.\n\nThen, the time / retired column for Michael Schumacher (row 0) is '1:32:35.101'. That's exactly what the claim mentions.\n\nPutting this together, all conditions in the claim are met by the data in row 1 of the table. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
