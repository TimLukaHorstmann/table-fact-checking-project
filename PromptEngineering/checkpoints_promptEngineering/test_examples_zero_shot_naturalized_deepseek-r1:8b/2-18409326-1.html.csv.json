Let me break down what's needed here.\n\nThe claim says: \"chsu - fm , own by bell media , have a frequency of 00 99.9 fm\"\n\nFirst, let's identify each part of the claim and see if it matches the data in the table.\n\n1. **Station Name**: The claim mentions \"chsu - fm\". Looking at the table, I should search for this call sign. Scanning through each row:\n\n   - Row 6: call sign is chsu - fm.\n   \n   So that's a match; the station exists in the table as Row 6.\n\n2. **Owner**: The claim states \"own by bell media\". Checking the owner column for chsu - fm, which is Row 6, the owner is listed as bell media. That matches too.\n\n3. **Frequency**: The claim says \"have a frequency of 00 99.9 fm\". I need to check if this station's frequency in the table is 00 99.9 fm. Looking at Row 6:\n\n   - Frequency: 00 96.3 fm.\n   \n   Wait, that doesn't match 00 99.9 fm. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nSo, the frequency part of the claim doesn't align with the actual data in the table. The station chsu - fm has a frequency of 00 96.3 fm, not 00 99.9 fm as claimed.\n\nTherefore, even though two parts of the claim (station name and owner) are correct, the frequency is incorrect. Since the claim includes this incorrect frequency, it makes the entire statement false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the station with a frequency of 00 96.3 fm play classic rock.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of the claim means. The key elements are the frequency and the format (classic rock) associated with that frequency.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: frequency 1150 am - doesn't match.\nRow 2: 00 88.9 fm - nope.\nRow 3: 00 89.7 fm - no.\nRow 4: 00 90.5 fm - not this one either.\nRow 5: 00 96.3 fm - this seems promising as it's the frequency in question.\nRow 6: 99.9 fm - nope.\nRow 7: 101.5 fm - not matching.\nRow 8: 103.1 fm - different.\nRow 9: 103.9 fm - no.\nRow 10: 104.7 fm - doesn't match.\n\nSo, the frequency in question is row 5.

The claim is: \"bell media own the radio station with frequency 0 101.5 fm.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for a row in the table where the frequency matches 0 101.5 fm. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 1: 1150 am - no.\nRow 2: 00 88.9 fm - no.\nRow 3: 00 89.7 fm - no.\nRow 4: 00 90.5 fm - no.\nRow 5: 00 96.3 fm - no.\nRow 6: 00 99.9 fm - no.\nRow 7: 0 101.5 fm - yes, this is the one.\n\nSo, row 7 has the frequency 0 101.5 fm. Now, I need to check who owns that station. Looking at the 'owner' column for row 7: it's bell media. That matches the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other rows with the same frequency to avoid confusion. Let me quickly scan again:\n\nRows 1-6 have frequencies starting with \"00\" or specific am times. Rows 7 and onwards start with \"0\". Row 7 is 0 101.5 fm, row 8 is 0 103.1 fm, row 9: 0 103.9 fm, row10:0 104.7fm. So only row7 matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim says bell media owns it, and according to row7, that's correct.

My task is to find out if there's a station that matches both the frequency of 1150 AM and uses \"am 1150\" as its branding.\n\nStarting with Row 1: The frequency listed here is 1150 AM, which exactly matches what the claim is referring to. The call sign is 'ckfr,' and the branding is indeed \"am 1150.\" So this row seems directly relevant because it has both the correct frequency and the specified branding.\n\nI should also check other rows to see if any other station might have a different frequency but somehow relates, but given the claim's specifics, only Row 1 fits.

The claim is: \"bell media's call sign be chsu - fm on the frequency 99.9 fm.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means and then check the table to see if it matches.\n\nThe claim has two main parts:\n1. Bell Media's call sign is \"chsu - fm.\"\n2. This station operates on 99.9 fm.\n\nSo I need to look for a row in the table where the owner is Bell Media, the call sign is chsu - fm, and the frequency is 99.9 fm.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Owner is Astral Media \u2013 not Bell Media. So skip.\nRow 2: Owner is Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) \u2013 not Bell Media. Skip.\nRow 3: CBC again. Skip.\nRow 4: CBC. Skip.\nRow 5: Owner is Sun Country Cablevision \u2013 not Bell Media. Skip.\nRow 6: Owner is Bell Media. Let's check this one. Call sign here is chsu - fm and frequency is 99.9 fm.\n\nSo, that matches exactly what the claim says. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: The row index for Row 6 is 5 (since it starts from 0), but wait, no, in the table given, the rows are numbered from 1 to 10. So Row 6 would correspond to index 5 in the list, but in the instructions, they might be considering row indices as starting from 0 or 1. Wait, looking back, the user provided a table with 10 rows, each labeled from Row 1 to Row 10. But when extracting relevant cells, it's based on the actual data, not their position.\n\nWait no, actually, in the table, each row is numbered starting from Row 1 to Row 10. So for example, Row 1: frequency: 1150 am... up to Row 10: cklz - fm...\n\nSo when looking at Row 6: it's the sixth entry in the table, so its row index would be 5 if we start counting from 0, but I think the user expects row_index as per their position. So Row 1 is row_index 0? Or maybe row_index corresponds to the actual position starting from 1?\n\nWait no, looking at the example given in the instructions:\n\nThe example shows:\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Employees\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nSo row_index starts from 0. Therefore, Row 1 in the table would be row_index 0, Row 2 is row_index 1, etc.\n\nWait no, that can't be because in the example, it's showing rows 0 and 1 as Revenue and Employees, but in reality, the table has more columns. So perhaps row_index corresponds to their actual position. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just check the relevant cells based on the data.\n\nIn Row 6: frequency is 99.9 fm, call sign chsu - fm, owner Bell Media. So this matches the claim exactly. Therefore, it's TRUE and the relevant_cells would be the row index where this occurs.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 6 is the sixth entry, so if we're using 0-based indexing, row_index would be 5 (since first row is 0). Wait no: actually, in the table provided by the user, it's:\n\nRow 1: ... \nRow 2: ...\n...\nRow 10: ...\n\nBut when processing, each row has a row index starting from 0. So Row 6 in the table would correspond to row_index 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rows are 1-based. Let me check the instruction again.\n\nIn the instructions, it says to find relevant cells with row_index (int) and column_name. The example shows row_index: 0,1. So probably, the first row is row index 0, second 1, etc., up to row index 9 for the tenth row.\n\nSo in Row 6 of the table (which is the sixth entry), the row index would be 5 (since it's the sixth item, starting from 0).\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Bell Media: owner column.\n- For call sign: call sign column.\n- For frequency: frequency column.\n\nWait no, the claim refers to both the call sign and the frequency. So we need to check which columns those correspond to.\n\nLooking back at the table structure: each row has several fields like frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner. So the relevant cells are:\n\n1. Owner is Bell Media \u2013 so that's one cell.\n2. Call sign is chsu - fm \u2013 another cell.\n3. Frequency is 99.9 fm \u2013 third cell.\n\nWait, but in the table, for Row 6, all three columns (owner, call sign, frequency) match the claim. Therefore, we need to list each of these as relevant cells.\n\nSo, row index would be 5 (since Row 6 is index 5). The columns are:\n\n- owner: Bell Media\n- call_sign: chsu - fm\n- frequency: 99.9 fm\n\nWait no, the table in the user's message shows for each row, the fields as:\n\nfrequency: ...,\ncall sign: ...,\nbranding: ...,\nformat: ...,\nowner: ...\n\nSo in the data, for Row 6 (index 5), the call sign is chsu - fm, frequency is 99.9 fm, and owner is Bell Media.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index:5, column_name:\"call sign\"\n- row_index:5, column_name:\"frequency\"\n- row_index:5, column_name:\"owner\"\n\nWait, but the user's example in instructions shows that each relevant cell is an object with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\". So for this case, we have three relevant cells.\n\nSo to sum up, the claim is TRUE because there's a match in all aspects. The relevant cells are the ones corresponding to owner, call sign, and frequency for Row 6 (index 5).\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}]}",

So this cell is definitely relevant because it directly provides the call sign in question.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows that might also be owners of Astral Media to see if there's another station with a different call sign. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 2: Owner is Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\n- Row 3: Same owner as Row 2\n- Row 4: Same as Row 2\n- Row 5: Owner is Sun Country Cablevision\n- Rows 6,7,8,9,10: Owners are Bell Media and Vista Broadcast Group.\n\nSo only Row 1 has Astral Media.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"vista broadcast group play all type of hit.\" The key here is understanding what this means. It seems to suggest that Vista Broadcast Group offers a variety of different types of hits in their radio programming. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different radio station with various attributes like call sign, frequency, branding, format, and owner. The owner for Row 9 is Vista Broadcast Group.\n\nSo, I need to find out if any relevant information about what types of music or content they play is present in the table for this specific station. \n\nLooking at Row 9: frequency is 0 103.9 fm, call sign: cjui - fm, branding: 103.9 the juice, format: adult hits, owner: vista broadcast group.\n\nThe format here is \"adult hits,\" which typically refers to a mix of hit songs from various genres aimed at adults. This suggests that they do play a type of hit music, but does this mean all types? The claim says \"all types,\" so I need to check if there's any indication that Vista Broadcast Group plays a diverse range of genres or hits.\n\nBut looking through the table, each station has its own format: news/talk, public news/talk, public music, classic rock, contemporary hits, adult contemporary, hot adult contemporary, and active rock. None of these suggest an exhaustive list of hit types. Each station targets a specific audience with a particular genre or format.\n\nSince Vista Broadcast Group owns only one station listed in the table (Row 9), I can't infer that they play all types of hits based on this data. The claim might be overreaching, stating that they play every possible type of hit, which isn't supported by the information given.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we check the relevant rows for Vista Broadcast Group.\n\n1. **Row 9** details the station owned by Vista Broadcast Group with a format of \"adult hits.\" This suggests they play a specific type of music rather than all types.\n\nNo evidence in the table indicates that Vista Broadcast Group plays all types of hits.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So the call sign here isn't \"cjui - fm\".\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check each row. Row 8 has a call sign of \"ckqq - fm\" and owner Jim Pattison Group. Row 9 is CJUI with Vista Broadcast Group. Oh, so Astral Media's station in Row 1 is CKFR.\n\nThe claim says the call sign is CJUI-FM, but according to the table, that's owned by Vista Broadcast Group, not Astral Media. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the owner of the radio station that play adult hit be bell media.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table relate to adult hits. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: format is news/talk.\n- Row 2: public news/talk.\n- Row 3: public music.\n- Row 4: public news/talk.\n- Row 5: classic rock.\n- Row 6: contemporary hits.\n- Row 7: adult contemporary.\n- Row 8: hot adult contemporary.\n- Row 9: adult hits.\n- Row 10: active rock.\n\nSo, the relevant rows for adult hits are Rows 7 and 8. Additionally, Row 9 is also adult hits, so that's another relevant row.\n\nNow, I need to check the owner of these stations. \n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Row 7: call sign cilk-fm, branding 101.5 ez rock, format adult contemporary, owner bell media.\n- Row 8: call sign ckqq-fm, branding q103, format hot adult contemporary, owner jim pattison group.\n- Row 9: call sign cjui-fm, branding 103.9 the juice, format adult hits, owner vista broadcast group.\n\nSo, Row 7 is owned by bell media, but Rows 8 and 9 are not. The claim says \"the owner of the radio station that play adult hit be bell media.\" \n\nWait, does it refer to all stations that play adult hits? Because only one of them (Row 7) is owned by bell media. The other two (Rows 8 and 9) are owned by different companies. Therefore, the claim isn't fully accurate because not all adult hit stations listed have bell media as their owner.\n\nBut maybe the claim is referring to a specific station or stations. Let me check again:\n\nRow 7: yes, bell media.\nRow 8: jim pattison group.\nRow 9: vista broadcast group.\n\nSo, only Row 7 matches the claim's condition. The other two do not. Therefore, the statement isn't fully true because it doesn't account for all adult hit stations, only one of them is owned by bell media.\n\nHowever, if the claim was specifically about a station that plays adult hits being owned by bell media, then it would be TRUE. But as stated, since multiple adult hit stations exist and not all are owned by bell media, the claim might be FALSE unless it's referring to a specific one.\n\nWait, let me read the claim again: \"the owner of the radio station that play adult hit be bell media.\" It seems like it's talking about any radio station that plays adult hits. So if at least one such station exists, then maybe it's TRUE because there is an example. But no, because the claim says \"the\" owner, implying all such stations have bell media as their owner.\n\nBut in reality, not all do. So the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the owner of any radio station playing adult hits is Bell Media. However, upon reviewing the table, only one out of the three adult hit stations (103.9 The Juice) is owned by Bell Media. The other two are owned by different entities, so the claim isn't fully accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the call sign for the radio owned by Bell Media be ckfr.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about a radio station that is owned by Bell Media and has the call sign 'ckfr'. So, my task is to find in the table if there's any radio station owned by Bell Media with the call sign ckfr.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists 10 rows, each with information about a radio station. Each row includes details like frequency, call sign, branding, format, and owner.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see if any of them match the criteria: owned by Bell Media and call sign ckfr.\n\nRow 1: Owner is Astral Media, so not Bell Media.\nRow 2: Owner is Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), not Bell Media.\nRow 3: Also CBC, same as above.\nRow 4: Again, CBC. Not Bell Media.\nRow 5: Owner is Sun Country Cablevision, different from Bell Media.\nRow 6: Owner is Bell Media. So this is a candidate.\nRow 7: Owner is Bell Media again. Another candidate.\nRow 8: Owner is Jim Pattison Group, not Bell Media.\nRow 9: Vista Broadcast Group, so no.\nRow 10: Jim Pattison Group as well.\n\nNow, focusing on the rows owned by Bell Media: rows 6 and 7.\n\nRow 6: Call sign is 'chsu - fm'. Not ckfr.\nRow 7: Call sign is 'cilk - fm'. Also not ckfr.\n\nSo neither of the Bell Media-owned stations have the call sign 'ckfr'.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the call sign for the radio owned by Bell Media be ckfr\" is FALSE because there's no station in the table with both those attributes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"call sign\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"Bell Media own 3 separate radio stations like the CBC.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim means. It's comparing Bell Media and the CBC as owners of radio stations. So, I need to check how many radio stations each owns from the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists 10 rows, each representing a different radio station with details like frequency, call sign, branding, format, and owner. The relevant columns for this task are the 'owner' column because we're interested in who owns each station.\n\nStarting with Bell Media: I'll go through each row and see which ones list Bell Media as the owner.\n\nRow 1: Owner is Astral Media \u2014 not Bell.\nRow 2: Owner is Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) \u2014 not Bell.\nRow 3: Same as Row 2, CBC.\nRow 4: Again, CBC.\nRow 5: Owner is Sun Country Cablevision \u2014 different from Bell.\nRow 6: Owner is Bell Media. That's the first one.\nRow 7: Bell Media again. Second station owned by Bell.\nRow 8: Jim Pattison Group \u2014 not Bell.\nRow 9: Vista Broadcast Group \u2014 nope.\nRow 10: Jim Pattison Group \u2014 not Bell.\n\nSo from the table, I see that Bell Media owns two stations: Row 6 and Row 7. That's only two, not three.\n\nThe claim says Bell Media owns three separate radio stations like the CBC. But according to the table, CBC has multiple stations (Rows 2, 3, 4), so they definitely own more than one. However, Bell Media only owns two from what's listed here.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each row again.\n\nRow 6: chsu-fm, owner Bell Media \u2014 yes.\nRow 7: cilk-fm, also Bell Media \u2014 that's two.\nIs there any other? Rows 8 and 9 are Jim Pattison Group, not Bell. Row 10 is Jim too. So only two.\n\nTherefore, the claim says three, but the table shows only two.

Hmm, sometimes active rock is a subtype or similar genre.\n\nWait, so I have Row 5 as classic rock and Row 10 as active rock. Are these two separate stations or the same? The claim is about \"classic rock,\" so if active rock is a different format, then they're distinct. So that would be two stations: 5 and 10. Alternatively, if active rock isn't considered classic rock, maybe only one station. But I'm not sure if the term 'classic rock' includes active rock. In some contexts, they might overlap but are considered separate formats.\n\nLooking back at the claim, it's specifically about \"classic rock,\" so unless there's another row with that exact format, it would be just Row 5. Wait, no\u2014Row 10 is active rock, which is a different genre from classic rock. So perhaps only one station fits \"classic rock.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread.
