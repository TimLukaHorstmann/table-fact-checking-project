    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says that none of the Latvian submissions were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nLet me start by understanding the table. It has five rows, each representing a submission from Latvia to the Oscars, I assume. Each row includes the year and ceremony (which seems like the Oscar ceremony number), the film title used in the nomination, the original title, the director, and the result\u2014whether they were nominated or not.\n\nSo the claim is that none of these films got nominated. To verify this, I need to check each film's result column. If all results are \"not nominated,\" then the claim holds; otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The result is \"not nominated.\" That aligns with the claim.\nRow 2: Similarly, result is \"not nominated.\"\nRow 3: Also \"not nominated.\"\nRow 4: Again, \"not nominated.\"\n\nNow, Row 5: The result is listed as \"tbd,\" which I think stands for \"to be determined\" or \"tentative.\" It might not have been finalized yet when the table was made. If the film was eventually nominated, then the claim would be false; if not, it still holds.\n\nBut since in the data provided, Row 5's result is \"tbd,\" which isn't a definitive no, I'm unsure. However, based on the given information, we can only go by what's shown. The original table doesn't mention that Row 5 was actually nominated or not. So for the purposes of this assessment, since the claim says none were nominated, and Rows 1-4 definitely weren't, but Row 5's status is unknown, maybe it's safer to say the claim could be false if Row 5 ends up being nominated.\n\nBut wait, the claim is specifically about whether any were nominated. If there was a case where one was nominated, then the claim would be false. Since Row 5's result isn't clearly negative, perhaps we have to assume that none were, or that it hasn't happened yet. But in reality, if \"tbd\" means it might still be possible, then technically, it could become true later.\n\nHowever, given the data in the table, only Rows 1-4 are definite non-nominations. Row 5's outcome isn't certain from what's provided. Therefore, since none of the first four were nominated and there's no indication that Row 5 was, I think the claim might still hold as true because we don't have evidence to the contrary in the table.\n\nBut wait again\u2014the claim is about \"none\" being nominated. If any one of them was, even if just Row 5 ended up getting a nomination, then the claim would be false. Since the data doesn't show that any were, but also doesn't confirm that none will be, maybe it's safer to say the claim is not fully supported because we don't know about Row 5.\n\nBut the instructions say to check each condition against the table and determine if they are relevant. The result column for each row is what needs to be checked. So Rows 1-4 have results that confirm no nominations, but Row 5's result isn't clear. Therefore, since we don't know about Row 5, we can't fully confirm the claim as true because there might be a case where it was nominated.\n\nWait, but \"tbd\" could mean \"to be determined,\" which implies that it hasn't been decided yet. So if \"tbd\" means they're still considering it, maybe it's possible that Row 5 could get a nomination in the future. But as of now, based on the table, none have been nominated.\n\nI'm a bit confused here. The claim is about whether none were nominated. If any of them was, then the claim is false. Since Rows 1-4 were not, and Row 5's result isn't clear, but in the table, it's marked as \"tbd,\" which might mean that it wasn't nominated yet or that the outcome isn't known.\n\nBut I think for the purpose of this exercise, since the claim is about whether none were nominated, and Rows 1-4 weren't, and Row 5's result is unknown but not confirmed as nominated, perhaps we can consider that the claim holds because there's no evidence in the table that any were nominated. Alternatively, if \"tbd\" implies it might still be nominated, then the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nWait, but the claim says none were nominated. If even one was, the claim is false. Since in Rows 1-4, none were, but Row 5's status is unknown, we don't know for sure whether any were. Therefore, based on the table, it can't be definitively stated that none were nominated because Row 5 might have been.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer should be \"FALSE\" because the claim isn't fully supported by the data\u2014Row 5 could still end up being nominated, making the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows four entries where submissions from Latvia did not receive a nomination. However, Row 5's result is listed as \"tbd,\" meaning it may or may not have been nominated. Since this information isn't conclusive, the claim that none were nominated cannot be fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"2 of the 5 films be directed by J\u0101nis Nords.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table and see if the director is J\u0101nis Nords. The table has five rows, each representing a film nomination.\n\nRow 1: Directed by J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. That's not J\u0101nis Nords, so no.\nRow 2: Directed by Aigars Grauba. Also not the same person.\nRow 3: Directed by M\u0101ris Martinsons. Not matching either.\nRow 4: Directed by Yevgeni Pashkevich. Still not J\u0101nis Nords.\nRow 5: Directed by J\u0101nis Nords. That's one.\n\nWait, so only Row 5 has J\u0101nis Nords as the director. So that's just one film directed by him. The claim says two of the five films are directed by him. Since there's only one, this seems false.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Looking at each row again:\n\n- 1992: J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds\n- 2008: Aigars Grauba\n- 2010: M\u0101ris Martinsons\n- 2012: Yevgeni Pashkevich\n- 2013: J\u0101nis Nords\n\nYes, only one film by J\u0101nis Nords. So the claim is definitely false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two out of five films are directed by J\u0101nis Nords, but according to the table, only one film (Row 5) meets this criterion.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant cells:** Only Row 5's director is relevant.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"director\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submit 1 year after the other.\" So, it's saying that these two films were submitted one year apart from each other. \n\nLooking at the table, I see five rows, each representing a different film submission with details like the ceremony year, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nLet me go through each relevant film mentioned in the claim.\n\n1. **Mother, I Love You**: This is row 5 from the table. The year is 2013 (86th), which means it was submitted in 2013. \n\n2. **Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg**: Looking at the table, this film isn't listed in any of the rows provided. Hmm, that's a problem because if it's not in the table, I can't verify its submission year.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Row 1: \"the child of man\"\n- Row 2: \"defenders of riga\"\n- Row 3: \"hong kong confidential\"\n- Row 4: \"gulf stream under the iceberg\"\n- Row 5: \"mother , i love you\"\n\nOh, actually, row 4 is about Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg. So, its year is 2012 (85th). Therefore, Mother I Love You was submitted in 2013, which is one year after Gulf Stream's submission in 2012.\n\nSo, the claim says both were submitted one year apart. Since Gulf Stream was submitted in 2012 and Mother I Love You in 2013, that's correct\u2014they are indeed one year apart. \n\nBut wait, the original instruction said to check if all conditions in the claim are supported by the table. The only film mentioned in the claim is Mother I Love You, which is row 5, and Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg, which is row 4.\n\nSo, for the claim to be TRUE, both films must have been submitted one year after each other. From the table, Gulf Stream was submitted in 2012, and Mother I Love You in 2013. That's a one-year gap, so it fits the claim.\n\nBut what about the rest of the films? The claim doesn't mention them, so they don't affect the verification. So, the relevant cells are row 4 (Gulf Stream) and row 5 (Mother I Love You).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with relevant cells being these two.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we verify the submission years of both films mentioned in the claim.\n\n- **Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg** (row 4, year 2012)\n- **Mother, I Love You** (row 5, year 2013)\n\nSince their submission years are one apart, the claim holds true. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\" So, I need to check if \"defender of riga\" was submitted for an award more than 10 years after its previous submission.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different film submission. The relevant columns here are 'film title used in nomination' and 'year (ceremony)'. \n\nRow 2 mentions \"defenders of riga\" with the original title \"r\u012bgas sargi\", director Aigars Grauba, and the result was not nominated. The year is 2008 (81st ceremony). Now, I need to check if this film was submitted before in earlier ceremonies. \n\nLooking through the table, I don't see any other entries for \"defenders of riga.\" So, perhaps it's only submitted once in 2008. But wait, the claim refers to a previous submission, so maybe there's another row with the same film title but from an earlier year.\n\nWait, let me check again. In Row 2, the film is defenders of riga, submitted in 2008. The other rows have different films: child of man (1992), hong kong confidential (2010), gulf stream under the iceberg (2012), and mother, i love you (2013). None of these are repeats of \"defenders of riga.\"\n\nSo, if defenders of riga was only submitted in 2008, there's no previous submission before that. Therefore, it hasn't been submitted more than a decade after any previous submission because there isn't a prior one. Hence, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread something. Let me make sure. The claim says \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\" So, for it to be true, there must have been a previous submission in or before 1998 (since 2008 -10 = 1998). But according to the table, defenders of riga was only submitted in 2008. There's no prior entry for it, so it can't have been submitted more than a decade later after any previous one. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"defenders of riga\" was submitted more than a decade after its previous submission. However, according to the table, this film was only submitted in 2008 and had no prior submissions.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is true or false. The table lists information about five Latvian films submitted for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film from 1992 to 2013. The claim is: \"5 latvian film in 21 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\"\n\nFirst, I need to carefully check each part of the claim against the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions five Latvian films submitted in a specific year, but it says \"in 21 year,\" which is a bit confusing because years are usually referred to in the singular or plural form. It might be a typo, perhaps meaning \"within the last 21 years\" or something similar, but I'll treat it as written.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: 1992\nRow 2: 2008\nRow 3: 2010\nRow 4: 2012\nRow 5: 2013\n\nSo, we're talking about films submitted in 1992 (the oldest) through 2013. The claim says \"in 21 year,\" which could be interpreted as within 21 years of a specific point. For example, if the submission is from 2024, that would be in 21 years after 2003, but that's not relevant here since all films are already submitted before 2014.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of films. The claim says \"5 latvian film,\" so it's asserting that there were five submissions. Looking at the table, there are indeed five rows (from 1992 to 2013), each representing a film submission. Each row has a film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nSo, the claim is about five films being submitted. Now, checking each year: from 1992 to 2013 is a span of 21 years (2013 - 1992 = 21). So, the claim could be implying that over these 21 years, five films were submitted. But looking at the data, there are exactly five films listed, each from different years within those 21 years. So, that part checks out.\n\nWait, but the table shows five submissions: in 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. That's five films over 21 years. So, the claim is saying that five films were submitted in these 21 years, which seems correct.\n\nAdditionally, each film was not nominated, as per the \"result\" column. However, the claim doesn't mention anything about the outcome, so I don't need to consider that for this particular check.\n\nSo, the relevant parts are confirming that there are five films listed in the table, each submitted in different years within a 21-year span, and thus supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five Latvian films were submitted over 21 years. The table shows five films spanning from 1992 to 2013, which is indeed a 21-year period.

The columns in each row include: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result.\n\nI need to check each row to see if any film from Latvia was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. If there are exactly two such films, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: 1992 (65th) ceremony. The film title used in nomination is \"the child of man,\" original title \"cilv\u0113ka b\u0113rns,\" directed by J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.

Again, no.\n\nRow 3: 2010 (83rd). Title used in nomination \"hong kong confidential,\" original title \"amaya,\" directed by M\u0101ris Martinsons. Not nominated as well.\n\nRow 4: 2012 (85th). Film is \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" original title \"golfa straume zem ledus kalna,\" director Yevgeni Pashkevich. Not nominated.\n\nRow 5: 2013 (86th). Title used in nomination \"mother, i love you,\" original title \"mammu, es tevi m\u012blu,\" directed by J\u0101nis Nords. The result here is listed as \"tbd.\" I'm not sure what \"tbd\" means.

That's a direct match, so this is row 5.\n\nSo, we have two films in the table that are mentioned in the claim: one from row 2 and another from row 5. Now, I need to see if they were submitted one year after each other.\n\nLooking at their ceremony years:\n\nRow 2 (defenders of riga) is 2008 (81st ceremony).\n\nRow 5 (mother , i love you) is 2013 (86th ceremony). Wait, that's a difference of 5 years, not just 1. So, the claim says they were submitted one year after each other, but in reality, it's five years apart.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It could mean that both films are submitted to the same ceremony, with \"mother\" being submitted as a follow-up or something, but I don't think so because the submission is for different ceremonies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about their original submissions relative to each other in time. So, if one was submitted in 2008 and the other in 2013, that's more than one year apart, not one. Therefore, the claim seems false.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the rows again. Row 5 is 2013 (86th), so that's five years after row 2 which is 2008 (81st). So, yes, definitely more than a year apart.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the two films were submitted five years apart, not one year.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mother , i love you\" and \"defender of riga\" were submitted one year after each other. However, upon checking the table, these films are from 2008 and 2013 respectively, which is a five-year gap. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"5 latvian film in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" Hmm, that seems a bit unclear. Let me parse it. It probably means that five Latvian films submitted in the 11th year (maybe 2011?) were nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards.\n\nNow, looking at the table, there are five rows, each representing a different film submission. Each row has details like the year of ceremony, film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result (not nominated in the first four, TBD in the fifth).\n\nWait, but the claim is about 5 films being submitted in the 11th year. Wait, the table's rows are for years 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013. The \"ceremony\" refers to Oscar ceremonies, so each row represents a submission in a specific year. For example, Row 1 is 1992 (65th ceremony), Row 5 is 2013 (86th ceremony). \n\nSo the claim mentions five films submitted in the 11th year. But looking at the table, there's no entry for the 11th Oscar ceremony. The earliest is the 65th in 1992, then 81st in 2008, 83rd in 2010, 85th in 2012, and 86th in 2013. So none of these are the 11th year. That might be a red flag because if the claim is about the 11th year, but there's no data for that year in the table.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe \"in the 11 year\" refers to the submission year, not the ceremony year. But looking at the table, each row's first column is the ceremony year, and the film was submitted that year. So, if someone claims five films from Latvia were submitted in 2011 (the 11th year after 2000), but the table doesn't have a 2011 entry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misstated. Let's think about when the Academy Awards started giving the Best Foreign Language Film category. I think it was in 1948, so the 2nd ceremony. The 65th ceremony would be 1992, as per the table. So each row represents a submission for that year.\n\nBut the claim says \"5 latvian film in 11 year,\" which probably means five films from Latvia submitted in the 11th year of something, maybe since some starting point. But without knowing what the \"11 year\" refers to, it's unclear. However, based on the table, there are only four films that were not nominated, and one with TBD result.\n\nWait, but the claim is about being submitted, not necessarily winning. So perhaps it's saying five films from Latvia have been submitted in 2011 (the 11th year after 2000). But the table doesn't show any submission for 2011. Therefore, there are no entries in the table for 2011.\n\nSo, since the table only has data up to 2013, and none of them is from 2011, the claim that five films were submitted in the 11th year can't be fully supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five Latvian films were submitted for the Academy Award Best Foreign Language Film in the 11th year. However, examining the provided table, there are no entries corresponding to the 11th year (2011). Each row represents a different year, and none of them align with the claimed 11th year. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and figure out which cells are relevant. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade before the next submission\". Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky. I think it means that \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted (nominated) more than ten years before another submission occurred after it. So, we need to check if there's another film in the table that was submitted after \"Defenders of Riga\", and see if the gap between their submission years is more than a decade.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different year when a film was nominated for something\u2014maybe an Oscar? The columns include the ceremony year, the film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. For this task, I'm interested in the film titles and their respective years to see if \"Defenders of Riga\" is followed by another submission more than ten years later.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 2: year (ceremony): 2008 (81st), film title used: defenders of riga. So this was submitted in 2008.\nNow, I need to check if there's any other film in the table that was submitted after 2008, and see how many years have passed since then.\n\nLooking through the rest of the rows:\n- Row 1: 1992 (65th) for \"The Child of Man\". That's before 2008, so not relevant here.\n- Row 3: 2010 (83rd), film title: hong kong confidential. This is after 2008, so that's a candidate.\n- Row 4: 2012 (85th), film title: gulf stream under the iceberg. Also after 2008.\n- Row 5: 2013 (86th), film title: mother, i love you. After 2008 as well.\n\nSo now, comparing \"Defenders of Riga\" in 2008 with the next submission, which is 2010 for \"Hong Kong Confidential\". Let's calculate the gap between 2008 and 2010\u2014that's exactly two years. Two years is less than a decade (which would be ten or more years), so that doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nNext, checking the next one: 2012. 2012 minus 2008 is four years\u2014still not over a decade. Then 2013: five years. All of these are within the same decade, so they don't qualify as being more than ten years apart.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade before the next submission\". Does this mean that \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted more than a decade before another film's submission? So we need to see if after 2008, any film in the table is more than ten years away. But looking at the remaining entries, they're all between 2010 and 2013\u2014so none are over a decade after 2008.\n\nTherefore, there isn't a next submission that's more than a decade after 2008. So the claim seems to be making an incorrect assumption here. The next submissions are within two years of each other, not more than a decade apart.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the claim is suggesting that \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted more than ten years before the next submission. But in the table, after 2008, all films are between 2010 and 2013\u2014so no, there's nothing more than ten years later. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nSo, to sum up: The relevant cells are the one for \"Defenders of Riga\" (Row 2), because it's the starting point we need to compare against subsequent submissions. But since none of the following submissions are more than a decade after 2008, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"defender of riga\" was submitted more than a decade before the next submission. However, upon examining the table, the next submissions occur in 2010, 2012, and 2013, all within fewer than ten years after 2008. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film title used in nomination\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
