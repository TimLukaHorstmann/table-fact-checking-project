    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Oakland Raiders losing to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2012 at Arrowhead Stadium with a score of 15-0 is true or false by checking the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the relevant information. The claim mentions the year 2012, so I should focus on rows where the year is 2012. Scanning through:\n\nRow 5: year 2012, date October 28, Raiders win 26-16 against Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.\nRow 6: year 2012, date December 16, Raiders win 15-0 against Chiefs at OCO Coliseum.\n\nWait, that's two games in 2012. The claim specifies a loss for the Raiders, but both these rows show wins. So there might be confusion here.\n\nI need to check if there was a game where the Raiders lost to the Chiefs in 2012 at Arrowhead Stadium with a score of 15-0. From the table, in 2012, the Raiders played two games: one on October 28 and another on December 16. Both are wins for the Raiders, so they didn't lose that year.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions a loss, but both 2012 games result in Raiders' victories. There's no row where the Chiefs won against the Raiders at Arrowhead Stadium with a score of 15-0 in 2012.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the Raiders actually won both games that season, and there's no record of them losing to the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium in 2012 with that score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because in 2012, the Oakland Raiders did not lose to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Instead, they won both their games against the Chiefs that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
