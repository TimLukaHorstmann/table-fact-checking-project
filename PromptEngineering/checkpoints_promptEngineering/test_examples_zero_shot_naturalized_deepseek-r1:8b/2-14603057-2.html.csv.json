The claim says: \"plain be class a for the 1988 - 89 and 1989 - 90 school year.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim means. It mentions two school years: 1988-89 and 1989-90. For each of these years, it's claiming that \"plain\" is the class a.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different school year, and within each row, there are several class levels like class a, aa, aaa, etc. So, my task is to check for the two specified school years if the class a is listed as \"plain.\"\n\nI'll start by going through each row one by one until I find the ones that match the school years mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 1: School year 1988-89. Let me see what class a is here. According to the table, it's \"plains.\" So that matches the first part of the claim for 1988-89.\n\nRow 2: School year 1989-90. Checking class a in this row, it also says \"plains.\" So both specified school years have \"plain\" as class a. That seems to support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other rows beyond that which might affect this. But since the claim is only about 1988-89 and 1989-90, any other rows don't matter here.\n\nSo, both relevant school years have \"plain\" as class a. That would mean the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the two specified school years in the table, where \"plain\" is indeed listed as class a for both 1988-89 and 1989-90.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"class a\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"class a\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim mentions the school year 2010 - 11, so I'll look for that in the table. Scanning through the list, I see Row 23 corresponds to 2010 - 11. That's row_index 22 if we start counting from 0? Wait, no, the rows are labeled from 1 to 23. So Row 23 is school year 2010-11.\n\nNow, within that row (Row 23), I need to look at the class a and class aa designations. The claim says Lindsay should be class a and Elkhart should be class aa. Looking at the data for Row 23:\n\n- Class a: lindsay\n- Class aa: elkhart\n\nSo, yes, in that row, Lindsay is class a and Elkhart is class aa. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI think that's all I need to check.

The claim is: \"plain be name class a for the 2004 - 05 school year.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that in the 2004-05 school year, the class A is named \"plain\" at some location, and maybe the name comes from somewhere else? Or perhaps it's indicating a specific structure, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school year, starting from 1988-89 up to 2007-08. Each row lists several classes with their respective designations (like class a, class aa, etc.) and the schools or areas they're associated with.\n\nThe claim mentions \"plain\" in the context of a class a name for the 2004-05 school year. So I need to check if any row corresponding to the 2004-05 school year has a class a named \"plain.\"\n\nLet me look through each row until I find the one that matches the school year 2004-05.\n\nRow 17: school year 2004 - 05\n- class a: plains\n- class aa: argyle\n- class aaa: bridgeport\n- class aaaa: longview pine tree\n- class aaaaa: lubbock\n\nSo in row 17, class a is listed as \"plains.\" The claim says it should be named \"plain,\" but here it's \"plains\" with an 's' at the end. That seems different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the term \"plain.\" Could it be a typo or different spelling? In some contexts, \"plain\" and \"plains\" might refer to similar things, but they're not exactly the same. The claim specifically says \"plain,\" so if the class is named \"plains,\" that would make the claim false.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other row where \"plain\" is used as a class name for class a in 2004-05. From the table, it seems like only row 17 corresponds to that year and class a is \"plains,\" not just \"plain.\"\n\nSo based on this, the claim doesn't hold true because the class a for 2004-05 is listed as \"plains\" and not \"plain.\" Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that class a is named \"plain\" for the 2004-05 school year. Upon checking the table, in row 17 (which corresponds to 2004-05), class a is listed as \"plains,\" not \"plain.\" This discrepancy means the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"class a\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the name of the class aa be stamford with class a of westbrook and school year of 1995 - 96.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It mentions three things:\n1. Class AA name: Stamford\n2. Class A name: Westbrook\n3. School Year: 1995-96\n\nI'll need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a school year and lists different classes (A, AA, AAA, etc.) with corresponding names. The columns are not explicitly labeled beyond the headers, but from the data, it seems that each class level has its own cell for each row.\n\nI'll start by checking if there's a Class A named Westbrook in the 1995-96 school year. To do this, I'll go through each row and look at the Class A column.\n\nRow 4: 1991-92\nClass A: san isidro\n\nRow 5: 1992-93\nClass A: westbrook\n\nSo, Westbrook is in Row 5 (1992-93), not 1995-96. So, the school year part doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread. Let me double-check the rows again. The claim says 1995-96, so looking at Row 4 is 1991-92, then Row 8 would be 1995-96. Let's see:\n\nRow 8: school year 1995-96\nClass A: rule\n\nSo no Westbrook there.\n\nNext part: Class AA being Stamford in the same school year (1995-96). Looking at Row 8, Class AA is stamford. That matches.\n\nBut wait, the Class A for 1995-96 is 'rule', not Westbrook. So even though Class AA is Stamford, the Class A isn't Westbrook. Therefore, the claim is combining two different school years: 1992-93 (Westbrook) and 1995-96 (Stamford).\n\nSo the claim incorrectly associates both Westbrook and Stamford in the same school year, which they aren't. Hence, the claim is FALSE because while Stamford is indeed Class AA for 1995-96, Westbrook isn't Class A for that year\u2014it was in a different year.\n\nI think I've covered all parts of the claim. The key cells would be where Class A is Westbrook and where Class AA is Stamford, each with their respective school years.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if:\n\n1. **Class AA** is named \"Stamford\" in the 1995-96 school year.\n2. **Class A** is named \"Westbrook\" in the same school year.\n\nFrom the table:\n- **1995-96 (Row 8)**: \n  - Class A: rule\n  - Class AA: Stamford\n\nThus, while Stamford is correct for Class AA, Westbrook isn't present as Class A in that year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Class AA\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Class A\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"session 1992 - 93 be the school year with class aaa of mcallen and class aaaa of longview pine tree.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The session mentioned is \"1992 - 93,\" which should correspond to a specific row in the table. Then, within that row, there should be an entry for \"class aaa\" with the value \"mcallen,\" and another entry for \"class aaaa\" with \"longview pine tree.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school year, starting from 1988-89 up to 2010-11. Each row lists different classes (a, aa, aaa, etc.) along with their corresponding schools or locations.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the 1992-93 school year. Let me count the rows: Row 1 is 1988-89, Row 2 is 1989-90, and so on. So, Row 5 should be 1992-93 because 1988 +4 is 1992, but let me double-check. Wait, no, each row increments by one school year, so Row 1: 88-89, Row 2: 89-90, ..., Row 5: 92-93. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at Row 5 (1992-93), the classes are:\n- Class a: westbrook\n- Class aa: quanah\n- Class aaa: carrizo springs\n- Class aaaa: longview pine tree\n- Class aaaaa: mcallen\n\nSo in this row, for \"class aaa,\" the value is \"carrizo springs,\" not \"mcallen.\" That's different from what the claim states. The claim says that in 1992-93, class aaa is mcallen, but according to the table, it's carrizo springs.\n\nAlso, checking the other part of the claim: class aaaa should be longview pine tree. In Row 5, yes, class aaaa is indeed \"longview pine tree.\" So that part checks out.\n\nBut since one part doesn't match (class aaa being mcallen instead of carrizo), the entire claim isn't fully supported.

The claim we need to verify is: \"garden city be the name of the class a with school session 2004 - 05.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. We're looking for a specific instance in the table where:\n\n1. The class level is **Class A**.\n2. The school year is **2004 - 05**.\n3. The name of the school or location is **garden city**.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table provided to see if there's a match for these three criteria.\n\nStarting from Row 1 (1988-89) up to Row 23 (2010-11), I need to scan each row and check two main points: whether it's Class A and whether the school year is 2004 - 05.\n\nLet me start by identifying rows that have \"garden city\" in any class level. From skimming through, I notice that \"garden city\" appears in Row 18 (2005-06) as part of Class A. However, that's for the school session 2005-06, not 2004-05.\n\nContinuing to check other rows:\n\n- **Row 17**: School year is 2004 - 05. Looking at Class A for this row, it says \"plains.\" So no match here.\n  \n- **Row 18**: As mentioned, 2005-06, but garden city is in Class A.\n\nWait a second, I think I might have missed Row 17. Let me double-check:\n\nIn Row 17 (2004 - 05), the Class A entry is \"plains,\" not \"garden city.\" So no match there either.\n\nMoving through the remaining rows after Row 18, I don't see another instance where \"garden city\" is paired with Class A and the specific school year of 2004-05. \n\nSo, upon reviewing each row, it appears that there's no entry in Class A for the school session 2004 - 05 named \"garden city.\" The first occurrence of \"garden city\" in Class A is in Row 18 (2005-06), which doesn't align with the claim's school year.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"garden city\" is the name of Class A for the 2004 - 05 school session.

The claim is: \"pharr - san juan - alamo be the class aaaa of school session 2001 - 02.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The table lists different schools under various classes (a, aa, aaa, aaaa) for specific school years. Each row corresponds to a different year.\n\nThe claim is about \"pharr - san juan - alamo\" being the class 'aaaa' in the 2001-02 school session. So I need to check if this entry appears under 'aaaa' and in the 2001-02 year.\n\nLooking through the table, each row starts with the school year, then lists several classes.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems to say that \"Mission Veteran Memorial\" is an AA class and it's located in Lindsay. So I need to check two things: whether Mission Veteran Memorial is listed as a class AA location and if it's associated with Lindsay.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a school year and lists various classes (a, aa, aaa, etc.) along with their respective locations. My task is to find any occurrence where \"Mission Veteran Memorial\" appears in the 'class aa' column and see if the corresponding location is Lindsay.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Classes include bishop, shallowater, port neches - groves, mcallen. No mention of Mission Veteran Memorial.\nRow 2: Classes are plains, shallowater, bishop, azle, converse judson. No match.\nRow 3: Locations are sterling city, shallowater, bandera, carrizo springs, lubbock. Not relevant.\nRow 4: San isidro, stamford, ingleside, carrizo springs, lubbock. Still no.\nRow 5: Westbrook, quanah, carrizo springs, longview pine tree, mcallen. No match.\nRow 6: Rule, stamford, carrizo springs, longview pine tree, lubbock. Not there.\nRow 7: Rule, stamford, bridgeport, gregory - portland, sugar land elkins. No.\nRow 8: Same as row 7. Still no.\nRow 9: Henrietta midway, plains, bridgeport, longview pine tree, pharr - san juan - alamo. Not matching.\nRow 10: Rule, plains, santa rosa, azle, klein. No.\nRow 11: Valley view, hamilton, santa rosa, pharr - san juan - alamo, klein. Still not.\nRow 12: Valley view, hamilton, bridgeport, fredericksburg, mcallen. No.\nRow 13: Nazareth, elkhart, bridgeport, pharr - san juan - alamo, klein. Not matching.\nRow 14: Nazareth, elkhart, bridgeport, longview pine tree, san antonio southwest. Close but not the one we need.\nRow 15: Plains, elkhart, bridgeport, longview pine tree, san antonio southwest. No match.\nRow 16: Henrietta midway, argyle, bridgeport, pharr - san juan - alamo, san antonio southwest. Not there.\nRow 17: Plains, argyle, bridgeport, longview pine tree, lubbock. Still no.\nRow 18: Garden city, argyle, bridge city, longview pine tree, pharr - san juan - alamo. No.\nRow 19: Garden city, salado, bridge city, mission veterans memorial, lubbock. Wait a minute, here in row 19, class aaaa is \"mission veterans memorial.\" But the claim says it's an AA class. So in this case, Mission Veteran Memorial is under 'aaaa' class, not 'aa'. That means it's in a higher tier.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 20: San isidro, stamford, ingleside, carrizo springs, lubbock. No.\nRow 21: Lindsay, elkhart, argyle, longview pine tree, fort bend clements. Here, class a is lindsay. But we need Mission Veteran Memorial as AA.\nRow 22: Poolville, paris chisum, argyle, mission veterans memorial, galena park north shore. Now in row 22, class aaaa is mission veterans memorial again, but this time the location is galena park north shore, not lindsay.\n\nWait, so in row 19, Mission Veteran Memorial is under 'aaaa' with location lubbock, and in row 22, it's under 'aaaa' again but now in galena park. So I don't see any instance where Mission Veteran Memorial is listed as an 'aa' class with Lindsay.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any other row where 'mission veterans memorial' appears in the AA column. From what I can see, in all rows, it's either under 'aaaa', and sometimes not even that. For example, row 14 has longview pine tree as aaaa, but no mission veteran memorial.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that Mission Veteran Memorial is an AA class with Lindsay. However, based on the table, it appears that Mission Veteran Memorial is listed under 'aaaa' and not 'aa'. Also, when it's in 'aaaa', its location isn't Lindsay except in row 22, but there it's galena park. In row 19, it was lubbock.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because Mission Veteran Memorial is not an AA class (it's aaaa), and even if it were, it doesn't have Lindsay as its location in any relevant row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Mission Veteran Memorial\" is classified as an AA class with Lindsay. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n1. **Classification Check**: In each relevant row, \"Mission Veteran Memorial\" appears under 'aaaa' and not 'aa'.\n2. **Location Check**: When \"Mission Veteran Memorial\" is listed in 'aaaa', its locations are either lubbock or galena park north shore, never Lindsay.\n\nSince the classification isn't AA and the location doesn't match Lindsay, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"class aaaa\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"class aaaa\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
