    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Raptor be the home team of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (34) as the lead scorer.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. The Raptors are the home team.\n2. Manu Gin\u00f3bili scores 34 points in that game.\n\nI'll need to check each row in the table to see if there's a match where the home team is the Raptors and the leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: February 5, 2008. Visitor: Spurs, Home: Pacers. Leading scorer: Tim Duncan (19). Doesn't match because home team isn't Raptors and leading scorer isn't Gin\u00f3bili.\nRow 2: Feb 6, 2008. Visitor: Spurs, Home: Wizards. Not Raptors.\nRow 3: Feb 8, 2008. Visitor: Spurs, Home: Knicks. Still not Raptors.\nRow 4: Feb 10, 2008. Visitor: Spurs, Home: Celtics. No match.\nRow 5: Feb 11, 2008. Visitor: Spurs, Home: Raptors. Wait, here the home team is Raptors. But leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points. So this row matches both conditions.\n\nBut wait, I should check all rows to make sure there isn't another instance where Raptors are home and Gin\u00f3bili scores 34 as a leader. Let's continue:\n\nRow 6: Feb 13, 2008. Visitor: Spurs, Home: Cavaliers. Not Raptors.\nRow 7: Feb 19, 2008. Visitor: Bobcats, Home: Spurs. Not relevant since visitor is not Spurs and home isn't Raptors.\nRow 8: Feb 21, 2008.Visitor: Spurs, Home: Timberwolves. No match.\nRow 9: Feb 23, 2008.Visitor: Hornets, Home: Spurs. Again, not Raptors as home.\nRow 10: Feb 25, 2008.Visitor: Hawks, Home: Spurs. Not relevant.\nRow 11: Feb 28, 2008.Visitor: Mavericks, Home: Spurs. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo only Row 5 matches both conditions: home team is Raptors and leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 34 points. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, supported by this row.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for each row are 'home' and 'leading scorer'. So in Row 5, column 'home' is Raptors and 'leading scorer' is Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34). That's the only relevant cell needed to confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 5 where the home team is Raptors and Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 34 points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the score of the game with manu gin\u00f3bili (44) as the lead scorer be 100 - 99.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are the score being 100-99 and that Manu Gin\u00f3bili was the leading scorer with a score of 44.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. I'll need to check each row where Manu Gin\u00f3bili is the leading scorer and see if any of those games have a score of 100-99.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: February 5, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 116 - 89\n- Home: Pacers\n- Leading Scorer: Tim Duncan (19)\n- Attendance: 11,288\n- Record: 30-16\n\nRow 2: February 6, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 85 - 77\n- Home: Wizards\n- Leading Scorer: Tim Duncan (23)\n- Attendance: 20,173\n- Record: 31-16\n\nRow 3: February 8, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 99 - 93\n- Home: Knicks\n- Leading Scorer: Tim Duncan (21)\n- Attendance: 19,763\n- Record: 32-16\n\nRow 4: February 10, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 90 - 98\n- Home: Celtics\n- Leading Scorer: Tim Duncan (22)\n- Attendance: 18,624\n- Record: 32-17\n\nRow 5: February 11, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 93 - 88\n- Home: Raptors\n- Leading Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (34)\n- Attendance: 19,800\n- Record: 33-17\n\nRow 6: February 13, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 112 - 105\n- Home: Cavaliers\n- Leading Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (46)\n- Attendance: 20,562\n- Record: 34-17\n\nRow 7: February 19, 2008\n- Visitor: Bobcats\n- Score: 65 - 85\n- Home: Spurs\n- Leading Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (18)\n- Attendance: 18,383\n- Record: 35-17\n\nRow 8: February 21, 2008\n- Visitor: Spurs\n- Score: 100 - 99\n- Home: Timberwolves\n- Leading Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44)\n- Attendance: 13,920\n- Record: 36-17\n\nRow 9: February 23, 2008\n- Visitor: Hornets\n- Score: 89 - 98\n- Home: Spurs\n- Leading Scorer: Manu Gin\u00f3bili (30)\n- Attendance: 18,997\n- Record: 37-17\n\nRow 10: February 25, 2008\n- Visitor: Hawks\n- Score: 74 - 89\n- Home: Spurs\n- Leading Scorer: Tim Duncan (23)\n- Attendance: 18,113\n- Record: 38-17\n\nRow 11: February 28, 2008\n- Visitor: Mavericks\n- Score: 94 - 97\n- Home: Spurs\n- Leading Scorer: Tim Duncan (31)\n- Attendance: 18,797\n- Record: 39-17\n\nNow, I need to find any game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili was the leading scorer with a score of 100-99. Let's focus on rows where the leading scorer is Manu Gin\u00f3bili.\n\nLooking at Row 5: He scores 34 points. The score is Spurs 93 - Raptors 88. Not 100-99.\n\nRow 6: He scores 46, but the score is Spurs 112 - Cavaliers 105. Not 100-99.\n\nRow 7: He scores 18, and the score is Bobcats 65 - Spurs 85. Not relevant.\n\nRow 8: He scores 44 points. The score is Spurs 100 - Timberwolves 99. That's exactly what the claim says! So this game matches both the score and Manu being the leading scorer with 44 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game where Manu Gin\u00f3bili scored 44 points, resulting in a 100-99 Spurs victory. Checking each row, Row 8 fits all criteria. \n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table. The claim says: \"when manu gin\u00f3bili (44) is the leading scorer and the visitor is the maverick, the date is february 28, 2008.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find where all these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the columns in the table, they are: date, visitor, score, home, leading scorer, attendance, and record. So the relevant columns for the claim are 'visitor' (to check if it's Mavericks), 'leading scorer' (to check if it's Manu Gin\u00f3bili with points 44), and 'date' (to be February 28, 2008).\n\nNow, I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: visitor is Spurs. Not Mavericks. So skip.\n\nRow 2: visitor is Wizards. Not Mavericks. Skip.\n\nRow 3: visitor is Knicks. No. Skip.\n\nRow 4: visitor is Celtics. No. Skip.\n\nRow 5: visitor is Raptors. No. Skip.\n\nRow 6: visitor is Cavaliers. No. Skip.\n\nRow 7: visitor is Bobcats. No. Skip.\n\nRow 8: visitor is Spurs again. Not Mavericks. Skip.\n\nRow 9: visitor is Hornets. No. Skip.\n\nRow 10: visitor is Hawks. No. Skip.\n\nRow 11: visitor is Mavericks. So this row could be relevant.\n\nNow, check the leading scorer in Row 11. It says Tim Duncan with 23 points. But the claim mentions Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). So that doesn't match. Therefore, even though the visitor is Mavericks, the leading scorer isn't Manu.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if any other row has both visitor as Mavericks and leading scorer as Manu. Let me check again quickly.\n\nRow 11: visitor is Mavericks, but leading scorer is Tim Duncan. No Manu here.\n\nSo, none of the rows have both visitor as Mavericks AND leading scorer as Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44). Therefore, the claim's conditions aren't all met in any row. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires that when Manu Gin\u00f3bili (44) is the leading scorer and the visitor is the Mavericks, the date must be February 28, 2008. Checking each row, none meet both the visitor being Mavericks and the leading scorer being Manu Gin\u00f3bili with 44 points on that specific date.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"leading scorer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
