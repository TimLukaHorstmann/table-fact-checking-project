Okay, so he has 14 goals, which is over 10.\n\nNext, Ronnie Jepson. Let me find him in the table. I think he's Row 17. Wait, no, let me check again. Oh yes, Row 16 is Ronnie Jepson? No, wait, looking at the numbers: Row 16 is Richard Logan, then Row 17 is Ronnie Jepson. So, his total goals are listed as 14. That's also over 10.\n\nWait, no, let me double-check because sometimes the rows might be a bit confusing.

I think they meant that Lee Sinnott and Simon Trevitt are both playing as defensive forwards (df) in their respective teams. So my task is to check the table for each of these players and see if their positions are listed as \"df\".\n\nI should start by finding where Lee Sinnott is in the table.
