    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"For the 2018 season, the Air Force - Navy score is yet TBD.\" Let me start by looking through the table provided.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. The columns seem to be for different games or scores related to the Air Force and Navy matchups over various seasons. Each row corresponds to a specific season with corresponding game details, such as the date and location.\n\nLooking at the claim, it specifically mentions the 2018 season and the Air Force - Navy score being TBD (To Be Determined). I need to find in the table any entries related to the 2018 season that might affect this claim.\n\nStarting from row 44, which is labeled as \"season: 2018\", it says the trophy winner is TBD. Then, under the scores, all three cells are marked as TBD\u2014Air Force - Navy, Air Force - Army, and Army - Navy. This makes sense because if the season hasn't concluded yet, these scores wouldn't be finalized.\n\nSo, row_index 44 has all three score cells as TBD for the 2018 season. Since the claim is about the Air Force - Navy score being TBD in 2018, this row directly relates to that part of the claim.\n\nI don't need to look further because the relevant information is already present in row 44. Therefore, the claim should be considered TRUE based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 44,\n      \"column_name\": \"Air Force - Navy score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"An army - navy game will be played on 10 Dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD.\"\n\nFirst, I should look through the table to find any relevant information related to an Army vs Navy game happening on that specific date and location.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row for mentions of Army vs Navy games. The rows are numbered from 0 upwards, so I can go through each one systematically.\n\nLooking at Row 42: It mentions the trophy winner as \"tbd\" (to be determined) and notes details about an Army-Navy game on 4 Oct 2014 at Air Force, another game on 1 Nov 2014 at Army, and a third on 13 Dec 2014 at Baltimore, MD.\n\nRow 43: This row is for the 2016 season. It states that the trophy winner is \"tbd,\" but importantly, it mentions an Army-Navy game date as 10 Dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD. That seems to match the claim exactly. \n\nRows beyond 43 don't seem to add any more information relevant to this specific claim.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"in 1983, the air force - navy score be 44 - 17.\" \n\nFirst, I should locate the row corresponding to 1983 in the table. Let me look through each row's season until I find one that says 1983. Scanning down, I see Row 31 is for 2002, which is too far. Wait, no, actually, looking back, maybe I missed it earlier. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me go step by step. The user provided a list of rows from 0 to 44. Each row starts with the season, so I need to find the one labeled \"1983.\" Let me count down from the top:\n\nRow 0: 2001\nRow 1: 2002\n...\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, looking back, maybe I'm miscounting. The user listed rows starting from 0 as season 2001 up to row 44 for 2018.\n\nWait, perhaps the first few rows are earlier years. Let me check:\n\nRow 0: 2001\nRow 1: 2002\n...\nContinuing down, I think Row 30 is 2001, but wait, no\u2014actually, looking at the table, each row's season seems to be in order from 1983 onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list out all the rows with their seasons:\n\nLooking at the data provided, each row starts with \"season: \". For example:\n\nRow 0: season: 2001\nRow 1: season: 2002\n...\nContinuing down, I see Row 30 is 2001? Wait, that can't be. Maybe the rows are in reverse order. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the first few lines after the Claim:\n\n- The table starts with \"season: 1983, Air Force - Navy score: 44 -17\"\n\nWait, no, actually, the user's initial data seems to have a list of rows from 0 to 40-something, each starting with \"season: \", followed by the year.\n\nSo Row 0 is season: 2001\nRow 1: 2002\n...\nContinuing until Row 30 is 2001 again? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps each row is a separate entry, not necessarily in order. Wait, no, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows are actually entries for each season from 1983 to 2018. So Row 0 would correspond to 2001, but then how does that fit? Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is structured as a list of seasons with their respective data. So to find the 1983 row, I need to scan each row until I find \"season: 1983\".\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- Row 0: season: 2001\n- Row 1: 2002\n- ...\nWait, no, actually, when looking at the user's table, it starts with:\n\n\"Row 30: season: 2001...\" up to \"Row 44: season: 2018...\"\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me try again.\n\nThe user provided a table where each row is numbered from 0 to 44, and each starts with the season, e.g., Row 0: season: 2001, Air Force - Navy score: 24 -18, etc.\n\nSo to find the row for 1983, I need to look through each row's season until I find one that says \"1983.\"\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 30: season: 2001\nRow 31: 2002\n...\nWait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the user's table, it starts from Row 0 as 2001 and goes up to Row 44 as 2018. So 1983 isn't among them. That can't be right because the claim refers to 1983.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the user's data:\n\nThey listed rows from 0 to 40-something, each starting with \"season: \", then the year and scores.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 30: season: 2001\nRow 31: 2002\n...\nContinuing up to Row 44: 2018.\n\nBut 1983 isn't listed in any of these rows. That can't be, because the claim is about 1983.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted or misunderstood how the table is structured. Alternatively, maybe the user's data starts with 2001 and goes up to 2018, but then where is 1983?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for a row that says \"season: 1983.\" If none of the rows provided by the user include 1983, then perhaps the claim is about a different data point.\n\nWait, perhaps the table includes earlier years as well. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the user's data, they have entries starting from 2001 up to 2018. So if 1983 isn't among them, that would mean there's no row for 1983 in the provided table.\n\nBut that can't be correct because the claim is about 1983. Maybe I misread the rows. Let me check again:\n\nRow 0: season: 2001\nRow 1: 2002\n...\nWait, perhaps the first row is actually 1983? Let me see:\n\nThe user's data starts with Row 0 as \"season: 2001... Air Force - Navy score: 24 -18...\" and so on up to Row 44.\n\nSo 1983 isn't among the rows provided. Therefore, there is no entry for 1983 in the table, which would mean that the claim's data point doesn't exist in the given information.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the user says \"the table\" which presumably includes all relevant data points up to 2018. So perhaps I missed a row where season: 1983 is present.\n\nWait, let me check each row again more carefully:\n\nLooking at the user's data, they listed rows from 0 (2001) to 44 (2018). So 1983 would fall between 2001 and 2018. Therefore, I need to find a row where season: is 1983.\n\nBut looking through the list provided by the user, I don't see any row with season: 1983.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me check again:\n\nThe user's data after the Claim says:\n\nRow 0: season: 2001, Air Force - Navy score: 24-18\n\nRow 30: season: 2001? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the user's table as provided in the query, it starts with Row 0: season: 2001 and ends with Row 44: season: 2018. So 1983 is not included.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data for 1983 in the table, the claim refers to a score that doesn't exist in the provided information.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the rows. Let me check:\n\nThe user's table includes multiple rows, each with season, and scores for Air Force vs Navy. For example:\n\nRow 30: season: 2001\nRow 31: 2002\n...\nRow 44: 2018\n\nSo yes, 1983 is not among them.\n\nWait, but that would mean the claim is incorrect because there's no data for 1983 in the table. Therefore, the answer would be that the claim is false because the score for 1983 isn't listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the rows are structured. Maybe each row corresponds to a different aspect or year beyond what's listed.\n\nBut given the information provided, there's no row with season: 1983, so the Air Force - Navy score for that year isn't in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the data doesn't support it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the statement: \"in 1983, the air force - navy score be 44 -17.\" To verify this, we need to check if there is an entry for the season 1983 in the provided table. \n\nUpon examining the table:\n\n- The table starts from the year 2001 (Row 0) and goes up to 2018 (Row 44).\n- There is no row corresponding to the year 1983.\n\nSince there is no data for the season 1983, the claim that the Air Force - Navy score was 44 -17 in 1983 cannot be supported by the provided information. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because there is no entry for the season 1983 in the table.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to verify the claim: \"the score for air force - navy have all been decided up until 2018.\" First, I should understand what this means. It seems like it's stating that by 2018, every game between the Air Force and Navy teams had their scores finalized.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a season from 2001 to 2018, except for some years where data is incomplete or pending (like 2014, 2016, 2018). Each season has three scores: Air Force vs. Navy, Air Force vs. Army, and Army vs. Navy.\n\nI need to check each of these scores up until 2018 to ensure there are no undecided games. Starting from row 0 to row 44, I should focus on the \"air force - navy score\" column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row:\n\n- Rows 0 (2001) to 40 (2011): These have decided scores for Air Force vs. Navy.\n- Row 41 (2012): Scores are present, so they're decided.\n- Rows 42 and beyond: 2014, 2016, and 2018 are tricky. For row 42 (2014), the game was played on October 4th at the Air Force base, but I don't see a final score there\u2014it says \"tbd,\" which probably means \"to be decided\" or pending. Similarly, rows 43 and 44 for 2016 and 2018 also have \"tbd,\" meaning those games haven't been played yet or their results aren't finalized as of the data provided.\n\nSince the claim is about scores up until 2018 being decided, any row after 2011 with a score that's still pending (like rows 42, 43, and 44) would mean the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, there are undecided scores beyond 2011, specifically in 2014, 2016, and 2018.\n\nSo, I should check all the cells where \"air force - navy score\" is either decided or pending up until 2018. The relevant rows are from row 0 to row 44 because even though some scores are pending, they're still within the timeframe mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 42,\n      \"column_name\": \"air force - navy score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 43,\n      \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 44,\n      \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to verify the claim that for the 1983 season, the Air Force - Navy score is TBD. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. The rows are labeled from 0 to 44, presumably corresponding to different seasons. I'm focusing on row 30 because it's the 2001 season, but wait, no, the claim is about 1983, so I need to find the relevant row for 1983.\n\nWait, looking at the table, the rows are listed from 0 to 44, and each corresponds to a specific season. For example, row 0 is season 2001, row 30 is 2001 again? Hmm, that might be confusing. Wait no, actually, let me count properly.\n\nRow numbers in the table start at 0, so each row represents a season. So row 0 is 1983 because the first entry after \"Claim\" says, \"for the 1983 season.\" Wait, no, the claim is about 1983, but looking at the table, the first rows are from 2001 onwards, with some going back to earlier years.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check: The table starts after the claim, so row 0 is probably 2012 or something else. Wait no, in the table, the first entry is Row 0: season 2012. Then it goes down to 2003, etc., with some rows having seasons like 2001, 2002, up to 2018.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to figure out which row corresponds to the 1983 season. Looking at the table, the highest row is 44 for 2018. The lowest seems to be around row 32 or so. Wait, in the table, it's not clear. Let me check the details:\n\n- Row 0: 2012\n- ...\n- Row 30: 2001\n- Row 31: 2002\n- Row 32: 2003\n- ...\n- So maybe I need to go back from row 40 onwards.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nRow 39 is 2010\nRow 40 is 2011\nRow 41 is 2012\nRow 42 is 2014\nRow 43 is 2016\nRow 44 is 2018\n\nSo 1983 isn't among these. Therefore, I need to check if there's a row for 1983 in the table.\n\nWait, looking at the rows provided, it seems that only from row 30 upwards are the more recent years, with earlier years possibly missing or maybe the initial rows aren't fully listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table starts at 2001. So the earliest season in the table is 2001 (row 0), and the latest is 2018 (row 44). Therefore, 1983 isn't present in the table because it's before 2001. Hence, any score for 1983 wouldn't be listed.\n\nSo if I'm looking for the Air Force - Navy score for 1983, since there's no row for that season in the table, the information isn't available. Therefore, the claim that \"the Air Force - Navy score for 1983 is TBD\" would not be fully supported by the table because the data doesn't exist.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table structure. Maybe each row corresponds to a specific aspect of the season, but the seasons listed start from 2001 onwards. Therefore, the 1983 season isn't included in the table at all. Hence, there's no data point for Air Force - Navy score in that season.\n\nIn conclusion, since the table doesn't have an entry for 1983, the claim can't be fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Air Force - Navy\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions provided. The claim says that all but one season have an Army-Navy game in Baltimore, MD at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to see where the games are held. Starting from Row 0 (Season 2001) up to Row 44 (Season 2018), I need to check the column named \"army - navy score\" because that's where the venue information is listed.\n\nI notice that in some rows, like Row 42 (Season 2014), the game was played at M&T Bank Stadium. Then there are other rows, such as Row 39 (Season 2010) and Row 40 (Season 2011), which also mention the stadium. However, I see that not all seasons have a venue listed. For example, Row 43 (Season 2016) and Row 44 (Season 2018) don't specify where the game was held\u2014both just say \"tbd\" for \"army - navy score.\"\n\nWait, looking closer, actually, in the table provided, each row has a column named \"army - navy score,\" but sometimes it's about the scores and other times it's about the venue or TBD. So, I need to check if for each season except one, there's an entry indicating the game was held in Baltimore.\n\nI go through each season:\n\n- 2001: Played at M&T Bank Stadium.\n- 2002: Played at the same venue.\n- 2003: Also at M&T Bank Stadium.\n- ... This continues until Season 2010, which is also at the stadium.\n- Then there's Season 2014, 2016, and 2018, all of which have \"tbd\" for their game location. But since they are \"tbd,\" it might mean that the venue wasn't specified or maybe they didn't play in Baltimore.\n\nWait, but according to the claim, only one season doesn't have a game there. However, looking at the data, Seasons 2016 and 2018 don't specify the venue, which could imply they weren't played in Baltimore. But it's unclear if \"tbd\" means they were supposed to play there or not.\n\nAlso, Season 2009 (Row 38) mentions \"M&T Bank Stadium\" but with \"(ot)\" perhaps indicating an overtime game, so that's still considered as being held there.\n\nLooking at the rows from 0 to 44, I need to count how many have a venue listed as M&T Bank Stadium. Most do except for Rows 43 and 44 (Seasons 2016 and 2018), which just say \"tbd.\" But the claim says all but one season have such games in Baltimore.\n\nWait, maybe the key is whether they had an Army-Navy game there or not. If a row doesn't specify where it was held, does that mean the game wasn't played? Or was it still played elsewhere?\n\nThe problem is that without knowing whether \"tbd\" means the venue wasn't used or just unspecified, it's hard to say. But the claim says all but one season have games in Baltimore. If any season didn't play there, then the claim is false.\n\nGiven that Seasons 2016 and 2018 are listed as \"tbd,\" which might mean they weren't played at M&T Bank Stadium, that would mean more than one season doesn't meet the condition. However, if \"tbd\" means the venue was still Baltimore but just not specified in the table, then only one season (maybe 2014) didn't have info.\n\nBut looking back, Row 42 (Season 2014) does specify M&T Bank Stadium as well, so maybe only Seasons 2016 and 2018 are missing. That would mean two seasons without a game there, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, if \"tbd\" is considered as not having a game in Baltimore, then more than one season doesn't meet it, hence the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows that while most seasons have an Army-Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium, the data for 2016 and 2018 isn't specified. This indicates they might not have been played there, exceeding one exception.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"army - navy score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
