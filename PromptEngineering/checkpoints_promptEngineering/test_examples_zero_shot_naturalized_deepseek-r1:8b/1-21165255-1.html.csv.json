    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim in question is: \"the number in season for 4300062 be 19.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that for the production code \"4300062,\" the corresponding \"number in season\" is 19. \n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, production code, and us viewers (millions). The relevant column here is \"no in season,\" which probably stands for the episode's number within its season. \n\nSo I need to find the row where the production code is \"4300062\" and then check what the \"no in season\" value is for that row. If it's 19, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the production code matching \"4300062.\" \n\nLooking at Row 18: The production code is 4300062. The column for \"no in season\" here is 62. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the claim says 19. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait no, each row's \"no in series\" increments by 1 starting from 45 up to 64 across the table. So Row 18 has production code 4300062 and \"no in season\" is 62. Therefore, the number in season for this specific production code is 62, not 19.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it's 19 is incorrect. The correct number is 62.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are identified by finding the row with production code \"4300062\" and checking its \"no in season\" value, which is 62, not 19.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
