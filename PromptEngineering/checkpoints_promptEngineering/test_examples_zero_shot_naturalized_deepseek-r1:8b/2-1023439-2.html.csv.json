    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has five rows, each with year, title, us, us r&b, and us dance columns.\n\nThe claim says: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9.\" So I need to check if in 1986, when the US R&B column is 9, the US Dance column is 6.\n\nFirst, I should look at row 3 because the year is 1986. Let me check what the values are for that row. The us r&b is 9 and us dance is 6. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but also there's row 4 which is another entry for 1986. In row 4, both us and us r&b and us dance are -, which probably means missing data or not applicable. So row 4 isn't relevant here because it doesn't have any numbers to check against.\n\nSo the only relevant data point is row 3, where in 1986, when us r&b is 9, us dance is indeed 6. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let me double-check if there are any other rows for 1986 with us r&b as 9. In row 3, it's 9 and 6, which fits. Row 4 is -, so no. So yes, only row 3 is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row 3, column \"us dance\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks that in 1986, when US R&B is 9, US Dance is 6. This condition is met in row 3 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and check which cells are relevant.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986\". \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with specific details. The columns involved here are 'title', 'year', 'us', 'us r&b', and 'us dance'. \n\nThe key parts of the claim are:\n1. \"under the influence chart\" refers to the title in the table.\n2. It mentions being at 56 in the US in both 1985 and 1986.\n\nLet's go through each relevant year mentioned in the claim: 1985 and 1986.\n\nIn 1985 (Row 2):\n- The title is \"mechanical emotion\".\n- The 'us' column has a value of 107, which doesn't match the claimed 56.\n- So, this row isn't directly supporting the claim.\n\nIn 1986 (Row 3):\n- The title is \"under the influence\", matching part of the claim.\n- The 'us' column here is 56, which matches the claim's figure for 1986.\n- Additionally, since the claim refers to both 1985 and 1986, but Row 2 doesn't match, we check if there's a Row 1 with 1984 or another row in 1986.\n\nWait, there's also Row 4 for 1986, but it has dashes. So, Row 3 is the only one that matches 'under the influence' and 56 in the US for 1986. \n\nHowever, the claim says \"in 1985 and 1986\". Since Row 2 (1985) doesn't have the correct data, there's no support for 1985. But Row 3 does support the 1986 part.\n\nBut the instruction is to check if the entire claim is supported. The claim includes both years, so since it's not fully supported for 1985, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could mean that in both those years, the chart was at 56, but looking at Row 3: under the influence had us=56 in 1986, and Row 1 (1984) also has undress with '-', but not relevant.\n\nSo, for 1985, there's no data matching 'under the influence' and 56. Therefore, the claim is only partially true for 1986, making the overall statement FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us\"}]}",
