So the claim is that episode number 10 is entitled \"Reflection.\" I need to check if this is true based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each column in the table represents. From looking at the table, it seems like each row has several columns: no_in_series, no_in_season, title, part (if applicable), directed by, written by, original airdate, and tv broadcast.\n\nThe claim is specifically about an episode number and its title. So I need to find which row corresponds to episode 10 and then check what the title of that episode is.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: no in series:27\nRow 2: no in series:29\n...\nContinuing this way until I reach Row 10.\n\nWait, let me count properly. The first row is 1, so Row 10 would be the tenth entry. Let me check each row's no_in_series to see which one has 37 or something else? Wait, no, in the table provided, the rows are numbered from 1 to 24, but each row's no_in_series increases sequentially.\n\nWait, looking at the initial description, the user provided a table with multiple rows, each starting with \"no in series: X\". For example:\n\nRow 1: no in series:27\nRow 2: no in series:29\n...\nRow 10: no in series:37\n\nSo Row 10 is the tenth entry, and it's \"the return of nano.\" So the title for episode number 10 is \"the return of nano.\"\n\nWait, but the claim says that episode number 10 is titled \"Reflection.\" That doesn't match. So according to the table, episode number 10 isn't titled \"Reflection\"; it's something else.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The answer should be \"FALSE.\"\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm correctly identifying the episode numbers. Each row has a unique no_in_series number. For example:\n\nRow 1:27\nRow2:29\n...\nLooking at Row 10, which would have the no_in_series value as 37.\n\nSo yes, the title for that particular row (row 10) is \"the return of nano,\" not \"Reflection.\" Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode number 10 is titled \"Reflection.\" Upon examining the table, I found that the tenth entry corresponds to no_in_series:37 with a title \"the return of nano.\" Since this does not match \"Reflection,\" the claim is incorrect.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"title\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
