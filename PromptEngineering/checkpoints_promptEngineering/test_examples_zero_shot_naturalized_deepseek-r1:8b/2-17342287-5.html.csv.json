    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"there be 8 games at the boston garden , all before december 17\". Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that there are exactly eight games played at the Boston Garden, and all of these games occurred before December 17th.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several details: game number, date, opponent, score, location/attendance, and record. The key here is to identify which rows have the location as \"boston garden\" and then check if their dates are before December 17th.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row one by one and note down which ones have \"Boston Garden\" as the location and whether their date is before December 17.\n\nStarting with Row 1: game 20 on December 3. Opponent is Philadelphia 76ers, location Boston Garden. The date is Dec 3, which is before Dec 17. So this counts.\n\nRow 5: game 24 on December 8. Location is Boston Garden again. But the date here is Dec 8, which is after Dec 17? Wait, no, Dec 8 is earlier than Dec 17. Wait, no, December has 31 days, so Dec 8 comes before Dec 17. So this also counts.\n\nWait, but let me list all the rows to make sure I don't miss any.\n\nRow 1: game 20, date: Dec 3 \u2192 Boston Garden\nRow 5: game 24, date: Dec 8 \u2192 Boston Garden\nRow 6: game 25, date: Dec 11 \u2192 Boston Garden\nRow 7: game 26, date: Dec 15 \u2192 Boston Garden\nAny others?\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRows after that are from 27 onwards. Row 28 is Dec 22, which is after Dec 17.\n\nSo in total, how many games at Boston Garden before Dec 17? Let's count them.\n\nRow 1: Dec 3 \u2192 yes\nRow 5: Dec 8 \u2192 yes\nRow 6: Dec 11 \u2192 yes\nRow 7: Dec 15 \u2192 yes\n\nThat's four games. Wait, that doesn't add up to eight. So the claim is saying there are eight games at Boston Garden before Dec 17, but according to my count, only four games meet that criteria.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some rows. Let me go through each row again more carefully.\n\nRow 1: game 20, Dec 3 \u2192 yes\nRow 5: game 24, Dec 8 \u2192 yes\nRow 6: game 25, Dec 11 \u2192 yes\nRow 7: game 26, Dec 15 \u2192 yes\nNow, looking for other rows with Boston Garden:\n\nWait, Row 1 is game 20, Dec 3\nThen, let me check from the beginning again.\n\nLooking at all rows where location/attendance is \"boston garden\":\n\n- Row 1: Dec 3\n- Row 5: Dec 8\n- Row 6: Dec 11\n- Row 7: Dec 15\n\nThat's four games. So the claim says there are eight, which is incorrect. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me make sure I didn't miss any rows with Boston Garden.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Boston Garden\nRow 2: St Louis Arena\nRow 3: Cincinnati\nRow 4: New York\nRow 5: Boston Garden\nRow 6: Boston Garden\nRow 7: Boston Garden\nRow 8: Detroit\nRow 9: Boston Garden\nRow 10: Baltimore\nRow 11: Baltimore\nRow 12: Baltimore\nRow 13: Madison Square Garden\nRow 14: Providence\n\nSo rows 1,5,6,7,9 are at Boston Garden. That's five games, not eight.\n\nWait, that's another mistake in my earlier count. So I thought only four, but actually rows 1,5,6,7, and 9 are all at Boston Garden.\n\nWait, row 28 is Dec 22, which is after Dec 17, so it doesn't count towards the claim.\n\nSo let me recount:\n\nRow 1: game20, Dec3 \u2192 yes\nRow 5: game24, Dec8 \u2192 yes\nRow6: game25, Dec11\u2192yes\nRow7: game26, Dec15\u2192yes\nRow9: game28, Dec22\u2192no (date after Dec17)\n\nSo that's four games at Boston Garden before Dec17. But the claim says eight. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought row9 is Dec22, so not included. So only four games.\n\nBut let me check again: are there any other rows with Boston Garden?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRows 1,5,6,7,9: five games at Boston Garden, but among these, only four have dates before Dec17 (rows1,5,6,7). Row9 is Dec22, which is after.\n\nSo the total number of games at Boston Garden before Dec17 is four. Therefore, the claim stating there are eight such games is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 8 games at the Boston Garden before December 17. Upon reviewing the table, only four games meet both criteria: location and date. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"location\": \"Boston Garden\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"location\": \"Boston Garden\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"location\": \"Boston Garden\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"location\": \"Boston Garden\"}\n  ]\n}",
