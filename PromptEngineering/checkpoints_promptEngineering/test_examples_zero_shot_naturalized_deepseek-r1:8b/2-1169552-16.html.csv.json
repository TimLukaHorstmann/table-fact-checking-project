Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase is a bit unclear, but it seems to say that among all classes, the one labeled \"i3\" has the highest number of locomotives not built. So I need to check if class i3 indeed has the maximum \"no built\" value in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different class with various attributes: wheels, date, no built, and loco nos. The classes mentioned are h1, c3, i1, i2, i3, i4, j1, and h2.\n\nMy task is to compare the \"no built\" numbers for each class and see if i3 has the highest. Let me list out the \"no built\" values:\n\n- Row 1: no built = 5\n- Row 2: no built = 10\n- Row 3: no built = 20\n- Row 4: no built = 10\n- Row 5: no built = 27\n- Row 6: no built = 5\n- Row 7: no built = 1\n- Row 8: no built = 6\n\nNow, looking at these numbers: 5, 10, 20, 10, 27, 5, 1, 6. The highest number here is 27, which is for class i3 (Row 5). So the claim seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check each row to ensure I haven't missed anything. Let me go through them again:\n\nRow 1: h1, no built=5\nRow 2: c3, no built=10\nRow 3: i1, no built=20\nRow 4: i2, no built=10\nRow 5: i3, no built=27\nRow 6: i4, no built=5\nRow 7: j1, no built=1\nRow 8: h2, no built=6\n\nYes, class i3 does have the highest \"no built\" value at 27. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns would be \"class\" and \"no built\". For each row, I need to check if it's a match for the claim. Since the claim is about class i3, only Row 5 is relevant because that's where class i3 is listed with no built=27.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 5, column_name: \"class\"\n- Row 5, column_name: \"no built\"\n\nI think that covers it. All other rows either have a different class or a lower \"no built\" value.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"the highest no built be class i3\" is TRUE because class i3 has the maximum \"no built\" value of 27 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is saying that there's only one class in the table where the wheels are listed as \"0 - 6 - 0\", and that class must be c3. So I need to check if every other class with wheels '0 - 6 - 0' is not present or if all instances of '0 - 6 - 0' are only associated with c3.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different class with various attributes like wheels, date, no built, and loco nos. My focus here is on the 'wheels' column because that's what the claim refers to.\n\nLet me go through each row and note down which classes have the wheel configuration '0 - 6 - 0'.\n\nRow 1: Wheels are 4 - 4 - 2 \u2192 doesn't match.\nRow 2: Wheels are 0 - 6 - 0 \u2192 this is c3. So that's one instance.\nRow 3: Wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t \u2192 nope.\nRow 4: 4 - 4 - 2t \u2192 nope.\nRow 5: Same as above.\nRow 6: Same.\nRow 7: Wheels are 4 - 6 - 2t \u2192 different.\nRow 8: Wheels are 4 - 4 - 2 \u2192 not matching.\n\nSo, from the table, only row 2 (c3) has wheels '0 - 6 - 0'. That seems to support the claim because there's only one occurrence and it's c3. But wait, I should make sure that no other classes have this configuration elsewhere in the table. Since all other rows don't match, maybe the claim is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check each row again just in case I missed something. Row 2 is definitely c3 with wheels '0 - 6 - 0'. No other rows have that exact wheel count. So it seems like only c3 has '0 - 6 - 0' for wheels.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because there's only one class (c3) with that wheel configuration, and no others share it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"wheels\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at what each part of the claim means. The term \"i1 build\" refers to the number of locomotives built in class i1, and similarly, \"i3 build\" refers to the number built in class i3. The claim states that there are 7 fewer i1 builds than i3.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different locomotive class with various attributes. I need to find the relevant rows for i1 and i3.\n\nStarting with Row 3: It's labeled as class i1. The \"no built\" column here has a value of 20. So, that's 20 i1 builds.\n\nNext, looking for Row 5: This is class i3. The \"no built\" column shows 27. So, there are 27 i3 builds.\n\nNow, to check the difference between these two numbers: 27 (i3) minus 20 (i1) equals 7. That means there are indeed 7 fewer i1 builds than i3.\n\nI should also make sure that there's no other relevant information elsewhere in the table that might affect this calculation. For instance, checking if any other rows for i1 or i3 have different \"no built\" values. From the table:\n\n- Row 3 (i1): no built = 20\n- Row 5 (i3): no built = 27\n\nOther classes like i2, i4, j1, h1, h2 don't affect this comparison since they're different classes.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing two classes: i1 and c3. It says there are 10 more i1 builds than c3. So, I need to find out how many i1s were built and compare that to how many c3s were built.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different class with various attributes like wheels, date, no built (which I think means number built), and loco nos. \n\nI'll start by scanning through the rows to find where classes i1 and c3 are mentioned. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Class is h1 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 2: Class is c3 \u2013 this is one of the classes in the claim. I need to note down the number built for c3 here. The \"no built\" column says 10.\nRow 3: Class is i1 \u2013 this is the other class mentioned in the claim. Number built for i1 is also 20.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. For Row 2, c3 has no built as 10. For Row 3, i1 has no built as 20. So, according to the table, there are 20 i1s built and 10 c3s built.\n\nThe claim says \"there be 10 more i1 build than c3.\" So, subtracting the number of c3 builds from i1 builds: 20 - 10 = 10. That matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check that I haven't missed any other rows. Let me make sure there are no additional i1s or c3s beyond what's in Rows 2 and 3. Scanning through:\n\nRow 4: i2 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 5: i3 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 6: i4 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 7: j1 \u2013 not relevant.\nRow 8: h2 \u2013 not relevant.\n\nSo, only Row 2 for c3 and Row 3 for i1 are the ones that matter. Their numbers are 10 and 20 respectively, so indeed there's a difference of 10 more i1s than c3s.\n\nI think that confirms it. So, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Rows 2 (c3) and 3 (i1), where the number built for c3 is 10 and for i1 is 20.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two things: \"lowest 'no built'\" and that it \"be class i4.\" So, I think this is saying that among all the classes in the table, the lowest number under the \"no built\" column corresponds to the class i4.\n\nTo verify this, I need to look at each row of the table, focus on the \"class\" and \"no built\" columns. Specifically, for each class, I should note down their \"no built\" numbers and then see which class has the lowest number. Then, check if that class is indeed i4.\n\nLet me list out the \"no built\" values for each row:\n\n- Row 1: no built = 5\n- Row 2: no built = 10\n- Row 3: no built = 20\n- Row 4: no built = 10\n- Row 5: no built = 27\n- Row 6: no built = 5\n- Row 7: no built = 1\n- Row 8: no built = 6\n\nNow, looking at these numbers, the smallest \"no built\" is in row 7 with a value of 1. The class for row 7 is j1. So, according to this, the lowest 'no built' is for class j1, not i4.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the lowest 'no built' belongs to class i4 is FALSE because the lowest is actually for j1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest \"no built\" corresponds to class i4.

The table has several rows, each representing a different class of locomotives with various attributes like wheels, date, no built, and loco nos. The claim is about 'no built' being the highest for class h2.\n\nI need to verify if class h2 indeed has the highest number of 'no built' compared to all other classes in the table.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the only locomotive class with wheels configured as '0 - 6 - 0' is i1. So I need to check each row of the table and see if any other classes besides i1 have wheels set to '0 - 6 - 0'.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: class, wheels, date, no built, loco nos. The wheels column seems to be a key here because that's what the claim is about.\n\nStarting with Row 1: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2. So that's not '0 - 6 - 0'.\n\nRow 2: wheels are 0 - 6 - 0. This matches the pattern in question, and the class here is c3. So already, there's a class other than i1 with this wheel configuration.\n\nMoving on to Row 3: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t. Not matching.\n\nRow 4: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t as well.\n\nRow 5: same as row 4.\n\nRow 6: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2t again.\n\nRow 7: wheels are 4 - 6 - 2t, which is close but not the exact '0 - 6 - 0'.\n\nRow 8: wheels are 4 - 4 - 2. Not matching.\n\nSo, from this, Row 2 (class c3) has wheels '0 - 6 - 0'. That means there's at least one other class with that wheel configuration besides i1. Therefore, the claim is false because it claims exclusivity for class i1 when another class, c3, also has that wheel setup.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't miss any rows. The table has 8 rows in total. I've checked each one, and only Row 2 matches the wheels '0 - 6 - 0'. So yes, there's at least one other class with that configuration.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not the only class with those wheels; c3 also has them.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to check all rows for classes with wheels '0 - 6 - 0'.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, I should identify which classes we're dealing with: i1 and i3. Looking at the table, rows are numbered from 0 to 8. The relevant rows for i1 are row 2 (since class is i1) and for i3, it's row 5. Wait, actually, looking again, row 2 is class i1, right? Let me check: Row 1 is h1, Row 2 is c3, Row 3 is i1, so yes, Row 2 is i1.\n\nNow, I need to find the number of built units for i1 and i3. The column that seems relevant here is \"no built\" which likely refers to the number built. For i1, in row 2, no built is 20. For i3, it's in row 5 where no built is 27.\n\nWait, so i1 has 20 built, and i3 has 27. The claim says there are 7 more i1 builds than i3. So that would mean i1 should be i3 +7. Let me calculate: if i3 is 27, then i1 should be 34 (27+7). But in the table, i1 is only 20. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"build.\" Maybe it refers to something else? Or perhaps I have the rows wrong. Let me double-check the classes: Row 3 is i1 with no built 20, and row 5 is i3 with no built 27. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo i1 has 20, i3 has 27. The difference is 27 -20=7. So actually, i3 has 7 more builds than i1, which contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"there be 7 more i1 build than i3.\" If i1 is less, then the claim is wrong. So answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, about the relevant cells: I need to list the cells that confirm this. For i1, it's row 2 (i1 class) and \"no built\" column, which is 20.

So I need to find out how many i1 and c3 were built and see if the difference is exactly 10.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different class with various attributes like wheels, date, no built (which I assume refers to the number built), and loco nos (probably locomotive numbers). \n\nI'll start by identifying the rows for i1 and c3. \n\n- For i1: Scanning through the table, I see Row 3 is class i1. The \"no built\" column here has a value of 20.\n  \n- For c3: Looking at Row 2, it's class c3 with \"no built\" as 10.\n\nNow, calculating the difference: 20 (i1) - 10 (c3) equals 10. That seems to support the claim that there are 10 fewer i1 builds than c3.\n\nWait a second, but I should double-check if \"no built\" is indeed referring to the number of locomotives built for each class. If \"no built\" indicates something else, like the number not built or another metric, my calculation might be off. But given that it's the only numerical value in those rows related to production, it's likely correct.\n\nSo, based on this, there are exactly 10 fewer i1 builds than c3. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"there be 10 fewer i1 build than c3\" is TRUE or FALSE, I need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Classes:**\n   - The claim compares two classes: **i1** and **c3**.\n   \n2. **Locate Rows for i1 and c3:**\n   - **i1** is found in Row 3 with a \"no built\" value of **20**.\n   - **c3** is located in Row 2 with a \"no built\" value of **10**.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of c3 builds from i1 builds: **20 (i1) - 10 (c3) = 10**.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are 10 fewer i1 builds than c3, which aligns with the calculated difference.\n\n**Conclusion:** The claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
