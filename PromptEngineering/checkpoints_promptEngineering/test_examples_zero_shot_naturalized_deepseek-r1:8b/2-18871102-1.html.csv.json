Let's start by breaking down the claim: \"olympic have an ihsaa class / football / soccer of 4a / 5a / 2a and join after 1926.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify where \"Olympic\" fits into the table. Looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Mascot is Indians\n- Row 2: School is Huntington North with mascot Vikings\n- Row 3: Kokomo with Wildkats\n- Row 4: Logansport Community with Berries\n- Row 5: Marion with Giants\n- Row 6: Muncie Central with Bearcats\n- Row 7: New Castle Chrysler with Trojans\n- Row 8: Richmond with Red Devils\n\nHmm, I don't see a row with \"Olympic\" as the mascot. Wait, looking at the 'previous conference' column in Row 2, it's Olympic. Oh, but the claim mentions the school name, so maybe that's different.\n\nWait, the claim says \"olympic have...\", which might refer to a school named Olympic. Let me check each row again for any mention of Olympic as the school or mascot. It seems none of the rows have \"Olympic\" in the 'school' column. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the previous conference was Olympic, but that's in Row 2 for Huntington North.\n\nSo if the claim is about a school named Olympic, there's no such row provided. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported because there's no data for an Olympic school in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a school named \"Olympic\" with specific IHSAA class and joining details. The table doesn't include any row where the school is \"Olympic,\" so the claim isn't supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the county that joined after 1926 and have participated in the olympic conference be 35 huntington.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts. It mentions two main criteria:\n1. Joined the conference after 1926.\n2. Have participated in the Olympic conference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a school with various attributes, including \"year joined\" and \"previous conference.\"\n\nI should look for rows where the \"year joined\" is after 1926 because that means they joined later. Then, I need to check if any of those schools have participated in the Olympic conference.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Row 1: Joined in 1926 (not after)\n- Row 2: Joined in 2003 (after 1926), previous conference was \"olympic\"\n- Row 3: Joined in 1926\n- Row 4: Joined in 1926\n- Row 5: Joined in 1933\n- Row 6: Joined in 1926\n- Row 7: Joined in 1926\n- Row 8: Joined in 1926\n\nSo, only Row 2 meets the first criteria of joining after 1926 (2003). Now, checking its previous conference: it's \"olympic.\" \n\nWait, but the claim says \"have participated in the olympic conference,\" and this school's previous conference was \"olympic.\" So that fits. But wait, the table shows that Row 2 is \"huntington north,\" which has county \"35 huntington.\"\n\nSo, according to the table, Huntington North joined after 1926 (2003) and participated in the Olympic conference. Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the county part. The claim mentions \"the county that join... be 35 huntington.\" Looking at Row 2, yes, the county is listed as 35 huntington. So it's Huntington North with those attributes.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Hence, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that \"huntington north\" joined after 1926 and participated in the Olympic conference with a county code of 35 huntington.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through Row 1, yes, it's Anderson with several attributes listed.\n\nNext, the claim mentions an enrollment of 1884. Looking at Row 1's 'enrollment' column, that number is indeed 1884. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, checking the county. The claim refers to \"48 Madison County.\" Looking at the 'county' column for Anderson (Row 1), it's listed as \"48 madison\". Wait a minute, there's a space before the number? Hmm, but in the table, the entry is written as \"48 madison\" without any leading zero. So that might be a discrepancy. However, sometimes county codes can be represented with the numerical part first, so 48 Madison County makes sense.\n\nLastly, the mascot. The claim says they have a Viking mascot. Looking at Row 1's 'mascot' column, it's \"indians\". Vikings are not Indians; that seems like a mistake.

Let me start by carefully reading the claim and understanding what it's asking.\n\nThe claim says: \"the / county that have a year join less than 1926 , and a previous conference of independent be 35 huntington.\" Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that there are counties where the school joined before 1926 and their previous conference was \"independent,\" specifically referring to the county with the number 35 Huntington.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like location, mascot, county, enrollment, etc. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"year joined\" and \"previous conference.\" \n\nFirst, I need to find schools that joined before 1926, so their year joined is less than 1926. Then, among those, check if any have a previous conference of \"independent\" and are located in the county with the number 35 Huntington.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Year joined is 1926. So not less than.\nRow 2: School is Huntington North, location is Huntington, county 35. Year joined 2003, which is after 1926.

So there's no school that both joined before 1926 (which would be none, since the earliest is 1926) and have a previous conference of independent while being in county 35 Huntington.\n\nSo the claim seems to be false because there are no such counties meeting those criteria.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"independent be the previous conference that have an ihsaa class / football / soccer of 3a / 4a / 2a , and a year join larger than 1926.\"\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me rephrase it. The claim is saying that the previous conference \"independent\" has an IHSAA classification in football/soccer as 3A/4A/2A and joined before 1926. Hmm, no, wait: actually, the wording is \"previous conference that have...\". So it's claiming that for the independent conference, their ihsaa class includes 3a / 4a / 2a and they joined before 1926.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row has a 'previous conference' column. Let me check the data.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which schools have \"independent\" as their previous conference and whether they meet the IHSAA classification and year joined criteria.\n\nRow 1: School Anderson. Previous conference: Independents. Their ihsaa class is 4a /5a /2a, so that's not matching 3a/4a/2a. Also, they joined in 1926, which is equal to the cutoff, but the claim says \"year join larger than 1926,\" meaning after 1926? Or is it greater than, meaning more recent? So if a school joined in 1926, does that count as larger than 1926? No, because 1926 isn't larger than itself. So this row doesn't meet both conditions.\n\nRow 2: Huntington North. Previous conference: Olympic. So not independents, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 3: Kokomo. Previous conference: Independents. Their ihsaa class is 4a /5a /2a. Not matching the required 3a/4a/2a. They joined in 1926 again, same issue as Row 1.\n\nRow 4: Logansport Community. Previous conference: Independents. Their ihsaa class is 4a /4a /2a. So not matching the required 3a/4a/2a. Joined in 1926, so same problem.\n\nRow 5: Marion. Previous conference: Independents. IHSAA class is 4a /4a /2a. Not matching. Joined in 1933, which is after 1926, but let's see if the claim requires it to be larger than 1926. So 1933 is larger than 1926? Yes, because 1926 +1 is 1927, and 1933 is later. But the IHSAA class doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: Muncie Central. Previous conference: Independents. Their ihsaa class is 3a /4a /2a. Oh, that matches the required classification. Did they join before 1926? No, they joined in 1926, which is not larger than 1926.\n\nRow 7: New Castle Chrysler. Previous conference: Independents. IHSAA class is 4a/4a/2a. Doesn't match. Joined in 1926.\n\nRow 8: Richmond. Previous conference: Independents. Their ihsaa class is 4a /5a /2a, so no match. Joined in 1926.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows, only Kokomo and Logansport have independent as previous conference but joined in 1926. Kokomi's IHSAA doesn't match, and neither does Logansport's. Marion is another one with independent but also not matching the classification and year.\n\nWait, no, Row 5: Marion has ihsaa class of 4a /4a /2a, which doesn't match. So none of the schools that are independents have both the correct IHSAA classification (3a/4a/2a) and joined after 1926. Because all the independent schools either didn't meet the classification or joined in 1926, which isn't larger than themselves.\n\nSo the claim is claiming that \"independent\" is a previous conference with those specific classifications and a year join larger than 1926. But based on the table, there are no such schools. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis shows none of the schools with the previous conference \"Independent\" meet both the required IHSAA classification and joined after 1926. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class / football / soccer\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"huntington north in location kokomo join in 2003 and have a viking mascot.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim to check against the table. Let's see:\n\n1. **Location Check**: The claim mentions \"kokomo\" as the location. Looking at the table, I need to find if there's a row where the school is Huntington North and the location is Kokomo.\n\n2. **Year Joined Check**: The claim states they joined in 2003. So, I'll look for Huntington North's year of joining.\n\n3. **Mascot Check**: The claim says the mascot is \"vikings.\" So, I need to verify if Huntington North's mascot is listed as Vikings.\n\nNow, going through each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: School: Anderson, location: Anderson, mascot: Indians, county: 48 Madison, etc. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 2**: School: Huntington North, location: Huntington, mascot: Vikings, county: 35 Huntington, enrollment: 1750, and so on. This seems relevant because it's Huntington North with the Viking mascot. But wait, the location here is Huntington, not Kokomo. So that's a discrepancy.\n  \nWait a second, maybe I misread the claim? The claim says \"in kokomo,\" but Row 2's location is Huntington. So that might be an issue.\n\nBut hold on, let me check all rows again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe there's another row for Huntington North in Kokomi?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- **Row 2**: school: huntington north, location: huntington\n- No other rows mention Huntington North with a different location.\n\nSo, Huntington North is only listed at Row 2 with location Huntington. Therefore, the claim about them being in Kokomo seems incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"huntington north in location kokomi,\" which might mean that Huntington North's mascot is Viking and they joined in 2003 while being located in Kokomi. But according to the table, Huntington North is in Huntington, not Kokomi.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: location and year joined. Since the table shows Huntington North joined in 2003 (Row 2) but their location is Huntington, not Kokomi, that makes part of the claim false.\n\nAdditionally, checking the mascot: Row 2 does have Vikings as the mascot. So the mascot part is correct.\n\nBut since the location is incorrect, the entire claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if there's another row where Huntington North is in Kokomi. But looking through all rows, only Row 2 mentions Huntington North with location Huntington. There's no other entry for Huntington North elsewhere.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- **Row 2**: Column \"school\" (to confirm it's Huntington North), column \"location\" (to check it's Huntington, not Kokomi), and column \"year joined\" to confirm it's 2003.\n- Also, column \"mascot\" to confirm it's Vikings.\n\nBut since the location in Row 2 is Huntington, not Kokomi, that makes the claim incorrect. So overall, the answer would be FALSE because the location doesn't match.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe claim says \"huntington north in location kokomo.\" The table only has one entry for Huntington North at Row 2 with location Huntington. Therefore, it's not located in Kokomi.
