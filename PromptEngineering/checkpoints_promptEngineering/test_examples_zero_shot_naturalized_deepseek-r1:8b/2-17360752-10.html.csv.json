    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. The claim says, \"game 82 after date 7 have a score of 2 - 3.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided. It has six rows, each representing a different game with various details. My main focus will be on finding the relevant information related to the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions \"game 82 after date 7.\" So, I need to find the row where the game number is 82 and the date is after the 7th. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Game 77, Date 1 \u2013 Not our target.\nRow 2: Game 78, Date 3 \u2013 Not our target.\nRow 3: Game 79, Date 4 \u2013 Not our target.\nRow 4: Game 80, Date 7 \u2013 This is the first game after date 7.\nRow 5: Game 81, Date 9 \u2013 Also after date 7.\nRow 6: Game 82, Date 11 \u2013 Definitely after date 7.\n\nSo, the relevant games here are 80, 81, and 82. Now, looking at the claim again, it's about \"game 82 after date 7.\" Therefore, I need to focus on Row 6 (Game 82) specifically.\n\nNow, checking the score for Game 82: The score is listed as 2 - 3. That matches exactly what the claim states. So, based on this, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The claim mentions \"after date 7,\" which includes all games with dates after the 7th. But the exact wording is about game 82 specifically, so only Row 6 is relevant here.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the relevant cells are row_index 6 and column_name \"score.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Game 82 occurring after date 7 with a score of 2-3. From the table, Game 82 on November 11th has a score of 2 - 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"pittsburgh penguin be the opponent at the mellon arena 17132 fan in attendance.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several attributes like game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. The claim mentions three specific things: Pittsburgh Penguins as the opponent, Mellon Arena as the location, and an attendance figure of 17,132.\n\nI'll start by checking if there's any row where the opponent is \"Pittsburgh Penguins\" at Mellon Arena with an attendance of 17,132.\n\nLooking at Row 1: The opponent is listed as \"pittsburgh penguins,\" which matches. The location is Mellon Arena and the attendance is 17132. This seems to fit all parts of the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are other rows where this might also be true or if it's unique to Row 1. Scanning through the rest of the rows:\n\nRow 2: Opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning.\nRow 3: Buffalo Sabres.\nRow 4: Toronto Maple Leafs.\nRow 5: Ottawa Senators.\nRow 6: Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nNone of these opponents are Pittsburgh Penguins, so only Row 1 fits. Also, the attendance in Row 1 is exactly 17132, matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there's a row where all the conditions of the claim are met, the answer should be TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"tampa bay lightning be the opponent when the score be 4 - 5 in overtime.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its key components. The opponent is supposed to be the Tampa Bay Lightning. The score is 4-5, and it's in overtime (which means it went into extra time or sudden death). \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several attributes: game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. My focus should be on finding rows where the opponent is the Tampa Bay Lightning and where the score is 4-5 in overtime.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to check for these conditions.\n\nRow 1:\n- Game: 77\n- Opponent: Pittsburgh Penguins \u2013 not our team.\n- Score: 1 - 6 \u2013 not 4-5.\nSo, this row doesn't fit.\n\nRow 2:\n- Game: 78\n- Date: 3\n- Opponent: Tampa Bay Lightning \u2013 yes, that's the opponent we're looking for.\n- Score: 4 - 5 (OT) \u2013 the score is exactly what the claim states.\nSo, this row meets both conditions. Therefore, the cell in row 2, column \"opponent\" and \"score\" are relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- Opponent: Buffalo Sabres \u2013 not our team.\nSo, skip.\n\nRow 4:\n- Opponent: Toronto Maple Leafs \u2013 not our team.\nScore: 4 -1 \u2013 nope.\n\nRow5:\n- Opponent: Ottawa Senators \u2013 nope.\nScore: 3-2 (SO) \u2013 sudden death, but opponent is wrong.\n\nRow6:\n- Opponent: Carolina Hurricanes \u2013 nope.\nScore: 2-3 \u2013 not 4-5.\n\nSo the only row that fits both conditions is Row2.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells in the table are relevant to support this claim.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"the score 3 - 2 be on date 4 after game 78.\" \n\nBreaking it down, we have two main parts here. The first part is the score \"3 - 2,\" and the second part mentions a date (4) and an event happening after game 78.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different game with various attributes like game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. \n\nTo verify the claim, I need to find if there's a game where the score is \"3 - 2\" occurring on date 4 after game 78.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** Game 77, Date 1, Score 1 - 6\n- **Row 2:** Game 78, Date 3, Score 4 - 5 (OT)\n- **Row 3:** Game 79, Date 4, Score 3 - 2\n- **Row 4:** Game 80, Date 7, Score 4 - 1\n- **Row 5:** Game 81, Date 9, Score 3 - 2 (SO)\n- **Row 6:** Game 82, Date 11, Score 2 - 3\n\nLooking for a score of \"3 - 2,\" I see that this occurs in Row 3 and Row 5. \n\nNow, checking the dates: \n- Row 3 is on Date 4.\n- Row 5 is on Date 9.\n\nThe claim specifies \"date 4,\" so Row 3's date matches. However, the claim also mentions \"after game 78.\" Let's see when each of these games happened relative to game 78.\n\nGame 78 is in Row 2 with a date of 3. So, any game after that would be Rows 3 (Date 4) and beyond.\n\nRow 3: Game 79, Date 4, Score 3 - 2 \u2192 This occurred after game 78.\nRow 5: Game 81, Date 9, Score 3 - 2 \u2192 Also after game 78.\n\nSo both Row 3 and Row 5 have the score \"3 - 2\" on date 4 (Row 3) and date 9 (Row 5). Since the claim refers to \"date 4,\" only Row 3 is directly relevant. However, I need to check if the specific wording of the claim aligns with this.\n\nThe claim says the score \"3 - 2\" is on date 4 after game 78. So, does a game occur on date 4 where the score was 3-2? Yes, that's Row 3 (Game 79). Therefore, it supports the claim.\n\nSo, to confirm, I should mark Row 3 as relevant because it has the score \"3 - 2\" on date 4 after game 78.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 3, which has a score of 3-2 on date 4 after game 78. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The game has a score of 4-5.\n2. The game went into overtime.\n3. The game was held at the Prudential Center.\n4. The attendance for that game was 17,625.\n\nNow, I'll check each condition against the table provided.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Score is 1-6 (no)\nRow 2: Score is 4-5 (yes), decision is Brodeur, location is Prudential Center, attendance 17,625 (yes).\nRow 3: Score is 3-2 (no)\nRow 4: Score is 4-1 (no)\nRow 5: Score is 3-2 (so) \u2013 wait, \"so\" might mean shootout?

Looking at Row 2, the score is indeed 4-5 and it's in overtime (OT). The location is Prudential Center, attendance 17,625. So all conditions are met here.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there exists such a game in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe game with the score of 4-5 that went into overtime was held at the Prudential Center with an attendance of 17,625.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is about the final score of game 82 being a certain number before a specific date. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"final score of the game 82 hold before date 7 be 2 - 3.\" I think this means that on or before July 7th (date 7), the final score for game 82 was 2-3. \n\nNow, looking at the table, each row corresponds to a different game. The columns include game number, date, opponent, score, decision, location/attendance, and record. I'm particularly interested in the 'score' column because the claim is about the final score.\n\nI need to locate game 82 in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Game 77\n- Row 2: Game 78\n- Row 3: Game 79\n- Row 4: Game 80\n- Row 5: Game 81\n- Row 6: Game 82\n\nSo, game 82 is in row 6. Let me check the date for game 82. The 'date' column says November 11th (date: 11). That's much later than July 7th. \n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"before date 7,\" which I assume refers to before July 7th. But game 82 was on November 11th, after July 7th. Therefore, the final score of game 82 would have been recorded after that date. So if someone is claiming that as of July 7th, the final score was 2-3, but in reality, the game happened later.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"final score of the game 82 hold before date 7.\" Does this mean the score at some point before July 7th? But the game was played after that date. So perhaps the score as of July 7th wasn't yet finalized because the game hadn't happened yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is implying that on or before July 7th, the final score was 2-3. However, since game 82 was on November 11th, it's not possible for the score to have been 2-3 as of July 7th because the game hadn't occurred yet.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column for game 82: it's November 11. So before that date, including July 7, the final score wouldn't have happened yet. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because game 82 took place after July 7, so the score couldn't have been finalized by then.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term \"final score\" refers to something else, like the result as of a certain point before the date, but I'm not sure that makes sense. The score is tied to the game itself, which occurs on November 11th.\n\nSo, putting it together: the claim is about game 82's final score being 2-3 before July 7. Since game 82 was after July 7, this can't be true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a game that occurred after the specified date, making it impossible for the score to have been finalized before that time.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It mentions three specific pieces of information:\n\n1. **Location/Attendance**: Mellon Arena with a number 17132.\n2. **Opponent**: Buffalo Sabres.\n\nI need to check each part in the table to see if they match.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 1**: Opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins, location is Mellon Arena with attendance 17132. This doesn't match because the opponent is wrong.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Opponent is Tampa Bay Lightning, location is Prudential Center. Doesn't match either.\n\n- **Row 3**: Opponent is Buffalo Sabres. Location is HSBC Arena with attendance 18690. The opponent matches, but the location doesn't.\n\n- **Row 4**: Opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what the claim is saying. It's referring to a specific game, number 79, which occurred before date 4, and its score was 3-2.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different game with various details. The key columns here are 'game' and 'date', as well as 'score'. \n\nSo, I need to find in the table where the game number is 79 and check if the date is before day 4 (i.e., earlier than day 4). Then, verify that the score for that game is indeed 3-2.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Game 77, Date 1. Not relevant because it's game 77, not 79.\nRow 2: Game 78, Date 3. Again, not game 79.\nRow 3: Game 79, Date 4. This is the game in question. Now, check if this date (4) is before another date? Wait, the claim says \"before date 4,\" but each row has a specific date. So for game 79, it's on date 4. The wording of the claim is a bit unclear: does it mean that the score was 3-2 before date 4? Or that the game occurred before date 4 with that score?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The claim says, \"score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2.\" So maybe it's saying that the game was played before date 4 and had a score of 3-2.\n\nBut in row 3, the date is April 4th (since Date: 4). If \"before date 4\" refers to before April 4th, then the game on April 4th wouldn't be before that date. That's confusing because if the game is on date 4, it's not before date 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"hold before date 4\" means something else, like the score was maintained up until date 4. But that interpretation isn't clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is stating that on game 79, which occurred before date 4 (so earlier than April 4th), the score was 3-2. So looking for a game with number 79 where the date is less than 4 and the score is 3-2.\n\nLooking at the table, there's only one game 79 on Date: 4. There are no other games numbered 79 in the table. Therefore, if the claim is that before date 4 (i.e., earlier than April 4th), game 79 happened with a score of 3-2, but since the game was actually on date 4, it's not before that date.\n\nThis suggests that the claim might be incorrect because game 79 is on date 4, not before it. Therefore, the statement that \"score of the game 79 which hold before date 4 be 3 - 2\" would be false because the game wasn't held before date 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the claim is just checking if the score for game 79 was 3-2, regardless of the date. In that case, looking at row 3, the score is indeed 3-2. But then the mention of \"before date 4\" complicates it.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider whether the game's date is before another date 4, but in this context, each game has its own date. So if the claim refers to a game that happened on or before date 4 with a score of 3-2, then game 79 is on date 4 and has score 3-2, so it's true. But the wording says \"hold before date 4,\" which might imply prior to date 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dates are in the same month or year as day 4, but that's unclear.\n\nI think the key is to check if game 79 occurred on a date before April 4th and had a score of 3-2. Since in the table, game 79 is on date 4, which would mean it wasn't before that date. Therefore, the claim might be incorrect because the game wasn't held before date 4.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \"before date 4\" refers to a specific date or month. If it's referring to April 4th, then yes, the game is on that day. If it's referring to something else, maybe in another context.\n\nIn any case, based on the table, the claim's conditions don't fully align because game 79 isn't before its own date of 4.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a specific game (79) occurring before date 4 with a score of 3-2. However, according to the table, game 79 is listed on April 4th, meaning it's not before that date. Therefore, the conditions of the claim aren't met.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"final score against the opponent tampa bay lightning be 5 - 4 (ot)\". So, the claim is making a statement about a game where the final score was 5-4 in overtime against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find which rows and columns are relevant.
