    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table has some information in naturalized format, and the claim is a specific statement about a partner working with another person at a certain event.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. There are six rows, each corresponding to an outcome related to events like world championships (wd), Asian Games, other open tournaments, etc. Each row has several columns: outcome, event, year, venue, and partner.\n\nThe claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1985 world championship in calgary , canada.\" \n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the table data provided.\n\nStarting with the partner mentioned in the claim: it's hwang sun. Looking through the table, row 2 has a partner named kang haeng - suk. Row 6 also mentions kang haeng - suk as the partner for a different event and year. So, I don't see any mention of \"hwang sun\" anywhere in the table. This could mean that either the name is incorrect or there's no data supporting the claim.\n\nNext, the claim refers to the 1985 world championship (wd) in Calgary, Canada. Looking at row 2: outcome is 3, event is wd, year is 1985, venue is calgary, partner is kang haeng - suk. So, this row does mention the 1985 world championships in Calgary with kang haeng - suk as the partner.\n\nNow, the claim says that hwang sun partnered for the first time at this event. However, the table doesn't list any partnership between hwang sun and kang haeng - suk. Additionally, since there's no row mentioning hwang sun as a partner in 1985, it seems like the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be implying that hwang sun is the partner, not kang haeng - suk. But in the table, for the same event and year (1985), the partner is kang haeng - suk, not hwang sun.\n\nSo, even though there's a partnership at Calgary in 1985, it's between kang haeng - suk and someone else, possibly another partner. Therefore, if the claim states that hwang sun partnered with kang haeng - suk for the first time there, it would be false because the table shows kang haeng - suk as the partner, not hwang sun.\n\nMoreover, I should check if \"hwang sun\" appears anywhere in the table. The only partners mentioned are kang haeng - suk and others like asian games. So, there's no entry for hwang sun.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it incorrectly identifies the partner as hwang sun when the table shows kang haeng - suk as the partner at that event.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng - Suk at the 1985 World Championships in Calgary. However, the table indicates that Kang Haeng - Suk was the partner at that event, not Hwang Sun. Additionally, there's no record of Hwang Sun as a partner in any row.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the provided table. The claim is: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Person 1**: Hwang Sun\n2. **Partner**: Kang Haeng\n3. **Number of Times**: 3\n4. **Type of Event**: Tournament\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent different events or outcomes, with specific details like outcome, event name, year, venue, and partner.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 1**: This seems to be a header row since all cells are labeled as \"world championships.\" Doesn't provide specific info about Hwang Sun.\n  \n- **Row 2**: Outcome is 3, event is WD (World Duet), year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada. Partner is Kang Haeng-suk. This seems relevant because it mentions Kang Haeng-suk and outcome as 3, which matches the claim's number of times (3).\n  \n- **Row 3**: Outcome is 1, event Asian Games, etc. Doesn't mention Hwang Sun or Kang Haeng-suk.\n  \n- **Row 4**: Outcome 1, WD, year 1982, venue New Delhi, partner Kang Haeng-suk. This also mentions Kang Haeng-suk but the outcome is 1, not 3, so doesn't fully support the claim.\n\n- **Row 5**: Header for \"other open tournaments,\" so no specific data.\n  \n- **Row 6**: Outcome 1, WD, year 1985, venue India Open. Partner Kang Haeng-suk again, but outcome is 1, not 3.\n\nSo from Rows 2 and 4, there are instances where Kang Haeng-suk was the partner with an outcome of 1 or 3. However, the claim specifies three times (outcome:3), which only occurs in Row 2. Row 4's outcome is 1, so it doesn't add to the count.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"partnered three times,\" so each time they partner together counts as one instance. So if Row 2 is one instance with outcome 3, and Rows 2 and 6 have Kang Haeng-suk as a partner, perhaps each of these could be considered separate events where Hwang Sun partnered with him.\n\nHowever, the claim specifies \"three times at tournament,\" which may mean three different tournaments. Looking back, Row 2: WD in 1985 (Calgary), outcome 3. That's one instance. Then, looking for two more instances where Hwang Sun partners with Kang Haeng-suk and the outcome is 3.\n\nIn the table, only Row 2 has an outcome of 3. Rows 4 and 6 also mention Kang Haeng-suk but have outcomes of 1. So perhaps the total number of times Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-suk at tournaments is more than three? Or maybe it's only once.\n\nWait, the claim says \"partnered three times at tournament.\" But in the table, I see:\n\n- Row 2: outcome 3 (so perhaps that's one event where they partners and got 3, which might mean they won or placed 3rd)\n- Row 4: outcome 1\n- Row 6: outcome 1\n\nSo maybe only once did Hwang Sun partner with Kang Haeng-suk at a tournament with an outcome of 3.\n\nAlternatively, if \"partnered three times\" means three different partnerships regardless of the outcome, then Rows 2, 4, and 6 each show a partnership, making it three times. But the term \"partnered three times at tournament\" could imply that in three tournaments, they partnered together with the same or any outcome.\n\nHowever, the claim also mentions \"3 time,\" which likely refers to three instances where they achieved an outcome of 3 (maybe meaning third place). Only Row 2 shows an outcome of 3. So unless there are other rows where the outcome is 3 and partner is Kang Haeng-suk, the claim might not be fully supported.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- Row 1: outcome world championships\n- Row 2: outcome 3 (WD), partner Kang Haeng-suk\n- Row 3: outcome 1 (Asian Games)\n- Row 4: outcome 1 (WD), partner Kang Haeng-suk\n- Row 5: other open tournaments\n- Row 6: outcome 1 (WD), partner Kang Haeng-suk\n\nSo only Row 2 has an outcome of 3 with Kang Haeng-suk. Rows 4 and 6 have outcome 1, so they don't contribute to the \"three times\" aspect as specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table because there's only one instance where Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-suk at a tournament with an outcome of 3. The other instances involve different outcomes.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. If \"partnered three times\" refers to any partnerships regardless of outcome, then Rows 2,4,6 would be the three times, making it true. But if the claim specifies that each time they partnered, they had an outcome of 3 (i.e., third place), then only Row 2 supports that.\n\nThe wording is a bit ambiguous. The claim says \"partnered three time at tournament.\" It's unclear whether it refers to three partnerships or three instances with a specific outcome.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the more precise interpretation is that the claim requires three instances where they partnered together and each time achieved an outcome of 3 (i.e., third place). Since only Row 2 meets that condition, the total number of times would be one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it's not supported by the table as having three instances.\n\nAlternatively, if \"three times\" just means they partnered together in three different tournaments regardless of outcome, then Rows 2,4,6 (three rows) support it. But each row represents a single event, so three events where they were partners would be three times. However, the outcome is only 3 in Row 2, not in 4 and 6.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct approach is to require each partnership to have an outcome of 3 for the claim to be TRUE. Since there's only one such row, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng 3 time at tournament,\" we examine the table for relevant cells:\n\n- **Relevant Rows**: Row 2 (outcome: 3, partner: Kang Haeng-suk)\n  \nOnly one instance matches the required outcome of 3. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"in 1982 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman 's double event , finish first , 1 of 2 time she win an event with kang haeng\"\n\nBreaking it down, the key points are:\n- Year: 1982\n- Event: Asian Games (specifically \"double woman's double event\")\n- Hwang Sun participated and finished first.\n- This is one of two times she won an event with Kang Haeng.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to find relevant information.\n\nThe table has six rows. Each row seems to represent different events or outcomes with columns like outcome, event, year, venue, partner, etc.\n\nLooking for 1982: The only row that mentions \"other open tournaments\" in the year column doesn't seem related. Wait, no, actually, Row 4 is outcome:1, event:wd, year:1982, venue:new delhi, india, partner:kang haeng - suk.\n\nWait, so Row 4 has year 1982, which matches the claim's year of 1982. The event there is \"wd\" (probably World Championships), and partner is Kang Haeng-suk. But the claim mentions \"Asian Games\" specifically. So does that mean it's not a match?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check if any row refers to Asian Games in 1982.\n\nLooking at Row 3: outcome: asian games, event: asian games, year: asian games, venue: asian games, partner: asian games. This seems odd because the columns don't specify what each cell represents beyond their headers. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the first column is \"outcome,\" but looking at Row 2: outcome:3, event:wd, year:1985, venue:calgary, canada, partner:kang haeng - suk.\n\nSo each row has multiple columns: outcome, event, year, venue, partner. So in Row 4: the outcome is 1, event is wd (World Championships), year is 1982, venue is new delhi, india, partner is kang haeng-suk.\n\nBut the claim says Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1982. So I need to see if any row corresponds to Asian Games in 1982 with her as a participant.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: outcome: world championships (but no specific details)\nRow 2: event: wd (world championships), year:1985\nRow 3: all columns are asian games, but it's unclear what the data is. Maybe this row represents Asian Games events in general?\nRow 4: as above\nRow 5: other open tournaments\nRow 6: outcome:1, event:wd, year:1985, venue:india open\n\nWait, perhaps Row 3 is not relevant because it doesn't have specific data. Maybe the table isn't structured clearly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Row 4 refers to Asian Games in 1982, but the term \"wd\" might stand for World Championships. So if Hwang Sun participated in both World Championships and Asian Games, but the claim specifically mentions Asian Games.\n\nSo perhaps there's no row explicitly stating that she participated in Asian Games in 1982. The only 1982 row is Row 4, which is about World Championships with partner Kang Haeng-suk.\n\nWait, the claim says \"double woman's double event,\" which might be a specific event within the Asian Games or World Championships. But looking at the table, there are no rows that mention this exact event name.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any row in the table that directly supports all aspects of the claim. Specifically, it mentions the Asian Games in 1982 with Hwang Sun finishing first, which isn't directly supported by the table data provided. The only related information is from Row 4 about World Championships in 1982.\n\nSo based on this analysis, the claim doesn't have full support from the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1985 india open finish first 2 year after win the asian game.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify key elements in the claim:\n1. Partner: Hwang Sun partners with Kang Haeng.\n2. Event: It's mentioned as the \"india open.\"\n3. Year: 1985.\n4. Outcome: Finishing first or second (finish first 2 year after winning Asian Games).\n5. The context is the Asian Games win, which implies a time frame.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find relevant information:\n\nRow 1: Doesn't seem directly related as it's about \"world championships.\"\nRow 2: Outcome: 3, Event: wd (probably World Duet), Year:1985, Venue: Calgary, Partner: Kang Haeng Suk.\nThis seems related because it mentions 1985 and Kang Haeng Suk as a partner. However, the event is \"wd\" which might not be the same as \"india open.\"\n\nRow 3: All columns are \"asian games,\" so probably about Asian Games events, not directly relevant to the claim.\n\nRow 4: Outcome:1, Event: wd, Year:1982, Venue: New Delhi, Partner: Kang Haeng Suk.\nThis is also related because of the partner and outcome, but the year is 1982, not 1985.\n\nRow 5: Other open tournaments, doesn't seem relevant.\n\nRow 6: Outcome:1, Event: wd, Year:1985, Venue: India Open, Partner: Kang Haeng Suk.\nThis row seems highly relevant because it mentions Hwang Sun (I assume partner is Hwang Sun) with Kang Haeng Suk at the 1985 India Open, outcome 1. But wait, in Row 6, does \"partner\" refer to Hwang Sun or someone else? The claim says Hwang Sun partners with Kang Haeng. I need to check.\n\nWait, in Row 2 and Row 4, the partner is Kang Haeng Suk. In Row 6, the partner is Kang Haeng Suk again. So if Hwang Sun is partnered with Kang Haeng Suk, that's correct. However, the claim refers to \"Hwang sun partner with kang haeng.\" The name might be a typo or different spelling. If in the table, the partner's name is Kang Haeng Suk, not just Kang Haeng, then there's a discrepancy.\n\nAssuming that the names must match exactly, if the claim says \"kang haeng\" but the table has \"kang haeng - suk,\" it might be a different person. So perhaps the partner in the table is Kang Haeng Suk, not just Kang Haeng, which would make the claim incorrect if Hwang Sun didn't partner with just Kang Haeng.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the names are interchangeable. If so, then Row 6 supports the claim as it mentions the 1985 India Open with outcome 1, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions finishing first or second (finish first 2 year after win). In Row 6, the outcome is 1, which means first place. The year is 1985, matching the claim. However, the event in the table for Row 6 is \"wd,\" which I assume stands for World Duet, not \"india open.\" Wait, no\u2014looking back, in Row 6, venue is \"india open.\" So event is \"wd\" but venue is \"india open.\" Maybe \"wd\" refers to a specific event within the India Open?\n\nWait, in the table's naturalized format, each row has columns for outcome, event, year, venue, and partner. So Row 6: outcome:1, event: wd, year:1985, venue: india open, partner:kang haeng - suk.\n\nSo the event is \"wd,\" but the venue is \"india open.\" This might be a bit confusing. If the event is \"wd\" (maybe World Duet), then it's an event within the India Open. So in 1985, at the India Open, there was a \"wd\" event where Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng Suk finished first.\n\nSo, does this align with the claim? The claim says Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng at the 1985 India Open, finishing first or second after winning the Asian Games. The table shows that in 1985, they did partner together and finished first. However, there's no information about when they won the Asian Games. So if the claim is saying that this was two years after winning the Asian Games, we need to check if that's true.\n\nLooking at Row 6: year is 1985. If Hwang Sun won the Asian Games in a particular year, say 1983 or 1984, then 1985 would be one or two years later. But without knowing exactly when they won, it's hard to confirm.\n\nBut wait, in the table, Row 2: outcome:3, event:wd, year:1985, venue:calgary, partner:kang haeng - suk. So in 1985, they also participated in another event, maybe the World Championships in Calgary.\n\nSo if Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng Suk won the Asian Games in 1984, then the India Open in 1985 would be one year later. But the claim says \"finish first 2 year after win.\" So maybe two years after winning, which would mean 1987, but that's not in the table.\n\nAlternatively, if they won the Asian Games in 1983, then 1985 is two years later. But we don't have that info from the table.\n\nThe table doesn't specify when they won the Asian Games, so it's unclear whether 1985 was one or two years after their victory.\n\nHowever, the key points are:\n- They were partners in 1985 India Open, finishing first.\n- The claim states this happened two years after winning the Asian Games.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide the exact year they won the Asian Games, we can't confirm the timing. Therefore, the claim might be making an assumption about the timeline that isn't supported by the table data.\n\nSo, in terms of relevant cells:\n- Row 6: outcome (1), event (wd), venue (india open), partner (kang haeng - suk). All these columns support the events described in the claim.\n- Additionally, the fact that they won (outcome:1) might imply winning the Asian Games.\n\nBut the timing aspect isn't directly verifiable from the table. However, the user's instruction is to check if the claim is fully supported by the table. Since the table confirms the partnership, event, venue, and outcome in 1985 at India Open, but doesn't specify when they won the Asian Games, it might still support the claim depending on interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the claim says \"finish first 2 year after win,\" meaning that two years after winning, they finished first. If they won the Asian Games in 1983 or 1984, then 1985 is either one or two years later. The table only shows 1985 as the year, but without knowing when they won, it's unclear if it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"finish first 2 year after win\" refers to placing first and second in separate events, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, I think the claim isn't fully supported by the table because the timing of their Asian Games victory isn't provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant data from the table supports key aspects of the claim: partnership, event, venue, and outcome in 1985 at the India Open. However, the timing of their Asian Games victory is not specified, creating ambiguity about whether 1985 was the correct year. Since this critical information isn't provided, the claim cannot be fully confirmed.\n\n**Answer:**  \nFALSE",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"With her partner kang haeng, hwang sun finish in the top 3 at 3 different venue from 1982 to 1985.\"\n\nSo, I need to check if Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng (also known as Hae-Nuk) have finished in the top 3 at three different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1 seems to be a header row with general information about \"world championships.\"\n\nRow 2: outcome is 3, event is WD (probably women's doubles), year is 1985, venue is Calgary, Canada, partner is Kang Haeng-suk. So in 1985, they finished 3rd at the World Championships in Calgary.\n\nRow 4: outcome is 1, event is WD, year is 1982, venue is New Delhi, India, partner is Kang Haeng-suk. So in 1982, they won the World Championships in New Delhi.\n\nRow 6: outcome is 1, event is WD, year is 1985, venue is India Open, partner is Kang Haeng-suk. So in 1985, at the India Open, they also finished first.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"3 different venues.\" Let me list all the relevant rows:\n\nRow 2: Calgary (Canada) - 3rd place, 1985\nRow 4: New Delhi (India) - 1st place, 1982\nRow 6: India Open - 1st place, 1985\n\nSo that's three different venues: Calgary, New Delhi, and the India Open. The years covered are 1982 and two from 1985, but the timeframe is from 1982 to 1985, which includes both years.\n\nWait, but 1982 is before 1985. So the claim says \"from 1982 to 1985,\" so the period is four years: 1982, 83, 84, 85.\n\nHwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk competed in three different venues during this time:\n\n1. New Delhi (1982)\n2. Calgary (1985)\n3. India Open (1985)\n\nWait, but the India Open isn't a World Championships; it's an \"other open tournaments.\" So does that count as a venue? The claim doesn't specify the type of tournament, just the venues.\n\nSo, three different venues: New Delhi, Calgary, and India Open. But wait, in 1985, they had two finishes: one at the World Championships (Calgary) where they got 3rd, and another at the India Open where they won. So that's two different events in 1985.\n\nSo from 1982 to 1985, there are three different venues where they finished top 3:\n\n- New Delhi, 1982: 1st\n- Calgary, 1985: 3rd\n- India Open, 1985: 1st\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk finished in the top 3 at three different venues (New Delhi, Calgary, and India Open) between 1982 and 1985.\n\nNow, checking the relevant cells. The claim talks about finishing in the top 3, so I need to find rows where outcome is a number indicating their placement. From the table:\n\nRow 2: outcome=3\nRow 4: outcome=1\nRow 6: outcome=1\n\nSo these are the three relevant outcomes. Now, looking at the columns, each row has 'outcome', 'event', 'year', 'venue', and 'partner'.\n\nBut wait, in Row 3, it's about Asian Games, which might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, but I think I should also check if they have three different venues where they finished top 3. So the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 2: outcome=3 (Calgary), partner=kang haeng-suk\nRow 4: outcome=1 (New Delhi)\nRow 6: outcome=1 (India Open)\n\nSo, their outcomes are in the 'outcome' column, which is a number indicating their placement. So these cells are relevant because they show that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk have finished top 3 (including 1st) at three different venues.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells include:\n\n- Row 2: outcome=3\n- Row 4: outcome=1\n- Row 6: outcome=1\n\nWait, but row 6's partner is also kang haeng-suk. So all these rows have the same partner, which is correct because it's about their partnership.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk finished top 3 at three different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with asian game 5 time at tournament.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n1. **Subject**: Hwang Sun\n2. **Action**: Partnered with\n3. **Object**: Asian Games\n4. **Timespan**: 5 times\n5. **Location**: Tournaments\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an event with details like outcome, event name, year, venue, and partner. The rows are:\n\n1. Row 1: Outcome: world championships, Event: world championships, Year: world championships, Venue: world championships, Partner: world championships.\n2. Row 2: Outcome: 3, Event: wd (probably World Darts), Year: 1985, Venue: Calgary, Canada, Partner: Kang Haeng-suk.\n3. Row 3: Outcome: asian games, Event: asian games, Year: asian games, Venue: asian games, Partner: asian games.\n4. Row 4: Outcome: 1, Event: wd, Year: 1982, Venue: New Delhi, India, Partner: Kang Haeng-suk.\n5. Row 5: Outcome: other open tournaments, Event: other open tournaments, Year: other open tournaments, Venue: other open tournaments, Partner: other open tournaments.\n6. Row 6: Outcome: 1, Event: wd, Year: 1985, Venue: India Open, Partner: Kang Haeng-suk.\n\nNow, I need to see if Hwang Sun is partnered with the Asian Games five times at tournaments.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- **Row 2**: Partners are Kang Haeng-suk.\n- **Row 3**: The partner is \"asian games,\" which might refer to the event, not a person. But if it's an actual name, perhaps it's another person named Asian Games? That seems unlikely.\n- **Row 4**: Again, partner is Kang Haeng-suk.\n- **Row 6**: Partner is Kang Haeng-suk.\n\nSo, from these rows, I don't see any mention of Hwang Sun as a partner. The claim mentions \"asian game\" as a partner, which could be a person's name if that's how it's meant to be read. \n\nChecking each row for the term \"Asian Games\":\n- Row 3: Venue is \"asian games,\" but the partner is also listed as \"asian games.\" If this is referring to an entity, maybe the Asian Games as an organization or event series, but it's not clear if that's a person.\n\nIf \"asian game\" refers to a specific person named Asian Games, then we can look for their partnering with Hwang Sun. But in none of the rows do I see Hwang Sun listed as a partner. The only partners mentioned are Kang Haeng-suk and others like \"other open tournaments.\"\n\nFurthermore, the claim mentions five times, but looking at the table, I don't see any row where Hwang Sun is partnered with Asian Games or anyone else five times.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be false because there's no evidence in the table supporting Hwang Sun partnering with Asian Games five times.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng for the first time at the 1982 world championship in the india open.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify the key elements of the claim:\n- Partners involved: Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng.\n- Event type: World Championship.\n- Year: 1982.\n- Venue: India Open.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row seems to represent a different event with various details. Let me go through each row to see if any match the claim.\n\nRow 1 doesn't seem relevant because it's more about \"world championships\" in a general sense without specifics.\n\nRow 2: outcome is 3, event is WD (World Wrestling), year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. This mentions Kang Haeng but the year is 1985, not 1982, and it's about World Wrestling, not specifically the World Championship or India Open.\n\nRow 3: outcome 1, event Asian Games, etc. Not relevant as it's a different type of event.\n\nRow 4: outcome 1, event WD (World Wrestling), year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. This matches the year and the partner, but the venue is New Delhi, not the India Open. Also, it mentions World Wrestling, which might be a different event than the World Championships.\n\nRow 5: outcome other open tournaments, etc. Not relevant as it's about general tournaments.\n\nRow 6: outcome 1, event WD (World Wrestling), year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng - Suk. This has the partner and venue mentioned, but the year is 1985, not 1982, and the venue is India Open. It also refers to World Wrestling.\n\nWait a minute, the claim mentions \"1982 world championship in the india open.\" So I'm looking for an entry where the year is 1982, event is World Championship, venue is India Open, partner is Kang Haeng - Suk.\n\nLooking back at the table, none of the rows directly match all these criteria. Row 4 has the same partner and year but a different venue (New Delhi) and event type (World Wrestling). Row 6 has the correct venue and partner but wrong year and event.\n\nSo there's no row where outcome is about World Championship, specifically in 1982 at India Open with Kang Haeng as partner. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a partnership between Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng during the 1982 World Championships at the India Open. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Row 4** mentions Kang Haeng in 1982 but refers to the event as \"WD\" (likely World Wrestling) and venue New Delhi.\n- **Row 6** refers to the India Open in 1985 with Kang Haeng but not Hwang Sun.\n\nNeither row directly supports all aspects of the claim. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me first read and understand both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 1985 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman's double event , finish second , 2 of 3 time she win an event with kang haeng\"\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows for different events. Each row seems to represent a separate competition or event with details like outcome, event type, year, venue, and partner.\n\nRow 2: Outcome is 3, event wd (probably World Disability), year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\nRow 6: Outcome 1, event wd, year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"Asian Games\" and \"finish second\". In the table, Row 3 is about Asian Games but it's generic without specific details. The other relevant row for 1985 with Kang Haeng Suk is Row 6, which refers to India Open, not the Asian Games.\n\nSo, Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1985? Looking at Row 2 and Row 6, both are under \"wd\" event type (World Disability). The claim mentions the Asian Games, but the table doesn't have an entry for the Asian Games with Hwang Sun in 1985.\n\nWait, Row 3 is generic: outcome: Asian Games, event: Asian Games, year: Asian Games, venue: Asian Games, partner: Asian Games. This seems like a header or placeholder rather than specific data. So there's no specific row for Hwang Sun in the Asian Games in 1985 with Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nIn Row 6, she participated in India Open (other open tournaments) and won with Kang Haeng Suk. So she did participate twice with him: once in Calgary (Row 2, outcome 3) and once in India Open (Row 6, outcome 1). The claim says \"2 of 3 times\" she wins an event with Kang Haeng Suk.\n\nBut wait, how many times did she win? Row 2's outcome is 3. Maybe that's a ranking or placement, not necessarily a win. Row 6 has outcome 1, which might indicate first place, so that's one win. So total of two wins: in 1985 (Row 6) and another time.\n\nWait, the table also has Row 4: 1982 with outcome 1, partner Kang Haeng Suk. So that's another win, making it three times? Or maybe not. The claim says \"2 of 3 times she win an event\". If Hwang Sun participated three times (Row 2, 4, 6), then she won in 1982 and 1985, which are two wins, supporting the claim's statement of 2/3 times.\n\nBut I'm not sure about Row 2. The outcome is 3; perhaps that's her placement, like third place, so she didn't win there. So she only won in 1982 (Row 4) and 1985 (Row 6), making it two wins out of three attempts, which aligns with the claim.\n\nHowever, the claim mentions specifically \"in the asian game\", but the table doesn't have a specific row for that event in 1985. So the relevant cells are Row 2 and Row 6, as they're the ones where Hwang Sun participated with Kang Haeng Suk in 1985.\n\nWait, no: Row 2 is about World Disability, not Asian Games. The claim says she participated in the Asian Games, but there's no such row. So that part of the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nBut the user instructions mention to check each condition against the table. So the key points are:\n\n1. In 1985: Correct, because Row 6 is 1985.\n2. Participated in Asian Games: No specific data in the table; only Row 3 is generic.\n3. Finished second: The claim says \"finish second\", but the table doesn't specify placements beyond outcome numbers. So it's unclear if outcome 1 is first, 2 is second, etc.\n4. 2 of 3 times she wins an event with Kang Haeng Suk: From Row 4 and Row 6, that seems correct.\n\nBut the main issue is whether she participated in the Asian Games in 1985, which isn't directly supported by the table. The only specific 1985 entry is Row 6 (India Open), not Asian Games. So the claim's first part is incorrect because there's no row for her participating in the Asian Games in 1985.\n\nSo, even though she did participate twice with Kang Haeng Suk, the participation in the Asian Games in 1985 isn't supported by the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun participated in the Asian Games in 1985 and finished second, which isn't directly supported by the table. While she did participate twice with Kang Haeng Suk (Rows 2 and 6), there's no specific entry for the Asian Games in 1985.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"hwang sun partner with kang haeng at the 1982 new delhi , india finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\"\n\nBreaking this down, I need to check if Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-suk in 1982 at New Delhi, India. The claim also mentions that they finished first two years after winning the world championship.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row to find relevant information.\n\nRow 1 seems to be a header or general info about world championships, so probably not directly relevant unless there's specific data there, but it doesn't seem to relate to individual partnerships.\n\nRow 2: Outcome is 3, event wd (world championship), year 1985, venue Calgary, Canada, partner Kang Haeng-suk. So this row shows that in 1985, someone partnered with Kang Haeng-suk won the world championship and got the outcome as 3. Not sure what the outcome refers to\u2014could be points or placement, but not directly relevant to Hwang Sun.\n\nRow 3 is about Asian Games, so maybe not related unless Hwang Sun participated there, which isn't specified in the claim.\n\nRow 4: Outcome 1, event wd (world championship), year 1982, venue New Delhi, India, partner Kang Haeng-suk. This seems directly relevant because it mentions Hwang Sun's partner as Kang Haeng-suk at the 1982 World Championships in New Delhi, with an outcome of 1.\n\nRow 5 is about other open tournaments, probably not relevant here unless Hwang Sun participated there, but the claim doesn't mention that.\n\nRow 6: Outcome 1, event wd (world championship), year 1985, venue India Open, partner Kang Haeng-suk. So in 1985, again, Kang Haeng-suk was partnered with someone at the world championships in India Open, not New Delhi.\n\nSo from the table, Row 4 stands out because it directly mentions Hwang Sun (probably, since the claim is about him) partnering with Kang Haeng-suk at the 1982 World Championships in New Delhi, and they finished first. The outcome of 1 likely indicates that they won or came first.\n\nThe claim also mentions \"finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\" If finishing first two years after winning the world championship, let's see: If they won in 1982, then finishing first again in 1983 and 1984 would make sense. However, looking at the table, Row 6 is about 1985, which is three years after 1982. So there's no data here supporting that they finished first two years immediately after their win.\n\nBut wait, does the claim specify that it's the next two years or any two years? The wording is a bit unclear. It says \"finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\" Maybe the claim is suggesting that within two years after winning, they finished first again, which in 1982 and 1983 would be two years later.\n\nHowever, without data on 1983 or 1984, I can't confirm if they indeed finished first in those years. The table only shows 1985, which is three years after 1982, but it's possible that the claim refers to any subsequent two years. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"finish first 2 year after win the world championship.\" So after winning (presumably in 1982), they finished first in the next two years, i.e., 1983 and 1984. But there's no data in the table for those years. The only data after 1982 is 1985.\n\nSo while Row 4 supports that Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-suk at the 1982 World Championships in New Delhi, it doesn't provide information about their performance in subsequent years to confirm the claim about finishing first in two consecutive years after winning.\n\nTherefore, even though the partnership and year are correct, the part about finishing first in the next two years isn't supported by the table data. So the claim might be partially true but not fully accurate regarding the timing of their finishes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is only partially supported. While Hwang Sun partnered with Kang Haeng-suk at the 1982 World Championships in New Delhi and finished first, there's no data confirming they finished first in the following two years (1983 and 1984). Thus, the full claim isn't entirely true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about Hwang Sun and her partner Kang Haeng-suk is true based on the table provided. The claim states: \"With her partner kang haeng , hwang sun finish first at 3 different venue from 1982 to 1985.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's about Hwang Sun finishing first in three different venues between the years 1982 and 1985, paired with Kang Haeng-suk.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a specific event or outcome. Let's go through each relevant row to find information that matches the claim.\n\nRow 2: Outcome is 3, event is 'wd' (which I think stands for World Championships), year is 1985, venue is Calgary, Canada, partner is Kang Haeng-suk. So this row shows Hwang Sun and her partner won the World Championships in 1985 at Calgary.\n\nRow 4: Outcome is 1, event is 'wd', year is 1982, venue is New Delhi, India, partner again is Kang Haeng-suk. So they also won the World Championships in 1982 at New Delhi.\n\nRow 6: Outcome is 1, event is 'india open' (I think), year is 1985, venue is India Open, partner is Kang Haeng-suk. Wait, but the event name here says \"other open tournaments\". So this might not be the World Championships but another event.\n\nSo from Row 2 and Row 4, we have two wins at different venues (Calgary in 1985 and New Delhi in 1982). The third win would need to be another event within the specified timeframe. However, looking at Row 6, it's listed as \"other open tournaments\", which might not fall under the same category as World Championships or Asian Games.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions finishing first at three different venues from 1982 to 1985. So we need three events where Hwang Sun and her partner won first place, each at a different venue in those years. From the table, we have two such wins: 1982 (New Delhi) and 1985 (Calgary). The third win would need to be another event, possibly the Asian Games or another open tournament.\n\nLooking at Row 3: outcome is 'asian games', but it seems like a placeholder because all columns are filled with 'asian games'. Maybe this row doesn't have relevant information. So perhaps Hwang Sun didn't win any Asian Games in that period, or maybe it's not specified.\n\nAlternatively, looking again, the sixth row is for the India Open, which might be considered another venue. But since the event name says \"other open tournaments\", I'm not sure if this counts towards the three different venues. The claim doesn't specify the type of events, just that they finished first at three different venues from 1982 to 1985.\n\nSo, considering the data we have: two World Championships wins (1982 and 1985) at New Delhi and Calgary. If there's a third win in another event within those years, it would be necessary for the claim to hold true. However, the table only shows three relevant rows where they won: Row 2 (World Championships, 1985), Row 4 (World Championships, 1982), and Row 6 (India Open, 1985). So that's two World Championships and one India Open.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"three different venue\", so if all three venues are different, then it would be true. However, in the given data, we only have information about three events: Calgary, New Delhi, and India Open. Each is a different venue, but I'm not sure if all three count because one of them is an 'other open tournament'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to three World Championships, but that's not possible since there are only two entries in the table for World Championships: 1982 and 1985.\n\nWait, looking again, Row 6 is labeled as \"event: other open tournaments\", so it might be a different type of event. The claim doesn't specify the type of events, just that they finished first at three different venues from 1982 to 1985.\n\nSo, if we have three wins at three different venues in those years, regardless of the event type, then the claim is true. From the table, Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk won twice at World Championships (1982 and 1985) and once at India Open in 1985. So that's three different venues: New Delhi, Calgary, and India Open.\n\nBut wait, the venue for Row 6 is \"india open\", which is a specific venue. So yes, that's a third venue. Therefore, they have finished first at three different venues between 1982 and 1985.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Rows 2, 4, and 6 because those are the rows where Hwang Sun and her partner won first place, each at a different venue within the specified years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-suk finished first at three different venues between 1982 and 1985. From the table:\n\n- **Row 2**: They won the World Championships in 1985 at Calgary.\n- **Row 4**: They won the World Championships in 1982 at New Delhi.\n- **Row 6**: They won the India Open in 1985.\n\nEach of these wins occurred at distinct venues within the given timeframe. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
