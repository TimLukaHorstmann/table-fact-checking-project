    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim says. It states: \"gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 , conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini and helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce be winner , runner - up , and semi finalist respectively in the week of may 8 tier 1.\"\n\nSo, breaking this down, there are three parts to check:\n\n1. **Winner**: gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva with scores 3-6, 7-6, 6-4.\n2. **Runner-up**: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini.\n3. **Semi-finalist**: helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row to see if any match the criteria.\n\nStarting from Row 1: week 1 May, Tier II, winner Conchita Mart\u00ednez. Not relevant since it's a different week and tier.\n\nRow 2: Also week 1 May, Tier II, winner Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Martina Hingis. The scores here are 6-2, 6-3, which don't match the claim's scores (3-6, 7-6, 6-4). So not a match.\n\nRow 3: Week 8 May, Tier IV. Winner Julie Halard. Not relevant as per the claim is about Tier I.\n\nRow 4: Also Week 8 May, Tier IV. Different winners and runners-up. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow 5: Week 8 May, Tier I. Winner Conchita Mart\u00ednez. The claim's winner is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Zvereva, so not a match here either.\n\nRow 6: Week 8 May, Tier I. Winner Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Zvereva with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4. This matches the first part of the claim. Runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini, which also matches the second part. The semi-finalists are Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce, which fits the third part.\n\nSo, all three parts of the claim are satisfied by Row 6. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there another row that might have the same data? Let's make sure.\n\nLooking further:\n\nRows 7-10: These are Week 15 May, so not relevant for Week 8 May.\n\nRows 11-12: Also different weeks and tiers.\n\nRows 13-14: Grand Slam tournaments, which I think are separate events, perhaps not included in the same week as Tier I in May 8. So probably not related to the claim.\n\nTherefore, only Row 6 matches all the criteria stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in Row 6 of the table, where Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez Natalia Zvereva won with the specified scores, Conchita Mart\u00ednez Patricia Tarabini was the runner-up, and Helena Sukov\u00e1 Mary Pierce were semi-finalists.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"winner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"semi finalists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"sandrine testud yone kamio be semi finalist the week of 22 may\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions two people: Sandrine Testud and Yone Kamio. The claim states that both were semi finalists in the week of May 22nd.\n\nNow, I should look through each row of the table to find any mention of \"Sandrine Testud\" or \"Yone Kamio.\" Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Week of May 1. The winner is Conchita Mart\u00ednez, runner-up is Martina Hingis. Semi finalists are Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva. No Sandrine Testud or Yone Kamio here.\n\nRow 2: Also week of May 1. Winner is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Martina Hingis. Runner-up is Conchita Mart\u00ednez. Semi finalists same as above. Still no relevant info.\n\nRow 3: Week of May 8. The winner is Julie Halard, runner-up Ludmila Richterov\u00e1. Semi finalists are Katar\u00edna Studen\u00edkov\u00e1 and Stephanie Rottier. Not matching.\n\nRow 4: Also week of May 8. Winner is Linda Harvey-Wild/Chanda Rubin, runner-up Maria Lindstr\u00f6m. Semi finalists same as above. No match.\n\nRow 5: Week of May 8 again. Tier I winner Conchita Mart\u00ednez. Runner-up Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario. Semi finalists are Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce. Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Same week, tier I. Winner is Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez/Natalia Zvereva. Runner-up Conchita Mart\u00ednez. Semi finalists same as above. No match.\n\nMoving on to Row 7: Week of May 15. Tier I winner Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario. Runner-up Magdalena Maleeva. Semi finalists are Irina Sp\u00eerlea and Natalia Zvereva. Not the people we're looking for.\n\nRow 8: Also week of May 15. Winner Amanda Coetzer/In\u00e9s Gorrochategui. Runner-up Larisa Savchenko/Gabriela Sabatini. Semi finalists Irina Sp\u00eerlea and Natalia Zvereva. Still no match.\n\nRow 9: Week of May 15 again, tier IV. Winner Ludmila Richterov\u00e1. Runner-up Patricia Hy-Boulais. Semi finalists Lindsay Lee/\u00c5sa Carlsson. Not relevant.\n\nRow 10: Tier IV, same week as above. Winner Mariaan de Swardt/Ruxandra Dragomir. Runner-up Kerry-Anne Guse. Semi finalists same as Row 9. No match.\n\nNow onto the rows for May 22. That's Row 11 and Row 12.\n\nRow 11: Week of May 22, tier III. Winner Lindsay Davenport. Runner-up Kimiko Date. Semi finalists are Sandrine Testud and Yone Kamio. Oh! Here we go. Both names are listed as semi finalists in this row. So, the claim is saying that both were semi finalists during week 22 May, which matches this row.\n\nRow 12: Also week of May 22, tier III. Winner Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez. Runner-up Sabine Appelmans/Miriam Oremans. Semi finalists same as Row 11. So, yes, both Sandrine Testud and Yone Kamio are indeed semi finalists in the week of May 22.\n\nI don't see any other rows beyond these two that pertain to week 22. So, the claim is fully supported by Rows 11 and 12. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those two rows.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim \"sandrine testud yone kamio be semi finalist the week of 22 may\" is TRUE or FALSE, we analyzed each row of the table for the week of May 22.\n\n- **Row 11** (week of May 22): Sandrine Testud and Yone Kamio are listed as semi finalists.\n- **Row 12** (week of May 22): The same individuals are also noted as semi finalists in this row.\n\nBoth rows confirm that the claim is accurate. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Semi_finalists\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Semi_finalists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"when week be 9 may , when semi finalist be helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce , and when runner - up be conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini , winner be gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 4\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components to check each part against the table.\n\n1. Week is 9 May: Looking at the table, I need to find rows where \"week of\" is 9 May. Scanning through the rows:\n   - Row 1: week of 1 May\n   - Row 2: week of 1 May\n   - Row 3: week of 8 May\n   - Row 4: week of 8 May\n   - Row 5: week of 8 May\n   - Row 6: week of 8 May\n   - Row 7: week of 15 May\n   - Row 8: week of 15 May\n   - Row 9: week of 15 May\n   - Row 10: week of 15 May\n   - Row 11: week of 22 May\n   - Row 12: week of 22 May\n   - Row 13: week of 29 May (2 weeks)\n   - Row 14: week of 29 May (2 weeks)\n\nWait, none of the rows have \"week of\" as 9 May. The closest is week of 8 May and 15 May. So there's no row for week 9 May. That might be an issue.\n\nBut maybe I misread. Let me double-check. No, I think it's correct\u2014rows go from 1 May, 8 May, 15 May, etc., skipping 9 May. So the first part of the claim might not have a matching row.\n\n2. Semi finalists: helena sukov\u00e1 mary pierce. Looking for this in the table:\n   - Row 5: semi finals are helena sukov\u00e1 and mary pierce.\n   - Any other rows? Let me check each one:\n     - Row 6: same as above, but winner is different.\n     - Rows 7-14 don't mention these names except row 5.\n\nSo the semi finalists in a week of 9 May would need to be in a row that's for 9 May, which doesn't exist. So perhaps this part is also incorrect.\n\n3. Runner-up: conchita mart\u00ednez patricia tarabini. Looking for runner-ups with these names:\n   - Row 2: runner-up is conchita mart\u00ednez and patricia tarabini.\n   - Any other rows? Let me check:\n     - Row 6 has the same runner-up, but it's in week of 8 May.\n     - So if we have to match \"week be 9 may,\" there's no such row. Therefore, this part is also not applicable.\n\n4. Winner: gigi fern\u00e1ndez natalia zvereva with scores 3-6,7-6,6-4. Looking for a winner in the table:\n   - Row 6 has winner as gigi fern\u00e1ndez and natalia zvereva with those exact scores (3-6,7-6,6-4).\n   - Also, row 14 has them as winners too, but that's week of 29 May.\n\nSo the only relevant row is row 6, which is week of 8 May, not 9 May. Therefore, even though the winner and scores match row 6, the week is incorrect.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim references a week of 9 May, but there's no such row. Additionally, in the actual table, when the semi finalists are helena sukov\u00e1 and mary pierce (which is correct for row 5), but that row is on week of 8 May. So the winner in that case would be someone else.\n\nTherefore, the claim's conditions aren't all met because there's no row for week of 9 May, so the relevant data isn't present to confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on a week (9 May) that doesn't exist in the table. Even if there were such a week, the winner in that week would not be correct as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Semi Finalists\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"22 may 22 may be a week when the winner be sandrine testud.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each row in the table for the week of 22 May and see who the winners were. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 11: Week of 22 May, Tier III, Winner: Lindsay Davenport\n- Row 12: Week of 22 May, Tier III, Winner: Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nNeither of these winners is Sandrine Testud. So the claim doesn't hold.\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully. Let me check each row again.\n\nRows 11 and 12 are both week of 22 May. In Row 11, the winner is Lindsay Davenport with runner-up Kimiko Date. In Row 12, the winner is Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez with runner-up Sabine Appelmans and Miriam Oremans. No Sandrine Testud mentioned here.\n\nLooking further, in Row 13: Week of 29 May (which is two weeks later), it's a Grand Slam, but that week has Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez as the winner, not Sandrine Testud.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all the rows again to ensure no other week of 22 May entries where she won. The only week in May with 22 is row 11 and 12, which both don't have her as a winner.\n\nSo, since there's no row where Sandrine Testud is the winner on the week of 22 May, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
