    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyer record be 40 - 11 - 10 as of february 23rd.\"\n\nFirst, I should identify the relevant parts of the claim that need to be checked against the table. Let me break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions three things:\n1. It's about the Philadelphia Flyer's record.\n2. The record is \"40 - 11 - 10.\"\n3. The date is February 23rd.\n\nSo, I'll look for cells in the table that match all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a game number, date, opponent, score, and record. So, I need to find a row where:\n- Opponent is Philadelphia Flyers.\n- The record is exactly \"40 - 11 - 10.\"\n- The date is February 23rd.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Game 49, Feb 2 vs Boston Bruins, score 2-0, record 31-10-8. Doesn't match opponent or date.\n\nRow 2: Game 50, Feb 3 vs Buffalo Sabres, score 4-2, record 32-10-8. Opponent is not Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nRow 3: Game 51, Feb 5 vs St Louis Blues, score 6-5, record 32-11-8. No match.\n\nRow 4: Game 52, Feb 6 vs Toronto Maple Leafs, score 2-2, record 32-11-9. Not the right opponent or date.\n\nRow 5: Game 53, Feb 9 vs Chicago Blackhawks, score 4-1, record 33-11-9. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 6: Game 54, Feb 12 vs Pittsburgh Penguins, score 8-3, record 34-11-9. Opponent is not Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nRow 7: Game 55, Feb 13 vs Los Angeles Kings, score 4-2, record 35-11-9. Not matching.\n\nRow 8: Game 56, Feb 15 vs Vancouver Canucks, score 5-1, record 36-11-9. No match.\n\nRow 9: Game 57, Feb 17 vs Los Angeles Kings, score 6-4, record 37-11-9. Opponent is not Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nRow 10: Game 58, Feb 18 vs California Golden Seals, score 2-2, record 37-11-10. Not matching opponent or date.\n\nRow 11: Game 59, Feb 20 vs Detroit Red Wings, score 4-3, record 38-11-10. Opponent is not Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nRow 12: Game 60, Feb 22 vs Montreal Canadiens, score 7-3, record 39-11-10. Not matching.\n\nRow 13: Game 61, Feb 23 vs Philadelphia Flyers, score 4-3, record 40-11-10. Here, opponent is Philadelphia Flyers, the date is February 23rd, and the record matches exactly as stated in the claim.\n\nSo, all three conditions are met in Row 13. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells in the table that support the claim are:\n\n1. **Row 13**: This row has the opponent as \"philadelphia flyers,\" the date is \"february 23rd,\" and the record is \"40 - 11 - 10.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
