Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for rows where the 'from' column matches \"830 bc\". Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 16 has 'from' as 830 bc and the state is song. That seems relevant because it directly matches the claim's date and state.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other possible matches. Looking at all the rows, only row 16 has 'from' as 830 bc. So that's the only one to consider.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the state be song\" at 830 bc. From row 16, the state is indeed song and from 830 bc. There are no conflicting or additional entries for this date, so it seems like a direct match.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be fully supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"from\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that when the state is 'jin', the names of the rulers are either 'xi' or 'xian'. So I need to look at the rows where the state is 'jin' and check if any of those rows have the name 'xi' or 'xian'.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for the state 'jin'. The rows related to 'jin' are:\n\nRow 8: state jin, name xi\nRow 9: state jin, name xian\n\nSo both these rows are relevant because they directly pertain to the state 'jin' and their respective names. \n\nFor Row 8, the name is 'xi', which matches one part of the claim.\nFor Row 9, the name is 'xian', which matches the other part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, both names mentioned in the claim ('xi' and 'xian') are present as rulers of the state 'jin' in the table. This fully supports the claim.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows for 'jin' that might affect this. From the table provided, only Rows 8 and 9 have 'jin' as the state. No others exist, so these are the only relevant cells to check.\n\nHence, the answer is TRUE because both names specified in the claim appear as rulers of 'jin' in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from rows 8 and 9 where the state is 'jin' with names 'xi' and 'xian'.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components. It seems like it's making a statement about a specific entry in the table where two conditions are met: the state is cai and the royal house is ji. The name associated with that entry should be yi.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different state or entity, with various attributes like type (sovereign), name, title, royal house, and from year BC.\n\nI'll start by searching for rows where the state is cai. Scanning through the table:\n\nRow 1: state: cai, type: sovereign, name: yi, title: marquis, royal house: ji, from: 837 bc.\nThis seems to match because the state is cai and the royal house is ji. The name here is yi.\n\nSo, in this row, all the conditions of the claim are met: state is cai, royal house is ji, and the name is yi. Therefore, the claim appears to be supported by this entry.\n\nI don't see any other rows where the state is cai, so I only need to check Row 1 for this condition. The other part of the claim refers to royal house being ji and state being cai, which is exactly what Row 1 provides.\n\nSince there's a matching row where all conditions are satisfied, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin and the title be duke.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It's asserting that there are two possible names\u2014either xi or xian\u2014that correspond to a state named jin with a title of duke.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to search for rows where the state is 'jin' and the type is 'sovereign.' Let me go through each row one by one to find relevant data.\n\nStarting from Row 8: state is jin, name is xi, title is marquis. So that's a jin sovereign with title marquis. Not what we're looking for because the title should be duke.\n\nNext, Row 9: state is jin, name is xian, title is marquis again. Still marquises, not dukes.\n\nSo in the table provided, I don't see any rows where state is 'jin,' type is 'sovereign,' and title is 'duke.' The closest matches are Rows 8 and 9, but their titles are both marquis, not duke.\n\nThat means there's no data supporting the claim that xi or xian are names of a jin sovereign with the title of duke. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"xi or xian\" are names associated with a 'jin' state and a 'duke' title. However, upon examining the table, both 'xi' and 'xian' are recorded as marquises, not dukes, for the state of jin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the given claim about a specific row in the table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim thoroughly. The claim states: \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai and the year be 826.\" Breaking this down:\n\n1. **Royal House**: \"ji\"\n2. **State**: \"cai\"\n3. **Year**: 826 BC\n\nNow, I'll look through the table provided to find any rows that match all three conditions: Royal House is ji, State is cai, and Year is 826 BC.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 1**: State is cai, royal house is ji. The name here is \"yi.\" The year mentioned is 837 BC, which doesn't match.\n  \nSo, Row 1 seems to have two of the three conditions met but fails on the year.\n\nNext, checking if there are any other rows that fit all three criteria:\n\n- **Row 2**: State is cao, royal house is -, so this doesn't match state cai.\n  \n- **Row 3**: Also state is cao and royal house is -, so not matching.\n  \n- **Row 4**: State is chen, royal house is -, no match.\n\n- **Row 5 to 7**: These are for the state chu with royal house mi. No match here as royal house needs to be ji.\n\n- **Rows 8-9 (Jin)**: Royal house is ji, but states are jin, not cai.\n\n- **Rows 10-11 (Lu)**: Royal house is ji, but states are lu.\n\n- **Rows 12-13 (Qi)**: Royal house jiang, no match.\n\n- **Row 14-15 (Qin)**: Doesn't apply.\n\n- **Row 16**: State song, royal house -, no.\n\n- **Rows 17-19 (Yan)**: Royal house is -, so not matching ji.\n\nAfter going through all rows, only Row 1 has state cai and royal house ji. However, the year in that row is 837 BC, which doesn't match the claim's year of 826 BC. Therefore, there's no row where all three conditions\u2014state cai, royal house ji, and year 826\u2014are met simultaneously.\n\nThus, the claim is not fully supported by any row in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"from\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"when the from be 830 bc , the state be wey\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The \"from\" here refers to a year, specifically 830 BC. The claim is stating that during this year, the state involved was Wey.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different state with various attributes like type, name, title, royal house, and from (the year). So I need to find rows where \"from\" is equal to 830 bc and see what the corresponding \"state\" is for that row. If the state in that row is Wey, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: from is 837 BC \u2192 Not 830.\nRow 2: 835 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 3: 826 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 4: 831 BC \u2192 Close, but not 830.\nRow 5: 837 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 6: 827 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 7: 821 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 8: 840 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 9: 822 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 10: 854 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 11: 825 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 12: 850 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 13: 824 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 14: 845 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 15: 822 BC \u2192 No.\nRow 16: from is 830 bc.

The corresponding state is Song, not Wey. Therefore, the claim that when from is 830 bc, the state is Wey is FALSE because it was actually Song.\n\nI should also note which cells are relevant. The \"from\" column and the \"state\" column for that specific row.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we check the table for any rows where \"from\" equals 830 BC. \n\n- **Row 16** has \"from\": 830 bc and \"state\": Song.\n\nSince the state isn't Wey, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"from\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"state\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
