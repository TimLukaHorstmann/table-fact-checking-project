    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a tennis match is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. Let me break down the claim and compare it with each row in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the match on hard surface have a score of 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6 and be hold on july 23 , 2006.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for a match that was played on a hard surface. From the table, rows 1 through 10 each specify the surface type. I need to find any row where \"surface\" is \"hard\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Row 1: hard\n- Row 2: clay\n- Row 3: hard\n- Row 4: hard\n- Row 5: hard\n- Row 6: hard\n- Row 7: clay\n- Row 8: clay\n- Row 9: clay\n- Row 10: clay\n\nSo, possible matches are rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nNext, the claim mentions a score of \"6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6\". This is a three-set match score. I need to find if any row has exactly this score.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: outcome: runner-up; score: 0-6, 0-6. Not matching.\n- Row 3: winner with scores 6-3, 6-3. No.\n- Row 4: winner with scores 6-3, 6-1. No.\n- Row 5: runner-up with scores 6-4, 2-6, 3-6. This matches exactly the score mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 6: winner with 6-3, 6-0. No.\n\nSo, row 5 has both the hard surface and the exact score of 6-4, 2-6, 3-6.\n\nNow, check the date. The claim says \"July 23, 2006\". Looking at the dates in relevant rows:\n\nRow 1: July 27, 2003\nRow 5: July 23, 2006\n\nYes, row 5's date is July 23, 2006, which matches the claim.\n\nThe opponent in the final for row 5 is Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri. The claim doesn't specify the opponent, so it's not necessary to check this unless there's a discrepancy, but since the claim doesn't mention the opponent, only the date and score are relevant here.\n\nPutting it all together: surface is hard (row 5), score matches exactly (row 5), and date matches (row 5). All conditions are satisfied by row 5. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez tournament is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"At the Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez tournament, the final opponent Estefania Craci\u00fan played on a clay surface and won with a score of 6-1, 0-6, 6-2.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim. \n\n1. **Tournament Location**: The claim mentions \"Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez tournament.\" Looking at the table, there are multiple tournaments, so I need to find which row corresponds to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Row 4: Le\u00f3n\n- Row 5: Campos do Jord\u00e3o\n- Row 6: Tampico\n- Row 7: Guadalajara\n- Row 8: Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez\n- Row 9: Civitavecchia\n- Row 10: Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez again\n\nSo, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez appears in rows 8 and 10. But the claim refers to a final opponent Estefania Craci\u00fan winning, so I need to check both to see if either matches.\n\n2. **Final Opponent**: The claim specifies \"Estefania Craci\u00fan\" as the final opponent. Looking at the table:\n- Row 7: Opponent is Estefania Craci\u00fan.\n- Row 8: Opponent is also Estefania Craci\u00fan.\n\nSo both rows 7 and 8 have her as the final opponent. I need to check if either of these matches the claim's details.\n\n3. **Surface**: The claim mentions a clay surface. Checking each relevant row:\n- Row 7: Surface is clay.\n- Row 8: Surface is also clay.\n\nSo both rows have the correct surface type.\n\n4. **Score**: The score given in the claim is \"6-1, 0-6, 6-2.\" I need to see if any of the relevant rows match this exact score.\n\nLooking at row 7:\n- Score: 6-3, 6-4 (wait, no, the score for row 7 is 6-3 and 6-4? Wait, let me check again. No, actually, in the table, row 8 has a score of 6-1, 0-6, 6-2.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's clarify:\n\nRow 7: outcome: winner, date: 24 september 2006, tournament: guadalajara, surface: clay, opponent in the final: estefania craci\u00fan, score: 6 - 3 , 6 - 4.\n\nRow 8: outcome: winner, date: 1 october 2006, tournament: ciudad ju\u00e1rez, surface: clay, opponent in the final: estefania craci\u00fan, score: 6 - 1 , 0 - 6 , 6 - 2.\n\nSo row 7's score is 6-3 and 6-4. Row 8's score is 6-1, 0-6, 6-2.\n\nThe claim's score is \"6-1, 0-6, 6-2.\" That matches exactly with row 8.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- The tournament is Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez: yes, it's row 8.\n- The final opponent is Estefania Craci\u00fan: yes, as per row 8.\n- Surface is clay: correct for both rows 7 and 8, but the claim refers to a specific instance where she won with that score.\n\nSince row 8 has all the matching details\u2014Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Estefania Craci\u00fan as opponent, clay surface, and the exact score of 6-1, 0-6, 6-2\u2014the claim is fully supported.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the outcome of the match with a score of 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 be winner.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand each part of this claim. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Outcome**: Winner\n2. **Score**: 6-3 and 6-4\n\nI need to find in the table if there's a match that ends with these scores and results in a win.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: outcome (either winner or runner-up), date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, and score. My task is to check each row for matches where the outcome is a winner and the scores are exactly 6-3 and 6-4.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Runner-up, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Runner-up again, so no.\nRow 3: Winner with scores 6-3 and 6-3. Close, but the second score is different from the claim's 6-4.\nRow 4: Winner with scores 6-3 and 6-1. Not matching.\nRow 5: Runner-up, not relevant.\nRow 6: Winner with scores 6-3 and 6-0. Doesn't match.\nRow 7: Winner with scores 6-3 and 6-4. Oh, this looks promising! The outcome is winner, the scores are 6-3 and 6-4 exactly as in the claim.\nRow 8: Winner but scores are 6-1 and 0-6, then 6-2. Doesn't match.\nRow 9: Winner with scores 6-2 and 6-2. Different from 6-3 and 6-4.\nRow 10: The score is 2-2 ret, so it's a retirement, not a win.\n\nSo the only row where outcome is winner with exactly those two scores is Row 7. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because such a match exists in the table.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant columns for each matching row would be \"outcome\", \"score\". So for Row 7, I'll include those two columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 7 where the outcome is winner and the scores are 6-3 and 6-4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the tournament on september 12 2004 result in a runner - up.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find the one that matches September 12, 2004. Scanning each row's date column:\n\n- Row 1: July 27, 2003\n- Row 2: September 12, 2004\n- Row 3: May 28, 2006\n- Row 4: June 4, 2006\n- Row 5: July 23, 2006\n- Row 6: September 17, 2006\n- Row 7: September 24, 2006\n- Row 8: October 1, 2006\n- Row 9: April 6, 2008\n- Row 10: October 5, 2008\n\nSo, only Row 2 has the date September 12, 2004. Now, looking at Row 2's outcome: it says \"runner - up.\" That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI should check if there are any other relevant cells beyond the row that confirms the outcome. The columns for each row include outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, and score. Since the claim is about the outcome, the most relevant column would be \"outcome,\" but also perhaps others like date or tournament to confirm which row it's referring to.\n\nWait, the user instructions say that \"relevant_cells\" should be a list of objects with \"row_index\" (int) and \"column_name\" (string). So for Row 2, I need to note which columns are relevant. The outcome is \"runner - up,\" so that's directly relevant. Also, date is September 12, 2004, which matches the claim's date. Tournament is Santiago, but the claim doesn't mention the tournament name, only the date and outcome. Opponent and score aren't mentioned in the claim, so they might not be relevant unless the claim refers to specific details beyond outcome.\n\nHowever, since the claim specifically mentions \"the tournament on september 12 2004,\" it's about that particular event. So, the date is definitely relevant as it matches the claim's date. The outcome is also directly stated in the row, so that's another relevant column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are for Row 2, checking both the \"outcome\" and \"date\" columns to confirm the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim says: \"the surface be hard when the score be 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6.\" So, it's saying that whenever a match has this specific scoreline (6-4, 2-6, 3-6), the surface is hard.\n\nNow, I need to look through each row of the table and check if any of them have both the score 6-4, 2-6, 3-6 and the surface as hard. If at least one such row exists, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is runner-up, date: 27 July 2003, tournament: Puerto Ordaz, surface: hard, opponent in final: Zuzana Cerna, score: 0-6, 0-6. The score here is 0-6, 0-6, so not matching the required 6-4, 2-6, 3-6.\n\nRow 2: Runner-up, 12 Sept 2004, Santiago, clay surface, opponent Maria Jose Argeri, score 4-6,5-7. Not matching.\n\nRow 3: Winner, 28 May 2006, Monterrey, hard surface, opponent Mariana Duque, score 6-3,6-3. Not the required score.\n\nRow 4: Winner, 4 June 2006, Le\u00f3n, hard, Agustina Lepore, 6-3,6-1. Again, not matching.\n\nRow 5: Runner-up, 23 July 2006, Campos do Jord\u00e3o, hard surface, opponent Maria Jose Argeri, score 6-4,2-6,3-6. Oh, this looks promising! The score is exactly what the claim mentions (6-4,2-6,3-6), and the surface is hard.\n\nRow 6: Winner, 17 Sept 2006, Tampico, hard, Daniela Munoz Gallegos, 6-3,6-0. Not matching.\n\nRow 7: Winner, 24 Sept 2006, Guadalajara, clay, Estefania Craciun, 6-3,6-4. Surface is clay, so not relevant even if the score matched.\n\nRow 8: Winner, 1 Oct 2006, Ciudad Juarez, clay, Estefania Craciun, 6-1,0-6,6-2. Clay surface again, and different scores.\n\nRow 9: Winner, 6 April 2008, Civitavecchia, clay, Polona Hercog, 6-2,6-2. Not matching.\n\nRow 10: Winner, 5 Oct 2008, Ciudad Juarez, clay, Jorgelina Cravero, score is 2-2 ret. Retired, so not the same as 6-4 etc.\n\nSo, only Row 5 has both the specified score and a hard surface.

Let's see:\n\n- The match was played on a hard surface.\n- The score was 6-4, 2-6, 3-6.\n- The date of the match was 23 July 2008.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row seems to represent a different tournament with details like outcome, date, tournament name, surface, opponent in the final, and the score. \n\nSo I need to check if there's a match that matches all three aspects: hard surface, the specific score, and the exact date mentioned.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 27 July 2003\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent: Zuzana Cerna\n- Score: 0-6, 0-6\n\nThis doesn't match the date or the score mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 12 September 2004\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- Score: 4-6, 5-7\n\nSurface is clay, so not matching. Also, date is September, not July.\n\nRow 3:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 28 May 2006\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent: Mariana Duque\n- Score: 6-3, 6-3\n\nDate is May, which doesn't match July 2008. Also, the score here is different from the claim.\n\nRow 4:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 4 June 2006\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent: Agustina Lepore\n- Score: 6-3, 6-1\n\nAgain, date is June, not July. The surface matches, but other details don't align.\n\nRow 5:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 23 July 2006\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- Score: 6-4, 2-6, 3-6\n\nWait a minute. The score here is exactly the same as in the claim: 6-4, 2-6, 3-6. But the date is July 2006, whereas the claim says 23 July 2008. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 6:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 17 September 2006\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent: Daniela M\u00fc\u00f1oz Gallegos\n- Score: 6-3, 6-0\n\nDate is September, not July. The surface matches, but other details are off.\n\nRow 7:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 24 September 2006\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent: Estefania Craci\u00fan\n- Score: 6-3, 6-4\n\nSurface is clay, so not matching. The date is September again.\n\nRow 8:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 1 October 2006\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent: Estefania Craci\u00fan\n- Score: 6-1, 0-6, 6-2\n\nSurface is clay, so no. The date is October.\n\nRow 9:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 6 April 2008\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent: Polona Hercog\n- Score: 6-2, 6-2\n\nDate is April, not July. Surface is clay.\n\nRow 10:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 5 October 2008\n- Surface: clay\n- Opponent: Jorgelina Cravero\n- Score: 2-2 ret\n\nScore ends with a retirement, so it's a different format from the claim.\n\nWait, but in Row 10, the date is October 2008, not July. So none of the rows seem to match all three criteria: hard surface, the exact score of 6-4, 2-6, 3-6, and the specific date of 23 July 2008.\n\nLet me double-check Row 5 because it had the same score as the claim but an earlier date. So, in Row 5, the match was on 23 July 2006 with a hard surface, resulting in a runner-up finish against Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri with the same score mentioned. But the claim's date is 2008, not 2006.\n\nLooking through all the rows again, none have a date of 23 July 2008. The closest is Row 5 on 23 July 2006 and Row 10 in October 2008, but that's clay.\n\nSo, there's no match in the table that matches all three aspects: hard surface, score of 6-4, 2-6, 3-6, and date of 23 July 2008. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to check if any row in the table matches all components of the claim: hard surface, score of 6-4, 2-6, 3-6, and date of 23 July 2008.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 1 be the score of the match on a clay surface with an outcome of winner, at the tournament ciudad ju\u00e1rez, and an opponent in the final of estefania craci\u00fan.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify each component of the claim:\n\n1. **Surface**: Clay\n2. **Outcome**: Winner\n3. **Tournament Name**: Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez\n4. **Opponent in Final**: Estefania Craci\u00fan\n5. **Score**: 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-1\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any rows that match all these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n- **Row 8**: Outcome: winner, date: 1 October 2006, tournament: ciudad ju\u00e1rez, surface: clay, opponent in final: estefania craci\u00fan. The score here is 6 - 1 , 0 - 6 , 6 - 2. This doesn't match the given score of 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.\n\nNo other rows mention Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and Estefania Craci\u00fan with a winner outcome on clay. Therefore, there's no matching row in the table that fully supports all aspects of the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim does not match any row in the table based on tournament name, surface, opponent, outcome, and score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim says: \"winner be the outcome of the match with a score of 6 - 1 , 6 - 4\". \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The term \"winner\" refers to the outcome being a win, so I'll look for rows where the outcome is listed as \"winner\".\n\nNext, the scores mentioned are \"6 - 1 , 6 - 4\". Each row in the table has a score field. For example, Row 3 has a score of \"6 - 3 , 6 - 3\", which is a win for the player.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is runner-up, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Runner-up as well, not relevant.\nRow 3: Winner with scores 6-3 and 6-3. Doesn't match.\nRow 4: Winner, scores 6-3 and 6-1. Not matching.\nRow 5: Runner-up.\nRow 6: Winner, scores 6-3 and 6-0. No.\nRow 7: Winner, scores 6-3 and 6-4. Wait, this matches! So Row 7 has a winner with those exact scores.\n\nRow 8: Scores are 6-1, 0-6, 6-2. Not matching.\nRow 9: Scores 6-2, 6-2. Doesn't match.\nRow 10: Score is 2-2 ret. So not relevant.\n\nSo only Row 7 has a winner with scores exactly 6-3 and 6-4. The claim says \"6 - 1 , 6 - 4\". That's different from what Row 7 shows, which is 6-3, 6-4. Therefore, the claim doesn't correctly describe any of the rows.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if there are other rows that match the score part. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at each row's scores:\n\nRow 1: 0-6, 0-6\nRow 2: 4-6,5-7\nRow3: 6-3,6-3\nRow4:6-3,6-1\nRow5:6-4,2-6,3-6\nRow6:6-3,6-0\nRow7:6-3,6-4 (this is a match for the score part)\nRow8:6-1,0-6,6-2\nRow9:6-2,6-2\nRow10:2-2 ret\n\nSo only Row7 has 6-3 and 6-4 as scores with outcome winner. But the claim is looking for 6-1 and 6-4.\n\nIs there any row where the score is 6-1 and 6-4? Looking through, I don't see that combination in any of the rows.\n\nSo the claim's description of the score doesn't match any row exactly. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it doesn't accurately describe any of the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"runner - up be the outcome of the match on 12 september 2003.\" \n\nFirst, I should carefully go through each row in the table to see if there's a match that fits the date and outcome specified.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: Date is 27 July 2003. The outcome is runner-up. But the date doesn't match September 2003, so it's not relevant here.\n\nRow 2: Date is 12 September 2004. Outcome is runner-up. Again, the date is September but in 2004, not 2003. So no match yet.\n\nRows 3-10 all have dates either before or after September 2003, except for Row 2 which is in September 2004, so none of them match the date specified.\n\nWait a second\u2014no row in the table has the date 12 September 2003. The closest is Row 2 with 12 September 2004, but that's a year later and different outcome as well (runner-up vs winner? Or maybe not). Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 1: July 2003\nRow 2: Sep 2004\nRow 3: May 2006\nRow 4: June 2006\nRow 5: July 2006\nRow 6: Sep 2006\nRow 7: Sep 2006\nRow 8: Oct 2006\nRow 9: April 2008\nRow 10: Oct 2008\n\nNone of these rows have a date in September 2003. Therefore, there's no match where the outcome was runner-up on that specific date.\n\nSo the claim is looking for a runner-up outcome on 12 September 2003. Since no such row exists in the table, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for a runner-up outcome on 12 September 2003. Upon reviewing all rows, none have this exact date and outcome combination.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "clay be the surface when the score be 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the instructions. The claim is: \"clay be the surface when the score be 6 - 4 , 2 - 6 , 3 - 6\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that whenever a match has a score of 6-4, 2-6, and 3-6, the playing surface is clay. So my task is to check if there's any row in the table where all three of these scores appear together, and then verify if the surface for that row is indeed clay.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, and score. The score column seems to have three numbers separated by spaces and possibly a 'ret' indicating retirement. For example, one of the scores is \"6 - 3 , 6 - 0\", which I assume means two sets: first set 6-3, second set 6-0.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any have the score 6-4, 2-6, 3-6. \n\nStarting with Row 1: outcome is runner-up, date July 27, 2003, tournament Puerto Ordaz, surface hard, opponent Zuzana Cerna, score 0-6, 0-6. That's two sets of 0-6, which doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 2: Runner-up on September 12, 2004, in Santiago, clay surface, opponent Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, score 4-6,5-7. Again, that's two sets each ending with a single digit, not matching 6-4, etc.\n\nRow 3: Winner on May 28, 2006, Monterrey, hard, Mariana Duque, scores 6-3,6-3. No match.\n\nRow 4: Winner on June 4, 2006, Le\u00f3n, hard, Agustina Lepore, scores 6-3,6-1. Not the score we're looking for.\n\nRow 5: Runner-up on July 23, 2006, Campos do Jord\u00e3o, hard, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, score 6-4,2-6,3-6. Oh, wait! Here's a row where the scores are 6-4, then 2-6, and 3-6. So that's exactly the combination mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, checking the surface for this row: it's hard. The claim says that when this score occurs, the surface is clay, but here it's hard. That would mean the claim is false because the surface doesn't match.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other rows with this exact score. Scanning through Rows 6-10:\n\nRow 6: Scores are 6-3,6-0.\nRow 7: 6-3,6-4.\nRow 8: 6-1,0-6,6-2. That's three sets, but the first is 6-1, second 0-6, third 6-2. Not matching 6-4,2-6,3-6.\nRow 9: Scores are two sets of 6-2.\nRow 10: Ends with a 'ret' so not relevant.\n\nSo only Row 5 has the exact score sequence of 6-4, 2-6, 3-6. But its surface is hard, not clay. Therefore, the claim is false because when that specific score occurs, the surface isn't clay as claimed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that whenever a match ends with scores of 6-4, 2-6, and 3-6, it's played on a clay surface. Upon reviewing the table, only Row 5 (runner-up on July 23, 2006) has this exact score combination, but its surface is hard, not clay.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the score is exactly \"6-4\", \"2-6\", and \"3-6\".\n2. **Check Surface for Those Rows:** For each match with that score, verify if the surface is clay.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since Row 5 has the specified score but a hard surface, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
