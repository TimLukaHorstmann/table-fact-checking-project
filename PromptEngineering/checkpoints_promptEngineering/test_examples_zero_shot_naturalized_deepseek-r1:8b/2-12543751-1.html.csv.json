    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the claim: \"the performance of 'higher and higher' in the top 20 bracket garderned an advancement.\" Hmm, that wording seems a bit off. I think they probably meant to say \"advanced\" instead of \"garderned,\" which is a typo. So, correcting it mentally, it should be about whether the performance in the Top 20 bracket led to an advancement.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, each row has several columns: week, theme, song choice, original artist, and result. I need to find out if there's any row where the song is \"higher and higher\" in the Top 20 bracket that resulted in an advancement.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Week: audition, theme: chicago, song: walking on the moon... Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Vegas verdicts, song: living for the city... No.\nRow 3: Week: top 20. Song choice is \"higher and higher\" by Jackie Wilson. The result is \"advanced.\" That seems relevant because the claim is about a performance in the Top 20 leading to advancement.\n\nRows 4-7 don't have \"higher and higher\" as the song choice, so they can be ignored for this specific claim.\n\nSo, only Row 3 has the correct song and result. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE because there's evidence supporting it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nThe claim is: \"audition be the week the original artist , lionel richie.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse it. It looks like they're trying to say that in the 'audition' week, the original artist was Lionel Richie. So I should look for the row where the week is 'audition' and check if the original artist column has Lionel Richie.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Week: audition, Theme: chicago, Song choice: walking on the moon, Original artist: The Police, Result: advanced.\nRow 2: Week: vegas verdicts, etc., not relevant.\nRow 3: Top 20, group 2, higher and higher, Jackie Wilson. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Top 10, Sam Cooke. No.\nRow 5: Top 8, Heroes, Lionel Richie. Wait, this is row 5, week: top 8, original artist: Lionel Richie.\nRow 6: Week: top 4, judges' choice, etc., not relevant.\nRow 7: Finale, Neil Diamond.\n\nSo the claim mentions 'audition' as the week. Looking for a row with 'audition' as the week is only Row 1. But in Row 1, the original artist is The Police, not Lionel Richie. So there's no week called 'audition' where the original artist is Lionel Richie. Instead, Lionel Richie was in Week 5.\n\nSo the claim seems to be mixing up the weeks and artists. Therefore, it's FALSE because the 'audition' week doesn't have Lionel Richie as the original artist.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the 'audition' week with Lionel Richie, but according to the table, he performed in a different week. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"original artist\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"higher and higher song garner an advanced result during top 10 week.\"\n\nFirst, I should look for the relevant cells in the table that might support this claim. Let me go through each row.\n\nRow 1: Week is audition, theme is Chicago, song choice is Walking on the Moon. Not relevant because it's not about \"Higher and Higher\" or top 10 week.\n\nRow 2: Week is Vegas Verdicts, theme N/A, song choice Living for the City by Stevie Wonder. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Week is Top 20, theme Group 2, song choice Higher and Higher by Jackie Wilson. The song is \"Higher and Higher,\" but the week here is Top 20, not Top 10. So it's not during Top 10 week.\n\nRow 4: Week is Top 10, theme N/A, song choice Bring It On Home to Me by Sam Cooke. Not relevant because the song isn't Higher and Higher.\n\nRow 5: Week is Top 8, theme Heroes, song choice Easy by Lionel Richie. Not relevant.\n\nRow 6: Week is Top 4, judges' choice contestant's choice, song Can't Help Falling in Love Sir Duke by Elvis Presley and Stevie Wonder. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Week is Finale, theme Duets, song Red Red Wine by Neil Diamond. Not relevant.\n\nWait, so none of the rows with \"Higher and Higher\" are during Top 10 week. Row 3 is Top 20, row 4 is Top 10 but a different song.\n\nSo the claim says that during Top 10 week, the song Higher and Higher got an advanced result. But looking at the table, when the song was performed (Row 3), it was during Top 20 week. In Row 4, another song was performed in Top 10 week.\n\nTherefore, there's no evidence in the table that \"Higher and Higher\" was performed during Top 10 week with an advanced result. The claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
