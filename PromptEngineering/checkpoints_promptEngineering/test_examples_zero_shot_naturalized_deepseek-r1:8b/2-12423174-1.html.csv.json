    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"asc diaraf lose to stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two teams: asc diaraf and stade malien. It says that asc diaraf lost to stade malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. So, I'm looking for evidence in the table that supports this.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a match between two teams over two legs (first leg and second leg). The columns include the names of both teams and their aggregate score (agg), which is the total goals from both legs.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where these two teams might have played against each other. \n\nRow 1: team 1 is al - merrikh, team 2 is tele sc asmara. No match between asc diaraf or stade malien here.\n\nRow 2: abaluhya united vs great olympics. Not relevant.\n\nRow 3: Here I see team 1 as asc diaraf and team 2 as stade malien. The aggregate score is 3 - 4, with first leg 3-0 and second leg 0-4. So in both legs, asc diaraf lost to stade malien.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. I need to check if this match was part of that competition in 1971. The table doesn't specify the year, so I'm not sure. Maybe the aggregate score can help? Asc diaraf's aggregate against stade malien is 3-4, which suggests they lost both legs. But without knowing the year from the table, it's unclear if this was in 1971.\n\nHowever, the claim says \"in the 1971 african cup of champion club,\" so I need to confirm whether asc diaraf vs stade malien indeed happened in that specific year and competition. Since the table doesn't provide the year, but shows a match between these two teams with their aggregate score, it's possible that this was part of the 1971 African Cup.\n\nAssuming the table includes matches from 1971, then yes, asc diaraf lost to stade malien in that year. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant information confirming the claim can be found in Row 3, where asc diaraf and stade malien faced each other with a final aggregate score of 3-4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"young african.\" Looking at the table, I see that there's a team named \"young africans\" in row 9. That seems relevant because the claim refers to them scoring points. So, their performance is key here.\n\nThe claim says they scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. Now, looking at the table provided, each row has information about two teams and their match results over two legs. However, I don't see any column that specifies the year or the tournament name. The closest we have is \"agg: x - y,\" which probably stands for aggregate score.\n\nSo, in row 9, team 1 is young africans with an agg of 2 - 0. That means they scored a total of 2 goals against their opponent. This aligns with the claim that they scored 2 points. Wait, but I'm not sure if \"points\" refers to goals or actual tournament points. In football, points are usually goals scored minus goals conceded, so 2-0 would mean two goals in aggregate.\n\nBut the table doesn't mention the year, only the match results and aggregate scores. Since the claim specifies the 1971 African Cup, I don't have evidence from the table that confirms this specific tournament. The table entries are for some matches, but without knowing which tournaments these are, it's hard to link them directly.\n\nSo, while young africans did score 2 in a match (row 9), the claim ties it specifically to the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs, which isn't directly supported by the table. The table doesn't provide information about the tournament year or name, only the scores from two legs.\n\nTherefore, the claim can't be fully verified because we don't have evidence from the table about the specific tournament and its year mentioned in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"the young african\" scoring 2 points in the 1971 African Cup. The table has a row for young africans (row 9) with an aggregate score of 2-0, which aligns with the claim's point value but lacks information about the tournament year.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against the enugu ranger\" is true based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking through each row and column of the table to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the table structure. Each row seems to represent a match between two teams. The columns involved are the team names and their aggregate score, including both legs of the match. The term \"agg\" likely stands for aggregate, which is the total points from both legs.\n\nLooking at the claim: it mentions \"secteur 6\" as one team and \"enugu ranger\" as the other. So I need to find a row where these two teams are matched against each other.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Teams are al-merrikh and tele sc asmara. No match here.\nRow 2: abaluhya united vs great olympics. Not our teams.\nRow 3: asc diaraf vs stade malien. Nope.\nRow 4: maseru united vs mmm tamatave. Still not matching.\nRow 5: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda. No match.\nRow 6: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9. Not relevant.\nRow 7: esp\u00e9rance vs al-ahly (benghazi). Doesn't fit.\nRow 8: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers. Ah, here we go! This is the row we need to check.\n\nLooking at Row 8: team 1 is secteur 6 with an aggregate score of 1 - 2. Team 2 is enugu rangers, and their aggregate is likely also 1 - 2 since they are playing against each other. Wait, but in the table, team 1's agg is listed as 1 - 2, which means sector 6 scored 1 point, while enugu rangers have 2 points. So, the match result would be that enugu rangers won by a score of 1-2 in aggregate.\n\nThe claim says \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger.\" Let me parse this: does it mean that sector 6 lost by a margin of 1 point? Or did they lose with a certain score?\n\nLooking at the scores, team 2 (enugu rangers) has agg 2 - 1. Wait no, in row 8, team 1 is secteur 6 with agg 1-2, and team 2 is enugu rangers with agg 1-1? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait the table's row 8 says:\n\nteam 1: secteur 6, agg: 1 - 2\nteam 2: enugu rangers, 1st leg: 1 - 1, 2nd leg: 0 - 1\n\nSo overall, team 2 (enugu rangers) has a higher aggregate score. So sector 6 lost the match.\n\nThe claim says \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against enugu ranger.\" Now, how is the loss by 1? Let's see:\n\nIn the second leg, enugu rangers scored 0-1, so team 2 won that leg. The aggregate score for sector 6 was 1 - 2, meaning they lost both legs? Wait no, because in the first leg, it was 1-1, and the second leg was 0-1, so overall 1-2. So enugu rangers scored 1 (from first leg) plus 1 from the second leg, making their aggregate 2 points. Sector 6 only got 1 point in total.\n\nSo sector 6 lost by a score of 0-1 in the second leg and 1-2 overall. The claim says they lose \"by 1,\" which might refer to the margin of loss. Since the aggregate is 1-2, the difference is 1. So that fits.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on row 8.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant information is found in Row 8, where \"secteur 6\" and \"enugu rangers\" are matched against each other. The table shows that \"secteur 6\" lost by a score of 1-2, which means they lost by one point.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"as porto novo score no point against the victoria club mokanda.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where both \"team 1\" and \"team 2\" match the teams mentioned in the claim. \n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 5 has team 1 as \"as porto novo\" and team 2 as \"victoria club mokanda.\" That's a match.\n\nNext, I'll check the scores between these two teams. The column for scoring is likely \"agg\" since that stands for aggregate. In row 5, under agg, it's 0 - 3. So team 1 scored 0 points, and team 2 scored 3.\n\nThe claim says \"as porto novo score no point,\" which would mean their total was 0. Since that's exactly what the table shows, this seems to be correct.\n\nI also need to make sure there are no other rows with these teams that might affect the outcome, but row 5 is the only one.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score 5 more points than their opponent\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has nine rows, each corresponding to a match between two teams. In each row, there's information about both team 1 and team 2, including their aggregate score (agg) and details for the first leg and second leg.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"canon yaound\u00e9\" scoring 5 more points than their opponent. So my main focus should be on finding canon yaound\u00e9's matches in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Team 1 is Al Merrikh, so not canon yaound\u00e9.\n- Row 2: Team 1 is Abaluhya United, nope.\n- Row 3: Asc Diaraf as team 1? Not matching.\n- Row 4: Maseru United, nope.\n- Row 5: As Porto Novo, not the one.\n- Row 6: Here we go! Team 1 is canon yaound\u00e9. Their aggregate score is 9-4.\n\nNow, I need to check if they scored 5 more points than their opponent in this match. The opponent here is team 2, which is As Solidarit\u00e9.\n\nThe first leg had canon yaound\u00e9 scoring 7 goals, and the second leg they scored 2 goals, totaling 9. The opponent's aggregate is 4. So the difference between canon yaound\u00e9 and their opponent is 9 - 4 = 5 points. That matches the claim perfectly.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't other instances of canon yaound\u00e9 in the table beyond row 6. Scanning through the remaining rows:\n\n- Row 7: Team 1 is Esp\u00e9rance.\n- Rows 8 and 9 don't mention canon yaound\u00e9 either. So row 6 is the only match where canon yaound\u00e9 is involved.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the claim holds true because canon yaound\u00e9's aggregate score was indeed 5 points more than their opponent in that match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"asc diaraf win against stade malien in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: asc diaraf and stade malien. From the table, I should look for these team names to find their matches. Looking at Row 3, I see \"asc diaraf\" as team 1 and \"stade malien\" as team 2. That's promising because it directly relates to the claim.\n\nNext, the claim specifies that asc diaraf won against stade malien. So I need to check the match results between these two teams. The table provides two legs of the match: the first leg and the second leg. For Row 3, team 1 (asc diaraf) has a score of 3-0 in the first leg and 0-4 in the second leg. Wait, that means asc diaraf scored 3 goals against stade malien in the first game but lost the second leg with 0 goals. So overall, the aggregate result would be 3-4 against, which isn't a win for asc diaraf.\n\nHmm, this seems conflicting because the claim states a win. I need to verify if I'm interpreting the table correctly. The table shows each row as two legs: first leg and second leg. For Row 3, team 1's aggregate is 3-4, which suggests they lost overall. But wait, maybe in some competitions, the aggregate is only one game? No, usually, it's over two legs.\n\nSo if asc diaraf had a higher score in the first leg but lost the second, their total would be 3-4 against stade malien, meaning stade malien won. Therefore, the claim that asc diaraf won is incorrect because they lost both legs and the aggregate.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. If team 1 is asc diaraf with a score of 3-0 in the first leg and 0-4 in the second, their total goals are 3+0=3 for and 0+4=4 against. So overall, 3-4 against stade malien, meaning they lost. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut I should double-check if there's any possibility that asc diaraf won. Maybe the table only shows one leg? No, each row has two legs. So the conclusion is that asc diaraf did not win against stade malien in 1971; instead, they lost both legs and the aggregate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because asc diaraf didn't win but actually lost to stade malien.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that asc diaraf won against stade malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs. However, upon examining Row 3 of the table, we see that asc diaraf scored 3 goals in the first leg but lost the second leg 0-4, resulting in an overall loss with a scoreline of 3-4 against stade malien. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"team 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table and check for any mention of 'secteur 6' and 'enugu rangers'. The claim involves two teams: secteur 6 and enugu rangers.\n\nLooking at the rows one by one:\n\nRow 1: Teams are al-merrikh and tele sc asmara. No match here.\nRow 2: abaluhya united vs great olympics. Not relevant.\nRow 3: asc diaraf vs stade malien. Nope.\nRow 4: maseru united vs mmm tamatave.

Not the same.\nRow 8: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers. This looks promising. I need to check this row.\nRow 9: young africans vs lavori publici. No.\n\nSo, in row 8, team 1 is secteur 6 and team 2 is enugu rangers. The agg column shows 1-2 for the series. That means over both legs, secteur 6 lost to enugu rangers because their aggregate is lower (1-2). Wait, but the claim says \"secteur 6 win agains...\" So they won? But according to the table, they lost.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if 'agg: 1-2' means that in total, secteur 6 scored 1 and enugu rangers scored 2. So overall, enugu rangers won the aggregate, meaning secteur 6 didn't win. Therefore, the claim that secteur 6 won against enugu rangers is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. In row 8, there's a cell for team 1: secteur 6 and team 2: enugu rangers.

The key points are:\n- The team in question is \"Young Africans.\"\n- They scored zero points.\n- This happened in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I see it has 9 rows, each representing a match between two teams. For each row, we have details like the two teams involved and their aggregate score (agg) after both legs of the match.\n\nI need to check if there's any row where \"Young Africans\" are mentioned as team 1 or team 2, with an aggregate score of 0-3, which would mean they scored zero points. Wait, no\u2014the claim says they scored zero points, but in football terms, a 0-3 score means the other team scored three goals. So if Young Africans scored zero points, their aggregate should be 0- something.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Team1 is Al-Merrikh, agg 2-2.\nRow 2: Team1 Abaluhya United, agg 1-3.\nRow 3: Asc Diaraf, agg 3-4.\nRow4: Maseru United, agg 3-5.\nRow5: As Porto Novo, agg 0-3. Wait, this is team1: as porto novo, agg 0-3. So their score is 0-3. That means they scored zero goals in aggregate, which would mean they didn't score any points. But the claim says Young Africans, not As Porto Novo.\n\nRow6: Canon Yaound\u00e9, agg9-4.\nRow7: Esp\u00e9rance, agg1-0.\nRow8: Secteur 6, agg1-2.\nRow9: Young Africans, agg2-0. Here, team1 is Young Africans with an aggregate score of 2-0.\n\nWait, so in row9, Young Africans have an aggregate score of 2-0 against Lavori Publici. So they scored two goals and the opponents scored zero. That doesn't mean they scored zero points; in fact, it's the opposite\u2014they scored points (two). So that can't be the match referred to in the claim.\n\nBut looking back, row5 has as porto novo with agg 0-3. If this is team1, their score is 0-3. But the claim is about Young Africans. Unless I'm misunderstanding, maybe I need to check if any of the other rows have Young Africans.\n\nWait, in row9, it's team1: young africans, so that's correct. Their aggregate is 2-0, which means they scored two goals and won that match. So their points are not zero; they have two points from that match.\n\nLooking again at all the teams:\n\nIn row5, as porto novo has agg 0-3. If this was Young Africans, but it's clearly team1: as porto novo. So in that case, if Young Africans were in a match where their aggregate was 0- something, maybe in another year.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the column names. Let me check:\n\nEach row has \"team1\" and \"team2\". For example, row5: team1: as porto novo, agg: 0 -3, team2: victoria club mokanda, 1st leg: 0-1, 2nd leg: 0-2.\n\nSo their aggregate is 0-3. That means as porto novo scored zero and lost both legs. But the claim is about Young Africans scoring zero points in 1971.\n\nI don't see any row where team1 or team2 is \"Young Africans\" with an aggregate score of 0- something, except row9 where they have a positive score.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all rows again:\n\nRow numbers from 0 to 8 (assuming the first row is index 0? Or maybe it's 1-based? The example given in the instructions uses row_index starting at 0, but sometimes tables are 1-based. But the claim is about 1971; perhaps that refers to a specific year.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, each row seems to represent a match between two teams over two legs, and \"agg\" is the aggregate score after both legs.\n\nI think the key is to find any row where team1 or team2 is Young Africans with agg 0- something. But from the table provided, I don't see any such entry.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but in the given data, row9 is the only one with Young Africans, and their agg is 2-0, which is positive.\n\nSo that suggests there's no match where Young Africans scored zero points. Therefore, the claim would be false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the claim says \"the young african score zero point in the 1971 african cup of champion club.\"\n\nIn the table, each row seems to represent a match between two teams, likely from different years because 1971 is quite old. So perhaps this table doesn't cover that year.\n\nBut then, the relevant cells would be none, because the data might not include matches from 1971.\n\nWait, but in the given table, there's no indication of the year each row represents. So unless the user can confirm which years are in the table, it's unclear.\n\nHowever, based on the given data, I have to check if any of the teams named \"Young Africans\" have an aggregate score of 0 points. From the table, only row9 has Young Africans with agg2-0. So they didn't score zero, but scored two.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no evidence in the provided data that Young Africans scored zero points in any match listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on the table provided, which lists matches between various teams over two legs. The key is to find if \"Young Africans\" have a score of 0 points in their aggregate. From the table, only row9 shows Young Africans with an aggregate of 2-0, indicating they scored points, not zero.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because there's no evidence in the provided data that Young Africans scored zero points in any match listed. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

In that row, their aggregate score (agg) is 9-4, which means they scored a total of 9 points against their opponent. The claim says they scored zero points, so this doesn't match.\n\nI should check if the scores in the legs add up to 9 for Canon Yaound\u00e9. In Row 6, the first leg score is 7-3 (so Canon scored 7) and the second leg is 2-1 (Canon scored 2). Totaling 7+2=9, which confirms their aggregate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Canon Yaound\u00e9 did not score zero points but nine in total against their opponent.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are found by checking each row for \"canon yaound\u00e9\" as team 1. Only Row 6 matches this condition, where their aggregate score is 9-4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then find the relevant cells that support this claim. The claim is: \"as porto novo score 3 points against the victoria club mokanda.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a match between the teams mentioned in the claim and the corresponding scores.\n\nLooking at Row 5: team 1 is As Porto Novo with an aggregate score of 0 - 3. Team 2 is Victoria Club Mokanda with aggregate 0 - 2. Hmm, but the claim says As Porto Novo scored 3 points against Victoria Club Mokanda. Wait, in the table, As Porto Novo's total is 0-3, which I think means they lost and scored 0 goals and conceded 3. So their points would be 0 from two legs? Or maybe it's the aggregate score. Similarly, Victoria Club Mokanda has 0-2, so they also lost.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"score 3 points,\" which might mean that As Porto Novo scored three goals in total against Victoria Club Mokanda. Looking at Row 5: team 1 is As Porto Novo with agg: 0 - 3, and team 2 is Victoria Club Mokanda with agg: 0 - 2. So if the scoreline is 0-3 for team 1, that means they lost both legs? Or perhaps it's the total aggregate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row has two teams, team 1 and team 2, along with their aggregate scores (agg) in the format team1_agg: score1 - score2, and then the first leg and second leg scores.\n\nSo for Row 5: team1 is As Porto Novo, agg: 0-3. That would mean over both legs combined, they scored 0 goals and conceded 3. Team2 is Victoria Club Mokanda with agg: 0-2, meaning they scored 0 and conceded 2. So the match scores for each leg must be considered.\n\nLooking at the first leg score: As Porto Novo vs Victoria Club Mokanda's first leg was 0 - 1 (team2 won), so team1 scored 0, team2 scored 1. Second leg was 0 - 2 (team2 won again), so team1 scored 0, team2 scored 2.\n\nTherefore, As Porto Novo's total goals in both legs were 0+0=0, and Victoria Club Mokanda scored 1+2=3. So team1 didn't score any goals against team2. Therefore, the claim that \"as porto novo score 3 points\" is incorrect because they actually scored zero.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the agg field. Perhaps agg: x - y means that in aggregate, team1 scored x and team2 scored y. So for Row5, team1's agg is 0-3, so they scored 0 and conceded 3. Team2's agg is 0-2, meaning they scored 0 and conceded 2. But wait, that can't be because in the first leg, team2 scored 1 and in the second leg, they scored 2, totaling 3 goals. So maybe the agg field for team1 is their total goals, and team2's agg is their total goals.\n\nWait, no. The agg: x - y likely means that for team1, it's x total goals scored and y goals conceded in aggregate, same for team2. So team1 (As Porto Novo) scored 0 and conceded 3, while team2 (Victoria Club Mokanda) scored 0 and conceded 2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the first leg was 0-1, so team1 scored 0, team2 scored 1. Second leg: 0-2, so team1 again 0, team2 2. So total for team1: 0 goals in both legs, and for team2: 3 goals (1+2). Therefore, As Porto Novo didn't score any goals against Victoria Club Mokanda.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because As Porto Novo didn't score 3 points; they scored none. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to find relevant cells. The claim refers to two teams: As Porto Novo and Victoria Club Mokanda. Looking through the table:\n\nRow5 is where team1 is As Porto Novo and team2 is Victoria Club Mokanda. So row_index 5. Then, the columns are 'team 1', 'agg', 'team 2'. So in Row5, we need to check the agg for both teams.\n\nWait, the claim says that As Porto Novo scored 3 points against Victoria Club Mokanda. But according to the table, team1's agg is 0-3. That would mean team1 (As Porto Novo) scored 0 and conceded 3. So perhaps the user confused the scores. Alternatively, maybe they meant that As Porto Novo won with a score of 3 points? No, in football, points are goals unless it's a different scoring system.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about the team scoring 3 points. Looking at row5, team1 (As Porto Novo) has agg:0-3, which might mean they lost both legs with 0 and 3 goals respectively? Or perhaps it's total goals for each team.\n\nIn any case, As Porto Novo didn't score 3 points; the claim is false. So to find relevant cells, I need to look at row5 and the specific columns where these scores are mentioned.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row_index:5 (Row5)\n- column_name: 'agg' for both team1 and team2.\n\nBecause that's where the score difference is shown. So each cell would have row_index 5 and their respective column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because As Porto Novo did not score 3 points against Victoria Club Mokanda; they scored none in both legs of the match.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
