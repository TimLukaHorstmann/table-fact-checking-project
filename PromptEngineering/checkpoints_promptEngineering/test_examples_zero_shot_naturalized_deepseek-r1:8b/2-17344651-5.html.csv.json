    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"boston celtic largest win margin in december be 23 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what the claim is saying: it's stating that the Boston Celtics had their largest win margin during December with a 23-point difference.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game, and there are multiple columns: game number, date, opponent, score (which includes both team scores), location, and record. The relevant column here is \"score\" because it shows the point differential for each game.\n\nI need to find all the games in December where the Celtics won by the largest margin. From the table:\n\n- Row 1: Score is 110 - 104, so a win margin of 6 points.\n- Row 2: Score is 122 - 99, a margin of 23 points.\n- Row 3: 99 - 104, margin is -5 (loss).\n- Row 4: 123 - 107, margin of 16.\n- Row 5: 107 - 98, margin of 9.\n- Row 6: 128 - 127, margin of 1.\n- Row 7: 130 - 121, margin of 9.\n- Row 8: 107 - 110, loss with margin of -3.\n- Row 9: 117 - 106, margin of 11.\n- Row 10: 101 - 94, margin of 7.\n- Row 11: 126 - 108, margin of 18.\n- Row 12: 92 - 107, loss with margin of -15.\n- Row 13: 117 - 107, margin of 10.\n- Row 14: 85 - 110, loss with margin of -25.\n- Row 15: 119 - 114, margin of 5.\n- Row 16: 118 - 103, margin of 15.\n- Row 17: 120 - 112, margin of 8.\n- Row 18: 98 - 114, loss with margin of -16.\n\nThe largest win margins in December are:\n\n- Row 2: 23 points\n- Row 14: Celtics lost by 25, which is a larger margin but it's a loss.\n- The others are smaller margins or losses.\n\nSo the claim says that their largest win margin was 23 points. However, they also had a larger loss margin of 25 points against the Chicago Bulls on December 22nd (Row 14). But the claim specifically mentions \"largest win margin,\" so we should focus only on wins.\n\nLooking at all the wins:\n\nThe maximum win margin is indeed 23 points in Row 2. So the claim is TRUE because that's the highest win margin they had in December.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"boston celtic play cleveland cavalier on consecutive day in december\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for games where both teams are Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers playing each other on consecutive days in December.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, and record. The team playing away is listed as \"opponent,\" so to find when the Celtics play the Cavaliers, I need to look for rows where \"opponent\" is either Boston Celtics or Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nNow, let's scan through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Opponent is Cleveland Cavaliers (Cavs). The date is Sat Dec 1.\n- Row 2: Opponent is Cleveland Cavaliers again. Date is Sun Dec 2.\n  \nWait, that's two games in a row on consecutive days: December 1 and December 2. That fits the criteria of playing each other on consecutive days.\n\nBut let me check all rows to ensure there are no more instances. The next Cavs game is Row 3 with the Pistons, so that's not relevant. Then Row 4, opponent Nuggets, etc., until I reach Row 8 again against the Cavs on Dec 12, which is not consecutive. So the only consecutive games in December between Celtics and Cavs are Rows 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's at least one instance where they played each other on consecutive days.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"boston celtic play cleveland cavalier on consecutive day in december,\" we look for rows where both teams play back-to-back games. \n\n- **Row 1**: Celtics vs Cavs, Sat Dec 1\n- **Row 2**: Celtics vs Cavs, Sun Dec 2\n\nThese are consecutive days in December, fulfilling the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"boston celtic play 6 game at boston garden in december\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions that the Boston Celtics played six games at the Boston Garden during December. So, I need to find if there are six games where both the location is Boston Garden and the date falls in December.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, and record. The relevant columns for this claim are \"game\", \"date\", \"opponent\", \"score\", \"location\", and \"record\". But specifically, I'm interested in games where the location is Boston Garden and the date is December.\n\nI'll go through each row to check these conditions:\n\nRow 1: Game 15 on Sat Dec 1 at Boston Garden. That's one game.\nRow 2: Game 16 on Sun Dec 2 at Boston Garden. Second game.\nRow 4: Game 18 on Wed Dec 5 at Boston Garden. Third game.\nRow 6: Game 20 on Sun Dec 9 at Boston Garden. Fourth game.\nRow 23: Game 23 on Fri Dec 14 at Boston Garden. Fifth game.\nRow 24: Game 24 on Sat Dec 15 at Boston Garden. Sixth game.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in december\" which I assume means December 1 to December 31. So all these games fit within December. That's six games in total.\n\nBut let me double-check each date:\n\n- Row 1: Dec 1\n- Row 2: Dec 2\n- Row 4: Dec 5\n- Row 6: Dec 9\n- Row 23: Dec 14\n- Row 24: Dec 15\n\nYes, all these dates are in December. Each of these games is at the Boston Garden. So that's six instances.\n\nNow, the claim says \"boston celtic play 6 game at boston garden in december.\" The term \"play\" implies they were part of a series or the team played multiple games there during the month.\n\nTherefore, based on the table, the claim is supported by six relevant rows where the location is Boston Garden and the date is December.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that the Boston Celtics played six games at the Boston Garden in December. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"Boston Celtic largest win margin in December was 23 points, which happened on Dec 1.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main things: a win margin of 23 points and that this occurred on December 1st.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, and record. The 'score' column shows the team's points minus their opponents', so for example, in Row 1, Boston scored 110 and the opponent scored 104, giving a margin of 6 points.\n\nThe claim is about a \"largest win margin\" which would be the biggest lead they achieved during December. So I need to find if on Dec 1st there was a game where they won by 23 points or more.\n\nLooking through each row for games in December:\n\nRow 1: Game 15, Sat Dec 1 vs Cleveland Cavaliers. Score is 110-104, so margin is 6.\nRow 2: Game 16, Sun Dec 2 vs same opponent, score 122-99, margin 23.\nRow 3: Tue Dec 4, margin 5 (99-104).\nRow 4: Wed Dec 5, margin 16 (123-107).\nRow 5: Sat Dec 8, margin 9 (107-98).\nRow 6: Sun Dec 9, margin 1 (128-127).\nRow 7: Tue Dec 11, margin 9 (130-121).\nRow 8: Wed Dec 12, margin 3 (107-110).\nRow 9: Fri Dec 14, margin 11 (117-106).\nRow 10: Sat Dec 15, margin 7 (101-94).\nRow 11: Tue Dec 18, margin 18 (126-108).\nRow 12: Wed Dec 19, margin -15 (92-107).\nRow 13: Fri Dec 21, margin 10 (117-107).\nRow 14: Sat Dec 22, margin -25 (85-110).\nRow 15: Wed Dec 26, margin 5 (119-114).\nRow 16: Thu Dec 27, margin 15 (118-103).\nRow 17: Sat Dec 29, margin 8 (120-112).\nRow 18: Sun Dec 30, margin -16 (98-114).\n\nFrom this, the largest margin in December was on Dec 2, where they won by 23 points against the Cavaliers. That's a game number of 16.\n\nNow, the claim says it happened on Dec 1. But according to the table, that first game on Dec 1 only had a margin of 6 points. So the largest margin didn't occur on Dec 1 but two days later on Dec 2. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Boston's largest December win margin was 23 points on Dec 1. However, checking each row shows the largest margin occurred on Dec 2 with a 23-point victory, not on Dec 1. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"boston celtic largest lose margin in december be 25 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that during December, the Boston Celtics experienced their largest loss with a margin of 25 points. So, I need to check if there's any game in December where the Celtics lost by 25 points or more.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists games from Game 1 to Game 32, with each row containing details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, and record. The dates range from Saturday, December 1st to Sunday, December 30th. That covers all of December as per the given data.\n\nNext, I need to identify which games are played by the Boston Celtics. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 2: Opponent is Cleveland Cavaliers.\n- Row 4: Opponent is Denver Nuggets.\n- Row 6: Opponent is Atlanta Hawks.\n- Row 7: Opponent is New Jersey Nets.\n- Row 8: Opponent is Philadelphia 76ers.\n- Row 10: Opponent is Atlanta Hawks again.\n- Row 11: Opponent is New York Knicks.\n- Row 12: Opponent is Milwaukee Bucks.\n- Row 13: Opponent is Indiana Pacers.\n- Row 14: Opponent is Chicago Bulls.\n- Row 15: Opponent is Phoenix Suns.\n- Row 16: Opponent is Los Angeles Clippers.\n- Row 17: Opponent is San Antonio Spurs.\n- Row 18: Opponent is Milwaukee Bucks again.\n\nWait, so actually, the Boston Celtics are not playing against themselves in these games. The opponents listed are various NBA teams like Cavaliers, Nuggets, Hawks, etc. So maybe I misread something. Wait, no\u2014the table seems to be about a single team's games, possibly the Celtics, but their opponents vary. Let me check if the opponent column is correctly indicating who they're playing against.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is about a specific team, and each row represents a game they played in December. So I need to look for the Celtics' losses and see the margin of their largest loss in December.\n\nLooking at the score in each row: the first number is the team's score, the second is the opponent's score. For example, Row 1: Celtics scored 110, opponent scored 104. That means the Celtics won by 6 points (110-104). So for a loss, I need to see where their score is less than the opponent's.\n\nLet me go through each row and note whether it's a loss and the margin:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Cavaliers. Celtics score 110, opp 104. They won. Margin +6.\nRow 2: Opponent is Cavaliers again. Score 122-99. Celtics won by 23.\nRow 3: Opponent is Pistons. Score 99-104. Celtics lost. Margin is -5 (they lost by 5).\nRow 4: Opponent is Nuggets. Score 123-107. They won by 16.\nRow 5: Opponent is Nets. Score 107-98. Won by 9.\nRow 6: Opponent is Hawks. Score 128-127. Won by 1.\nRow 7: Opponent is Nets again. Score 130-121. Won by 9.\nRow 8: Opponent is 76ers. Score 107-110. Lost. Margin -3.\nRow 9: Opponent is Jazz. Score 117-106. Won by 11.\nRow 10: Opponent is Hawks. Score 101-94. Won by 7.\nRow 11: Opponent is Knicks. Score 126-108. Won by 18.\nRow 12: Opponent is Bucks. Score 92-107. Lost. Margin -15.\nRow 13: Opponent is Pacers. Score 117-107. Won by 10.\nRow 14: Opponent is Bulls. Score 85-110. Lost. Margin -25.\nRow 15: Opponent is Suns. Score 119-114. Won by 5.\nRow 16: Opponent is Clippers. Score 118-103. Won by 15.\nRow 17: Opponent is Spurs. Score 120-112. Won by 8.\nRow 18: Opponent is Bucks again. Score 98-114. Lost. Margin -16.\n\nSo, now I can list all the losses and their margins:\n\n- Row 3: lost by 5 points\n- Row 8: lost by 3 points\n- Row 12: lost by 15 points\n- Row 14: lost by 25 points\n\nSo, in December, the Celtics had a loss where they were behind by 25 points. That's the largest margin of their losses in that month.\n\nTherefore, the claim is stating that the largest loss was 25 points, which matches the data. So the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"boston celtic largest lose margin in december be 25 point\" is **TRUE** based on the provided data. The Boston Celtics experienced a loss with a margin of 25 points against the Chicago Bulls on December 14th.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

Let me start by breaking down the claim and then analyze each part against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that the Celtics played only one game on a Thursday in December. So I need to look for games where the date was in December and check if it's a Thursday. Then, count how many such games there are.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, and record. The relevant columns here are \"date\" and possibly others, but for this claim, the key is to find all games in December on a Thursday.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Dec 1 (Saturday) \u2013 not Thursday.\nRow 2: Dec 2 (Sunday) \u2013 nope.\nRow 3: Dec 4 (Tuesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 4: Dec 5 (Wednesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 5: Dec 8 (Saturday) \u2013 no.\nRow 6: Dec 9 (Sunday) \u2013 no.\nRow 7: Dec 11 (Tuesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 8: Dec 12 (Wednesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 9: Dec 14 (Friday) \u2013 no.\nRow 10: Dec 15 (Saturday) \u2013 no.\nRow 11: Dec 18 (Tuesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 12: Dec 19 (Wednesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 13: Dec 21 (Friday) \u2013 no.\nRow 14: Dec 22 (Saturday) \u2013 no.\nRow 15: Dec 26 (Wednesday) \u2013 no.\nRow 16: Dec 27 (Thursday) \u2013 yes, this is one game on Thursday.\nRow 17: Dec 29 (Saturday) \u2013 no.\nRow 18: Dec 30 (Sunday) \u2013 no.\n\nWait, but the last row is row 18, which is December 30. So in December 2018, the Celtics played a game on Thursday, December 27. Looking at the table, that's row 16 with game number 30 against Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other games in December 2018 on a Thursday. From the dates provided, only Dec 27 is a Thursday. So that would mean only one game on Thursday in December.\n\nBut wait, looking again, maybe I missed something. The table goes up to row 18, which is Dec 30. So from Dec 1 to Dec 30, how many Thursdays are there? Let me count the dates:\n\nDec 1: Sat\nDec 2: Sun\nDec 3: Mon\nDec 4: Tue\nDec 5: Wed\nDec 6: Thu \u2013 Wait, row 4 is Dec 5 (Wed), so Dec 6 would be Thursday but it's not in the table. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me list all dates in December 2018:\n\n1: Sat\n2: Sun\n3: Mon\n4: Tue\n5: Wed\n6: Thu\n7: Fri\n8: Sat\n9: Sun\n10: Mon\n11: Tue\n12: Wed\n13: Thu\n14: Fri\n15: Sat\n16: Sun\n17: Mon\n18: Tue\n19: Wed\n20: Thu\n21: Fri\n22: Sat\n23: Sun\n24: Mon\n25: Tue\n26: Wed\n27: Thu\n28: Fri\n29: Sat\n30: Sun\n\nSo in December, the Thursdays are Dec 6 and Dec 13 and Dec 20 and Dec 27. Wait, that's four Thursdays. But looking at the table, only Dec 27 is listed as a Thursday (row 16). The other dates like Dec 6, 13, and 20 aren't in the table, so perhaps those games are not included. Therefore, only one game on Thursday in December is present in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the dates. Let me check each row's date:\n\nRow 1: sat dec 1\nRow 2: sun dec 2\nRow3: tue dec4\nRow4: wed dec5\nRow5: sat dec8\nRow6: sun dec9\nRow7: tue dec11\nRow8: wed dec12\nRow9: fri dec14\nRow10: sat dec15\nRow11: tue dec18\nRow12: wed dec19\nRow13: fri dec21\nRow14: sat dec22\nRow15: wed dec26\nRow16: thu dec27 \u2013 this is Thursday.\nRow17: sat dec29\nRow18: sun dec30\n\nSo yes, only Dec 27 is a Thursday in the games listed. So that's one game.\n\nBut wait, I thought there are four Thursdays in December 2018, but only Dec 27 is present in the table. So does that mean the Celtics played only one game on Thursday in December?\n\nYes, according to the table provided, only row 16 (Dec 27) is a Thursday. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because they only played one game on Thursday in December.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there are more Thursdays beyond Dec 30? No, since Dec 30 is Sunday, and the next Thursday would be Jan 3, which is outside December. So yes, only Dec 27 is a Thursday in the games listed, making it one game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"the celtic only play 1 game on a thursday in december\" is TRUE based on the given data.\n\nAnswer: TRUE",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim is: \"Boston Celtic play Cleveland Cavalier on consecutive days in December, both at the Boston Garden.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key parts:\n1. Two teams: Boston Celtics (referred to as Boston Celtic) and Cleveland Cavaliers.\n2. They play against each other on two consecutive days.\n3. The games are in December.\n4. Both games are held at the Boston Garden.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row for these conditions.\n\nStarting from game 16: It's game 16 on Sunday, Dec 2, opponent is Cavaliers, location is Boston Garden. Record is 15-1.\n\nNext, game 17: Tuesday, Dec 4 vs Pistons in Pontiac Silverdome. No Cavs here and not consecutive to game 16.\n\nLooking further, the next Cavaliers game after Dec 2 is game 18 on Wednesday, Dec 5, which is also at Boston Garden but not consecutive as it's three days later. \n\nThen, game 19: Saturday, Dec 8 vs Nets in another location, so that's a different opponent and location.\n\nI notice that game 16 is Celtics vs Cavs on Dec 2 (Boston Garden), and the next day, Dec 3, there's no game listed for them. Then, the next Cavs game is Dec 5, which isn't consecutive to Dec 2. Wait, but in the table, after Dec 2, the next Cavs game is Dec 5, which would make it three days later, not consecutive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each row carefully:\n\nRow 16: Game 16, opponent Cavaliers on Dec 2 at Boston Garden.\nNext day, Dec 3: No games listed, so no game against Cavs there.\nThen Dec 4: Pistons, so no.\nDec 5: Another game vs Cavaliers at Boston Garden. So the two games are on Dec 2 and Dec 5. That's not consecutive days.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the claim of consecutive days. The claim says they play on consecutive days, but according to the table, it's Dec 2 and Dec 5, which is a three-day gap.\n\nBut looking again, perhaps I misread something. Let me check each game:\n\nGame 16: Dec 2 vs Cavs at Boston Garden (row 2).\nGame 17: Dec 4 vs Pistons (row3). So the next Cavs game after Dec 2 is Dec 5 (game18). Therefore, they don't play on consecutive days.\n\nSo the claim is false because in December, they don't play on two consecutive days at Boston Garden against each other. Wait, but looking back, perhaps I missed a row where they play on Dec 2 and then another on Dec 3? But no, row2 is Dec2, next row after that is row3: Dec4. So there's a gap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about two consecutive games in December, not necessarily on back-to-back days. But the term \"consecutive day\" implies playing one after another without days in between.\n\nSo based on the table, the Cavs play Celtics on Dec2 and then again on Dec5, which isn't consecutive. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Boston Celtics played against the Cleveland Cavaliers on consecutive days in December at the Boston Garden. Examining the table:\n\n- **Row 16 (Game 16)**: Dec 2 vs Cavs at Boston Garden.\n- The next game involving the Cavs after this is **Row18 (Game18)**: Dec5, which isn't consecutive.\n\nThus, there are no games on two consecutive days in December as per the table. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Boston Celtics play 6 games at Boston Garden in December and win every one.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's look at each part of the claim. It mentions that there are six games played at Boston Garden in December where the Celtics won all of them. So I need to check for six instances where the location is Boston Garden and the result is a win.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Location is Richfield Coliseum, so not relevant.\n- Row 2: Location is Boston Garden. Score is 122 - 99, which means Celtics won. So that's one game.\n- Row 3: Opponent is Pistons, location Pontiac Silverdome, irrelevant.\n- Row 4: Location is Boston Garden, score 123 - 107, Celtics win. That's two games.\n- Row 5: Location is Brendan Byrne Arena, irrelevant.\n- Row 6: Boston Garden again, score 128 - 127, so they won. Three games.\n- Row 7: Hartford Civic Center, not relevant.\n- Row 8: The Spectrum, irrelevant.\n- Row 9: Boston Garden, score 117 - 106, win. Four games.\n- Row 10: The Omni, irrelevant.\n- Row 11: Madison Square Garden, irrelevant.\n- Row 12: Boston Garden, score 92 - 107, so Celtics lost here. This is the first loss mentioned in their record as well.\n- Row 13: Boston Garden again, score 117 - 107, win. Five games.\n- Row 14: Chicago Stadium, irrelevant.\n- Row 15: Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, irrelevant.\n- Row 16: Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, irrelevant.\n- Row 17: Hemisfair Arena, irrelevant.\n- Row 18: The Mecca, irrelevant.\n\nSo from the table, the games at Boston Garden where Celtics won are Rows 2,4,6,9,13. That's five wins, but the claim says six. Also, in Row 12, they lost, so that game is a loss, not a win. So there's only five wins in December at Boston Garden.\n\nWait, let me count again:\n\nRow 2: Win (1)\nRow 4: Win (2)\nRow 6: Win (3)\nRow 9: Win (4)\nRow 13: Win (5)\nSo that's five wins. The claim says six. So the claim is false because there are only five games where they won at Boston Garden in December.\n\nAlso, the dates given in the table go from Dec 1 to Dec 30, so all within December. Therefore, the number of games played and won doesn't add up to six. There's also a loss on Row 12, which isn't part of the six wins.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because there are only five games where Celtics won at Boston Garden in December, not six.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Boston Celtics played six games at Boston Garden in December and won all of them. By examining each row, only five games meet this criteria: Rows 2,4,6,9,13. The presence of a loss on Row 12 further contradicts the claim of winning every game.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the Boston Celtics is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"Boston Celtic's largest loss margin in December was 25 points and it happened on Dec 30.\" \n\nFirst, I should go through each row of the table to see if any match this claim. Let me look for games that took place in December, specifically looking for a game where Boston lost by a margin of 25 points.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. Each row has details like game number, date, opponent, score, location, and record. I need to check each one where the date is in December (dec 1 to dec 30) and see if the loss margin was 25 points.\n\nStarting from row 1: The game on Dec 1 against the Cavaliers. Score is 110-104. That's a win for Boston because 110 > 104, so no loss here.\n\nRow 2: Dec 2 vs Cavaliers again. Score is 122-99. Boston won by 23 points. Not a 25-point margin.\n\nRow 3: Dec 4 against Pistons. Score is 99-104. This is a loss for Boston. The margin is 5 points (104-99). Not 25.\n\nRow 4: Dec 5 vs Nuggets. Score is 123-107. Boston won by 16 points. So no.\n\nRow 5: Dec 8 against Nets. Score is 107-98. Win, 9 points margin. No.\n\nRow 6: Dec 9 vs Hawks. Score is 128-127. That's a win by 1 point. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: Dec 11 against Nets again. Score is 130-121. Boston won by 9 points.\n\nRow 8: Dec 12 vs 76ers. The score is 107-110. So Boston lost this one. The margin is 3 points (110-107). Still not 25.\n\nRow 9: Dec 14 against Jazz. Score is 117-106. Win, so no loss here.\n\nRow 10: Dec 15 vs Hawks. Score is 101-94. Win, margin of 7 points.\n\nRow 11: Dec 18 vs Knicks. Score is 126-108. That's a win by 18 points.\n\nRow 12: Dec 19 vs Bucks. Score is 92-107. Loss for Boston. Margin is 15 points (107-92). Not 25.\n\nRow 13: Dec 21 vs Pacers. Score is 117-107. Win, so no loss here.\n\nRow 14: Dec 22 vs Bulls. Score is 85-110. That's a loss for Boston. The margin is 25 points because 110 - 85 = 25. Oh, that matches the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says the largest margin happened on Dec 30. So I should check if there was another game on Dec 30 where they lost by a larger margin than 25 points.\n\nLooking at the dates: The last game in December is row 18, which is Dec 30 against Bucks. The score is 98-114. Boston lost this one as well. The margin is 16 points (114-98). That's less than 25, so not the largest.\n\nSo in December, the largest loss margin for Boston was on Dec 22 against the Bulls by 25 points. Therefore, the claim that it happened on Dec 30 is false. So the overall claim is false because the game with a 25-point loss occurred earlier in December, not on the 30th.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the largest loss margin for the Boston Celtics in December was 25 points and occurred on Dec 30. From the table:\n\n- On Dec 22 (game 14), the Celtics lost to the Bulls with a score of 85-110, resulting in a 25-point margin.\n- The last game in December was on Dec 30 (game 18) against the Bucks, but it resulted in a loss by only 16 points.\n\nSince the largest margin occurred earlier in December and not on Dec 30, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the celtic only play 1 game on a thursday in december and lose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key points:\n\n1. The Celtics played only one game on Thursday in December.\n2. They lost that game.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nStarting with the date column: looking for games that occurred on Thursday in December.\n\nLooking through the table rows (game 1 to game 18), I'll note the dates and see which are Thursdays in December.\n\nRow 16: Dec 27 is a Thursday. That's one game on Thursday.\nAre there any others? Let me check each date:\n\n- Row 1: Sat Dec 1\n- Row 2: Sun Dec 2\n- Row 3: Tue Dec 4\n- Row 4: Wed Dec 5\n- Row 5: Sat Dec 8\n- Row 6: Sun Dec 9\n- Row 7: Tue Dec 11\n- Row 8: Wed Dec 12\n- Row 9: Fri Dec 14\n- Row 10: Sat Dec 15\n- Row 11: Tue Dec 18\n- Row 12: Wed Dec 19\n- Row 13: Fri Dec 21\n- Row 14: Sat Dec 22\n- Row 15: Wed Dec 26\n- Row 16: Thu Dec 27\n- Row 17: Sat Dec 29\n- Row 18: Sun Dec 30\n\nOnly row 16 is on Thursday in December. So the first part of the claim holds\u2014only one game on Thursday in December.\n\nNext, I need to check if they lost that game. Looking at the score for row 16: the opponent is Los Angeles Clippers, and the score is 118 - 103. Since the Celtics are the home team (as per the table's context), but wait, no\u2014actually, looking at the location column:\n\nRow 16: location is \"los angeles memorial sports arena,\" which means it's an away game for the Celtics. So their score is 103, and the Clippers scored 118. That means the Celtics lost that game.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true: they played only one Thursday game in December and lost it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
