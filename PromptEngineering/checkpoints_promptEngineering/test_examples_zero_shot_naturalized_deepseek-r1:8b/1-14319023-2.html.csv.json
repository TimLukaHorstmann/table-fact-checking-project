    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia , the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Girl doubles are ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\n2. Boy doubles are jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\n\nI need to check if both these statements are true according to the table provided for each year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, with various categories such as boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. The claim specifically mentions 'girl double' and 'boy double', which I assume refer to the girls doubles and boys doubles categories.\n\nSo, my approach will be:\n\n- Find the relevant rows where either ayu pratiwi anggi widia is in the girl doubles or jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita are in the boy doubles.\n- Check if for the same year, both conditions are met.\n\nLet's go through each row to see if any match these conditions.\n\nStarting from 2001 to 2010:\n\nRow 1: 2001\n- Girls doubles: lilyana natsir natalia poluakan. Not matching either name.\n- Boys doubles: hendra setiawan joko riyadi. No match.\n\nRow 2: 2002\n- Girls doubles: purwati meiliana jauhari. No match.\n- Boys doubles: ujang suherlan yoga ukikasah. No match.\n\nRow 3: 2003\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari. Not matching.\n- Boys doubles: fran kurniawan chandra kowi. No match.\n\nRow 4: 2004\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari. Not ayu pratiwi.\n- Boys doubles: aditya dwi putra i made agung. No match.\n\nRow 5: 2005\n- Girls doubles: lily siswanti shendy puspa irawati. Not matching.\n- Boys doubles: rio willianto davin prawidssa. No match.\n\nRow 6: 2006\n- Girls doubles: bellaetrix manuputty samantha lintang. No.\n- Boys doubles: danny bawa chrisnanta afiat yuris wirawan. Not jones ralfy or dandi prabudita.\n\nRow 7: 2007\n- Girls doubles: anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati. No.\n- Boys doubles: budi hartono yohanes rendy sugiarto. No match.\n\nRow 8: 2008\n- Girls doubles: suci rizki andini tiara rosalia nuraidah. No.\n- Boys doubles: didit juang indrianto seiko wahyu kusdianto. No.\n\nRow 9: 2009\n- Girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia. This matches the first part of the claim.\n- Boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita. The claim says \"jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita\", which is exactly what's listed here.\n\nSo, in 2009, both conditions are met:\n- Girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\n- Boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both parts of the condition are satisfied in the same year (2009).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems like it's stating that in a particular year, if the girl singles participant is Lindaweni Fanetri, then the mixed doubles pair would be Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010. Each row lists several categories: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. \n\nI need to check if there's any row where Lindaweni Fanetri is listed as the girl singles player and Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta are the mixed doubles pair.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one.\n\nRow 1: 2001\n- Girls singles: Maria Kristin Yulianti. Not Lindaweni.\n\nRow 2: 2002\n- Girls singles: Fransisca Ratnasari. No match.\n\nRow 3: 2003\n- Girls singles: Wiwis Meilyanna. Nope.\n\nRow 4: 2004\n- Girls singles: Pia Zebadiah. Not matching.\n\nRow 5: 2005\n- Girls singles: Bellaetrix Manuputty. No.\n\nRow 6: 2006\n- Girls singles: Sylvinna Kurniawan. Still no.\n\nRow 7: 2007\n- Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri. Oh, this is the first occurrence of her name in the girls singles column.\n\nNow, let's check the mixed doubles for this row (row_index 6). The mixed doubles are listed as Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto. Hmm, so the pair here isn't Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nRow 8: 2008\n- Girls singles: Ana Rovita. Not Lindaweni.\n\nRow 9: 2009\n- Girls singles: Ana Rovita again. No match.\n\nRow 10: 2010\n- Girls singles: Ganis Nur Rahmadani. Not her.\n\nWait a second, row 7 is for 2007. So in 2007, Lindaweni was the girl singles participant, and the mixed doubles were Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanta. The claim mentions Wifqi Windarto as part of the mixed doubles pair. I need to check if Wifqi Windarto ever teamed up with Debby Susanta in any row where Lindaweni was playing girls singles.\n\nLooking through all the rows, I see that Wifqi Windarto appears in the mixed doubles for row 7 (2007) with someone else, not Debby. Wait no, in row 6 (2006), the mixed doubles are Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanta. So that pair was together in 2006.\n\nIn row 7: 2007\n- Mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta? Let me check the table again. Wait, the 2007 row lists mixed doubles as \"wifqi windarto debby susanto.\" Yes, so in 2007, that pair was together.\n\nBut Lindaweni Fanetri was in girls singles in 2007? No, wait: looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 1: 2001 - Girls singles: Maria Kristin Yulianti\nRow 2: 2002 - Girls singles: Fransisca Ratnasari\nRow 3: 2003 - Girls singles: Wiwis Meilyanna\nRow 4: 2004 - Girls singles: Pia Zebadiah\nRow 5: 2005 - Girls singles: Bellaetrix Manuputty\nRow 6: 2006 - Girls singles: Sylvinna Kurniawan\nRow 7: 2007 - Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\nAh, yes, in row 7 (2007), Lindaweni is the girl singles. Then, looking at the mixed doubles for that year, it's \"wifqi windarto debby susanta.\" So yes, that pair is together.\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows again because I might have missed something. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 7: 2007\n- Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri (yes)\n- Mixed doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanta (correct as per the claim)\n\nSo yes, in 2007, when Lindaweni is playing girl singles, the mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe it wasn't correct. Let me confirm again: in row 6 (2006), the mixed doubles are Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanta. In row 7 (2007), the pair is Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\nSo yes, the claim matches for 2007.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is accurate for the year 2007. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**TRUE**\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the year where Lindaweni Fanetri participated as the girl singles player.\n2. Check if in that same year, Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta were the mixed doubles pair.\n3. From the table, Lindaweni Fanetri was indeed the girl singles in 2007.\n4. In 2007, the mixed doubles were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

The claim says: \"in 2006 , the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table provided. It has rows for each year from 2001 to 2010. Each row lists several categories: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two things for the year 2006:\n1. The boy single is nugroho andi saputro.\n2. The mixed double is danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto.\n\nSo I'll start by locating row 6 since it's for the year 2006. Looking at Row 6, which corresponds to 2006, under boys singles, the name listed is \"nugroho andi saputro.\" That matches the first part of the claim. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check the mixed doubles category in the same row. According to Row 6, the mixed doubles are \"danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto,\" which exactly matches the second part of the claim. \n\nSince both parts of the claim find their respective cells correctly in Row 6, there's no discrepancy or mismatch here.

Each row represents a year from 2001 to 2010. Within each row, there are four columns: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, and girls doubles. Additionally, there's a mixed doubles column that includes both a male and female player.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the year 2007. So my first step is to find the relevant row for 2007. Looking through the table, Row 7 corresponds to the year 2007.\n\nNext, I need to verify the two parts of the claim:\n\n1. The girl double in 2007 should be \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati.\"\n2. The mixed double in 2007 should be \"wifqi windarto debby susanto.\"\n\nLooking at Row 7 for girls doubles: The entry is \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati.\" That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the mixed doubles for 2007.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify the relevant cells.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table provided. There are 10 rows, each representing a year from 2001 to 2010. Each row has columns for boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles, listing the names of the players in each category for that specific year.\n\nThe claim states: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta after the year 2007.\"\n\nI need to check if there's a year after 2007 where:\n1. The girl singles are Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. The mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nLooking at each row starting from 2008 onwards (since it's after 2007):\n\n- **Row 8 (2008):**\n  - Girls singles: Ana Rovita\n  - Mixed doubles: Irfan Fadhilah and Weni Anggraeni\n  No match here.\n\n- **Row 9 (2009):**\n  - Girls singles: Ana Rovita\n  - Mixed doubles: Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu\n  No match.\n\n- **Row 10 (2010):**\n  - Girls singles: Ganis Nur Rahmadani\n  - Mixed doubles: Jones Ralfy Jansen and Nurbeta Kwanrico\n  No match again.\n\nNone of the years after 2007 have Lindaweni Fanetri in girl singles or Wifqi Windarto paired with Debby Susanta in mixed doubles. Wait, but I should double-check if there's any mention of Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta together in any year beyond 2007.\n\nLooking back at the rows:\n\n- **Row 7 (2007):**\n  - Mixed doubles: Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta\nBut this is in 2007, which isn't after 2007. The claim specifies \"after the year 2007,\" so the next possible would be 2008 onwards.\n\nIn row 6 (2006), mixed doubles are Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto, but that's before 2007.\n\nWait, in row 7 (2007), Wifqi is present, but it's still in 2007. The claim says \"after the year 2007,\" so I need to check if there's a later occurrence of both conditions together.\n\nLooking at rows beyond 2007:\n\n- Row 8: No.\n- Row 9: No.\n- Row 10: No.\n\nSo, the only instance where Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta are paired is in 2007, but that's not after 2007. Therefore, there's no year after 2007 where both conditions are met simultaneously.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says \"when the girl single be Lindaweni Fanetri, the mixed double be...\" So maybe I should check if there's any row where girl singles are Lindaweni and mixed doubles include Wifqi and Debby in any year, not necessarily after 2007. But the claim specifies \"after the year 2007.\"\n\nBut since in the table, Lindaweni appears only once\u2014in row 6 (2006) as part of the girls doubles and in row 7 (2007) as a girl singles. Wait no, row 6's girls singles is Sylvinna Kurniawan, so Lindaweni isn't listed there.\n\nWait, actually, I need to check each row:\n\nLooking for \"Lindaweni Fanetri\" specifically in the girls singles column.\n\n- Row 7 (2007): Girls singles: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- Then, mixed doubles in row 7 is Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta\n\nSo, if I look at row 7, which is 2007, both conditions are met. However, the claim specifies \"after the year 2007,\" meaning after 2007, so 2008 onwards.\n\nBut Lindaweni Fanetri only appears in row 7 (2007) as girl singles, and Wifqi Windarto is paired with Debby Susanta in that same row. So for row 7, both conditions are true, but it's not after 2007.\n\nTherefore, there is no year after 2007 where both the girl singles are Lindaweni Fanetri and the mixed doubles are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta. Hence, the claim is FALSE because it refers to a situation that doesn't occur in any of the years after 2007.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that after 2007, when Lindaweni Fanetri is playing girl singles, Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanta are in the mixed doubles. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Lindaweni Fanetri** only appears as a girl singles player in 2007.\n- **Wifqi Windarto** paired with **Debby Susanta** is only recorded in 2007.\n\nSince both events occur in 2007 but the claim specifies \"after\" 2007, there's no year after 2007 where both conditions are met. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is FALSE. No such occurrence exists in the years after 2007.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 7 (2007): Lindaweni Fanetri as girl singles and Wifqi Windarto/Debby Susanta as mixed doubles.\nBut since it's in 2007 itself, no post-2007 year meets both conditions.",

The claim says: \"in 2010 , the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia and the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita\". \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. There are 10 rows, each corresponding to a different year from 2001 to 2010. Each row has information about boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nThe claim is specifically about 2010, so I should focus on Row 10.

Let's break it down.\n\nGirl Doubles part of the claim: ayu pratiwi anggi widia.\nLooking at Row 10, under Girls Doubles, the players are aris budiharti dian fitriani. Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia isn't listed here. So that part doesn't match.\n\nBoy Doubles part of the claim: jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\nIn Row 10's Boys Doubles, it's exactly jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita. That matches perfectly.\n\nSince one part (girl doubles) is incorrect and the other (boy doubles) is correct, the overall claim isn't fully supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let me break down what I'm being asked to do.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"in 2009 , the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. The term \"be the boy single\" probably refers to someone playing in the boys singles category. So the claim is saying that in 2009, the mixed doubles pair was didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah, who also played as a boy singles player.\n\nWait, but in a mixed doubles team, one is male and the other is female, right? So if hermansyah is playing in boys singles, he's a male singles player. The mixed doubles partner must be a female singles player or someone else. Let me check the table for 2009.\n\nLooking at Row 9 (year: 2009), I see the entries:\n- Boys singles: riyanto subagja\n- Girls singles: ana rovita\n- Boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita\n- Girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia\n- Mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nSo, in 2009, the mixed doubles pair is didit juang indrianto and yayu rahayu. Wait, but the claim says \"hermansyah be the boy single.\" Hermonsyah is listed as a boys singles player in Row 8 (year: 2008). So he played singles in 2008 but not in 2009.\n\nWait, let me check again. In Row 9, boys singles is riyanto subagja, and girls singles is ana rovita. Hermonsyah isn't listed as a boys singles for 2009, so maybe the claim is incorrect because it's saying hermansyah was part of the mixed doubles in 2009, but he wasn't even playing singles that year.\n\nWait no, actually, the claim says \"the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\" So it seems they're saying the mixed doubles team includes hermansyah. But in 2009, the boys singles is riyanto subagja, not hermonsyah. Hermonsyah was in 2008. So the claim might be mixing up years or incorrectly pairing players.\n\nSo first, checking for 2009's mixed doubles: it's didit juang indrianto and yayu rahayu, as per Row 9. Now, is hermansyah part of this? No, he's not in 2009's mixed doubles; he's in boys singles for 2008.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because hermansyah isn't in the 2009 mixed doubles team. Also, the term \"be the boy single\" seems off because hermansyah was a boy singles player in 2008 but not in 2009. So the claim mistakenly pairs him with didit and yayu for the 2009 mixed doubles, which is wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the structure of the claim might be mixing up players from different years. So this makes the entire statement false because hermansyah wasn't part of the 2009 mixed doubles team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Now, within that row, I need to check two things:\n\n1. Did Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto form a mixed doubles pair in 2010?\n2. Was Nugroho Andi Saputro the boys singles winner in 2010?\n\nFirst, let's check the mixed doubles for 2010. In Row 10, under \"mixed doubles,\" I see \"jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico.\" That doesn't match Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto at all. So that condition isn't met.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the mixed doubles part. Let me check again. Row 10's mixed doubles are indeed \"jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico.\" So the claim is incorrect here because the mixed doubles pair in 2010 wasn't Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look elsewhere. Maybe the mixed doubles were represented by different players, but I need to confirm that. The claim specifies both mixed doubles and boys singles for 2010, so if either is incorrect, the entire claim fails.\n\nNext, checking the boys singles for 2010. In Row 10, under \"boys singles,\" it's \"shesar hiren rhustavito.\" The claim says it should be Nugroho Andi Saputro. But looking at other rows, I see that in 2006 (Row 6), the boys singles were \"nugroho andi saputro.\" So he won in 2006, but not in 2010.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect for 2010. The mixed doubles weren't the specified pair, and the boys singles winner was someone else. So the overall claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is asserting that in 2010, Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto were the mixed doubles champions while Nugroho Andi Saputro won the boys singles. Checking Row 10 of the table:\n\n- Mixed Doubles: Jones Ralfy Jansen and Nurbeta Kwanrico (not the claimed pair).\n- Boys Singles: Shesar Hiren Rhustavito (not Nugroho Andi Saputro).\n\nBoth conditions are not met, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is true or false. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nThe table has rows from 2001 to 2010, each representing a year and listing players in different categories: boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. The claim says: \"in 2009, when the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati, the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanta.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate the relevant cells in the table for the year 2009. Looking at Row 9 (since it's the 10th row and starts with 2010, so 2009 is the 9th row), I see that:\n\n- Girls doubles: pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari\n- Mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"girl double\" as anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati. But in Row 9 of the table, the girls doubles are pia zebadiah nitya krishinda maheswari, not anneke feinya. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nNext, the claim states that the mixed double is wifqi windarto debby susanta. Looking at Row 7 (2007), I see mixed doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanta. However, in Row 9 (2009), the mixed doubles are different\u2014didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\n\nSo both parts of the claim don't align with the table data for 2009. The girls doubles and mixed doubles players listed in the claim do not match those in the table for that year. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
