    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. We're looking for Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring three goals specifically in international friendly matches.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a different match or competition that M\u00e1rquez participated in. The columns include goal, date, score, result, and competition type. \n\nI need to check if there's any row where M\u00e1rquez scored exactly 3 goals in an international friendly competition. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: competition is 1999 Carlsberg Cup. Not a friendly match.\nRow 2: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup. Not friendly.\nRow 3: 2002 World Cup qualifier. Not friendly.\nRow 4: Friendly match, but the goals scored are not mentioned here. Wait, in row 4, the goal is 4, which is for the whole match? Or per game? Wait, the table seems to have each row as a single event. So if it's a friendly competition, but what about the number of goals?\n\nWait, the claim is about scoring exactly three goals at an international friendly competition in his career. So I need to find a row where both conditions are met: competition type is \"friendly\" and goal is 3.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 4: competition is friendly, but the goal column says 4. So that's four goals.\nRow 9: competition is friendly, goals scored is 2-2 in score, so likely the result was 4-2. The goal here is 9, which seems to be for the entire match. Wait, no, each row probably represents a single game where M\u00e1rquez scored that many goals.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Each row represents a specific match where M\u00e1rquez scored 'goal' number of goals in that match. So for example, row 4 has goal:4, which means in that particular game, he scored 4 goals? But the score is 2-1, so it's likely that his team won 2-1, but how did he score four goals if the final result was 2-1? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the table.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'score' column refers to the match score, not M\u00e1rquez's personal goal tally. Let me read the instructions again: \"You are tasked with determining whether a claim about the following table (given in naturalized format) is TRUE or FALSE.\" And each row has 'goal', which I think is the number of goals he scored in that match.\n\nSo for example, in Row 4: goal:4, date:12 may 2002, score:2-1. So M\u00e1rquez scored four goals in a friendly match where his team won 2-1? That seems inconsistent because if he scored four goals, the score should be higher. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'score' refers to the overall match result, not M\u00e1rquez's goals. But then the 'goal' column is separate. So in Row 4: goal:4 (M\u00e1rquez scored 4 goals), date:12 may 2002, score:2-1 (so M\u00e1rquez's team won by 2-1). So he scored four goals in a friendly match where his team only won by two goals? That seems possible if the other team scored one.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the 'score' is the half-time or something else. Or maybe it's a typo. But regardless, for the purpose of this task, I need to check each row.\n\nSo the claim is that M\u00e1rquez scored 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions. So looking for any row where:\n\n- competition: friendly\n- goal:3\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: comp:1999 Carlsberg Cup - not friendly.\nRow 2: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup - not friendly.\nRow 3: 2002 World Cup qualifier - not friendly.\nRow 4: friendly, but goal is 4.\nRow 5: Concacaf Gold Cup - not friendly.\nRow 6: 2006 World Cup qualifier - not friendly.\nRow 7: same as above.\nRow 8: 2006 FIFA World Cup - not friendly.\nRow 9: friendly, goal is 2-2 in the score. Wait, 'goal' column here is 9. So in this game, he scored 9 goals? That seems too high, but if that's the case, then yes, in a friendly match.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misreading it. The 'score' column is likely the overall score of the match, so for row 4: M\u00e1rquez scored 4 goals in a friendly match where his team won 2-1. That's possible if he scored four and the other team scored one.\n\nBut looking specifically for any row where competition is \"friendly\" and goal is exactly 3.\n\nSo let me check each friendly row:\n\nRow 4: comp:friendly, goal:4\nRow 9: comp:friendly, goal:2 (wait, no, in row 9, the 'goal' column says 9? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, looking at the table again.\n\nWait, the table is presented as:\n\nRow 1: goal:1, date:5 feb 1999, score:1-0, result:3-0, competition:1999 carlsberg cup.\nRow 2: goal:2, date:13 feb 2000, score:1-0, result:4-0, competition:2000 concacaf gold cup.\nRow 3: goal:3, date:3 sep 2000, score:2-1, result:5-2, competition:2000 world cup qualifiers.\nWait no, the original table might have different content.\n\nWait I think in the problem statement it says:\n\n\"You are tasked with determining whether a claim about the following table (given in naturalized format) is TRUE or FALSE.\"\n\nSo each row has columns: goal, date, score, result, competition.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 4: goal:4, date:12 may 2002, score:2-1, result:4-1, competition:friendly.\n\nWait no, the user didn't provide the exact table, but in their initial message they said:\n\n\"You are tasked with determining whether a claim about the following table (given in naturalized format) is TRUE or FALSE.\"\n\nSo likely, each row has 'goal', 'date', 'score', 'result', and 'competition'.\n\nLooking for any row where competition is \"friendly\" and goal is 3.\n\nAssuming that, let's go through the rows.\n\nRow 1: comp: Carlsberg Cup (not friendly)\nRow 2: Concacaf Gold Cup\nRow 3: World Cup Qualifiers\nRow 4: Friendly - but goal is 4.\nRow 5: Concacaf Gold Cup\nRow 6: World Cup Qualifiers\nRow 7: same as above\nRow 8: World Cup\nRow 9: Friendly - what's the goal here? In row 9, the 'goal' is 2-2 in score and result is 4-2. So M\u00e1rquez scored two goals? No, because 'goal' column says 9. Wait that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait no, perhaps I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the problem statement, it's unclear, but from prior examples, each row is a match where he scored 'goal' number of goals in that match.\n\nSo if the competition is friendly and goal is 3, we need to find such a row.\n\nFrom the initial example, I think there was a row with:\n\nRow 9: competition: friendly, goal:2 (but in the score it's 2-2).\n\nWait no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the 'goal' column for Row 9 is 9, which would mean he scored nine goals in that match.\n\nBut regardless of whether it's possible or not, we need to check if any row has both competition = friendly and goal =3.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- I don't see a row where competition is \"friendly\" and goal is exactly 3.\n\nBecause:\n\nRow4: comp=friendly, goal=4\nRow9: comp=friendly, but goal seems high (maybe 2 goals because score is 2-2? Or perhaps the 'goal' column is correct with 9.)\n\nWait, I think I need to parse each row correctly. Let me try.\n\nEach row has:\n\n- Goal: number of goals scored by M\u00e1rquez in that match.\n- Date: the date of the match.\n- Score: likely the scoreline of the match (e.g., 2-1).\n- Result: the full-time result, perhaps (e.g., 4-1)\n- Competition: type of competition.\n\nSo for each friendly row:\n\nRow4: goal=4, competition=friendly. So M\u00e1rquez scored four goals in a friendly match.\nRow9: goal=2, because score is 2-2 and the result is 4-2. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. If the score was 2-2 at halftime, then maybe he scored two goals.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 'goal' column is the number of goals in total, so for Row9: goal=9, which seems too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a formatting issue and the 'score' is actually the half-time score or something else.\n\nIn any case, looking specifically for a row where competition is \"friendly\" and goal is exactly 3.\n\nFrom the problem statement, I think there are three friendly rows: Row4 and Row9.\n\nAssuming that:\n\nRow4: comp=friendly, goal=4\nRow9: comp=friendly, but the 'goal' here might be 2 (since score is 2-2), or perhaps it's 9. It's unclear.\n\nWait no, let me check again.\n\nIn Row9: goal is listed as 9? That seems unlikely because the score is 2-2 and result is 4-2. So M\u00e1rquez scored two goals in that match. Therefore, 'goal' column should be 2, but it says 9. Maybe a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nBut regardless, if the claim is that he scored exactly three goals in an international friendly competition, then we need to see if any of those matches had him scoring three.\n\nSince none of the rows show that, the statement must be false.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again.\n\nIf Row9 has a score of 2-2 at halftime and the final result is 4-2, then M\u00e1rquez scored two goals in that match, so 'goal' should be 2, not 9.\n\nTherefore, there are no rows where he scored exactly three goals in a friendly match.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Andr\u00e9s Iniesta scored exactly three goals in an international friendly match is false. There is no evidence in the provided data of such a match where he netted precisely three goals in a friendly competition.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; there are no matches in the table where Iniesta scored exactly three goals in a friendly context.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then find the relevant cells. The claim is: \"2000 be the only year Rafael M\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. From the table:\n\n- goal: number of goals scored\n- date: when the match occurred\n- score: the score of the match (like 1 - 0)\n- result: probably the final score or points, maybe not sure, but it's a separate column\n- competition: the name of the tournament or competition\n\nThe claim is about M\u00e1rquez scoring more than 1 goal in international competitions in the year 2000. So I need to look for his goals in 2000 and check if that's the only such occurrence.\n\nLooking at each row, let me see which ones are from 2000.\n\nRow 3: date is 3 September 2000. Competition is 2002 World Cup Qualifier.\nRow 4: 12 May 2002. Not 2000.\nWait, actually, the claim says \"in international competition,\" so I should filter for competitions that are international or tournaments.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: 1999 Carlsberg Cup \u2013 likely international.\nRow 3: 2000, but competition is World Cup qualifier (international).\nRow 12: 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 international.\nSo rows related to 2000 that are international competitions would be Row 1 and Row 3.\n\nWait no, the claim is about the year 2000. So I need to check all goals scored by M\u00e1rquez in 2000, in international competitions.\n\nRow 2: 13 Feb 2000 \u2013 competition is Concacaf Gold Cup 2000. So that's 2000.\nRow 3: 3 Sep 2000 \u2013 World Cup qualifier 2002? Wait, but the date is 2000. The competition name is 2002 World Cup qualifier, so perhaps that's an international competition in 2000.\n\nSo for each row where the year is 2000 and competition is international:\n\nRow 1: 5 Feb 1999 \u2013 not 2000.\nRow 2: 13 Feb 2000 \u2013 yes, 2000, Concacaf Gold Cup.\nRow 3: 3 Sep 2000 \u2013 World Cup qualifier in 2002, but date is 2000. So that's also 2000.\n\nWait, the claim says \"2000 be the only year.\" So I need to check if in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in any international competition, and whether that's unique to 2000.\n\nLooking at Row 2: goal is 2. Score is 1-0. So he scored 1 goal.\nRow 3: goal is 3. Score is 5-1, result is 7-1. So he scored 3 goals in that match.\n\nSo in 2000, he scored at least 2 goals in one match and possibly more elsewhere.\n\nNow, I need to check other rows for other years where he scored more than one goal.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 5: 24 July 2003 \u2013 Concacaf Gold Cup. Score is 1-0, result 2-0. Goal is 5. So in 2003, he scored 5 goals, which is more than one.\n\nRow 6: 19 June 2004 \u2013 World Cup qualifier. Score 3-0, result 3-0. Goal is 6. So in 2004, he scored 6 goals.\n\nSo M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in multiple years beyond 2000. Therefore, the claim that 2000 was the only year where he did so would be FALSE because other years like 2003 and 2004 also had him scoring more than one goal.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the only year.\" So if there are other years where he scored more than one goal in international competition, then the claim is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: I need to find all rows where the year is 2000 and the competition is international, as well as any other rows where the year is not 2000 but M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about 2000 being the only year. So to verify this, I need to check if in 2000 he scored more than one goal in an international competition and whether there are no other years where he did so.\n\nWait, no: the claim is asserting that 2000 was the ONLY year he did so. Therefore, we need to find:\n\n- All rows where the year is 2000, competition is international, and goals >1.\n- All rows where the year is not 2000, competition is international, and goals >1.\n\nBecause if there are any such rows in other years, then the claim is false.\n\nSo from the table, let's list all rows with competition being international:\n\nRow 1: Carlsberg Cup 1999 \u2013 yes.\nRow 2: Concacaf Gold Cup 2000 \u2013 yes.\nRow 3: World Cup qualifier 2002 (date 2000) \u2013 yes.\nRow 5: Concacaf Gold Cup 2003 \u2013 yes.\nRow 6: World Cup qualifier 2006 \u2013 yes.\nRow 7: same as above, date 2005 \u2013 yes.\nRow 8: World Cup 2006 \u2013 yes.\nRow 12: Concacaf Gold Cup 2011 \u2013 yes.\n\nNow, for each of these, check if goals >1 and the year is 2000 or not.\n\nIn Row 2 (2000): goal=2. So in 2000, he scored more than one goal.\n\nRow 3 (date 2000): goal=3>1, so also in 2000.\n\nRows 5 (2003),6(2004),7(2005),8(2006) all have goals >1. Therefore, other years beyond 2000 had him scoring more than one goal, making the claim false.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE.\n\nNow, for relevant cells: the rows where:\n\n- Year is 2000 and competition is international (Rows 2,3).\n- Any row not in 2000 where goals>1 (Rows5,6,7,8).\n\nSo all these should be included as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that M\u00e1rcio was the only player to score more than one goal in a single match of an international competition in the year 2000 is false. He also did so in matches in 2003 and 2004, among other years.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{FALSE}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim made is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at both the 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cup.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find relevant information about Rafael M\u00e1rquez's goals in these tournaments.\n\nStarting with the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Scanning the rows, I see that Row 8 mentions \"2006 fifa world cup\" and has a goal number of 8, scored on June 24, 2006. So, he did score a goal there.\n\nNext, checking the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Looking through the table, Row 11 is about the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, in this row, the score is 1 - 1 and the result is a draw. The goal number is 11, but it's not specified if he scored in that particular match or any goals in the tournament. Wait, no, actually, looking at Row 11: goal: 11, date: June 11, 2010, competition: 2010 FIFA World Cup. So, this indicates that he scored a goal during the 2010 World Cup. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes players might not score in every match they play in, but just whether they scored at least one goal in each of those tournaments. So, even if he didn't score in every game, as long as he scored at least once, it counts.\n\nSo, Row 8 is definitely about the 2006 World Cup where he scored. Row 11 also shows he scored a goal in the 2010 World Cup. Therefore, the claim seems to be supported by both rows.\n\nWait, but looking back, the claim says \"both\" the tournaments, so he needs to have scored in each of them. Since he did score in both, it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goal\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"Mexico only lose 1 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scores a goal.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. Mexico losing only once in international competitions under specific conditions related to Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring. So, I need to look for instances where Mexico lost while M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a match: goal, date, score, result, and competition. My task is to check if there's only one such occurrence where Mexico lost (result shows a negative outcome) and M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? The goal column is 1, so yes. Date is Feb 5, 1999. Score is 1-0 in favor of Mexico. Result is 3-0. So they won, not a loss. So irrelevant for the loss condition.\n\n2. **Row 2**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? Yes, goal is 2. Date is Feb 13, 2000. Score is 1-0 (Mex win), result 4-0. Not a loss.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Goal is 3, so yes. Date Sep 3, 2000. Score 5-1 (win). Result 7-1. So no loss here either.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? The goal column is 4. Score is 2-1, which means Mexico lost? Let's see the result: it's 2-1. Wait, so did Mexico lose or win? I think in soccer, higher score wins unless it's a tie. So if the result is 2-1, that would be Mexico winning by that scoreline. So no loss here.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Goal is 5, so M\u00e1rquez scored. Date July 24, 2003. Score 1-0 (Mex win). Result 2-0. No loss, irrelevant.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? Yes, goal 6. Date June 19, 2004. Score 3-0 (win), result 3-0. So no loss here.\n\n7. **Row 7**: Goal is 7, so yes. Date Sep 7, 2005. Score 2-0, result 5-0. Mexico won again.\n\n8. **Row 8**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? Yes, goal 8. Date June 24, 2006. Score 1-0 (Mex win), but the result is 1-2 in aet, which means Mexico lost. So this is a loss where M\u00e1rquez scored. So that's one instance.\n\n9. **Row 9**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? No, goal is 9 but I don't know if it's M\u00e1rquez. Wait, the goal column increments per match, so each row's goal is unique. But since this is just \"goal\", not specifying the scorer, I can't confirm if it's M\u00e1rquez here. So irrelevant for his goals.\n\n10. **Row 10**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? Yes, goal 10. Date Sep 10, 2008. Score 2-0 (win), result 2-1. Wait, result is 2-1 meaning Mexico lost. So another loss where he scored a goal. That's two losses now.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only lose 1 time\" when M\u00e1rquez scores. So if there are two instances, that would make the claim false.\n\n11. **Row 11**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? Yes, goal 11. Date June 11, 2010. Score 1-1 (draw), result 1-1. No loss, so irrelevant.\n\n12. **Row 12**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? Yes, goal 12. Date June 12, 2011. Score 1-0 (win), result 4-1. So no loss here.\n\n13. **Row 13**: Goal by M\u00e1rquez? No, because the goal is 13, but I don't know if it's him. Anyway, score is 1-0 (Mex win), so no loss.\n\nSo in rows 8 and 10, Mexico lost while M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. That's two instances, which contradicts the claim that they only lose once under those conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. The table has columns for: goal (which I assume refers to the number of goals scored), date, score, result, and competition. Since the claim is about M\u00e1rquez not scoring in specific competitions, I'm particularly interested in the \"competition\" column because it indicates which tournament or event his goals were counted towards.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific years: 2001, 2009, and 2012. My task is to check each of these years to see if there's any record of M\u00e1rquez scoring a goal in an international competition during those years. If he scored in any of those competitions, the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different match or event with various details. The \"competition\" column lists the names of the tournaments. I need to check if there are any competitions in 2001, 2009, or 2012 where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\nLet me go through each year one by one.\n\nStarting with 2001: Scanning the table, I see that the earliest date is February 5, 1999, and the last date listed is October 30, 2013. The competition entries include various tournaments like the Carlsberg Cup, Concacaf Gold Cup, World Cup qualifiers, and friendly matches.\n\nLooking through each row's competition column:\n\n- Row 1: 1999 Carlsberg Cup\n- Row 2: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup\n- Row 3: 2002 World Cup qualifier\n- Row 4: May 12, 2002 \u2013 Friendly\n- Row 5: 2003 Concacaf Gold Cup\n- Row 6: 2004 World Cup qualifier\n- Row 7: 2005 World Cup qualifier\n- Row 8: 2006 FIFA World Cup\n- Row 9: March 28, 2007 \u2013 Friendly\n- Row 10: September 10, 2008 \u2013 2010 World Cup qualifier\n- Row 11: June 11, 2010 \u2013 2010 FIFA World Cup\n- Row 12: June 12, 2011 \u2013 Concacaf Gold Cup\n- Row 13: October 30, 2013 \u2013 Friendly\n\nI don't see any competition in 2001. The closest is the 1999 Carlsberg Cup (Row 1) and then the 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup (Row 2). So no entries for international competitions in 2001 where M\u00e1rquez scored goals. Therefore, 2001 doesn't apply.\n\nNext, checking for 2009. Again, looking through all the competition columns, I need to see if any match or event takes place in 2009 and is an international competition where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. However, upon reviewing each row's date, none of them are in 2009. The closest dates around that time would be Row 8 (2006 World Cup) and Row 10 (2008 qualifier). So no data points for 2009 either.\n\nMoving on to 2012: I need to check if there was any international competition in 2012 where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. Looking at the dates, the last row is October 30, 2013. The competition entries after that include:\n\n- Row 12: June 12, 2011 \u2013 Concacaf Gold Cup\n- Row 13: October 30, 2013 \u2013 Friendly\n\nSo between 2011 and 2013, there's no mention of a competition in 2012. Therefore, M\u00e1rquez didn't score any goals in international competitions during that year.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if perhaps the competition names include events around those years. For example, Row 12 is the 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup, and Row 13 is a friendly match in 2013. There's no specific mention of an international competition in 2009 or 2012 where M\u00e1rquez scored.\n\nTherefore, based on this table, there are no instances where M\u00e1rquez scored goals in international competitions during 2001, 2009, or 2012. This means the claim is true because he didn't score in those years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring fewer than 3 goals in his international friendly competitions is true or false based on the table provided. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that M\u00e1rquez scored fewer than three goals in all of his international friendly matches throughout his career. So, I need to check each match he played in the friendly category and count how many goals he scored there.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that there are 13 rows, each corresponding to a different match or game. Each row has several details: goal number (which likely increments with each appearance), date, score, result, and competition type.\n\nMy first task is to identify which of these matches were in international friendly competitions because only those should be counted towards the claim. So I'll scan through each row's competition column.\n\nRow 1: 1999 Carlsberg Cup \u2013 not a friendly.\nRow 2: 2000 Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 3: 2002 World Cup qualifier \u2013 nope.\nRow 4: Friendly \u2013 yes, this is relevant.\nRow 5: 2003 Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 6: 2006 World Cup qualifier \u2013 no.\nRow 7: 2006 World Cup qualifier \u2013 same as above.\nRow 8: 2006 FIFA World Cup \u2013 definitely not friendly.\nRow 9: Friendly \u2013 yes, another relevant one.\nRow 10: 2010 World Cup qualifier \u2013 nope.\nRow 11: 2010 FIFA World Cup \u2013 nope.\nRow 12: 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup \u2013 not friendly.\nRow 13: Friendly \u2013 this is the third relevant row.\n\nSo, rows 4, 9, and 13 are the ones where M\u00e1rquez played in international friendly competitions. Now I need to look at how many goals he scored in each of these matches.\n\nRow 4: Score is 2 - 1. Since it's a friendly match, I think in football (soccer), the first number is goals for, so M\u00e1rquez scored 2 goals here.\nRow 9: The score is 2 - 2. Again, since it's a friendly and likely a draw, both teams scored twice. So M\u00e1rquez scored 2 goals.\nRow 13: The score is 1 - 0, meaning he scored 1 goal.\n\nAdding these up: 2 (row4) + 2 (row9) + 1 (row13) = 5 goals in total across all his international friendly matches.\n\nThe claim says he scored fewer than 3 goals. But according to the table, he scored a total of 5 goals in friendly competitions. This means the claim is false because he actually scored more than three goals.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any rows. Let me double-check the competition types:\n\n- Rows 4,9,13: Friendly\n- All others are either World Cup qualifiers or Concacaf Gold Cups, which aren't considered friendly in this context.\n\nSo yes, only those three rows count. That makes his total goals in friendly competitions 5, which is more than 3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored fewer than 3 goals in his career at international friendly competitions is false because he actually scored a total of 5 goals across three friendly matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 [competition], but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows and columns in the table are relevant to this claim.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a specific match. The claim mentions two competitions: the 2006 competition and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. So, I should look for rows where the competition is either the 2006 FIFA World Cup or the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nStarting with the 2006 competition, from the table, it's mentioned in Row 8: competition: 2006 fifa world cup. That row also includes a goal by M\u00e1rquez, so that's relevant because it shows he scored there.\n\nNext, checking for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In Row 11, the competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup. Looking at that row, M\u00e1rquez scored 1-1 but the result was a draw, meaning he didn't score any goals in that match because both teams had one goal each. So, if he scored in 2006 but not in 2010, the claim holds.\n\nWait, actually, the table shows for Row 11 (goal:11, date:11 june 2010), the score was 1-1 and result was a draw. That means M\u00e1rquez didn't score any goals there because the score is 1-1, which suggests each team scored once, so M\u00e1rquez didn't add to his team's total in that game.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are Row 8 (where he scored) and Row 11 (where he didn't score despite being part of the competition). So both these rows support the claim.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim is true, we need to check for Rafael M\u00e1rquez's performance in the 2006 FIFA World Cup and his participation in the 2010 FIFA World Cup without scoring any goals.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows for 2006 FIFA World Cup:**\n   - Row 8 corresponds to the 2006 FIFA World Cup where M\u00e1rquez scored a goal (goal:8, score:1-0).\n\n2. **Identify Rows for 2010 FIFA World Cup:**\n   - Row 11 is the match during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where the score was 1-1, indicating M\u00e1rquez didn't score.\n\n**Conclusion:** The data supports that M\u00e1rquez scored in 2006 and remained scoreless in 2010, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. The claim says: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It's talking about Rafael M\u00e1rquez scoring more than one goal in international competitions in the year 2000 and another year (specifically 2002). Wait, actually, it says \"1 of 2 year,\" which might mean that there are two instances where he scored more than one goal: once in 2000 and once in another year.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: goal, date, score, result, competition. I'm interested in the 'year' implied by the date and the 'score' to see if it's over 1 goal.\n\nStarting with 2000. The claim mentions 2000, so let me look for rows where the date is in 2000. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 2: date February 13, 2000 \u2013 that's 2000. Score is 1-0, which is one goal. So he scored exactly 1 goal here. But the claim says \"more than 1,\" so this doesn't count.\n\nNext, I need to find another year where M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in an international competition. The other possible candidate is 2002. Let's check for rows with date in 2002:\n\nRow 4: May 12, 2002. Score is 2-1, which means he scored two goals here. So that's more than one.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm if these competitions are international. For row 2 (2000), the competition is Concacaf Gold Cup, which is an international competition. For row 4 (2002), it's a friendly match, but wait, friendly matches can still be considered international if it's against another country's national team.\n\nWait, in 2002, the competition is \"friendly,\" so maybe that's not considered an international competition? I'm a bit confused here. International competitions usually refer to official matches, like World Cup qualifiers or tournaments like Concacaf Gold Cup.\n\nSo row 4 (2002) is a friendly match. Friendly matches can be between national teams, but they aren't considered official, so maybe the claim doesn't count that as international competition.\n\nTherefore, in 2000, M\u00e1rquez scored only one goal, and in 2002, he scored two goals in a friendly match which might not be counted as international. So does the claim hold?\n\nWait, the claim says \"in international competition.\" If friendly isn't considered international, then only row 2 (1 goal) is relevant, but it's not over one. So maybe there's no instance where he scored more than one goal in an international competition in 2000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers friendly as international? I'm not sure. But typically, international competitions are official matches, so friendly might be excluded.\n\nSo in 2000, he scored only one goal in an international competition. In 2002, if friendly isn't considered, then no. Therefore, the claim that in 2000 he scored more than one goal in an international competition is FALSE because row 2 has one goal and row 4's competition might not count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the years. Maybe the two years are 2000 and another year where he did have more than one goal. Let me check all rows for scores over 1:\n\nRow 3: September 3, 2000 \u2013 score is 5-1, which is 5 goals, but this is in a World Cup qualifier, so international.\n\nRow 4: May 12, 2002 \u2013 score is 2-1, as before.\n\nSo, if considering friendly as international, then M\u00e1rquez scored two goals in 2002. So in 2000, he had row 3 with 5 goals and row 2 with one goal. Wait, no: row 3's date is September 3, 2000? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: Feb 5, 1999 \u2013 score 1-0\n\nRow 2: Feb 13, 2000 \u2013 score 1-0 (so that's row 2)\n\nRow 3: Sep 3, 2000 \u2013 score 5-1\n\nSo in 2000, there are two matches: one on Feb 13 where he scored 1 goal, and another on Sep 3 where he scored 5 goals. So if we consider both as international competitions, then in 2000, he scored more than one goal (5) in a World Cup qualifier.\n\nSo the claim says \"2000 be 1 of 2 year...\" meaning that in 2000, he scored more than once, and in another year (likely 2002), also over once. So looking at 2000: yes, he scored multiple goals in both row 2 and row 3.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"more than 1 goal,\" so scoring two or more. So in 2000, M\u00e1rquez had at least one match (row 3) where he scored more than once. But does row 2 count? No, because he scored only one. However, since the competition is international, and he scored five goals in another match that year, then yes, he did have instances in 2000 where he scored more than one goal.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"2000 be 1 of 2 year rafael m\u00e1rquez score more than 1 goal in international competition.\" So it's saying that in 2000 and another year, he scored more than once. From the table, looking at all rows:\n\nIn 1999: row 1 \u2013 1-0 (not over one)\n\n2000: row 2 \u2013 1 goal; row 3 \u2013 5 goals (so yes, in 2000 he had a match where he scored more than one)\n\n2002: row 4 \u2013 2 goals.\n\nSo the two years would be 2000 and 2002. Both have matches where he scored more than once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because in 2000 and another year (like 2002), he had multiple goals in international competitions.\n\nWait, but the wording of the claim is a bit confusing: \"2000 be 1 of 2 year...\" Maybe it's saying that 2000 is one of the two years where he scored more than once. So considering that, yes, because row 3 (2000) has five goals.\n\nSo in conclusion, the claim holds true because M\u00e1rquez did score more than once in both 2000 and another year as per the data.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is based on the evidence provided by the matches listed:\n\n1. **In the year 2000**: \n   - On February 13, M\u00e1rquez scored 1 goal against an unspecified opponent.\n   - On September 3, he scored 5 goals in a World Cup qualifying match.\n\n2. **In the year 2002**:\n   - On May 12, he scored 2 goals during a friendly match.\n\nGiven that international competitions include World Cup qualifiers and other national team matches, both instances in 2000 (row 3) and 2002 (row 4) involve scores above 1 goal. Therefore, the claim is supported by these specific matches.\n\n**Answer**: The claim holds true as Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored more than one goal in international competitions in both 2000 and another year according to the provided data.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about Mexico losing 1-2 in an international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal is true or false by checking the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim: Mexico lost 1-2 in an international competition where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with specific details like goals, date, score, result, and competition. The relevant columns for the claim would be 'result' because it shows the final score, which is necessary to confirm a loss. Also, 'competition' might indicate if it's an international event, but since all competitions in the table are international (like World Cup qualifiers or Concacaf Gold Cup), I might not need that column unless the specific competition type matters for whether it's considered \"international.\"\n\nI need to check each row where Mexico lost. Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Score is 1-0, result 3-0. Not a loss.\n- Row 2: 1-0, result 4-0. Not a loss.\n- Row 3: 5-1, result 7-1. Not a loss.\n- Row 4: 2-1, result 2-1. Loss? No, it's a tie.\n- Row 5: 1-0, result 2-0. Win.\n- Row 6: 3-0, result 3-0. Win.\n- Row 7: 2-0, result 5-0. Win.\n- Row 8: Score is 1-0, result is 1-2 (aet). That's a loss. So the result is 1-2 against Mexico. Now check if M\u00e1rquez scored a goal here. There's no 'goal scorers' column, so I can't confirm from the table that he scored in this match.\n- Row 9: Tie, not a loss.\n- Row 10: Score 2-0, result 2-1. Loss? No, because it's 2-1, but the score is higher than the result? Wait, no, the result is the final score. So if the result is 2-1, that means Mexico scored 2, opponent 1, so they won. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in football, usually the result is who won and by how much. If the result is 2-1, then Mexico won 2-1. So not a loss.\n- Row 11: 1-1, result 1-1. Draw, not a loss.\n- Row 12: 1-0, result 4-1. Win.\n- Row 13: Friendly match, no need for international competition.\n\nSo the only row where Mexico lost is none because all other rows either have a win or a tie or friendly. Wait, in row 8, it's a loss but M\u00e1rquez scored? I can't confirm from the table that he scored there since there's no goalscorer info.\n\nWait, maybe I missed another row. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for any row where Mexico lost:\n\nRow 1: Win\nRow 2: Win\nRow 3: Win\nRow 4: Tie\nRow 5: Win\nRow 6: Win\nRow 7: Win\nRow 8: Loss (Mexico scored 1, opponent scored 2)\nRow 9: Tie\nRow10: Win (as result is 2-1)\nWait no, the score is 2-0, but the result is 2-1. So the actual goalscorers might have been 2 for Mexico and 1 for the opponent, resulting in a 2-1 win.\n\nSo actually, none of the rows show Mexico losing except possibly row 8, where the result is 1-2. So that's a loss. Now, did M\u00e1rquez score in that match? Since there's no 'goalscorer' column, I can't confirm from the table if he scored or not.\n\nBut the claim says \"when Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal.\" So, unless it's implied by the data, but since the table doesn't include who scored, I can't verify. Therefore, the claim might be false because there's no confirmation that M\u00e1rquez scored in any of Mexico's losses, or at least not in row 8.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I missed a loss in the table. Let me check each result:\n\n- Row1: 3-0 (win)\n- Row2:4-0 (win)\n- Row3:7-1 (win)\n- Row4:2-1 (tie)\n- Row5:2-0 (win)\n- Row6:3-0 (win)\n- Row7:5-0 (win)\n- Row8:1-2 (loss)\n- Row9:4-2 (win)\n- Row10:2-1 (win)\n- Row11:1-1 (tie)\n- Row12:4-1 (win)\n- Row13:4-2 (win)\n\nSo the only loss is row8. But since I can't confirm M\u00e1rquez scored in that match, maybe the claim is false because it's not fully supported by the table.\n\nAlternatively, if the competition was international and the result was a loss with M\u00e1rquez scoring, but without knowing he scored, it's unclear. So the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mexico lost 1-2 in an international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal. From the table, the only match where Mexico lost is row 8 (2006 World Cup), with a result of 1-2. However, there's no data indicating if M\u00e1rquez scored in that match since the 'goal' column doesn't specify scorers. Without confirmation from the table, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The claim is not fully supported by the provided data.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Rafael M\u00e1rquez does not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Rafa didn't stay scoreless (i.e., he scored at least one goal) in three specific years: 2001, 2009, and 2012. So, I need to check if there are any matches where he scored a goal during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about a match: goal number, date, score, result, competition. The 'goal' column likely indicates how many goals M\u00e1rquez scored in that match. If the 'score' shows Rafa scored a goal (e.g., 1-0 or similar), then he didn't remain scoreless.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to see if any fall within 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nRow 1: February 1999 \u2013 too early.\nRow 2: February 2000 \u2013 still before 2001.\nRow 3: September 2000 \u2013 2000, not relevant.\nRow 4: May 2002 \u2013 2002. So competition in 2002, but the claim is about 2001. Not relevant.\nRow 5: July 2003 \u2013 2003, beyond 2001 and 2009.\nRow 6: June 2004 \u2013 2004.\nRow 7: September 2005 \u2013 2005.\nRow 8: June 2006 \u2013 2006.\nRow 9: March 2007 \u2013 2007.\nRow 10: September 2008 \u2013 2008.\nRow 11: June 2010 \u2013 2010, which is after 2009 but within the claim's scope for 2012? Wait, no, 2010 is before 2012. So maybe not relevant unless checking up to 2012.\nWait, actually, the claim includes 2012 as well. So I need to check for any matches in 2012.\n\nLooking further:\n\nRow 12: June 2011 \u2013 2011, still before 2012.\nRow 13: October 2013 \u2013 after 2012, so not relevant for 2012 unless maybe considering up to 2012. But the date is 2013, which is beyond.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rows. Let me recount:\n\nWait, the table has 13 rows from Row1 to Row13. So I need to check all of them.\n\nLet me recheck each row's date and see if any fall into 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nRow 4: May 12, 2002 \u2013 2002.\nRow 5: July 24, 2003 \u2013 2003.\nRow 6: June 19, 2004 \u2013 2004.\nRow 7: September 7, 2005 \u2013 2005.\nRow 8: June 24, 2006 \u2013 2006.\nRow 9: March 28, 2007 \u2013 2007.\nRow 10: September 10, 2008 \u2013 2008.\nRow 11: June 11, 2010 \u2013 2010.\nRow 12: June 12, 2011 \u2013 2011.\nRow 13: October 30, 2013 \u2013 2013.\n\nWait, none of the rows have dates in 2001, 2009, or 2012. So perhaps there are no matches where M\u00e1rquez scored goals in those specific years. Therefore, he might remain scoreless in international competitions during those years.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if any row has a 'goal' greater than zero in 2001, 2009, or 2012. Since none of the rows correspond to those dates, it's possible that there are no goals scored by M\u00e1rquez in those years, making the claim TRUE because he did not remain scoreless.\n\nWait, but wait again. The claim says he \"does not remain scoreless\" in those years, meaning he scored at least one goal. If he didn't play or didn't score in any of those years, then he would remain scoreless, making the claim FALSE.\n\nBut since there's no data for 2001, 2009, or 2012 in the table, it's unclear whether he played or scored. Therefore, we can't confirm that he scored goals in those years. Thus, we don't have evidence to support the claim, so it would be FALSE because we can't confirm he didn't remain scoreless.\n\nWait no, the claim is asserting that he does not remain scoreless in 2001, 2009, or 2012. So if he scored at least once in any of those years, the statement is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nBut since there's no data for those specific years, we don't know if he scored or not. Therefore, the claim might be considered as possibly TRUE or FALSE based on missing information. However, the task is to check against the table provided. Since none of the rows fall in 2001, 2009, or 2012, and the table doesn't show any goals by M\u00e1rquez in those years, we can assume he remained scoreless. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that Rafa scored at least once in 2001, 2009, or 2012. However, none of the table's rows fall into these years. Without evidence of goals in those years, it's inferred he remained scoreless, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
