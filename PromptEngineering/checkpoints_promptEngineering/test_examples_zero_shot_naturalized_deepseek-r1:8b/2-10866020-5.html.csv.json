    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two main parts: the home team, which is Adelaide United, and the specifics of the match\u2014specifically, the stadium and the crowd number mentioned.\n\nLooking through each row to find where Adelaide United plays at Adelaide Oval. Since the table has 21 rows, I'll go one by one.\n\nRow 1: Home team is Queensland Roar, so not Adelaide United.\nRow 2: Sydney FC is home, nope.\nRow 3: Adelaide United is away against Melbourne Victory. Stadium is Hindmarsh, not Adelaide Oval.\nRow 4: Newcastle Jets are home, away team is Adelaide United at EnergyAustralia Stadium.\nRow 5: Wellington Phoenix host, away is Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium.\nRow 6: Home is Adelaide United vs Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh.\nRow 7: Perth Glory hosts at Members Equity Stadium. Away team is Adelaide United.\nRow 8: Home is Adelaide United against Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh.\nRow 9: Sydney FC hosts at Sydney Football Stadium, away team is Adelaide United.\nRow 10: Home is Adelaide United vs Wellington Phoenix at Hindmarsh.\nRow 11: Adelaide United hosts against Queensland Roar at Hindmarsh.\nRow 12: Central Coast Mariners host at Bluetongue Stadium. Away is Adelaide United.\nRow 13: Adelaide United hosts Newcastle Jets at Hindmarsh.\nRow 14: They are away to Perth Glory at Hindmarsh.\nRow 15: Home is Wellington Phoenix, away is Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium.\nRow 16: Melbourne Victory hosts at Telstra Dome. Away team is Adelaide United.\nRow 17: Hosts are Adelaide United against Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh.\nRow 18: This one catches my eye.

That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo, row 18 has the match where Adelaide United plays at Adelaide Oval in front of 25039 fans. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"adelaide united play in front of 10256 crowd in hindmarsh stadium on november 18.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts to see what each part needs to be verified.\n\n1. **Home team**: Adelaide United\n2. **Crowd size**: 10,256\n3. **Stadium**: Hindmarsh Stadium\n4. **Date**: November 18\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if there's a match where all these conditions are met. So, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from row 1 to row 21:\n\n- **Row 13** catches my eye because the home team is Adelaide United, and the date is November 18. The score is 1 - 1 between Adelaide United and Newcastle Jets. Let me check the crowd number for this match. \n\nIn row 13: \n- Home team: Adelaide United\n- Score: 1 - 1 against Newcastle Jets\n- Crowd: 10,256\n- Stadium: Hindmarsh Stadium\n\nThat matches all the criteria in the claim. So, it seems true.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might have a match on November 18 with those details. But looking through the dates, only row 13 has November 18 as the date. No other row for that day, so this is the only relevant one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"sydney fc play at adelaide oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, Sydney FC is a team, and they play football (soccer) in Australia. Adelaide Oval is a stadium located in Adelaide. The claim is saying that Sydney FC plays their matches at Adelaide Oval.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it's got 21 rows, each representing a match between two teams on specific dates. Each row has details like home team, away team, score, crowd size, stadium name, and date.\n\nI need to check if there are any matches where Sydney FC (away or home) is playing against another team at Adelaide Oval.\n\nLet me go through the table step by step:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Queensland Roar. Away team is Adelaide United. Stadium is Suncorp Stadium. Not relevant.\nRow 2: Home team is Sydney FC vs Adelaide United, but the stadium is Sydney Football Stadium.\nRow 3: Adelaide United vs Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 4: Newcastle Jets vs Adelaide United at EnergyAustralia Stadium.\nRow 5: Wellington Phoenix vs Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium.\nRow 6: Adelaide United vs Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 7: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United at Members Equity Stadium.\nRow 8: Adelaide United vs Melbourne Victory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 9: Sydney FC vs Adelaide United again, but at Sydney Football Stadium.\nRow 10: Adelaide United vs Wellington Phoenix at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 11: Adelaide United vs Queensland Roar at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 12: Central Coast Mariners vs Adelaide United at Bluetongue Stadium.\nRow 13: Adelaide United vs Newcastle Jets at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 14: Adelaide United vs Perth Glory at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 15: Wellington Phoenix vs Adelaide United at Westpac Stadium.\nRow 16: Melbourne Victory vs Adelaide United at Telstra Dome.\nRow 17: Adelaide United vs Central Coast Mariners at Hindmarsh Stadium.\nRow 18: Adelaide United vs Sydney FC, but the stadium is Adelaide Oval. Wait, this row has home team as Adelaide United and away team as Sydney FC, and the stadium is Adelaide Oval. So that's one match where Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval.\nRow 19: Newcastle Jets vs Adelaide United at EnergyAustralia Stadium.\nRow 20: Perth Glory vs Adelaide United at Members Equity Stadium.\nRow 21: Adelaide United vs Queensland Roar at Hindmarsh Stadium.\n\nSo, in row 18, Sydney FC is the away team playing against Adelaide United at Adelaide Oval. That's exactly what the claim says. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm checking all the relevant cells. Each match involves two teams and a stadium. The key columns here are 'home team', 'away team', and 'stadium name'. Since Sydney FC is listed as an away team in row 18 at Adelaide Oval, that's the cell that verifies the claim.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be row_index 18 for both home_team (Adelaide United) and away_team (Sydney FC), and also the stadium_name column. But wait, since the claim is about Sydney FC playing at Adelaide Oval, the key info is in the 'stadium name' column for that particular match.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 18's 'home team', 'away team', and 'stadium name'. But perhaps more accurately, only the 'stadium name' is necessary because it directly shows where they played. However, I think the user expects all columns that might be relevant to verify the claim. Since the claim involves both the teams and the stadium, all three columns for that row are relevant.\n\nWait, but the instruction says: \"If fully supported, answer 'TRUE'; otherwise, answer 'FALSE'.\" So I need to check if there's any match where Sydney FC is at Adelaide Oval.\n\nLooking back, in row 18, yes, Sydney FC (away) vs Adelaide United (home) at Adelaide Oval. So that's the only occurrence in the table where Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"sydney fc play at adelaide oval,\" we check if any matches involve Sydney FC at Adelaide Oval.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches:** Look for rows where 'Sydney FC' is either home or away and the stadium is Adelaide Oval.\n2. **Locate Sydney FC Matches:** Scan each row's 'home team', 'away team', and 'stadium name'.\n3. **Find the Specific Match:** In row 18, Sydney FC (away) plays against Adelaide United at Adelaide Oval.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere is a match where Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval, specifically in row 18.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"home_team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"stadium_name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
