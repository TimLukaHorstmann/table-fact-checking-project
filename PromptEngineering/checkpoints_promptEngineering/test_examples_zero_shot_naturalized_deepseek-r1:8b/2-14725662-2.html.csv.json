    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the game against Iowa take place at Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see if there's a game involving Iowa played at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Date 09/26/1931, Opponent is North Dakota State. Site is Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN. Result is W13-7, Attendance 15000. No mention of Iowa here.\n\nRow 2: Also on 09/26/1931, the opponent is Ripon, same site and venue as Row 1. Not Iowa.\n\nRow 3: Date 10/03/1931, Opponent is Oklahoma A&M. Site is Memorial Stadium again, but opponent isn't Iowa.\n\nRow 4: October 10th against Stanford at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, CA. Not relevant.\n\nRow 5: October 24th vs Iowa. Opponent is Iowa. The site listed here is Memorial Stadium, Minneapolis, MN. That matches the claim's location.\n\nSo, Row 5 has the game against Iowa taking place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, which supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other rows might also have a game against Iowa at that venue. Let me scan the rest:\n\nRow 6: Opponent is Wisconsin, same venue but not Iowa.\n\nRows 7-10 don't mention Iowa either; opponents are Northwestern, Cornell (IA), Michigan, and Ohio State respectively.\n\nSo only Row 5 fits the claim. Therefore, the relevant cells are in Row 5, specifically the 'opponent' and 'site' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe game against Iowa does occur at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, as supported by Row 5 of the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the game against michigan take place at memorial stadium , minneapolis , mn\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see where Michigan (michigan) is listed as an opponent and whether their game was played at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Opponent is North Dakota State. Not Michigan.\nRow 2: Opponent is Ripon. No.\nRow 3: Opponent is Oklahoma A&M. Nope.\nRow 4: Opponent is Stanford. No, and the site is Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, CA. So that's different from Memorial Stadium.\nRow 5: Opponent is Iowa. Not Michigan.\nRow 6: Opponent is Wisconsin. No.\nRow 7: Opponent is Northwestern. Site is Dyche Stadium in Evanston, IL.\nRow 8: Opponent is Cornell (IA). Site is Memorial Stadium, but opponent isn't Michigan.\nRow 9: Opponent is Michigan. This is the game we're interested in. The site here is Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, MI. So that's a different location from Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis.\n\nSo the only row where Michigan is the opponent is Row 9, but the site is not Memorial Stadium. Therefore, there's no game against Michigan at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis listed in the table. The claim might be referring to a game that isn't actually in the data provided. \n\nWait, I should check all rows again to ensure I didn't miss any mention of Michigan at Memorial Stadium. Scanning through, Row 9 is the only one with Michigan as the opponent, but it's at Michigan Stadium. No other row lists Michigan as the opponent and has Memorial Stadium as the site.\n\nSo since there's no game against Michigan at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"site\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
