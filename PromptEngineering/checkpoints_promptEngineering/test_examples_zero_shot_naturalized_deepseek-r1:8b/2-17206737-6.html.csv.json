The claim is: \"the montreal canadiens be the home team at least 5 times.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see when the Montreal Canadiens are listed as the home team. \n\nLooking at Row 1: Home team is Montreal Canadiens.\nRow 2: Same home team.\nRow 3: Again, same.\nRow 4: Still home.\nRow 5: Yes.\nRow 6: Yes.\nRow 7: Now, the home team is Carolina Hurricanes. So this row doesn't count for the claim.\nRow 8: Home team is Montreal Canadiens.\nRow 9: Home team is still them.\nRow 10: They are visitors here, so not relevant.\nRow 11: Visitors again.\nRow 12: Visitors.\nRow 13: They are visitors here as well.\n\nSo, counting how many times they are the home team: Rows 1-6 (that's 6), Row 8 (7), and Row 9 (8).

That's definitely more than 5.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in some rows, like Row 10, they're visitors, so that shouldn't count against them being home. So yes, they were the home team on at least 5 occasions.

Looking at row 11 (since row indices start from 0). The visitor is listed as \"montreal canadiens,\" so they are the visitor on that day. That's correct according to the claim, so this cell is relevant.\n\nNext, December 29. Row 12 has a date of December 29th. The visitor is again \"montreal canadiens.\" So that matches the claim; another relevant cell.\n\nThen, December 30. Looking at row 13, the date is December 30th. The visitor is \"montreal canadiens\" as well. So this also fits the claim.\n\nI don't see any rows where on those dates the Montreal Canadiens were not the visitors.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"21273 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the data provided.\n\nThe claim states that there were 21,273 people in attendance at a game where the Montreal Canadiens played and it was the 9th game. Wait, actually, I think I need to parse the claim correctly. It's written as \"21273 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game.\" So, I'm trying to figure out if for the 9th game, the attendance was 21,273.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, record, and points. My task is to check whether any of these rows correspond to the 9th game with an attendance of 21,273.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which row corresponds to the 9th game. The row index starts at 0, so the 1st game is row 0, the 2nd is row 1, and so on until the 13th game in row 12. Therefore, the 9th game would be row 8.\n\nNow, I'll look at row 8 to see if the attendance matches 21,273. The data for row 8 (date: december 18) shows that the home team was the Montreal Canadiens, the visitor was the Philadelphia Flyers, and the score was 2-5. The decision is halak, the attendance is indeed 21273, which matches the claim.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check if there are multiple games with attendance 21,273 or just one. Scanning through all rows:\n\nRow 0: 21273\nRow1: 21273\nRow2: 21273\nRow3: 21273\nRow4: 21273\nRow5: 21273\nRow6: 21273\nRow7: 16434 (different)\nRow8: 21273\nRow9: 21273\nRow10:21273\nRow11:17132 (different)\nRow12:20741 (different)\nRow13:20454 (different)\n\nSo, rows 0-10 have attendance 21273 except for row7 and beyond. But the claim is specifically about \"9 of the game,\" which likely refers to the 9th game, not the first nine games.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be interpreted in two ways: either it's referring to the 9th game (row8) or the first nine games (rows0-10). But since attendance is consistent across multiple rows, I need to clarify.\n\nLooking again at the claim: \"21273 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game.\" The phrasing suggests that on a particular game number (the 9th), the attendance was 21,273. So, it's about the 9th game, which is row8, and indeed, its attendance is 21273.\n\nTherefore, the claim is referring to the 9th game having 21,273 attendees, which aligns with row8's data.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is the one from the 9th game (row index 8), specifically the \"attendance\" column, as it shows 21,273 attendees.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"less than 21273 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It seems to say that there were only 4 games where the attendance was less than 21,273. My task is to check each row's attendance column and count how many times it's below 21,273.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an 'attendance' value. I'll go through each one by one.\n\nRow 1: 21273 - this is equal, not less than, so doesn't count.\nRow 2: same as Row 1.\nRow 3: same.\nRow 4: same.\nRow 5: same.\nRow 6: same.\nRow 7: Attendance is 16,434 which is less than 21,273. So this is one game.\nRow 8: 21273 again, so no.\nRow 9: same as others.\nRow 10: same.\nRow 11: 17,132 - less than 21k. That's two games now.\nRow 12: 20,741 - still less than 21k. Three games.\nRow 13: 20,454 - yes, that's four games.\n\nSo in total, there are 4 instances where attendance is below 21,273.

The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyers be the home team at least 5 times.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see which ones involve the Philadelphia Flyers as the home team. Each row has a 'visitor' and 'home' field. \n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Row 4: visitor is Calgary Flames, home is Montreal Canadiens.\n2.

    "claim": "over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE and identify which cells are relevant for verification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game.\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear. It might mean that there are at least three games where the team scored over 40 points. Alternatively, it could be interpreted as games where both teams scored over 40 points in total, but given the context of hockey scores, which typically don't reach such high numbers, I think the former interpretation is more plausible.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, record, and points. The key columns here are \"score\" and \"points.\" For each game, we need to check if the total points scored by both teams (visitor and home) is over 40.\n\nWait, actually, in hockey, the \"score\" usually represents the goals for each team, like Visitor: x - y, where x is their goals. The \"points\" column might be the total points earned, which could be related to wins, losses, etc., but I think it's more likely that \"points\" here refer to goals scored. However, given that some scores have overtime (OT) or shootouts (SO), those might affect the total goals.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the score is a column with values like 4-5 or 2-6, and another column called \"points,\" which seems to be cumulative points, not necessarily the goals. For example, in row 1, the score is 4-5, and the points are 32. So perhaps \"points\" refers to total team points for that season, but that doesn't make sense because each game's points would add up.\n\nWait, no, looking at the table again: each row has a date, visitor, score (visitor - home), home, decision, attendance, record, and points. The \"record\" is something like 14-6-4, which likely refers to wins-losses-ties. Then there's a \"points\" column, which for row 1 is 32.\n\nHmm, perhaps the \"points\" here are cumulative points per game, but that doesn't make sense because each game would have separate points. Alternatively, maybe it's the total goals scored by the home team. Wait, looking at row 13: date december 30, score 2-1 so (shootout), and points 48. So if in that game, the home team scored 2 goals in regulation, then perhaps the \"points\" are the home team's goals. Because in a shootout, it's extra goals beyond regulation.\n\nWait, but looking at row 3: score is 2-1 ot, so the visitor scored 2 in overtime, making total goals for that game 3 (visitor) and 1 (home). The points column is 35. If \"points\" refers to home team's goals, then 1 point isn't enough, but maybe it's cumulative.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the claim: \"over 40 point be score for at least 3 of the game.\" Maybe it means that in at least three games, the home team scored over 40 points. But looking at the table, the maximum points per game is around 48 (row 13). So if the claim is about home teams scoring over 40 points in a single game, then we need to check each game's score for the home team.\n\nWait, but the \"score\" column is visitor - home. So to get the home team's goals, I'd have to parse that. For example, row 1: visitor scored 4, home scored 5, so home has 5 points in that game. Similarly, row 2: visitor scored 2, home scored 6, so 6 points.\n\nWait, but let me look at the \"points\" column instead. Maybe it's a different metric. For instance, row 1 has points as 32, which might be total points for the season or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the \"points\" are the number of goals scored by the home team in that game.\n\nWait, let me see: row 13 has score 2-1 so, home is Tampa Bay Lightning? Wait no, visitor is Montreal Canadiens, and home is Tampa Bay Lightning. So in that game, visitor (Montreal) scores 2, home (Tampa Bay) scores 1. The points for that row are 48.\n\nWait, perhaps \"points\" refers to the total points earned by the home team in the game, but that doesn't make sense because goals don't directly translate to points. Or maybe it's a mistake and \"points\" is supposed to be something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"points\" column represents the total goals scored by the home team in all games up to that point, which would be cumulative. But looking at row 1: points are 32, then row 2: 32 as well? No, row 2 has points as 32 as well? Wait no, row 1: points=32; row 2: points=36 (because record is 14-6-4, so total wins are 14, losses 6, ties 4). Hmm, that doesn't align with the \"points\" column.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim is likely about the home team scoring over 40 points in a game. So each row's score represents the goals for visitor and home. So for example, if the home scored more than 40 goals in at least three games, then the claim would hold.\n\nBut looking at the scores:\n\nRow 1: score 4-5 \u2192 home scored 5\nRow 2: 2-6 \u2192 6\nRow3: 2-1 ot\u21921 (visitor scored 2 in OT; total for home is 1)\nRow4: 3-0 \u21923\nRow5: 1-0 \u21921\nRow6: 3-2 \u21922\nRow7: 1-0 \u21921\nRow8: 2-1 \u21921\nRow9: 3-1 \u21921\nRow10: 2-1 \u21921\nRow11: 4-1 \u21921\nRow12: 3-2 \u21922\nRow13: 2-1 so\u2192 visitor scored 2 in shootout, home scored 1.\n\nSo the home team's goals per game are as follows:\n\nRows where home scored over 40? Wait, but none of these scores exceed 40. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"points\" refers to the home team's points (goals) for that specific game. If so, looking at each row's points column: it goes from 32 up to 48. But in reality, hockey games don't end with such high scores; usually, it's around 2-3 goals max per team.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the \"points\" are not directly related to the score but to something else, like PIM (penalty minutes) or something else entirely. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the table's columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"points\" column is a cumulative total of points earned per game, where each game contributes 2 points for a win, 0 for loss, and 1 for tie. So, looking at row 1: record is 14-6-4, so total points would be 14*2 + 6*0 + 4*1 = 28 + 0 +4=32, which matches the \"points\" column in row1.\n\nSimilarly, row2: same team's record is now 15-6-4, so total points 30. Wait no, row2 has points as 36. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe each game contributes 3 points for a win, 0 for loss, and 2 for tie? Let me check.\n\nRow1: 14 wins, 6 losses, 4 ties \u2192 14*3=42 + 6*0 +4*2=8 \u2192 total 50. But row1's points are 32, so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 2 points for a win, 0 for loss, and 1 for tie. So row1: 14*2=28 + 6*0 +4*1=4 \u2192 total 32, which matches. Similarly, row2 would have record 15-6-4, so 30 points, but in the table, it's 36. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, perhaps \"points\" is the total goals scored by the home team across all games up to that point. Let me see:\n\nRow1: home scored 5 goals, cumulative 5\nBut row1 points are 32, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the total number of goals scored in all games: sum of both teams' goals. But for row1, 4+5=9; row1 points=32, not matching.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe claim is likely about home teams scoring over 40 goals in a game, but given the scores don't go that high, maybe it's about total points earned (like PHL's point system where each goal is worth 2 points? Not sure).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"over 40 point be score\" refers to both teams scoring over 20 points each. But again, in hockey, goals are rare, so that's unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe the \"points\" column represents something else, like the sum of goals plus assists or something. That could add up higher, but without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is just to process each row's home team score and see if any exceed 40, which none do. So maybe the answer is that there are no such games.\n\nBut given that the user provided a table with \"points\" ranging up to 48 (row13: points=36), I'm probably misinterpreting something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the home team having a 40+ goal differential in any game. But looking at each row:\n\nThe score is visitor - home. So, for example, row1: 4-5 \u2192 home leads by +1\n\nRow2:2-6\u2192home leads by +4\nRow3:2-1\u2192 home leads by +1\nRow4:3-0\u2192 home leads by +3\nRow5:1-0\u2192 home leads by +1\nRow6:3-2\u2192 home leads by +1\nRow7:1-0\u2192+1\nRow8:2-1\u2192+1\nRow9:3-1\u2192+2\nRow10:2-1\u2192+1\nRow11:4-1\u2192+3\nRow12:3-2\u2192+1\nRow13:2-1\u2192+1\n\nNone of these are over 40, so again, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the points column is about something else entirely, like PIM or something. But without context, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo and meant \"over 40\" in terms of total goals per game? Or maybe they're using a different scoring system.\n\nGiven that none of the home team scores exceed single digits, I think there might be a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the table is from a different sport where higher scores are possible.\n\nBut given hockey context, the highest score for home is 6 in row2 (visitor scored 2, so home scored 6), which is still way below 40.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, there are no games where the home team scored over 40 points.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each game's score and the \"points\" column provided, none of the home teams scored more than 40 points in any single game. Therefore, the claim that a home team has scored over 40 points in three or more games is not supported by the data given.\n\n**Answer:** There are no games where the home team scored more than 40 points.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"16434 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and the data.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a specific number, 16434, which should refer to the attendance figure in some row of the table. I'll look through each row's attendance column to see if this number appears.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n- Row 1: Attendance is 21273\n- Row 2: 21273\n- Row 3: 21273\n- Row 4: 21273\n- Row 5: 21273\n- Row 6: 21273\n- Row 7: 16434 (Here it is)\n- Row 8: 21273\n- Row 9: 21273\n- Row 10: 21273\n- Row 11: 17132\n- Row 12: 20741\n- Row 13: 20454\n\nSo, the attendance figure of 16434 is found only in row 7. Now, the claim says that this crowd size was present for \"9 of the game.\" I need to find how many times 16434 appears in the table.\n\nFrom the above check, it's clear that 16434 only appears once, in row 7. Therefore, there is just one instance where the attendance was 16434, not nine.\n\nNext, I should consider if the term \"crowd\" or \"attendance\" aligns with other data points. However, the relevant part here is the count of how many times this specific number appears. Since it only appears once, the claim is incorrect as stated.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because 16434 attendance occurred only once in the games listed.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false by checking the table provided. The claim states: \"less than 17132 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to say that there were only four games where the attendance was less than 17,132.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with rows representing different games. Each row has several columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, and points.\n\nThe key here is to find all rows where the attendance is less than 17,132. Then, count how many such games there are. If that count is four or fewer, the claim holds; otherwise, it doesn't.\n\nSo I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Attendance is 21,273 \u2013 which is more than 17,132.\nRow 2: Same as Row 1.\nRow 3: Same as well.\nRow 4: 21,273 again.\nRow 5: Also 21,273.\nRow 6: Again, same number.\nRow 7: Here, the attendance drops to 16,434. That's less than 17,132. So this is one game.\nRow 8: 21,273 \u2013 more.\nRow 9: Same as above.\nRow 10: Still high attendance.\nRow 11: Attendance is 17,132. The claim says \"less than,\" so this doesn't count because it's not less, just equal.\nRow 12: 20,741 \u2013 way more.\nRow 13: 20,454 \u2013 again more.\n\nSo only Row 7 has attendance less than 17,132. That means there was only one game where the crowd was less than 17,132. The claim says \"only 4 of the games,\" which is incorrect because it's actually just one game. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"over 40 point be score for at least 5 game\" is true based on the given table. First, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions \"over 40 points as a score for at least 5 games.\" So, I think this means that there should be at least five games where the team's score (points) was over 40.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with various details like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, and points. The \"score\" column seems to show the result of the game, but I'm not entirely sure if it's representing points or goals. Wait, in hockey, typically a goal is a point, so each team's score would be their total points for that game.\n\nBut looking at the scores provided, I see entries like 4-5, 2-6, etc., which might indicate the final score of the game, where the first number is the home team's goals and the second is the visitor's. So if we're talking about the home team's points, maybe it's adding up their goals to get a total. But in the \"points\" column, I see numbers like 32, 34, etc., which probably represent the total points for the home team.\n\nWait, but the claim is about the score being over 40 points. So perhaps each game has a point total for the home team, and we need to check how many times this was over 40.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Points:32\nRow2:34\nRow3:35\nRow4:37\nRow5:37\nRow6:37\nRow7:37\nRow8:39\nRow9:41\nRow10:42\nRow11:44\nRow12:46\nRow13:48\n\nSo, the points column shows the home team's total points for each game. The claim is about having \"over 40\" in at least five games. Let's see how many times the points are over 40.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row1:32 \u2192 no\n- Row2:34 \u2192 no\n- Row3:35 \u2192 no\n- Row4:37 \u2192 no\n- Row5:37 \u2192 no\n- Row6:37 \u2192 no\n- Row7:37 \u2192 no\n- Row8:39 \u2192 no (since 40 is the threshold)\n- Row9:41 \u2192 yes, over 40\n- Row10:42 \u2192 yes\n- Row11:44 \u2192 yes\n- Row12:46 \u2192 yes\n- Row13:48 \u2192 yes\n\nWait, so from row9 to row13, that's five games where points are above 40. So that's at least five games.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"at least 5 game\" \u2013 does it mean exactly five or at least five? I think at least five, so if there are more than five, it still counts as true.\n\nHowever, looking back, the rows where points exceed 40 start from row9 (41) up to row13. That's five games: row9,10,11,12,13 \u2013 that's five games. So yes, at least five games meet the condition.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row corresponds to a different date, so each is a separate game. So rows 9-13 are five games where home team scored over 40 points. Therefore, the claim is true because there are indeed at least five games with scores over 40.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
