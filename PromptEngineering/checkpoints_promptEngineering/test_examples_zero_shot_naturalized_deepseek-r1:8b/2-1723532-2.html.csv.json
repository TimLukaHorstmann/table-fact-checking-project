    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"the date for the tournament in indian well be 8 march 1992\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a tournament called \"indian well\" and specifies that the date was 8 March 1992. I need to check if there's any row in the table that matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 1: outcome: winner, date: 25 May 1987, tournament: Florence, surface: clay...\nI see \"tournament\" column, so let me focus on that. \n\nI'm looking for a row where \"tournament\" is \"Indian Wells\". Let's scan through each row.\n\nRow 13 says: outcome: runner-up, date: 8 March 1992, tournament: Indian Wells, surface: hardcourt...\n\nAh, here it is. The tournament is indeed Indian Wells and the date is 8 March 1992. So this matches the claim exactly.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there's no other row with the same tournament name on a different date. Let me check quickly through the rest of the rows.\n\nRows 1 to 15: Only Row 13 has \"Indian Wells\" as the tournament and the date is 8 March 1992. No other rows mention Indian Wells or that specific date.\n\nSo, since there's a matching row in the table, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be the ones for Row 13: specifically, the \"date\" column and the \"tournament\" column.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells include row_index 13 for both columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier be the opponent in the match that be play in nice on a clay court.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. The opponent's name is j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier.\n2. The match was played in Nice on a clay court.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different match with various details like outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. My task is to find if any row matches both conditions mentioned in the claim: j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier as the opponent and the tournament being Nice on clay.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: May 25, 1987\n- Tournament: Florence\n- Surface: Clay\n- Opponent: Alessandro de minicis\nNo match here because the opponent is not j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier and the tournament isn't Nice.\n\nRow 2:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: January 3, 1988\n- Tournament: Wellington\n- Surface: Hardcourt\n- Opponent: Ramesh Krishnan\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 3:\n- Runner-up\n- January 10, 1988\n- Sydney\n- Grass surface\n- John Fitzgerald as opponent.\nNo match.\n\nRow 4:\n- Winner\n- March 14, 1988\n- Orlando\n- Hardcourt\n- Miloslav Me\u010d\u00ed\u0159\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 5:\n- Runner-up\n- October 16, 1988\n- Toulouse\n- Hardcourt\n- Jimmy Connors\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 6:\n- Winner\n- April 24, 1989\n- Nice\n- Clay surface\n- Opponent: j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier.\nWait, that's exactly what the claim says! The tournament is Nice, clay court, and the opponent is j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier. So this row matches both conditions.\n\nRow 7:\n- Winner\n- May 8, 1989\n- Munich\n- Clay\n- Martin St\u0159elba\nNot our case since the tournament isn't Nice.\n\nRow 8:\n- Runner-up\n- January 14, 1990\n- Auckland\n- Hardcourt\n- Scott Davis\nNo match.\n\nRow 9:\n- Winner\n- April 30, 1990\n- Monte Carlo\n- Clay\n- Thomas Muster\nDifferent opponent and different tournament.\n\nRow 10:\n- Runner-up\n- May 20, 1990\n- Rome\n- Clay\n- Thomas Muster\nNo match again.\n\nRow 11:\n- Winner\n- October 15, 1990\n- Tel Aviv\n- Hardcourt\n- Amos Mansdorf\nNot relevant.\n\nRow 12:\n- Winner\n- July 29, 1991\n- Montreal\n- Hardcourt\n- Petr Korda\nNo match.\n\nRow 13:\n- Runner-up\n- March 8, 1992\n- Indian Wells\n- Hardcourt\n- Michael Chang\nNot our case.\n\nRow 14:\n- Runner-up\n- May 9, 1993\n- Hamburg\n- Clay\n- Michael Stich\nDifferent opponent and tournament.\n\nRow 15:\n- Runner-up\n- August 8, 1993\n- Prague\n- Clay\n- Sergi Bruguera\nNo match here either.\n\nSo the only row that satisfies both conditions is Row 6. The tournament is Nice on a clay court, and the opponent is j\u00e9r\u00f4me potier. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

That seems to match exactly with the claim. \n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other rows where Serghi Bruguera is the opponent. Scanning through the table again, I don't see any other entries for him. So Row 15 is the only one.\n\nNext, I need to check what the score in that row is. It says 5-7 and 4-6, which matches the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, it's specifically about the opponent being Serghi Bruguera and the score.

It mentions the score for the tournament in Wellington as \"7 - 6 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\". So I need to find this exact score in the table under the \"score\" column for that particular row.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. My focus is on finding a row where the tournament is Wellington and the score matches the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Tournament is Florence, so not relevant.\nRow 2: Tournament is Wellington. Let's check the score here. It says \"7 - 6 , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 3 - 6\". That matches exactly what the claim states.\nRows 3 to 15 don't mention Wellington again, so they're not relevant.\n\nSince Row 2 has both the tournament as Wellington and the score matching the claim, this means the claim is supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list the row where the tournament is Wellington (Row 2) along with its \"score\" column.

Let me break down the claim:\n\n1. **Tournament**: Indian Wells\n2. **Date**: 8 March 1992\n3. **Surface**: clay\n\nNow, I need to look through each row of the table to find a match for these criteria.\n\nLooking at the rows, let's check for \"Indian Wells\" as the tournament name and the date 8 March 1992.\n\nRow 13: outcome: runner-up, date: 8 March 1992, tournament: Indian Wells, surface: hardcourt. Hmm, the surface here is hardcourt, not clay. So this row doesn't support the claim.\n\nAre there any other rows with \"Indian Wells\" and a clay surface? Let me check each row carefully:\n\n- Row 12: Montreal, July 1991 \u2013 hardcourt\n- Row 13: Indian Wells, March 1992 \u2013 hardcourt\n- Row 14: Hamburg, May 1993 \u2013 clay\n- Row 15: Prague, August 1993 \u2013 clay\n\nWait, I'm only looking for \"Indian Wells\" and the date in question. Since there's only one row with \"Indian Wells,\" which is row 13 on a hardcourt surface, that doesn't match the claim of being played on clay.\n\nSo, the tournament in Indian Wells on 8 March 1992 was indeed played on a hardcourt surface, not clay.

The score in the Tel Aviv tournament was 6-4, 6-3.\n2. Amos Mansdorf won that match.\n\nNow, I need to check each part against the table. Let's start with the first part: the score.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim is about a specific match score against sergi bruguera. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"the score in the match against sergi bruguera be 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 5 - 7.\" So they're saying that when Andre played against Sergi Bruguera, the scores were 5-7, then 6-4, and finally 5-7.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to find any row where the outcome is a runner-up or winner against Ser[gi] Bruguera. Wait, in the data, the opponent's name is \"sergi bruguera\". Let me check each row to see if there's a match against this opponent with those scores.\n\nI'll go through the table row by row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Alessandro de minicis.\nRow 2: Ramesh krishnan.\n...\nContinuing down, I notice that in Row 15: outcome is runner-up, date: 8 august 1993, tournament: prague, surface: clay, opponent: sergi bruguera. The score here is 5-7 and 4-6.\n\nWait, the claim mentions a match with three sets: 5-7, 6-4, 5-7. That's two tiebreaks and one final set. But in Row 15, there are only two scores listed: 5-7 and 4-6. So maybe it was a best-of-three or something else? Or perhaps the score is incomplete?\n\nI also check other rows for \"sergi bruguera.\" Hmm, in Row 14, the opponent is Michael Stich, not Bruguera. In Row 15, yes, it's Bruguera. But the scores don't match the claim. The claim has three scores: two sets and a final tiebreak.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the format. Let me check the other rows again. For example, Row 4 shows \"7-6 (8-6), 6-1.\" So in that case, it's the first set score, then the tiebreak, followed by the second set. So maybe the score should be split as 7-6 and 8-6 for the tiebreak, but written together.\n\nIn Row 15, the scores are listed as 5-7 and 4-6, so perhaps it's two sets only, or perhaps it was a best-of-five? Or maybe the format is different. Alternatively, could there be another row with Bruguera?\n\nWait, looking again at the table, I don't see any other rows where opponent is sergi bruguera except Row 15. So the claim must be referring to that specific match.\n\nBut in Row 15, the scores are 5-7 and 4-6. The claim mentions 5-7, 6-4, 5-7. That's three sets: first set 5-7, second 6-4, third 5-7. So that would imply a final tiebreak after the second set, making it a best-of-five scenario.\n\nBut in Row 15, only two scores are provided. Maybe the table is missing some data or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the match ended at three sets without a third set score because it was already decided. Or perhaps the scoring format in the table is different.\n\nWait, let me check another row for comparison. Row 4: outcome: winner, date:14 March 1988, tournament: Orlando, surface: hardcourt, opponent: Miloslav me\u010d\u00ed\u0159, score:7-6 (8-6), 6-1. So that's two scores, with the tiebreak in parentheses.\n\nSimilarly, Row 15 has only two scores without any tiebreak notation. So perhaps it's a straight two-set match where Bruguera won 4-6 and 5-7? No, wait: outcome is runner-up, so Andre lost both sets. So the score would be 5-7 in the first set and 4-6 in the second, making him the runner-up.\n\nBut the claim says that the score was 5-7, then 6-4, then 5-7. That's a different sequence of scores, implying that the third set had a tiebreak, which isn't reflected in Row 15.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse the claim again: \"5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 5 - 7.\" So after the first set, it's tied at 6-4 (second set), and then another tiebreak of 5-7? That would make sense if it were a best-of-five scenario.\n\nBut in the table, Row 15 only has two scores: 5-7 and 4-6. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the third set isn't present or doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me see if there are any other rows where Bruguera is the opponent with more than two sets. No, looking at all the rows, only Row 15 mentions Bruguera as the opponent, and it has only two scores.\n\nTherefore, the claim's score sequence doesn't match the actual data in the table. Hence, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on a specific match against sergi bruguera with scores 5-7, 6-4, and 5-7. However, upon reviewing the table, only one row (Row 15) lists a match against Bruguera, with scores 5-7 and 4-6. The claim's sequence of scores doesn't align with this data, indicating it's incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"false\": true\n}\n```",
