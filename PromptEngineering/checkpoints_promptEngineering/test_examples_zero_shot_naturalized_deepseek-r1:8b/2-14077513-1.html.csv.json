I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"there be 0 drawn for 7 game with 4 loss , 19 - 19 point differential and 6 point.\"\n\nLet me break down each part of the claim.\n\n1. **0 drawn for 7 games**: This means I'm looking for rows where the number of drawn games is 0, and the total number of games played is 7.\n\n2. **4 loss**: So, the number of lost games should be 4 in these rows.\n\n3. **19 - 19 point differential**: The points difference column should show a value of 19 - 19, which equals 0. Wait, actually, looking at the table, the points difference is already given as 19-19 for each row. So maybe it's referring to that specific number being present.\n\n4. **6 point**: The total points for these rows should be 6.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check these conditions.\n\nLooking at Row 1: games=7, drawn=1, lost=0. Doesn't match because drawn isn't 0 and lost is 0 (but the claim says 4 loss), so not relevant.\n\nRow 2: games=7, drawn=4, lost=0. Doesn't fit since drawn is 4, not 0.\n\nRow3: games=7, drawn=1, lost=2. Again, drawn isn't 0 and lost is 2, not 4.\n\nRow4: games=7, drawn=2, lost=2. No, same issue.\n\nRow5: games=7, drawn=1, lost=3. Not matching.\n\nRow6: games=7, drawn=0, lost=4. Here, drawn is 0 and lost is 4. That's two conditions met. Points difference is 19-19, which matches the claim. Total points are 6, as per the row.\n\nSo this row (row_index=6) satisfies all parts of the claim.\n\nI don't see any other rows that fit because the others have either more drawn games or fewer losses than what's specified.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE and the relevant cells are in Row6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
