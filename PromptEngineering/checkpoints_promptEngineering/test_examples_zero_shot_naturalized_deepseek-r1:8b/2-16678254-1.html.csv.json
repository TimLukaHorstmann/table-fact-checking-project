Let me start by understanding the claim.\n\nThe claim says: \"week 8 on november 13 , 1949 have a w result with a score of 65 - 20.\"\n\nSo I'm looking for a row in the table where:\n- The week number is 8.\n- The date is November 13, 1949.\n- The result starts with 'w' (which I assume means a win).\n- The score is 65 - 20.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to find matches for these criteria.\n\nLooking at Row 8: week 8, date: november 13, 1949. Opponent is new york bulldogs. Result is w 65 - 20. Record is updated accordingly.\n\nSo all four conditions are met in this row. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The relevant cells would be:\n- Row index of 8 (since it's the week 8 game).\n- The columns that contain the information checked: week, date, result, and score.\n\nSo each relevant cell corresponds to a column name and the row index. Therefore, I'll list four relevant cells: 'week', 'date', 'result', and 'score' at row 8.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with data about a team's games over several weeks in 1949. The claim I need to evaluate is: \"there be a result of w 65 - 20 after week 9 on november 13 , 1949.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out which rows and columns are relevant here. Let me look at the table structure again.\n\nEach row has the following columns: week, date, opponent, result, record. The 'result' column seems to be where the outcome of each game is listed. So for this claim, I need to check if any row matches both the week and date mentioned in the claim, specifically looking at the result.\n\nThe claim says \"after week 9 on november 13, 1949.\" So I need to find a row where week is 9 and date is November 13, 1949. Then, check what the result was for that game.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: week 1, September 26\nRow 2: week 2, October 2\nRow 3: week 3, October 8\nRow 4: week 4, October 16\nRow 5: week 5, October 23\nRow 6: week 6, October 30\nRow 7: week 7, November 6\nRow 8: week 8, November 13\nRow 9: week 9, November 20\nRow 10: week 10, November 27\nRow 11: week 11, December 4\nRow 12: week 12, December 11\n\nSo, the date is November 13, which matches Row 8. Let's check what week that is\u2014week 8.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"after week 9.\" That might be a bit confusing because in the table, week 8 is November 13, and week 9 is November 20. So perhaps the claim is slightly off? Or maybe it's referring to the result after Week 9, but that would include games up to Week 9.\n\nBut regardless, I think the main point is to check if there's a game on November 13 with a result of w 65 - 20. Looking at Row 8, the opponent was New York Bulldogs, and the result was w 65 - 20. So yes, that row matches both the week (week 8) and date (November 13), but the claim mentions week 9.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"after week 9 on november 13,\" which might be a typo or misstatement because in reality, November 13 is Week 8. So perhaps the claim is incorrect in the week number as well.\n\nBut regardless of that, looking at Row 8 (week 8), the result is indeed w 65 -20. So even if the week number in the claim is wrong, the result exists for that date. Therefore, the claim's statement about the result is true because there is a game on November 13 with that result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user meant to refer to week 9, but since there's no game on November 13 for week 9 (because week 9 is November 20), the correct match is week 8. So the claim might be slightly incorrect in the week number, but the result still exists on that date.\n\nSo to determine if the claim is true, I need to check if there's a row where week=9 and date=November 13, which doesn't exist because week 9 is November 20. Therefore, the claim is false because the specified week and date don't align correctly.\n\nWait, but maybe the user intended to refer to the game on November 13 regardless of the week number. So even if the week in the claim is wrong, as long as there's a result for that date, it's true. But since the claim specifies both week and date, both have to match. Since there's no Week 9 game on November 13, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the week number, but the date and result are correct. It might be that they meant to say Week 8 instead of 9. So depending on interpretation, it could be tricky.\n\nBut strictly following the instructions, I need to check if there's a row where both week is 9 and date is November 13. Since there isn't such a row, the claim is false because no game in week 9 on that date. Alternatively, even though there's a result for Week 8 on that date, the claim specifies Week 9, which doesn't have that result.\n\nSo I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there is a result of \"w 65 - 20\" after week 9 on November 13, 1949. Checking the table, we find that the game on November 13, 1949, corresponds to week 8 with the result \"w 65 - 20.\" Since there is no game in week 9 on that date, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns and Rows:** The 'result' column is key. We need rows matching both the specified week (9) and date (November 13).\n2. **Search for Matching Rows:** None of the rows have week=9 and date=November 13.\n3. **Conclusion:** Since no such game exists, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
