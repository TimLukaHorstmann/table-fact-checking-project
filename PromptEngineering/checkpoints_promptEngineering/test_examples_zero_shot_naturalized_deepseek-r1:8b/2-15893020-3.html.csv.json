    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the term \"average\" in cricket usually refers to a player's average runs per innings or something similar. The claim says that Deon Kruis has an average of 0.1. That seems really low because typically players have higher averages, especially if they're batting for some time.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find where Deon Kruis is listed and check his average. Scanning through the rows, I see Row 17: player: deon kruis. In that row, under \"average\" it says \"n / a\". Hmm, \"n/a\" probably stands for not applicable or no data. So there's no average provided for Deon Kruis in the table.\n\nThe claim refers to his average being 0.1, but since the table doesn't provide an average for him, this information isn't available to verify. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported as true because the necessary data is missing.\n\nSo, even though the claim is about Deon Kruis having a very low average, there's no data in the table to confirm or deny that specific number. Without that data, we can't validate whether 0.1 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not provide an average for Deon Kruis, as it is marked as \"n/a.\" Therefore, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
