    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those played late afternoon or evening.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what the relevant data points are. The key aspects here are the time of each game and their attendances.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the games are scheduled on different dates, times, and locations. Each row has details like date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance.\n\nThe claim is making a comparison between games played in the middle of the day and those in the late afternoon or evening. It also mentions an exception for the Florida game, which I think refers to the September 11 game against South Florida.\n\nI need to identify which games are \"in the middle of the day\" and which are \"late afternoon or evening.\" Typically, middle of the day might mean around noon, while late afternoon or evening is later, like in the afternoon or evening. So I'll categorize each game's time accordingly.\n\nLooking at the times:\n- September 10, 7:00 pm (evening)\n- September 11 games:\n  - 12:00 pm (noon/midday)\n  - 1:00 pm (late morning/afternoon)\n  - 3:30 pm (late afternoon)\n  - 7:00 pm (evening)\n\nWait, the claim says \"middle of the day,\" which is probably around noon. So games at 12:00 pm and maybe 1:00 pm could be considered midday.\n\nThe Florida game is on September 11, 12:00 pm. The claim says it's an exception, so I should handle that separately.\n\nI need to check the attendance for these time slots. Let me list them:\n\n1. **September 10, 7:00 pm (evening)**: Marshall vs West Virginia, attendance 41,382.\n2. **September 11 games**:\n   - 12:00 pm: Florida vs South Florida, attendance 90,612.\n   - 1:00 pm: Pittsburgh vs New Hampshire, attendance 50,120.\n   - 3:30 pm: Louisville vs Eastern Kentucky, attendance 51,427.\n   - 7:00 pm: Washington vs Syracuse, attendance 62,418.\n\nWait, the claim says games in the middle of the day (except Florida) have lower attendance than those played late afternoon or evening. So I need to compare midday games with afternoon/evening games.\n\nBut looking at the times, the 12:00 pm game is midday, and then there are multiple games at 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, and 7:00 pm which are after that.\n\nSo for the midday games:\n- Florida vs South Florida (12:00 pm): attendance 90,612\n- Pittsburgh vs New Hampshire (1:00 pm): 50,120\nWait, but 1:00 pm is technically still early afternoon or late morning. The claim might be considering anything after noon as late afternoon/evening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the midday refers to games at noon, and then late afternoon/evening are others. Let me clarify:\n\n- Midday: games at 12:00 pm (September 11)\n- Late afternoon/Evening: games at 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, 7:00 pm.\n\nWait, the claim is about \"the game in the middle of the day, with exception of Florida game.\" So maybe midday refers to the game on September 11 at 12:00 pm, and then late afternoon/evening includes games after that. But some games are on September 10, which is earlier.\n\nI think I need to structure this as:\n\n- Midday games: Only the Florida vs South Florida game on September 11 at 12:00 pm.\n- Late afternoon/Evening games: All other games except those before or at midday.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the game in the middle of the day\" (singular) and the rest as late afternoon/evening. Or perhaps it's considering any time after noon as evening.\n\nWait, the original claim is: \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nHmm, maybe the wording is that all midday games (except Florida) have lower attendance. But I think it's better to parse the claim as:\n\n- All games played in the middle of the day (e.g., around noon) have lower attendance compared to games played later in the afternoon or evening.\n\nBut looking at the times, there are multiple games on September 11: 12:00 pm, 1:00 pm, 3:30 pm, and 7:00 pm. So perhaps midday is 12:00 pm, and late afternoon/evening would be 1:00 pm and later.\n\nSo the midday game is Florida vs South Florida (attendance 90,612). The games in the afternoon/evening are:\n\n- 1:00 pm: Pittsburgh vs New Hampshire (50,120)\n- 3:30 pm: Louisville vs Eastern Kentucky (51,427)\n- 7:00 pm: Washington vs Syracuse (62,418)\n\nThe claim says that midday game has lower attendance than the afternoon/evening games. Let's check:\n\nFlorida at midday: 90,612\nPittsburgh in afternoon: 50,120 < 90k \u2192 so this is lower.\nLouisville: 51,427 < 90k \u2192 also lower.\nWashington: 62,418 < 90k? Wait, no, 62k is less than 90k. So yes.\n\nSo Florida midday game has higher attendance than all afternoon/evening games except maybe none? Because 50k, 51k, 62k are all less than 90k.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"with the exception of the florida game,\" so perhaps it's saying that among midday games (except Florida), they have lower attendance. But in this case, there is only one midday game, which is the Florida game.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nThe claim: \"the game in the middle of the day , with the exception of the florida game , have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's saying that all games played in the middle of the day (midday) except Florida have lower attendance than the afternoon/evening games.\n\nBut in this case, only the Florida game is midday. So perhaps it's irrelevant because there are no other midday games to compare.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the game\" refers to a single game, but that doesn't make much sense with \"have lower attendance.\"\n\nI think I need to interpret the claim as:\n\n- All games played in the middle of the day have lower attendance than those played late afternoon or evening, except for the Florida game which might be an exception.\n\nBut looking at the numbers:\n\nMidday: Florida vs South Florida: 90,612\nAfternoon/Evening:\n- Pittsburgh:50k < 90k \u2192 yes\n- Louisville:51k <90k\u2192yes\n- Washington:62k <90k\u2192yes\n\nSo all afternoon/evening games have lower attendance than midday. But the claim says midday (except Florida) have lower, which might not apply because only Florida is midday.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's saying that except for Florida, other midday games (if any) have lower attendance, but in our case, there are none, so perhaps the statement is vacuously true. But that seems odd.\n\nWait, another interpretation: The claim could be stating that all games played in the middle of the day (i.e., around noon) have lower attendance compared to games played later in the afternoon or evening. Except for the Florida game, which might not fit this pattern.\n\nBut since the Florida game is midday and has higher attendance than some other games, it's an exception.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is trying to say that all games except the Florida one have lower attendance when played in the middle of the day compared to after. But that doesn't align with the numbers because the Florida game has higher attendance.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. Let me lay out the data clearly:\n\n- Midday (12:00 pm): Florida vs South Florida, 90,612\n- Afternoon/Evening:\n   - 1:00 pm: Pittsburgh vs New Hampshire, 50,120\n   - 3:30 pm: Louisville vs Eastern Kentucky, 51,427\n   - 7:00 pm: Washington vs Syracuse, 62,418\n\nSo Florida midday game has the highest attendance among all games. The other games have lower attendances.\n\nThe claim states: \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's a misstatement and meant to say that midday games (except Florida) have lower attendance. But since there are no other midday games, maybe it's implying that all non-Florida games have lower attendance when played midday vs after.\n\nBut the only midday game is Florida, which has higher attendance than others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's intended to say that except for the Florida game, which doesn't fit the pattern, other games do. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven this confusion, maybe the claim is correct in that all midday games (only Florida) have higher attendance, but perhaps the user wants us to verify if midday games generally have lower attendance than evening/afternoon ones except for Florida.\n\nBut looking at the data:\n\nMidday: 90k\nAfternoon:50k,51k,62k\n\nAll afternoon/evening are lower. So the claim's statement that midday (except Florida) have lower attendance is incorrect because Florida has higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be false because the Florida game in midday actually had higher attendance than all others.\n\nSo, to answer the task: I need to check if \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nGiven that only the Florida game is midday and it has higher attendance than all other games, the statement is false.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe original statement claims that \"the game in the middle of the day, with the exception of the florida game, have lower attendance than those played late afternoon or evening.\" However, upon analyzing the data:\n\n- **Midday (12:00 pm)**: Florida vs South Florida had an attendance of 90,612.\n- **Afternoon/Evening**:\n  - Pittsburgh vs New Hampshire: 50,120\n  - Louisville vs Eastern Kentucky: 51,427\n  - Washington vs Syracuse: 62,418\n\nAll afternoon and evening games have lower attendances compared to the midday Florida game. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because the Florida game actually had higher attendance than the others.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because the midday Florida game had a higher attendance than other games played later in the day.",

The table has several rows, so I'll scan through them.\n\nRow 1: Date is September 10 \u2013 doesn't match.\nRow 2: September 11 \u2013 yes, this is relevant because it's one of the games on that date.\nRow 3: Also September 11 \u2013 another game to check.\nRow 4: Same date \u2013 another game.\nRow 5: September 11 again.\nRow 6: Still September 11.\nRow 7: The same date.\n\nSo, rows 2 through 7 are all games on September 11. But wait, row 2 is actually September 11 at 12 PM, so it's a different time but same date. So I need to check each of these for attendance numbers.\n\nNow, the claim states that Indiana State and Cincinnati drew the least attendance with only 30,807 attendees. Let me look up which game that refers to.\n\nLooking at row 3: visiting team is Indiana State, home team is Cincinnati, result is W 40-7, attendance is 30,807. That's exactly the number mentioned in the claim.\n\nSo I need to check if this is indeed the smallest attendance for games on September 11.\n\nLet me list out the attendances for each relevant row:\n\n- Row 2: South Florida vs. #8 Florida \u2013 90,612\n- Row 3: Indiana State vs. Cincinnati \u2013 30,807\n- Row 4: Texas Southern vs. Connecticut \u2013 37,359\n- Row 5: New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh \u2013 50,120\n- Row 6: Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville \u2013 51,427\n- Row 7: Syracuse vs. Washington \u2013 62,418\n\nLooking at these numbers, 30,807 is indeed the smallest attendance among the games on September 11.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are row 3's attendance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the home team wins 5 of the 7 game plays on the day list.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each row in the table represents. Each row seems to be a different game played on a specific date and time. I'll need to check each game's result to see if the home team won.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Marshall. Result is W 24 - 21 OT, which means they won.\nRow 2: Home team is No. 8 Florida. Result is L 14 - 38, so they lost.\nRow 3: Home team is Cincinnati. Result is W 40 - 7, so they won.\nRow 4: Home team is Connecticut. Result is W 62 - 3, so they won.\nRow 5: Home team is Pittsburgh. Result is W 38 - 16, so they won.\nRow 6: Home team is Louisville. Result is W 23 - 13, so they won.\nRow 7: Home team is Washington. Result is L 20 - 41, so they lost.\n\nSo, let's count the home wins:\n- Row 1: Win\n- Row 2: Loss\n- Row 3: Win\n- Row 4: Win\n- Row 5: Win\n- Row 6: Win\n- Row 7: Loss\n\nThat gives us 5 wins out of 7 games. So the home teams did win 5 of the 7 listed games.\n\nNow, to make sure I'm checking the right columns. The relevant data is in the 'result' column because it tells whether the home team won or lost each game. Therefore, for each row, I need to look at the result to determine if it's a win for the home team.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all rows where the result is a home win. But wait, the claim says \"the home team wins 5 of the 7 games on the day list.\" So I need to check each game in the day list (which seems to be September 11 except for Row 1, which is the 10th). Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nRow 1: September 10\nRows 2-7: September 11\n\nSo, the day list includes games from both the 10th and 11th.

It's about September 11 attendances and identifying if the highest number happened in a specific game between South Florida (SF) and Washington.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, all on September 11 except row 1, which is on the 10th. So I can focus only on rows 2 to 7 since they're on the 11th.\n\nI need to look for the highest attendance on that date and check if it's from the game between South Florida and Washington.\n\nLet me extract the attendances for each row on September 11:\n\nRow 2: SF vs UConn - 37,359\nRow 3: Indiana State vs Cincinnati - 30,807\nRow 4: Texas Southern vs UConn - 37,359\nRow 5: New Hampshire vs Pittsburgh - 50,120\nRow 6: Eastern Kentucky vs Louisville - 51,427\nRow 7: Syracuse vs Washington - 62,418\n\nNow, let's list these attendances:\n\n- Row 2: 37,359\n- Row 3: 30,807\n- Row 4: 37,359\n- Row 5: 50,120\n- Row 6: 51,427\n- Row 7: 62,418\n\nSo the highest attendance is in row 7, which is between Syracuse and Washington with 62,418.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"South Florida and Washington.\" Looking at the table, South Florida (SF) is visiting UConn on September 11. So row 2 is SF vs UConn, and row 4 is Texas Southern vs UConn. There's no game between SF and Washington in the table.\n\nTherefore, the attendance for the SF vs Washington game isn't even present here because in row 7, it's Syracuse vs Washington, not South Florida.\n\nSo the highest attendance on September 11 isn't from the game between SF and Washington; it's from Syracuse against Washington.

It's stating that two teams, Indiana State and Cincinnati, played against each other on September 10th and had the lowest number of attendees, specifically 41,382 people.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check for any games involving these two teams on that specific date. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Date is September 10th, time is 7 pm. Visiting team is West Virginia (No.23), home team is Marshall. The site is Joan C. Edwards Stadium in Huntington, WV. So this isn't the Indiana State vs Cincinnati game because both teams aren't mentioned here.\n\nRow 2: September 11th at 12 pm. The visiting team is South Florida, home team is Florida (No.8). Site is Ben Hill-Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, FL. Again, neither Indiana State nor Cincinnati are listed here.\n\nRow 3: Same date as Row 2 but different time: 12 pm. Visiting team is Indiana State, home team is Cincinnati. Site is Nippert Stadium in Cincinnati, OH. The broadcast is FSOHIO. Result is a win for Cincinnati with 40-7. Attendance is 30,807.\n\nRow 4: September 11th at 12 pm. Visiting team is Texas Southern, home team is Connecticut. So not relevant to the claim either.\n\nRow 5: September 11th at 1 pm. Visiting team is New Hampshire, home team is Pittsburgh. Site is Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, PA. Not related.\n\nRow 6: September 11th at 3:30 pm. Eastern Kentucky vs Louisville. Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: September 11th at 7 pm. Syracuse vs Washington. Also not relevant.\n\nWait, the claim mentions that the game was on September 10th, but looking through the table, I don't see a game between Indiana State and Cincinnati on that date. Instead, Row 3 is on September 11th with the same teams. So maybe there's a mistake in the claim regarding the date.\n\nAlso, the attendance for Row 3 is 30,807, which is less than 41,382 from Row 1. So even if the date were correct, they wouldn't have the least attendance on September 10th. Wait, no\u2014Row 1's game was on September 10th and had 41,382 attendees.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"indiana state and cincinnati\" but in Row 3, it's Indiana State visiting Cincinnati. So perhaps that's the same as the claim. But the date is September 11th, not the 10th. The claim might have an incorrect date.\n\nAlso, looking at all the rows, only Row 1 has attendance of 41,382. Rows 2-7 have higher or lower attendances but none on September 10th except for Row 1.\n\nSo, the claim says that on September 10th, Indiana State and Cincinnati drew the least attendance with 41,382 attendees. But looking at the table, there's no game between those two teams on September 10th. Instead, their game is on the 11th with a lower attendance (30,807). Also, Row 1 is Marshall vs West Virginia, not Indiana State and Cincinnati.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because the date is wrong, and there's no such game on September 10th between those teams. So the answer should be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that a game between Indiana State and Cincinnati occurred on September 10th with the lowest attendance of 41,382. However, checking the table reveals that their game was actually on September 11th with lower attendance (30,807). Additionally, Row 1's game is between different teams, so no relevant game supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"the home team wins all of the game play on the day list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It says that on each day listed in the table, every home team played a game and won it. So, for every row (each representing a day), all games involving home teams should result in wins.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a specific date with multiple games happening on that date. Wait, no, actually, upon closer inspection, I notice something. Each row has a single game's details: visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance. So, it appears that each row is a separate game, possibly from different days or perhaps all on the same day but different times.\n\nWait, no, the dates in the table are September 10 and September 11. So, some rows have the same date (like Rows 2,3,4,5,6,7), which suggests that these are games happening on September 11 at different times. However, Row 1 is on September 10.\n\nSo, the claim says that for each day listed, all home team games resulted in wins. That means we need to check each game (each row) and see if the home team won their respective games.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Home team is Marshall, result is W 24-21 OT. So, a win.\n\nRow 2: Home team is No. 8 Florida, result is L 14-38. That's a loss, so this game doesn't count as a home team win.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the home team wins all of the game play on the day list\". So, for each day listed, check if all home team games resulted in wins.\n\nBut wait, each row is a separate game. So, looking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: Home team won.\n- Row 2: Home team lost.\n- Row 3: Home team Cincinnati won.\n- Row 4: Home team Connecticut won.\n- Row 5: Home team Pittsburgh won.\n- Row 6: Home team Louisville won.\n- Row 7: Home team Washington lost (since result is L).\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Row 2, the home team is No.8 Florida, but they lost. So, that game was a loss. Similarly, Row 7 shows the home team as Washington and the result is a loss.\n\nSo, for each row (game), we need to see if it's a home team game and whether they won or not.\n\nThe claim says \"the home team wins all of the game play on the day list.\" So, perhaps the table lists multiple games happening on different days, but the claim is that in each of those days listed, every home team game played that day resulted in a win. But looking at the dates, there are two days: September 10 and September 11.\n\nWait, Row 1 is September 10, and Rows 2-7 are September 11. So, perhaps the claim is saying that on each of those two days, all home team games resulted in wins.\n\nBut let's check each day:\n\nSeptember 10 (Row 1): Only one game, home team won.\n\nSeptember 11: Multiple games. Let's list all the home teams for September 11 and their results:\n\n- Row 2: Home team Florida lost.\n- Row 3: Home team Cincinnati won.\n- Row 4: Home team Connecticut won.\n- Row 5: Home team Pittsburgh won.\n- Row 6: Home team Louisville won.\n- Row 7: Home team Washington lost.\n\nSo, on September 11, there are two home teams that lost their games (Florida and Washington), while the others won. Therefore, not all home team games resulted in wins on September 11.\n\nHence, the claim is false because on September 11, some home teams lost.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"all of the game in the middle of the day have lower attendance than those play late afternoon or evening.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. Middle of the day would likely refer to games that are played around noon or early afternoon, like 12 PM. Late afternoon or evening might mean games starting at 3:30 PM or later.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game with details like date, time, visiting team, home team, site, broadcast, result, and attendance.\n\nI need to check all games that are in the middle of the day (12 PM) and compare their attendance to those in late afternoon or evening (3:30 PM or later). The claim says that all mid-day games have lower attendance than the late ones. So I should find all mid-day games, see if each has lower attendance compared to every game after 3:30 PM.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: September 10 at 7 PM. That's evening, so not relevant for middle of day.\n\nRow 2: September 11 at 12 PM. That's mid-day. Its attendance is 90,612.\n\nRow 3: September 11 at 12 PM. Also mid-day. Attendance is 30,807.\n\nRow 4: September 11 at 12 PM. Mid-day again with 37,359 attendees.\n\nRow 5: September 11 at 1 PM. That's late afternoon. Its attendance is 50,120.\n\nRow 6: September 11 at 3:30 PM. Late afternoon/early evening. Attendance is 51,427.\n\nRow 7: September 11 at 7 PM. Evening. Not relevant for mid-day comparison.\n\nSo the mid-day games are rows 2,3,4 with attendance of 90,612; 30,807; and 37,359 respectively.\n\nNow I need to compare these mid-day games to all late afternoon/evening games. Wait, but in the claim, it's about \"middle of the day\" versus \"late afternoon or evening.\" So I should consider each mid-day game and check if each has lower attendance than every game that starts at 3:30 PM or later.\n\nLooking at row 5 (1 PM) and row 6 (3:30 PM). So row 5 is late afternoon, row 6 is also considered as late.\n\nMid-day games:\n\n- Row2: 90,612\n- Row3: 30,807\n- Row4:37,359\n\nCompare each to row5:50,120 and row6:51,427.\n\nFirst mid-game: 90,612 vs. row5:50,120. Here, the mid-day game has higher attendance (90k) than the late afternoon game (50k). So this violates the claim because one mid-game is higher.\n\nSo the claim is not true because there's at least one mid-day game with higher attendance than a late afternoon game. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are rows 2,3,4 for mid-day games and row5,6 for late games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"washington win against syracuse in front of 62418 fan at home.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see if there's corresponding data in the table that supports it.\n\n1. **Team Names**: The claim mentions \"washington\" as the home team. Looking through the rows, I need to check which row has \"washington\" listed as the home team. Scanning through Row 7: date is september 11, time: 7:00 pm, visiting team: syracuse, home team: washington, site: husky stadium seattle, wa, broadcast: fsn northwest, result: l 20 - 41, attendance: 62418. So, in this row, the home team is indeed washington.\n\n2. **Opponent**: The opponent is \"syracuse.\" Checking Row 7 again, the visiting team is syracuse. So that's correct.\n\n3. **Location**: The claim states \"at home,\" which should be the home team's stadium. From Row 7, the site is husky stadium seattle, wa. That seems to be the home game for washington.\n\n4. **Result**: The claim says \"washington win against syracuse.\" In Row 7, the result is l 20 - 41, which means washington lost to syracuse. So that contradicts the claim.\n\n5. **Attendance**: The attendance given in Row 7 is 62418. The claim mentions \"in front of 62418 fan,\" so that matches.\n\nWait, but the result part is a problem because the claim says washington won, but according to the table, they lost. That would mean the claim is false. But I should make sure I'm not missing anything else.\n\nLet me double-check Row 7: visiting team is syracuse, home team is washington, site in seattle, result is loss for washington, attendance matches. So the only discrepancy is the result\u2014washington didn't win but lost.\n\nTherefore, the claim's assertion that washington won is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because, according to the table, Washington lost to Syracuse rather than winning.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
