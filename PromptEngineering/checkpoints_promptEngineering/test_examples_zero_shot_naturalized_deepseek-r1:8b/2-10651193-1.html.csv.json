    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no player draft from tennessee state with a rank lower than 261\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that there are no players drafted from Tennessee State who were picked before the 261st overall spot in the draft. So, if any player from Tennessee State has a rank lower than 261 (i.e., their position in the draft was earlier, like 1 to 260), then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see if there's a player from Tennessee State and whether their overall rank is below 261. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Player is Willis Adams from Houston.\n- Row 2: Lawrence Johnson from Wisconsin.\n- Row 3: Sam Claphan from Oklahoma.\n- Row 4: Jim Ramey from Kentucky.\n- Row 5: Matt Miller from Colorado.\n- Row 6: Rich Dimler from USC.\n- Row 7: Clinton Burrell from LSU.\n- Row 8: Jim Ronan from Minnesota.\n- Row 9: Cody Risien from Texas A&M.\n- Row 10: Kent Perkov from San Diego State.\n- Row 11: Carl McGee from Duke.\n- Row 12: Curtis Weather from Mississippi.\n- Row 13: John Henry Smith from Tennessee State. His overall rank is 261.\n- Row 14: Randy Poeschl from Nebraska.\n- Row 15: Dee Methvin from Tulane.\n\nSo, row 13 stands out because the player is from Tennessee State and his rank is exactly 261. The claim says \"rank lower than 261,\" so 261 is not lower; it's equal to 261. Therefore, this player does exist, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there are any other players from Tennessee State with a rank below 261. Looking through all rows, only row 13 has Tennessee State. So, no one else qualifies.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because John Henry Smith from Tennessee State was drafted at overall rank 261.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
