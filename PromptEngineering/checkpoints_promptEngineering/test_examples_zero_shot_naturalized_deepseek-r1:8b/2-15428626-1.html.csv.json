    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"October 27, 1963 be the date of the game against Houston Oilers\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it specifies a specific date and opponent. So, my task is to find in the table if there's a row where both the date is October 27, 1963 and the opponent is Houston Oilers.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several pieces of information: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. I'll need to scan through each row to see which ones match both the date and opponent mentioned in the claim.\n\nStarting from Row 1:\n- Week 1, September 8, 1963 vs Buffalo Bills \u2013 Doesn't match the date or opponent.\nRow 2: Week 2, September 14, 1963 vs Boston Patriots \u2013 No match.\nRow 3: Week 3, September 29, 1963 vs Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 Not a match.\nRow 4: Week 4, October 6, 1963 vs Denver Broncos \u2013 Close date but not October 27 and opponent is wrong.\nRow 5: Week 5, October 13, 1963 vs New York Jets \u2013 Opponent doesn't match.\nRow 6: Week 6, October 20, 1963 vs Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 Not matching.\nRow 7: Week 7, October 27, 1963 vs Oakland Raiders \u2013 Date matches, but opponent is not Houston Oilers. So this row isn't the one we're looking for.\nRow 8: Week 8, November 2, 1963 vs New York Jets \u2013 Doesn't match either criteria.\nRow 9: Week 9, November 10, 1963 vs Boston Patriots \u2013 No match.\nRow 10: Week 10, November 17, 1963 vs Buffalo Bills \u2013 Not relevant.\nRow 11: Week 11, December 1, 1963 vs Houston Oilers \u2013 Here we go! The date is December 1, which doesn't match October 27, but the opponent is Houston Oilers. So while it's against the Oilers, the date isn't correct.\nRow 12: Week 12, December 8, 1963 vs Oakland Raiders \u2013 Doesn't match either.\nRow 13: Week 13, December 15, 1963 vs Houston Oilers \u2013 Opponent matches but date is December 15, not October 27.\nRow 14: Week 14, December 22, 1963 vs Denver Broncos \u2013 No match.\n\nSo after scanning all rows, I notice that the only game against Houston Oilers is in weeks 11 and 13. Both of these have dates in December, which doesn't align with October 27. Therefore, there's no row where both the date is October 27 and the opponent is Houston Oilers.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check. Looking at Row 7 again: Week 7 on October 27 against Oakland Raiders. That's correct; not Houston Oilers. And the other Oilers games are in November and December, so no match for October 27.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by any row in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
