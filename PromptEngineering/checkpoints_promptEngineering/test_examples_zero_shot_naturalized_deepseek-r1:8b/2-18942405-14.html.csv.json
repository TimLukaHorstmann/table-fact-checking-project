    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the Andrean Fighting '59ers' enrollment is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying: \"the andrean fighting '59ers have an enrollment of 587.\" So I'm looking for the enrollment number for the school named Andrean with the mascot Fighting '59ers.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school. Let me check each row one by one to find the relevant information.\n\nRow 1: School is Andrean, location Merrillville, mascot Fighting '59ers, enrollment 587. So here, all the details match what the claim states. The school name is Andrean, the mascot is Fighting '59ers, and the enrollment is 587. That seems to fully support the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other row that could also have the same or different information. Let me check Row 2: Griffith with Panthers, enrollment 925. Not matching. Row 3: Highland with Trojans, enrollment 1175. No match. Row 4: Hobart with Brickies, enrollment 1268. Nope. Row 5: Kankakee Valley with Kougars, enrollment 1087. Still no. Row 6: Lowell with Red Devils, 1276. Not it. Row 7: Munster with Mustangs, 1616. That's different.\n\nSo only Row 1 matches the school name, mascot, and the specific enrollment number mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the Andrean Fighting '59ers' row in the table, which shows an enrollment of 587.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
