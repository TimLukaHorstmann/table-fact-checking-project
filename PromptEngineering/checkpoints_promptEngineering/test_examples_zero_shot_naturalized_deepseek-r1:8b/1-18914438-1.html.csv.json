The claim says: \"Graham McKenzie played in 60 matches in his career, from 1961 to 1971.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for the row corresponding to Graham McKenzie in the table. Scanning through the rows, I see that Row 8 is named Graham McKenzie. So his data is in Row 8.\n\nNext, I need to check each piece of information in the claim against the relevant cells in the table. The claim has two main parts: the number of matches and the career years.\n\nStarting with the number of matches, the claim states he played 60 matches. Looking at Row 8, under \"matches,\" it says 60. So that part checks out.\n\nThen, checking the career years, the claim mentions from 1961 to 1971. In Row 8, under \"career,\" it's listed as 1961 - 1971. That also matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim about Brett Lee is true based on the given table. The claim says: \"Brett Lee have a best score of 5 / 30 , with 547 maiden in 2755.1 over.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify which columns and rows are relevant here. Looking at the table structure, each row represents a different cricketer with various stats.\n\nI'll start by looking for Brett Lee's row. Scanning through the names: shane warne, glenn mcgrath, dennis lillee, brett lee, etc. There it is\u2014row 4. So that's row_index 4.\n\nNext, I need to check which columns are mentioned in the claim. The key points are \"best score of 5 / 30,\" \"547 maiden,\" and \"2755.1 over.\" \n\nFrom the table headers, the relevant columns seem to be:\n- best: This is a column that shows the best bowling performance.\n- maidens: This would correspond to the number of maiden overs.\n- overs: The total overs bowled.\n\nLooking at row 4 for Brett Lee, let's check these columns. \n\nFor \"best,\" it says 5 / 30. In the table, under row 4 (Brett Lee), the best column is listed as \"5 / 30.\" That matches exactly. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim mentions 547 maiden overs. In the table, the maidens column for Brett Lee shows 547. That's correct too.\n\nThe last part is about 2755.1 over. Looking at the overs column in row 4, it indeed says 2755.1. So that matches as well.\n\nTherefore, all three aspects of the claim are supported by the data in the table. There's no discrepancy or missing information. Each relevant cell aligns with what the claim states.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Brett Lee, I need to check if his best score, maiden overs, and total overs match the given data.\n\n1. **Best Score Check**: The table shows Brett Lee's best as \"5 / 30,\" which matches the claim.\n2. **Maidens Check**: His maidens are listed as 547 in the table, aligning with the claim.\n3. **Overs Check**: The total overs bowled by Brett Lee are 2755.1, as stated in the table.\n\nSince all elements of the claim are accurately reflected in the data, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"best\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"maidens\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim about Glenn McGrath participating in 4874.4 overs during his cricket career is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"glenn mcgrath participate in 4874.4 over during the course of his cricket career.\" The key here is to verify if Glenn McGrath's total overs in his career match exactly 4874.4 as stated in the claim.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different cricketer, and their statistics are listed under various columns like matches, overs, maidens, etc. My goal is to find the relevant cells that could verify this claim.\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to Glenn McGrath. Scanning through the names in rows 1 to 13, I see Row 2 has the name \"glenn mcgrath.\" That's the correct row.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'overs' column for Row 2 because the claim mentions 4874.4 overs. According to the table, Row 2's 'overs' is listed as 4874.4. So this seems to match exactly.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure there are no typos or formatting issues in the table that might cause confusion. The number is written as 4874.4 with a decimal point, which makes sense because overs can be fractional. So, if the claim says \"4874.4 over,\" and Row 2 has exactly that number, then it's correct.\n\nI also need to consider any other possible rows that might have similar data, but since Glenn McGrath is only in Row 2, I don't need to check others. However, I should double-check the spelling of his name to ensure there are no variations, like \"glenn\" versus \"glen\" or something else. In this case, it's spelled correctly as \"glenn mcgrath.\"\n\nNow, considering all this, the claim is directly supported by Row 2's 'overs' column having the exact value mentioned. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells would be from Row 2, specifically the 'overs' column.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim about Glenn McGrath participating in 4874.4 overs during his career, we need to check the 'overs' column for his row.\n\n1. **Identify the correct row**: The second row corresponds to \"glenn mcgrath.\"\n2. **Check the 'overs' value**: This row has \"4874.4\" overs, which matches the claim exactly.\n3. **Conclusion**: The information provided supports the claim accurately.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the best score of 7 / 83 be for the career year of 1971 - 1984.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. The claim mentions two things: \n1. The best score is 7 / 83.\n2. This best score occurred during the career years of 1971 to 1984.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: name, career, matches, overs, maidens, runs, wickets, average, best, 5w, and 10w. The 'best' column seems to refer to the highest score in an innings or series, I assume. \n\nI need to check if any player whose best score is 7/83 had their career spanning from 1971 to 1984.\n\nStarting with row 3: Dennis Lillee. His career is from 1971-1984, and his best score is listed as 7 /83. That matches the claim exactly. So this cell (row 3, column 'best') directly supports the claim.\n\nNo other rows have a best score of 7/83. For example, checking row 9: Ray Lindwall's best is 7/38, and others don't have 7/83 either. \n\nSo, only Dennis Lillee in row 3 has the best score of 7/83 during his career from 1971-1984.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from Dennis Lillee's career as listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"best\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 8 has name: graham mckenzie with career: 1961 - 1971. So that's the one.\n\nNext, check the average for this player. The average is listed as 29.79. Now, the claim says the average should be less than 26. Since 29.79 is higher than 26, does this mean the claim is false?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me double-check. The claim states two things: career duration from 1961-1971 with 60 matches and an average less than 26.\n\nGraham McKenzie's row meets the first part: career from 1961-1971 and 60 matches.

The claim says: \"the person with the career 1946 - 1960 be in 61 match and have 2727.2 over and 6704 run.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n\n1. Career: 1946 - 1960\n2. Matches: 61\n3. Overs: 2727.2\n4. Runs: 6704\n\nNow, I need to look through each row of the table to find a match for all these conditions.\n\nStarting with Row 1, the career is 1992-2007, which doesn't fit. Moving on to Row 2 (Glenn McGrath) \u2013 career is 1993-2007, nope. Row 3: Dennis Lillee, 1971-1984. Not matching.\n\nRow 4: Brett Lee, 1999-2010. No. Row5: Craig McDermott, 1984-1996. Not it. Row6: Jason Gillespie, 1996-2006. Nope. Row7: Richie Benaud, career is 1952-1964. Close but not 1946-1960.\n\nRow8: Graham McKenzie, 1961-1971. Doesn't match the start year. Row9: Ray Lindwall, 1946-1960. Career matches the first part of the claim. Now check matches: 61. Looking at his row, yes, it's 61 matches.\n\nNext, overs: 2727.2. Ray Lindwall has 1970.2 overs. Wait, that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check. The claim says 2727.2, but Ray has 1970.2. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant the person with career 1952-1964? Because Row7 (Richie Benaud) has 63 matches and overs of 2727.2. Let me check:\n\nRichie Benaud: Career is 1952-1964, which doesn't match the claim's 1946-1960. So even if his overs and runs fit, his career doesn't.\n\nWait, but Ray Lindwall's career is 1946-1960, matches are 61, but his overs are 1970.2, not 2727.2. So both conditions don't align for any one person.\n\nBut wait, the claim might be referring to another player. Let me check all rows again.\n\nLooking at Row9: Ray Lindwall has career 1946-1960, matches=61, overs=1970.2, runs=5251.\n\nRow7: Richie Benaud has career 1952-1964, matches=63, overs=2727.2, runs=6704.\n\nSo the claim is saying that a player with career 1946-1960, 61 matches, 2727.2 overs, and 6704 runs exists. But looking at the table:\n\n- Ray Lindwall has career 1946-1960, 61 matches, but his overs are 1970.2 (not 2727.2) and runs=5251 (not 6704).\n- Richie Benaud has 63 matches, which doesn't match the claim's 61.\n- No other player in the table fits all four conditions: career from 1946-1960, 61 matches, overs 2727.2, runs 6704.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake with Ray Lindwall's overs? Let me check again. His row says \"overs\": 1970.2, not 2727.2. So that doesn't match. Richie Benaud has the right overs and runs, but his career is 1952-1964 and matches are 63, which don't fit.\n\nSo there's no one in the table who has all four attributes: career 1946-1960, 61 matches, 2727.2 overs, 6704 runs.

The columns include name, career span (years), matches played, overs bowled, maidens, runs scored, wickets taken, average, best bowling figures, five-wicket hauls, and ten-wicket hauls.\n\nThe key points in the claim are:\n1. There is a person with the highest average.\n2. That person has 44 matches.\n\nSo I need to find who has the highest average in the table and check if that person's matches are 44.\n\nLooking at the 'average' column, I can see each player's average. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Shane Warne: 25.42\n2. Glenn McGrath: 21.64\n3. Dennis Lillee: 23.92\n4. Brett Lee: 30.82\n5. Craig Mcdermott: 28.63\n6. Jason Gillespie: 26.14\n7.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim given is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's start by carefully reading the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the person who be in the second highest number of match have 17995 run and 708 wicket.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this sentence to understand what it's asking. It seems like there are two main points here:\n\n1. The person referred to has the second highest number of matches.\n2. This same person has 17,995 runs and 708 wickets.\n\nSo, I need to find in the table which player(s) have 17,995 runs and 708 wickets and then check if any of them are in the second position for the highest number of matches.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different cricketer with various statistics. The columns provided are: name, career, matches, overs, maidens, runs, wickets, average, best, 5w (five-wicket hauls), and 10w (ten-wicket hauls).\n\nFirst, I'll look for the player who has 17,995 runs and 708 wickets.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Shane Warne - runs are 17,995. Wickets are 708. So that's exactly the numbers mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow, we need to check if this person is in the second highest number of matches. So, I should find out who has the highest and second highest number of matches and see where Shane Warne stands.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 145 matches\nRow 2: 124\nRow 3: 70\nRow 4: 76\nRow 5: 71\nRow 6: 71\nRow 7: 63\nRow 8: 60\nRow 9: 61\nRow 10: 37\nRow 11: 53\nRow 12: 44\nRow 13: 50\n\nThe highest number of matches is Row 1 with 145. The next highest would be the closest lower number, which is either 124 (Row 2) or 76 (Row 4), depending on how it's ranked.\n\nWait, but in this context, \"second highest\" could mean the second position when ordered from most to least. So let's list them in order:\n\n145 (Shane Warne), 124 (Glenn McGrath), 76 (Brett Lee), 71 (Craig McDermott and Jason Gillespie), 63 (Richie Benaud), 61 (Ray Lindwall), 60 (Graham McKenzie), 53 (Merv Hughes), 50 (Mitchell Johnson), 44 (Stuart MacGill), 37 (Clarrie Grimmett).\n\nSo the order is clear. The top two are Shane Warne with 145 and Glenn McGrath with 124.\n\nTherefore, the second highest number of matches would be Glenn McGrath with 124.\n\nBut the claim says that \"the person who be in the second highest number of match\" has those run and wicket numbers. So if we take \"second highest\" as the player with the second most matches, which is Glenn McGrath, but he doesn't have 17,995 runs or 708 wickets. His runs are 12,186 and wickets 563.\n\nOn the other hand, Shane Warne, who has the highest number of matches (145), does have those specific run and wicket numbers. So if the claim is saying that the second-highest in terms of matches has these stats, it's incorrect because it's actually the highest, not the second. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting \"second highest\" correctly. The claim says \"the person who be in the second highest number of match.\" So perhaps it's about being the second among those with the most matches. But Shane Warne is first, so no one else has 145, making him unique.\n\nTherefore, if the claim refers to someone else having the second highest, but that person doesn't have those specific stats, then the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that the person with the second-highest matches also has these stats. But since the person with the second-highest (Glenn McGrath) doesn't have them, it's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase: The claim says \"the person who is in the second highest number of matches\" has 17995 runs and 708 wickets.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Shane Warne (145 matches, 17,995 runs, 708 wickets)\n- Glenn McGrath (124 matches, 12,186 runs, 563 wickets)\n\nSo, Shane is first, Glenn is second. The claim says that the person in second place has these stats. But Glenn doesn't have those stats. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim meant the person with the highest number of matches, then it's correct because that's Shane Warne. But since it specifically mentions \"second highest,\" which refers to Glenn McGrath, and his stats don't match, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the claim is saying that the second-highest in terms of some other metric, not matches? Or perhaps it's a translation issue because the original might have been differently phrased.\n\nBut as per the given instruction, the relevant cells are where the person with the second highest number of matches has 17995 runs and 708 wickets. Since the person with the second highest is Glenn McGrath, who doesn't have those numbers, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the person with the second highest number of matches has 17,995 runs and 708 wickets. After examining the table, it's clear that Shane Warne, who has the highest number of matches (145), holds these specific stats. The second-highest in matches is Glenn McGrath, but he doesn't have those numbers.
