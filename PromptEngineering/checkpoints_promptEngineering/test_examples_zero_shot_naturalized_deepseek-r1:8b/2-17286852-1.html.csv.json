    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"in stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is saying. It's stating that in Stanley, there's a bridge made using the concrete deck girder style. To verify this, I should look for any entries in the table related to Stanley and check their types.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a different bridge. Let me scan through the 'location' column specifically for rows where the location is \"stanley\". \n\nI go down each row:\n\n- Row 1: location finley\n- Row 2: caledonia\n- Row 3: haynes\n- Row 4: lisbon\n- Row 5: crystal\n- Row 6: minot\n- Row 7: towner\n- Row 8: cartwright\n- Row 9: grace city\n- Row 10: stanley\n\nOkay, so row 10 is the one in Stanley. Now I need to check what type of bridge it is. The 'type' column for this row says \"concrete deck girder bridge.\" \n\nThat matches exactly with the claim which mentions \"concrete deck girder style.\" So, the information provided in the table supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"in colton 's cross the bridge be a pratt through truss bridge.\" \n\nFirst, I should look for any rows in the table that mention \"Colton's Crossing Bridge\". Scanning through the rows, I see Row 4: name: colton 's crossing bridge. That's exactly what the claim refers to.\n\nNext, I need to check the type of this bridge. In Row 4, under the 'type' column, it says \"pratt through truss.\" So that matches the claim stating it's a pratt through truss bridge.\n\nWait, but looking at the table more carefully, I notice that some bridges have additional notes about their status. For example, Row 26 and others mention \"removed\" on specific dates. But in this case, Row 4 doesn't mention being removed or anything else; it's just listed as pratt through truss. So that shouldn't affect the claim.\n\nTherefore, since there is a bridge named \"Colton 's crossing bridge\" of type \"pratt through truss,\" the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"the westgaard bridge be in the style of a pratt pony through truss bridge.\"\n\nFirst, I should locate the Westgaard Bridge in the table. Let me scan each row's name until I find it. Looking at the rows, I see Row 25 has the name \"westgaard bridge.\" That's the one we're interested in.\n\nNext, I need to check what type of bridge the Westgaard Bridge is. In the 'type' column for Row 25, it says \"pratt pony through truss bridge.\" So that matches the style mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything else. The claim only specifies the type of bridge, so I don't need to check other columns like location or listed date. Also, there's no indication that the bridge has been removed or is closed, which might affect its status. The relevant information here is solely in the 'type' column.\n\nSo, putting it together: Westgaard Bridge is indeed a pratt pony through truss bridge as per the table. Therefore, the claim should be true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"nesheim bridge be in mcville\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me carefully go through each step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the specific row in the table where the name is \"nesheim bridge\". Scanning through the rows, I find it at Row 15. The details for this bridge are listed as follows: it was listed on 1997-02-27, located in mcville, county of nelson, and it's a pratt through truss type.\n\nSo, the name is \"nesheim bridge\", location is mcville, which matches exactly with the claim. There doesn't seem to be any conflicting information or removal dates that would affect this particular entry. It looks like all the relevant data about nesheim bridge is correctly listed in Row 15 of the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out because \"nesheim bridge\" is indeed located in mcville as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Cooperstown having a Pratt through truss type bridge. To verify this, I should look for any bridges listed that are in Cooperstown and of type Pratt through truss.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll go row by row to find entries where the location is Cooperstown.\n\nRow 20: name: romness bridge, listed: 1997 - 02 - 27, location: cooperstown, county: griggs, type: pratt through truss. This seems relevant because it's in Cooperstown and is a Pratt through truss bridge.\n\nI should check if there are any other bridges in Cooperstown. Scanning the rest of the rows, I don't see another entry with Cooperstown as the location. So, row 20 is the only one that matches both the location and the type specified in the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that row 26 mentions the Blanchard bridge being removed in 2009, but it's still located in Blanchard, not Cooperstown. Similarly, other bridges are either removed or in different locations. So, no other entries in Cooperstown besides the romness bridge exist in the table.\n\nTherefore, since there is a Pratt through truss bridge in Cooperstown as listed in row 20, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge,\" we check for entries with location \"cooperstown\" and type \"pratt through truss.\" The romness bridge (row 20) fits both criteria. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"cooper town be famous for the blanchard bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the name \"cooper town\" is mentioned. Looking at the table, I should check if there's a location named \"cooper town.\" Scanning through the 'location' column: row 20 has \"cooperstown,\" which is pretty close to \"cooper town.\" Maybe it's a typo or variation in spelling. So, Cooper Town might refer to Cooperstown.\n\nNext, the claim says that Cooper Town is famous for the Blanchard Bridge. I need to look into the table for any bridges associated with Blanchard. Looking at row 26, there's a \"blanchard bridge\" listed as being removed on March 25, 2009. The location is Blanchard in Traill County. So, the bridge exists but was later removed.\n\nNow, I need to see if Blanchard Bridge is significant enough for Cooper Town (Cooperstown) to be famous for it. The table shows that the Blanchard Bridge was removed in 2009, which might indicate that it's notable enough to have been listed and then removed, suggesting it was a significant structure.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the other bridges in the table, many were built around 1997-02-27 or later, but the Blanchard Bridge is specifically mentioned as being removed. This could imply that it was a well-known bridge before its removal.\n\nSo, putting this together: There's a Blanchard Bridge in Blanchard (a town close to Cooperstown) that was significant enough to be famous, at least in the local context, even if it was later removed. Therefore, it makes sense that Cooper Town, or Cooperstown, would be associated with the Blanchard Bridge as something notable.\n\nI should also consider any other possible bridges related to Cooper Town, but from the table, only row 20 is near Cooperstown, and that's the Romness Bridge. However, since the claim specifically mentions the Blanchard Bridge, which is in a place considered part of Cooper Town, it seems relevant.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"mcville have goose river bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the components of the claim. It mentions two things: \n1. \"mcville\" having a goose river bridge.\n2. This bridge is currently under construction because of a structural issue.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to see if there's a bridge named the \"goose river bridge\" located in McVille. \n\nGoing through the table, I notice that Row 26 mentions the Blanchard Bridge and says it was removed on March 25, 2009. But there's no mention of a goose river bridge in McVille. However, in Row 27, the Goose River Bridge is listed as being removed on March 25, 2009, but its location is Hillsboro, not McVille.\n\nWait, so there's no goose river bridge in McVille according to the table. The claim states that \"mcville have goose river bridge,\" which seems incorrect because the table doesn't list a Goose River Bridge in McVille. So based on this, part of the claim is false.\n\nNow, regarding the second part: whether it's under construction due to structural issues. Looking at Row 27, the Goose River Bridge was removed in 2009, so it's not currently under construction anymore\u2014it\u2019s gone. There's no indication that it's still under construction now or ever because of structural issues after its removal.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold up against the table data. The first part is incorrect because there's no Goose River Bridge in McVille, and the second part is false because the bridge was removed years ago.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the grace city bridge be a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the name is \"grace city bridge\". Scanning through the rows, I find Row 9: name: grace city bridge. So that's row index 8 (since it starts from 0). Now, I check the location and type columns.\n\nIn Row 9, the location is \"grace city\", county is \"foster\". The type is \"pratt through truss.\" The claim mentions the location as \"stanley,\" which doesn't match.

The claim says: \"colton 's crossing bridge be a pratt through truss in adam county.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions two specific pieces of information:\n1. The bridge is called \"colton 's crossing bridge.\"\n2. It is a \"pratt through truss\" type.\n3. The location is in \"adam county.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the exact row that matches these criteria. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Name is \"beaver creek bridge,\" so not relevant.\nRow 2: \"caledonia bridge,\" different name, location Traill County, nope.\nRow 3: \"cedar creek bridge,\" Adams County, but type is pratt through truss. Hmm, that's in Adams, but the claim says Adam County. Wait, \"adam\" vs \"adams\"\u2014they might be different counties. I need to check if there's an Adams or Adam county.\n\nWait, looking at Row 4: name \"colton 's crossing bridge,\" listed on 1997-02-27, location Lisbon, county Ransom, type pratt through truss. So this matches the bridge name and type but in Ransom County. The claim says Adam County, so that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, is there another row with \"colton 's crossing bridge\"? Let me check again. Row 4 is the only one listed as \"colton 's crossing bridge.\" So it's in Ransom County, not Adam County.\n\nIs there any other row with \"colton 's crossing bridge\"? No, I don't think so. The name seems unique to Row 4. Therefore, the claim says it's in Adam County, but according to the table, it's actually in Ransom County. So that part is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, the type is pratt through truss as per the table and the claim, which matches.\n\nBut since the location doesn't match (Ransom vs Adam), the overall claim is FALSE because the county is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"county\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

From the table, the type is pratt pony through truss, which matches part of the claim. However, the county listed is Mchenry, not Traill.
