    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Wells Fargo Center (19684) be the location and attendance total from the game on December 1.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at each part of the claim. It mentions two things: the location is Wells Fargo Center with the number 19684, and the attendance for that specific game.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where \"game\" is 26 and \"december\" is 1 because December 1 is when the game in question took place. \n\nIn Row 1: \n- Game: 26\n- December: 1\n- Opponent: Boston Bruins\n- Score: 0 - 3\n- Location/Attendance: Wells Fargo Center (19684)\n- Record: 15 - 7 - 4\n- Points: 34\n\nSo, the location is indeed Wells Fargo Center with the number 19684. Now, I need to check if the attendance matches. The table shows \"location / attendance\" as part of each row, so for Row 1, the attendance is 19684.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by Row 1's data: location and attendance. There's no contradiction or missing information here.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table confirms that on December 1, the game was held at Wells Fargo Center with an attendance of 19,684.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"game 32 have the highest number of points, which be 45.\" \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to find where game 32 is located. Each row has a 'game' column, so I'll check each one until I find game 32.\n\nLooking at Row 1: game 26\nRow 2: game 27\n...\nWait, let me count properly. The first few rows are games 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Oh, so row 7 is game 32. That's the relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check the 'points' column for game 32. From the table, row 7 has points:45.\n\nNow, I should confirm if this is the highest in the entire table. So I'll look at all other rows to see if any have higher than 45 points. Let's scan through each row:\n\nRow 1:34\nRow2:36\nRow3:38\nRow4:39\nRow5:41\nRow6:43\nRow7:45\nRow8:47\nRow9:49\nRow10:49\nRow11:49\nRow12:51\n\nWait, row 12 has points:51. That's higher than 45. So game 32 isn't the highest; game 37 has 51 points.\n\nSo the claim that game 32 has the highest points is FALSE because another game (game 37) has more points.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"points\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then determine which cells in the table support that conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim: \"December 4th be the date of the game that have a location and attendance of well fargo center (19684).\" \n\nWait, I think there might be a typo. The user wrote \"well fargo\" but in the table it's spelled as \"wells fargo center\". So the correct name is Wells Fargo Center with the specific attendance number 19684.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a game. Each row has several pieces of information: game number, date (December X), opponent, score, location/attendance, record, and points.\n\nThe claim says that December 4th is the date when there was a game with the location and attendance specified as Wells Fargo Center with 19684. So I need to check if any row has the date December 4th, location \"Wells Fargo Center (19684)\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Dec 1 vs Boston Bruins at Wells Fargo Center (19684). That's close, but it's Dec 1, not 4.\nRow 2: Dec 4 vs New Jersey Devils. Let's check the location and attendance. The opponent is NJ Devils, score is 5-3. Location is Wells Fargo Center with attendance 19657. Hmm, the attendance number is different from what the claim says (19684). So even though the date is Dec 4, the attendance doesn't match.\nRow 3: Dec 5 vs NY Islanders at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Not relevant.\nRow 4: Dec 8 vs San Jose Sharks at Wells Fargo Center with 19801. Attendance doesn't match.\nRow 5: Dec 9 vs Toronto Maple Leafs at Air Canada Centre.\nRow 6: Dec 11 vs Boston Bruins in OT at TD Garden.\nRow 7: Dec 14 vs Pittsburgh Penguins at Wells Fargo with 19824.\nRow 8: Dec 15 vs Montreal Canadiens at Bell Centre.\nRow 9: Dec 18 vs NY Rangers at Wells Fargo with 19898.\nRow 10: Dec 20 vs Florida Panthers at Wells Fargo with 19864.\nRow 11: Dec 28 vs Vancouver Canucks at Rogers Arena.\nRow 12: Dec 30 vs LA Kings at Staples Center.\n\nSo, looking for December 4th. Only Row 2 has the date as December 4. Now, check location and attendance in that row. The location is Wells Fargo Center with attendance 19657. But the claim says attendance should be 19684.\n\nTherefore, the game on Dec 4 does have the correct location but not the specific attendance number mentioned. So the claim's statement about both date, location, and attendance isn't fully supported for any row except maybe if there's a typo in the table. Wait, let me double-check Row 2 again: opponent is New Jersey Devils, score 5-3, location Wells Fargo Center (19657). So attendance is indeed different from 19684.\n\nWait, are there multiple games at Wells Fargo Center with that specific attendance? Let's check other rows where location is Wells Fargo Center:\n\nRow 1: Dec 1, attendance 19684\nRow 2: Dec 4, attendance 19657\nRow 7: Dec14, attendance 19824\nRow9: Dec18, attendance 19898\nRow10: Dec20, attendance 19864\n\nSo none of them have attendance exactly 19684 except Row1 on Dec1. So no game on Dec4 has both the correct date and the exact attendance number as per the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there's no game on Dec4 with both location Wells Fargo Center (19684) attendance. Only Row2 is on Dec4 but with different attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that December 4th was the date of a game at Wells Fargo Center (19684). Upon reviewing the table, the only game on Dec 4 is against the New Jersey Devils, but its attendance was 19,657, not 19,684. Therefore, no such game exists as described in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location / attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
