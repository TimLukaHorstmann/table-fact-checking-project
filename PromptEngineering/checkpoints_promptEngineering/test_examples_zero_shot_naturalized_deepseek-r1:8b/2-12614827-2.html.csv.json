    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Rob Emerson having the highest win record of 13-10 in his MMA career is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"rob emerson have the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his mma career.\" The key points here are that Rob Emerson's win record is 13-10 and it's the highest.\n\nNow, I need to check each row in the table to see if any match Rob Emerson with a 13-10 win record. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It mentions \"jared downing\" as the opponent, so not Rob Emerson. The record here is 13-10 (1), but since the opponent isn't Emerson, this might be someone else's record.\n\nRow 2: Opponent is Savant Young; not Emerson. Record is 12-10, which is less than 13-10.\n\nRow 3: Opponent Justin Salas, loss with a different record. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Eric Reynolds, win, but record is 11-9. Not matching.\n\nRow 5: Rodney Rhoden, 10-9, not 13-10.\n\nRow 6: Nik Lentz, loss, but the record is 9-9.\n\nRow 7: Philippe Nover, 9-8, not 13-10.\n\nRow 8: Rafael dos Anjos, loss, record 8-8.\n\nRow 9: Kurt Pellegrino, loss, 8-7.\n\nRow 10: Manny Gamburyan, 8-6. No match.\n\nRow 11: Keita Nakamura, 7-6.\n\nRow 12: Gray Maynard, NC, so not a win/loss record.\n\nRow 13: Kenji Arai, 6-6.\n\nRow 14: Takafumi Ito, 5-6.\n\nRow 15: Jamie Schmidt, 4-6.\n\nRow 16: Julian Samaniego, 3-6.\n\nRow 17: Melvin Guillard, loss with record 2-6.\n\nRow 18: Randy Velarde, 2-5.\n\nRow 19: Joe Camacho, win but 2-4.\n\nRow 20: Justin Berkley, 1-4.\n\nRow 21: Dokonjonosuke Mishima, 0-4.\n\nRow 22: Javier Vazquez, 0-3.\n\nRow 23: Jamal Perkins, 0-2.\n\nRow 24: Jens Pulver, loss with 0-1.\n\nWait a minute, in Row 1, the record is 13-10 (1). So that's a win record of 13 wins and 10 losses. But who is that? The opponent is Jared Downing, so it's not Rob Emerson. It might be someone else with that record.\n\nSo, from the table, there's no row where Rob Emerson has a 13-10 record. Therefore, the claim that Rob Emerson has the highest win record of 13-10 isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if Rob Emerson has a 13-10 win record, I checked each row for \"Rob Emerson\" and compared his records. None matched 13-10.\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Key Points:** The claim states Rob Emerson's MMA record is 13-10.\n2. **Search the Table:** Look for rows where the opponent is Rob Emerson and check their win/loss records.\n3. **Find Relevant Rows:** No row lists Rob Emerson with a 13-10 record; Row 1 shows another fighter with this record.\n4. **Conclusion:** Since no data supports Rob Emerson having a 13-10 record, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"there be only 1 ko (punches) method for win by rob emerson\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions a specific fighter named Rob Emerson and specifies that he has only one knockout victory via punches in his fight record. So I need to look through each row of the table to see if Rob Emerson has exactly one KO (punches) win.\n\nLooking at the \"opponent\" column first might help identify which rows involve Rob Emerson. Scanning each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Jared Downing\nRow 2: Opponent is Savant Young\nRow 3: Opponent is Justin Salas\nRow 4: Opponent is Eric Reynolds\nRow 5: Opponent is Rodney Rhoden\nRow 6: Opponent is Nik Lentz\nRow 7: Opponent is Phillipe Nover\nRow 8: Opponent is Rafael dos Anjos\nRow 9: Opponent is Kurt Pellegrino\nRow 10: Opponent is Manny Gamburyan\nRow 11: Opponent is Keita Nakamura\nRow 12: Opponent is Gray Maynard\nRow 13: Opponent is Kenji Arai\nRow 14: Opponent is Takafumi Ito\nRow 15: Opponent is Jamie Schmidt\nRow 16: Opponent is Julian Samaniego\nRow 17: Opponent is Melvin Guillard\nRow 18: Opponent is Randy Velarde\nRow 19: Opponent is Joe Camacho\nRow 20: Opponent is Justin Berkley\nRow 21: Opponent is Dokonjonosuke Mishima\nRow 22: Opponent is Javier Vazquez\nRow 23: Opponent is Jamal Perkins\nRow 24: Opponent is Jens Pulver\n\nI don't see \"Rob Emerson\" listed as an opponent in any row. That means Rob Emerson isn't present in this table, so there's no data to verify whether he has one KO or not. Therefore, the claim can't be fully supported because there are no relevant rows about him.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check if \"Rob Emerson\" is indeed not in the opponents list. Scanning again: No, he isn't listed. So without any row where he's involved, we don't have information to confirm or deny the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Rob Emerson having one KO victory via punches, but there are no rows with his name as the opponent. Thus, insufficient data exists to support or contradict the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"match against Eric Reynolds be 1 of the 4 matches to have decision (split) method.\" \n\nFirst, I should check each row in the table for a match involving Eric Reynolds where the method was a split decision.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 4: res: win, record: 11 - 9 (1), opponent: Eric Reynolds, method: decision (split), event: art of fighting 10. So this is a win, but the method is split decision. \n\nWait, does that mean it's one of the four matches with split decisions? The claim says \"match against Eric Reynolds be 1 of the 4 match to have decision (split) method.\" So I need to see if there are three other matches where the method was split decision involving Eric Reynolds.\n\nBut looking at the table, Eric Reynolds is only in row 4. None of the other rows mention him again. So maybe that's the only one? But the claim says \"1 of the 4,\" implying there are four such matches. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim doesn't specify if it's exactly four or at least four. If it's exactly four, then Eric Reynolds needs to have three more split decision wins. But from the table, he only has row 4 as a split decision win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"match\" refers to any match where the method was split decision, regardless of the opponent. Wait no, the claim specifies \"match against Eric Reynolds,\" so it's specifically about his matches.\n\nSo in that case, since only row 4 involves Eric Reynolds with a split decision method, the claim that this is one of four such matches would be FALSE because there's only one match involving him with that method.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. I need to see if any other matches against Eric Reynolds have split decisions. Looking through all rows, row 4 is the only one where he is the opponent and the method is split decision.\n\nSo the claim says it's one of four; since there's only one, the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that there should be four matches involving Eric Reynolds with a split decision. Upon reviewing the table, only row 4 meets this criterion. Since there are not four such matches, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"rob emerson never play at the ufc 87 event\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of Rob Emerson in the table. Scanning through all the rows, I see that Row 10 has a result of 'win' against Manny Gamburyan at UFC 87. The location is Minneapolis, Minnesota. Now, the opponent's name here is Manny Gamburyan, which doesn't seem to be Rob Emerson.\n\nNext, I need to check if there's any event named \"ufc 87\" where Rob Emerson was involved. From the table, only Row 10 mentions UFC 87, and it's between Gamburyan and someone else. There's no Rob Emerson listed in any of the rows for that event or any other related events.\n\nLooking further, I check if there are any other UFC events where Rob Emerson might have fought. The table includes events like Bellator 104, TPF 12, UFC Fight Night: Florian vs Gomi, etc., but none seem to feature Rob Emerson as an opponent. \n\nSince the claim is that Rob Emerson never played at UFC 87, and there's no record of him being part of that event, the statement seems to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether \"rob emerson never play at the ufc 87 event\" is true or false, we check if Rob Emerson fought in UFC 87. \n\n- **Step 1:** Search for any row where the opponent is Rob Emerson and the event is UFC 87.\n- **Step 2:** Review each row and find that none list Rob Emerson as an opponent at UFC 87.\n\nSince there's no data indicating Rob Emerson participated in UFC 87, the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Rob Emerson's lowest win record of 12-9 in his MMA career is true based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It claims that Rob Emerson has a win-loss record of 12 wins and 9 losses in his MMA career. So, my task is to check if there's any row in the table that matches Rob Emerson with this exact record.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight event with details like the result (res), the fighter's record before the fight, the opponent, method of victory/loss, event name, round number, and location. The 'record' column seems to show the fighter's record going into that particular fight. For example, Row 1 shows a record of 13-10 after a win.\n\nI need to find if Rob Emerson is listed in any row with a record of 12-9. So I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: res is win, record before fight is 13-10 (1). Not 12-9.\nRow 2: record 12-10 (1), opponent Savant Young. Close but not 12-9.\nRow 3: loss, record 11-10 (1).\nRow 4: win, record 11-9 (1). Wait, that's a different format\u2014maybe the 'record' is before the fight?\nWait, in Row 2, opponent Savant Young's record is 12-10? Or is it the fighter's record? I'm confused.\n\nWait, looking again, each row starts with \"res: win\" or loss, then \"record: x - y (z)\". The number after 'win' seems to be the fighter's previous record. So for Row 1, Rob Emerson won with a record of 13-10 before the fight. But wait, in the table, is Rob Emerson one of the fighters listed? I don't see his name mentioned anywhere.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim is about Rob Emerson's career, but looking at the table, there's no direct mention of him. So perhaps the data doesn't include him, making the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson is one of the fighters with a 12-9 record somewhere else in the table. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking through all rows, I see that Row 4 shows a win with a record of 11-9 (1). Another row, perhaps? Wait, let me list all the records:\n\nRow 0: Not present as it starts from 1.\nRow 1: 13-10\nRow 2: 12-10\nRow3:11-10\nRow4:11-9\nRow5:12-9? Wait, no, Row5 is not in the table as per the given data. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table goes from row1 to row24. So I need to check each record:\n\nLooking for a fighter with 12 wins and 9 losses before the fight. Let's see:\n\nRow 2: Opponent Savant Young has a record of 12-10? Or is that the fighter's record? The structure is \"record: x - y (z)\", so perhaps the number in parentheses refers to something else, maybe the current standing or another metric.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check if any row shows a fighter with 12 wins and 9 losses before the fight. So looking for \"12-9\" in the 'record' column.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow1:13-10\nRow2:12-10\nRow3:11-10\nRow4:11-9\nRow5: Not provided.\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the table is from Row 1 to Row24. Let me list all 'record' entries:\n\nRow1:13-10\nRow2:12-10\nRow3:11-10\nRow4:11-9\nRow5: Not in data.\n...\nLooking through all rows, I don't see a \"12-9\" record mentioned anywhere.\n\nWait, perhaps Rob Emerson isn't even in the table. The table lists various fighters like Rob Emerson? Wait no, looking at the table's content, it seems to list different opponents but not Rob Emerson specifically.\n\nSo if Rob Emerson isn't listed in any row, then he doesn't have a 12-9 record here. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The 'record' column for each row shows the fighter's record before the fight. So if Rob Emerson had a 12-9 record in any of his fights, that would be reflected in one of these rows.\n\nBut looking through all rows, I don't see any entry with \"12-9\". The closest is Row4:11-9 and Row2:12-10. So no match for 12-9.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Rob Emerson's record isn't listed as 12-9 in any of his fights according to this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Rob Emerson has a lowest win record of 12-9 in his MMA career is not supported by the provided data. After reviewing each row in the table, there is no entry where Rob Emerson's record before a fight is 12 wins and 9 losses.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim that \"rob emerson have lose a total of 10 match in his career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, I should understand what each column represents in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a fight event, with details like the result (win or loss), the fighter's record before this fight, the opponent's name, method of victory/loss, the event name, round number, and location. The 'res' column indicates whether it was a win or loss for that fighter.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Rob Emerson losing 10 matches in his career. So I need to check how many times Rob Emerson lost according to the table.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Result is Win, so not a loss.\nRow 2: Win, no.\nRow 3: Loss. Opponent Salas, method Decision. Check if it's Rob Emerson. Wait, does Rob Emerson fight here? The opponent in Row 3 is Justin Salas. So this isn't Rob's loss.\nRow 4: Win, not a loss.\nRow 5: Win, nope.\nRow 6: Loss, opponent Nik Lentz. Is the fighter here Rob Emerson? Let me check the row details. The res is Loss, record goes from 9-9 to 8-9. I think this might be Rob Emerson because his name isn't mentioned in opponents so far except maybe others. Wait, no, opponent is Nik Lentz, so not Rob.\nRow 7: Win.\nRow 8: Loss. Opponent Rafael dos Anjos. Again, the fighter's record goes from 8-8 to 8-7. I think this might be Rob Emerson because he's dropping a fight here. But it's not explicitly stated which fighter is losing unless we track each row.\nWait, maybe I should look for rows where 'res' is Loss and see if the fighter's name is Rob Emerson.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\nRow 3: Opponent Justin Salas lost to Rob Emerson? No, because Row 3 says res is Loss, so the fighter here lost. Wait, no\u2014each row is about a fight. So for example, Row 1: res is Win, meaning the fighter in that row won. So if I'm checking for Rob's losses, I need to see when 'res' is Loss and it's his fight.\n\nBut the table doesn't specify which fighter is in each row beyond the result. Wait, actually, perhaps each row is a different event, but without knowing who the fighters are except from the opponents. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the table structure.\n\nWait no, the 'res' column indicates if that fighter won or lost. So for example, Row 1: res Win, so Rob Emerson (if it's his fight) won here. If he lost in another row, that would be a relevant cell.\n\nBut how can I know which rows are about Rob Emerson? The table doesn't explicitly state the fighters; only the opponents and results. So maybe Rob Emerson is not mentioned by name in any of these rows, except as an opponent perhaps?\n\nWait, looking at the claim: \"rob emerson have lose a total of 10 match in his career.\" So the key here is to find all rows where the fighter (Rob Emerson) lost.\n\nBut without knowing which rows are Rob's fights, I can't directly count. However, maybe the table includes all of Rob Emerson's fights, and each 'res' is Loss or Win for him.\n\nWait, perhaps in the table, each row represents a fight involving Rob Emerson, but that seems unlikely because opponents are named as well. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table lists all of Rob Emerson's fights, and each row is his match, with 'res' indicating whether he won or lost. That would make sense if the claim is about him specifically.\n\nBut looking at Row 3: opponent Justin Salas lost? No, res is Loss, so the fighter here lost. If Rob Emerson fought and lost that fight, then it counts towards his losses. Similarly, Row 6: fighter lost to Nik Lentz\u2014could be Rob's loss. Row 8: he lost to Rafael dos Anjos. Then there are other rows where 'res' is Loss.\n\nWait, let me list all the rows where res is Loss and see if that's Rob Emerson:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: res Loss\nRow 6: res Loss\nRow 8: res Loss\nRow 18: res Win (no)\nRow 19: res Win (no)\nRow 20: res Win (no)\nRow 21: res Loss\nRow 22: res Loss\nRow 23: res Loss\nRow 24: res Loss\n\nWait, that's a lot. But I don't know which of these are Rob Emerson's fights.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table only lists Rob Emerson's matches, and each row is his fight with opponents. So if that's the case, the relevant rows would be all where res is Loss.\n\nBut in the given data, it's not clear. The problem states that the task is to verify a claim about Rob Emerson losing 10 matches. So perhaps I need to assume that all rows are his fights, but without explicit information on which fighter he is.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes all the matches from various fighters, and only some of them involve Rob Emerson. But without knowing which ones, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the 'record' column shows how many losses Rob has accumulated over time.\n\nBut I think a better approach is to look for any row where the fighter lost (res: Loss) and the opponent is someone else, indicating that Rob Emerson is the one losing.\n\nAlternatively, if Rob Emerson's name is in the 'opponent' column somewhere, but looking through the opponents:\n\nRow 3 opponent: Justin Salas\nRow 6: Nik Lentz\nRow 8: Rafael dos Anjos\nRow 20: Justen Berkley (no)\nRow 21: Dokonjonosuke Mishima\nRow 22: Javier Vazquez\nRow 23: Jamal Perkins\nRow 24: Jens Pulver\n\nNone of these opponents are named Rob Emerson, so perhaps Rob Emerson is the fighter in each row.\n\nWait, but that can't be because then all the res would indicate his wins and losses. So for example:\n\nIf Rob Emerson fought 24 times, and some resulted in wins, some in losses.\n\nBut how do we know which rows are his fights? Because each row has an opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about Rob Emerson losing 10 matches. So I need to find all the rows where he lost, regardless of who the opponent was.\n\nBut without explicit information on which fighter is in each row, it's impossible unless we assume that each row represents a fight by Rob Emerson.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'opponent' column includes other fighters named Rob, but looking through the opponents:\n\nOpponents are Justin Salas, Nik Lentz, Rafael dos Anjos, Justen Berkley, Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Javier Vazquez, Jamal Perkins, Jens Pulver. No Rob Emerson there.\n\nSo if that's the case, perhaps the table is about various fighters, and we need to see how many times Rob Emerson lost.\n\nBut without any direct mention of him as a fighter, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to count all rows where res is Loss, assuming they are all his fights. That would give 9 losses (rows 3,6,8,21,22,23,24). Wait, that's only 7.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRows with res:Loss:\n\nRow 3\nRow 6\nRow 8\nRow 21\nRow 22\nRow 23\nRow 24\n\nThat's 7 rows. So the claim is he lost 10 times, but in reality, according to this table, he only lost 7 times.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that he didn't lose 10 times, but only 7 times.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure of the table. Maybe each row represents a single event, and 'res' is whether Rob Emerson won or lost. If so, then the number of Losses is equal to the number of rows where res:Loss.\n\nCounting those:\n\nRow3: Loss (1)\nRow6: Loss (2)\nRow8: Loss (3)\nRow21: Loss (4)\nRow22: Loss (5)\nRow23: Loss (6)\nRow24: Loss (7)\n\nSo total 7 losses. Therefore, the claim that he lost 10 times is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, the table has 24 rows. Perhaps not all of them are relevant to Rob Emerson's career.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the data is about all matches in a league or something, and we need to extract how many times Rob Emerson lost.\n\nBut without any additional info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each fight has two participants, and if 'res' is Loss for one fighter, it's a win for the other. So if we're only considering Rob Emerson's losses, regardless of who the opponent was.\n\nBut again, without knowing which rows are his fights, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nI think the key here is to realize that each row represents a fight involving Rob Emerson, and 'res' indicates whether he won or lost. Therefore, all the rows where res is Loss count towards his total losses.\n\nIn that case, the number of Losses would be 7 (from the list above). So if the claim is that he lost 10 times, it's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that in each row, the fighter who lost could be Rob Emerson. Therefore, regardless of who the opponent was, if 'res' is Loss, then Rob Emerson lost once.\n\nBut again, without knowing which rows are his fights, this doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes all fights from all fighters, and we need to count how many times Rob Emerson lost in his career. But since we don't have any data about him specifically, except that he's an opponent in some rows, perhaps the answer is that there isn't enough information to confirm or deny the claim.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the task is to verify the claim, implying that the data provided should suffice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rob Emerson is one of the opponents listed, and each time he lost as an opponent would count towards his total losses. But looking at the opponents:\n\n- Justin Salas: Maybe a fighter who defeated someone.\n- Nik Lentz: Same\n- Rafael dos Anjos: A famous fighter, perhaps.\n- Justen Berkley: Not sure.\n- Dokonjonosuke Mishima: Another name.\n- Javier Vazquez: Spanish name.\n- Jamal Perkins: Maybe another fighter.\n- Jens Pulver: Ring of Fire fighter.\n\nNone of these names are Rob Emerson, so perhaps Rob Emerson isn't listed as an opponent. Therefore, he might not be part of the data set provided.\n\nIn that case, we can't confirm whether he lost 10 times because we don't have his fight record in the table.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense either because the task is to verify the claim based on the data given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each row represents a different event, and 'res' is the result for Rob Emerson in that event. So, for example:\n\nRow3: He lost\nRow6: He lost\nRow8: He lost\nRow21: He lost\nRow22: He lost\nRow23: He lost\nRow24: He lost\n\nThat's 7 losses.\n\nSo if the claim is he lost 10 times, that's incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be no, Rob Emerson did not lose 10 matches; he only lost 7 in the provided data.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because without explicit information about which fighter is in each row, it's possible that Rob Emerson isn't included here. However, given the task, I think we have to assume that all rows are about him or someone else named Rob Emerson.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 'Rob Emerson' is not a real person but a placeholder name, and the table represents fight records for a fictional character or something similar.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, if each row represents a loss by Rob Emerson, then he lost 7 times. Therefore, the claim that he lost 10 times would be false.\n</think>\n\nThe data provided lists several matches where the result is a loss. By examining each row, we can identify the number of losses attributed to Rob Emerson:\n\n1. **Row3**: Loss\n2. **Row6**: Loss\n3. **Row8**: Loss\n4. **Row21**: Loss\n5. **Row22**: Loss\n6. **Row23**: Loss\n7. **Row24**: Loss\n\nThis accounts for a total of 7 losses. Therefore, based on the information given, Rob Emerson did not lose 10 matches; he lost 7 times.\n\n**Answer:** No, Rob Emerson did not lose 10 matches. He lost 7 times according to the provided data.",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the specific instructions. The claim is: \"there be 3 ko method for the win by rob emerson.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's stating that there are three instances where Rob Emerson won a fight using a knockout method (KO). So, my task is to check each row in the table to see if any of them represent Rob Emerson having a KO win.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that each row has several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. The result can be 'win', 'loss', or 'nc' (no contest). The method for a win could be KO, submission, decision, etc.\n\nMy first step is to go through each row and see if any of them have Rob Emerson as the fighter who won via KO. So, I'll need to look at the \"opponent\" column because that's where it would list the opponent's name. If Rob Emerson is the winner, then his name wouldn't be in the opponent column; instead, the opponent's name would be there.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should clarify: The table seems to list each fight with details about who was fighting whom. So, for example, Row 1 says the res is 'win' and the opponent is 'jared downing', which implies that Rob Emerson fought against Jared Downing and won.\n\nBut hold on, the table doesn't explicitly state whose fights these are. It just lists each fight with the result, opponent, method, etc. So, perhaps Rob Emerson isn't even listed in the opponents column. That would mean I need to see if there's any row where 'Rob Emerson' is the winner but not the opponent.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the table seems to list all the fights from various organizations like Bellator, UFC, etc., but without indicating who the fighters are beyond their opponents in each row. So, maybe Rob Emerson isn't listed as an opponent in any of these rows. Therefore, I need to check if there's a way to identify that he is the winner.\n\nHmm, this is tricky because the table only lists the opponent for each fight. It doesn't mention who the other fighter was. So, without knowing who fought whom beyond the opponent, it's hard to determine Rob Emerson's wins directly from the table.\n\nWait, perhaps Rob Emerson isn't even in the table at all. If that's the case, then there are zero KO wins by him here. But I don't know that for sure because the table doesn't specify who is fighting whom beyond the opponent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'opponent' column lists the fighter Rob Emerson fought against, so if his name appears in that column three times with a KO method, then the claim would be true.\n\nBut looking through the opponents listed:\n\nRow 1: opponent - jared downing\nRow 2: opponent - steve bosman\nRow 3: opponent - alex rios\n... and so on, up to Row 24.\n\nI don't see any mention of Rob Emerson as an opponent. So that would imply that either Rob Emerson isn't in the table, or he's not listed because perhaps all these opponents are other fighters who fought against someone else.\n\nWait, but the claim is about Rob Emerson's wins, so if his name is not in the opponent column at all, then there are no KO wins by him in this table. Therefore, the number of KO wins would be zero, not three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe each row represents a fight that Rob Emerson participated in, and the opponent is who he fought against. So if that's the case, looking for rows where 'opponent' is someone else, but without knowing who Rob Emerson is beyond that, it's difficult.\n\nWait, maybe the table includes all the fights involving Rob Emerson. If so, then I need to look for his name in the opponent column as someone he fought and won against via KO three times.\n\nBut looking through the table, I don't see any mention of 'Rob Emerson' as an opponent. Therefore, there are no KO wins by him here, which means the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says: \"rob emerson play at the ufc 87 event 3 time in his career.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions Rob Emerson, a UFC fighter, and an event called UFC 87. Specifically, it's about him playing (fighting) in that event three times in his career.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight event with details like result, record, opponent, method, etc. I'll need to find any rows where the fighter is Rob Emerson and the event is UFC 87.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 10: res: win, record: 8 - 6 (1), opponent: manny gamburyan, method: ko (punches), event: ufc 87, round: 1, location: minneapolis , minnesota , united states.\nHere, the fighter is \"manny gamburyan,\" not Rob Emerson.\n\n- The rest of the rows don't mention UFC 87 either. \n\nWait, I see that Row 10 mentions UFC 87 but with a different fighter. So there's no row where Rob Emerson fought at UFC 87. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because he didn't fight there three times in his career.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"3 time,\" which could mean three times in total for that event. Since I don't see any rows with Rob Emerson and UFC 87, it's likely the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't show Rob Emerson fighting at UFC 87, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds be the only match to have decision method\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify Rob Emerson and Eric Reynolds in the table. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Opponent is Jared Downing.\nRow 2: Opponent is Savant Young.\nRow 3: Opponent is Justin Salas.\nRow 4: Opponent is Eric Reynolds. Here, it's a win for Rob Emerson via Decision (Split).\nRow 5: Opponent is Rodney Rhoden.\nRow 6: Opponent is Nik Lentz.\nRow 7: Opponent is Phillipe Nover.\nRow 8: Opponent is Rafael dos Anjos.\nRow 9: Opponent is Kurt Pellegrino.\nRow 10: Opponent is Manny Gamburyan.\nRow 11: Opponent is Keita Nakamura.\nRow 12: Opponent is Gray Maynard.\nRow 13: Opponent is Kenji Arai.\nRow 14: Opponent is Takafumi Ito.\nRow 15: Opponent is Jamie Schmidt.\nRow 16: Opponent is Julian Samaniego.\nRow 17: Opponent is Melvin Guillard.\nRow 18: Opponent is Randy Velarde.\nRow 19: Opponent is Joe Camacho.\nRow 20: Opponent is Justin Berkley.\nRow 21: Opponent is Dokonjonosuke Mishima.\nRow 22: Opponent is Javier Vazquez.\nRow 23: Opponent is Jamal Perkins.\nRow 24: Opponent is Jens Pulver.\n\nSo, Rob Emerson fought Eric Reynolds in Row 4. The method was Decision (Split), so that's one match with a decision method.\n\nNow, I need to check if there are any other matches where the method was Decision. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 3: Loss via Decision (Unanimous) against Justin Salas.\nRow 4: Win via Decision (Split) against Eric Reynolds.\nRow 7: Win via Decision (Unanimous) against Phillipe Nover.\nRow 8: Loss via Decision (Unanimous) against Rafael dos Anjos.\nRow 12: Loss via Decision (Unanimous) against Gray Maynard.\nRow 19: Win via Decision (Unanimous) against Joe Camacho.\n\nSo, excluding Row 4, there are other matches where the method was Decision. For example, Row 3, 7, 8, 12, and 19 all have Decision methods. Therefore, Rob Emerson's match against Eric Reynolds isn't the only one with a decision method.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there are multiple matches in the table that ended with a decision method.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Method\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Method\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"rob emerson have only win 10 match in his career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that Rob Emerson has won only 10 matches in his career. So, I'm looking for information about how many wins Rob Emerson has in total across all his fights.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with multiple rows, each representing a fight outcome. Each row includes details like 'res' (result), 'record', opponent, method, etc. The key here is to find any row where the fighter is named \"Rob Emerson\" and check the number of wins he has.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: res: win, record: 13-10 (1). Opponent: Jared Downing. No mention of Rob Emerson.\nRow 2: res: win, record: 12-10 (1). Opponent: Savant Young. Not Rob Emerson.\nRow 3: loss. Not relevant.\nRow 4: win, opponent: Eric Reynolds. Not him.\nRow 5: win, opponent: Rodney Rhoden. No.\nRow 6: loss. Not relevant.\nRow 7: win vs. Phillipe Nover. Not Rob.\nRow 8: loss to Rafael dos Anjos. Not Rob.\nRow 9: loss to Kurt Pellegrino. No.\nRow 10: win over Manny Gamburyan. Not him.\nRow 11: win vs. Keita Nakamura. Not Rob.\nRow 12: NC with Gray Maynard. Not relevant.\nRow 13: Win against Kenji Arai. Opponent's name doesn't seem to match.\nRow 14: Win vs. Takafumi Ito. Not Rob.\nRow 15: Win over Jamie Schmidt. Opponent is Jamie, but not Rob.\nRow 16: Win over Julian Samaniego. No.\nRow 17: Loss to Melvin Guillard. Not relevant.\nRow 18: Loss to Randy Velarde. No.\nRow 19: Win vs. Joe Camacho. No.\nRow 20: Win over Justin Berkley. Opponent is Justin, not Rob.\nRow 21: Loss to Dokonjonosuke Mishima. Not relevant.\nRow 22: Loss to Javier Vazquez. No.\nRow 23: Loss to Jamal Perkins. Not relevant.\nRow 24: Loss to Jens Pulver. No.\n\nWait, I'm going through each row and not finding Rob Emerson in the opponent's column. Maybe he's listed as the fighter in some other rows? Or perhaps the table includes more details elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking at the first few columns, there are 'row_index', which seems to be numbered from 0 to 24, but the data is under other columns like 'opponent', 'res', etc. Maybe Rob Emerson is listed as the fighter in some row. But I don't see his name in any of these rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rob Emerson's record isn't shown here, or maybe he's not included in this table at all. If that's the case, then the claim can't be verified from this data.\n\nWait, let me think again. The claim is about Rob Emerson's total wins. So if there are no rows with his name, we don't have information to confirm or deny the claim. Therefore, we can't say for sure whether he has 10 wins or more because his fight record isn't provided in the table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Is Rob Emerson even present in this dataset? Let me check all opponents again. The opponents listed are Jared Downing, Savant Young, Eric Reynolds, Rodney Rhoden, Phillipe Nover, Rafael dos Anjos, Kurt Pellegrino, Manny Gamburyan, Keita Nakamura, Gray Maynard, Kenji Arai, Takafumi Ito, Jamie Schmidt, Julian Samaniego, Melvin Guillard, Randy Velarde, Joe Camacho, Justin Berkley, Dokonjonosuke Mishima, Javier Vazquez, Jamal Perkins, Jens Pulver. None of these names are Rob Emerson.\n\nTherefore, Rob Emerson's fights aren't listed here. So the table doesn't contain any information about his wins or losses. As a result, we can't confirm whether he has 10 wins in his career because there's no data provided on him.\n\nIn conclusion, since there's no relevant data about Rob Emerson in the table, the claim cannot be fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
