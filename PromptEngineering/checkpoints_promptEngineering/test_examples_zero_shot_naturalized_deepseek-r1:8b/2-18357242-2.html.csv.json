    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"Ryan Hunter - Ray and Jimmy Vasser both have fewer than 2 points and grid larger than 4, and be on the American Spirit Team Johansson team.\"\n\nSo I need to verify each part of this statement for both drivers mentioned.\n\nLet's start with Ryan Hunter-Reay. Looking through the table, I should find his row. Scanning the \"driver\" column: Row 12 is Ryan Hunter - Ray. His points are listed as 1 and grid position is 9. So, does he have fewer than 2 points? Yes, because he has exactly 1 point. Does his grid position (which is the starting position) larger than 4? His grid is 9, which is indeed larger than 4. Also, check if he's on the American Spirit Team Johansson. In Row 12, his team is \"american spirit team johansson.\" So all conditions for Ryan Hunter-Reay are met.\n\nNext, Jimmy Vasser. Looking for his row in the table: Row 14 is Jimmy Vasser. His points are listed as 0 and grid position is 16. Does he have fewer than 2 points? Yes, because he has 0 points. Does his grid position larger than 4? His grid is 16, which is definitely larger than 4. Also, check if he's on the same team as mentioned: Row 14 shows his team as \"american spirit team johansson.\" So Jimmy Vasser also meets all conditions.\n\nTherefore, both drivers satisfy the claim's criteria. The relevant cells would be their respective rows for points and grid.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the player on the patrick race team with fewer than 2 points and grid larger than 4 be ryan hunter - reay and oriol servi\u00e0.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into its components. It mentions two specific drivers: Ryan Hunter-Reay and Oriol Servi\u00e0. The claim is about a player on the Patrick Racing team who has fewer than 2 points and a grid position larger than 4.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify which rows correspond to Patrick Racing. Scanning through the table, I see that in row 18, the driver is Oriol Servi\u00e0 with the team as Patrick Racing. I don't immediately see Ryan Hunter-Reay listed under Patrick Racing, so perhaps he isn't on that team.\n\nNext, I need to check each relevant driver's points and grid position. For Oriol Servi\u00e0 (row 18), his points are 0 and his grid is 4. The claim says \"fewer than 2 points\" which would include 0 or 1 point, so that fits. However, the grid is exactly 4, not larger than 4. The condition in the claim requires a grid larger than 4, so Oriol Servi\u00e0 doesn't meet this part.\n\nSince Ryan Hunter-Reay isn't listed under Patrick Racing, he might be on another team. Looking through the table again, I find Ryan Hunter-Reay is in row 12 with the American Spirit Team Johansson. His points are 1 and his grid position is 9. The claim says fewer than 2 points (so 1 point or less) but his grid is 9, which isn't larger than 4.\n\nWait, but the claim specifies \"the player,\" implying one person. However, Ryan Hunter-Reay's points fit but his grid doesn't, and Oriol Servi\u00e0's grid fits but points are okay, but grid doesn't. Also, they might be on different teams, so there isn't a single Patrick Racing team member meeting both conditions.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. The claim says \"the player\" which could mean multiple. But the main point is whether any player on Patrick Racing meets the criteria. From row 18, Oriol Servi\u00e0 has grid 4 and points 0. So he doesn't meet the grid condition (grid must be larger than 4). Therefore, no driver on Patrick Racing in the table meets both conditions: fewer than 2 points and grid larger than 4.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because there's no such player on Patrick Racing meeting both criteria.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because neither Ryan Hunter-Reay nor Oriol Servi\u00e0 are on the Patrick Racing team, and no Patrick Racing driver meets both conditions of fewer than 2 points and a grid larger than 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
