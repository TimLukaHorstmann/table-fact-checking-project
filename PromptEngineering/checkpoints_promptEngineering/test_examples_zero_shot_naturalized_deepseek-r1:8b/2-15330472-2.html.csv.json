    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and the conditions in the claim. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the claim: \"viswanathan anand have a rating greater than 2753 , with a prev less than 4 , and + 4 as the chng.\"\n\nI need to check three things:\n1. His rating is greater than 2753.\n2. His previous rank (prev) is less than 4.\n3. The change in his rating (chng) is +4.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll find the row for viswanathan anand. Scanning through the players' names, I see that Row 1 is about viswanathan anand. So, row_index is 0 if we start counting from 0, but let me check the instructions again. Wait, in the example provided, the rows are indexed starting at 0. For instance, the first row is row_index: 0, so yes, Row 1 in the table corresponds to row_index 0.\n\nNow, for each condition:\n\n1. Rating greater than 2753: In Row 1, his rating is 2803. 2803 is definitely greater than 2753. So this condition is met.\n\n2. prev less than 4: The 'prev' column shows that for viswanathan anand, the value is 2. So, 2 is less than 4. That's good.\n\n3. Change (+4) as per the table: In Row 1, change is +4. So this condition is also met.\n\nSince all three conditions are satisfied, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to map which cells in the table are relevant for each condition.\n\nFor rating greater than 2753: Look at the 'rating' column in row 0 (Row 1). So the cell is \"rating\" and row_index 0.\n\nFor prev less than 4: The 'prev' column in row 0. So another cell is \"prev\" and row_index 0.\n\nFor change being +4: The 'change' column in row 0. So third cell is \"chng\" and row_index 0.\n\nSo all three relevant cells are from row 0, columns rating, prev, and chng.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the validity of the claim, each condition was checked against the corresponding columns in viswanathan anand's row. All conditions were satisfied, confirming the claim as true. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rating\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"prev\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"change\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
