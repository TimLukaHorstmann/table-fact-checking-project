    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the first episode aired on 7 / 02 / 08\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing both the claim and the table data.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it has five rows, each representing an episode with details like date, time, network, length, etc. The episodes are numbered from one to five. Now, the claim is about the first episode airing on 7/02/08.\n\nI need to check each relevant cell in the table that supports this claim. The key columns here are 'episode' and 'date'. Specifically, I should look for the row where 'episode' is \"one\" because that's the first episode, and see what date it has.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 1: episode one on 7/02/08\n- Row 2: episode two on 7/21/08\n- And so on...\n\nSo, row 0 (assuming row indices start at 0) for 'episode' is \"one\" and date is 7/02/08. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nWait, but the table shows rows starting from one to five, but in the JSON example, they used row_index as integers starting from 0. So if row 1 is index 0? Or does it start at zero? Wait, no, looking back, the instruction says 'row_index' is an integer, so I think row indices are 0-based. But in the table provided, the rows are labeled one to five, but their data starts from one as well.\n\nWait, perhaps the first row corresponds to row index 1 because it's the first episode. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nBut in the JSON example, for instance, the answer was based on row indices starting at 0. So I think the table is presented with rows 1 through 5, but in terms of row_index in the JSON output, it would be 0-based. So row one is index 0, row two is index 1, etc.\n\nTherefore, for the claim, we need to find the first episode, which is row one, and check its date. So in the table, row one has date 7/02/08. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo, I need to mark this as TRUE because all relevant cells support it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the provided table. The claim is: \"espn2 air episode one on 7 / 21 / 08\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions 'espn2', which refers to the network, and it's about airing episode one on a specific date, 7/21/08.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like episode number, date, time, network, and length. \n\nI'll start by checking if there's an episode named 'one' (episode: one) that was aired on 7/21/08. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Episode one on 7/02/08 at 7 pm.\nRow 2: Episode two on 7/21/08 at 7:30 pm.\nRow 3: Episode three on 7/31/08 at 7:30 pm.\nRow 4: Episode four on 8/05/08 at 7 pm.\nRow 5: Episode five on 8/05/08 at 7:30 pm.\n\nSo, the claim says \"episode one\" was aired on 7/21/08. From the table, I see that episode two is on 7/21/08, not episode one. Therefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because it's referring to the wrong episode number and date.\n\nNext, I'll look for any other relevant cells. The network in all rows is espn2, which matches the claim, so that part is correct. However, since the episode number and date don't match, this doesn't fully support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of episode one being aired on 7/21/08.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
