    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the dance tango with song hung up receive a 10 from goodman and be also rated by tonioli.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two things:\n1. The dance tango with song \"hung up\" gets a score of 10 from Goodman.\n2. This dance is also rated by Tonioli.\n\nI'll need to check each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with rows for different weeks, dances/songs, and scores from four judges (Horwood, Goodman, Dixon, and Tonioli). The \"result\" column also has some values like 'safe,' 'n/a,' or 'second place.'\n\nI'll start by searching for the dance \"tango\" with the song \"hung up.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 12: Week 11, Dance: tango / hung up. The scores are Horwood:9, Goodman:10, Dixon:10, Tonioli:9. Total is 38, result: safe.\n\nSo, in this row, Goodman gives a score of 10. That's the first part of the claim: receiving 10 from Goodman.\n\nNow, does the claim mention that it's rated by Tonioli? Looking at the scores for Tonioli in this row, he gave a 9. The claim says \"be also rated by tonioli.\" So, does a score of 9 count as being rated?\n\nWait, in the table, every dance seems to have all four judges rate it. For example, even if some cells are 'n/a' or have different scores, each dance has entries for all four judges except when they're marked as 'n/a.' But in Row 11, there's a dance with some 'n/a' scores but the result is safe.\n\nIn Row 12, Tonioli gave a 9. So, does that mean he rated it? Yes, because his score is present and not 'n/a.' So the claim says \"be also rated by tonioli,\" which would be true since he has a score of 9 for this dance.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim specifies that Goodman gives a 10 and that Tonioli rates it. From Row 12, Goodman did give a 10, and Tonioli gave a 9, so yes, both conditions are met.\n\nSo, the claim is supported by the table in Row 12 where tango with \"hung up\" gets 10 from Goodman and is rated (with a score of 9) by Tonioli. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe dance \"tango\" with song \"hung up\" appears in Row 12, where Goodman scores it 10 and Tonioli gives a rating of 9.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"dance / song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"goodman\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"tonioli\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be , rank a 7 from horwood , have a total score of 31 , and have a safe result.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be\" - This likely means Goodman gives a score of 8 to all songs or dances. So I need to check if Goodman's scores for each dance/song are 8.\n\n2. \"rank a 7 from horwood\" - This suggests Horwood gives a rank of 7, so I should look at Horwood's rankings (probably numerical scores) and see if they are 7 in all cases where Goodman scored 8.\n\n3. \"have a total score of 31\" - The total points per row should be 31 for the specified dances/songs.\n\n4. \"have a safe result\" - The result column should say 'safe' for those rows.\n\nNow, I'll go through each relevant row to verify these conditions.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Week 1\n- Dance/Song: cha - cha - cha / ain't no mountain high enough\n- Goodman: 8\n- Horwood: 7\n- Total: 31\n- Result: n/a\n\nRow 2: Week 2\n- Dance/Song: foxtrot / she said\n- Goodman: 8\n- Horwood: 7\n- Total: 31\n- Result: safe\n\nRow 3: Week 3\n- Dance/Song: quickstep / dreaming of you\n- Goodman: 7 (Wait, this contradicts the first condition where Goodman should give 8 to all songs. So Row 3 is a problem.)\n\nBut wait, in the claim, it says \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be\". So if Row 3's Goodman score is 7, then the claim isn't fully supported there.\n\nHowever, let me double-check. Maybe I misread something. In Row 3, dance/song is quickstep / dreaming of you, and Goodman's score is 7. That doesn't fit the claim because Goodman should give an 8 to all relevant songs.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim means \"goodman gives an 8 to all songs that he assesses,\" not necessarily all songs in the table. So perhaps I need to check if for each row where there's a dance/song, Goodman scored 8.\n\nLooking at Row 1: Yes, 8.\nRow 2: Yes, 8.\nRow 3: No, 7.\nSo this already contradicts the claim because not all relevant dances have Goodman giving 8.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to check only for the rows where the result is 'safe.' Let's see:\n\nRows with 'safe' results are 2-8 and 10-15 except Row 11 which has n/a but still safe. Wait, no: Row 11 says \"result: safe,\" even though scores are n/a.\n\nBut focusing on Rows 1-4, since the claim is about specific weeks (weeks 1-12 or so). But maybe it's better to check all rows where result is 'safe' and see if Goodman gives 8 and Horwood gives 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to certain rows, but I think it's more general. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe claim seems to be describing a pattern: whenever Goodman gives an 8, Horwood gives a 7, leading to a total of 31 and a safe result.\n\nSo for each row where Goodman scored 8, check if Horwood scored 7, total is 31, and result is 'safe'.\n\nLet's go through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Goodman 8, Horwood 7. Total 31. Result: n/a. So this doesn't count because result isn't safe.\n\nRow 2: Goodman 8, Horwood 7. Total 31. Result: safe. This fits.\n\nRow 3: Goodman 7, so not applicable.\n\nRow 4: Goodman 9, so no.\n\nRow 5: Goodman 8, but Horwood is 8. So doesn't fit since Horwood should be 7.\n\nRow 6: Goodman 9.\n\nRow 7: Goodman 9.\n\nRow 8: Goodman 9.\n\nRow 10: Goodman 7.\n\nRows 11-15: Goodman varies, some n/a.\n\nSo only Row 2 fits the pattern where Goodman gives 8, Horwood gives 7, total is 31, and result is safe. Therefore, the claim that \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be\" etc., seems incorrect because not all such songs have these attributes.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is more about a general pattern rather than specific rows. Let's read it again: \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be , rank a 7 from horwood , have a total score of 31 , and have a safe result.\"\n\nSo perhaps the claim is making a general statement that whenever Goodman gives 8, Horwood also gives 7, leading to a total of 31 and a safe result.\n\nIn that case, I need to check if for all rows where Goodman scored 8, Horwood also scored 7, and the total was 31 with a safe result.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 1: Yes, Goodman 8, Horwood 7. Total 31 but result n/a, so maybe not included.\n\nRow 2: Same as Row 1 but result is safe.\n\nSo only Rows 1 and 2 meet some criteria, but the claim suggests it's a general rule for \"all song that be.\"\n\nTherefore, since there are rows where Goodman scored 8 but Horwood didn't give 7 (e.g., Row 5: Goodman 8, Horwood 8), the claim isn't fully accurate. Also, Row 1's result is n/a, not safe.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because not all cases where Goodman gives 8 have Horwood giving 7 and a total of 31 with a safe result.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for certain dances/songs, Goodman scores 8, Horwood ranks them 7, resulting in a total score of 31 and a 'safe' outcome. Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- Row 1: GOODMAN=8, HORWOOD=7, TOTAL=31, RESULT=n/a \u2192 Doesn't qualify.\n- Row 2: GOODMAN=8, HORWOOD=7, TOTAL=31, RESULT=safe \u2192 Qualifies.\n- Rows 3-15: Most don't meet all criteria.\n\nSince not all instances where Goodman scored 8 also have Horwood's score as 7 and a safe result, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"statement\": \"goodman give an 8 to all song that be , rank a 7 from horwood , have a total score of 31 , and have a safe result.\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The pattern described in the claim does not consistently hold true across all relevant rows, specifically where Goodman's score is 8, Horwood's score is not always 7, and sometimes results are not 'safe'.\",\n  \"outcome\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"goodman give the score 9 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. Goodman gives a score of 9.\n2. To the dance or song \"samba / young heart run free.\"\n3. This performance is in second place.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 8: week 8, dance/song samba / young hearts run free. The scores for Goodman are 9 (row 8). So that part checks out\u2014Goodman scored 9.\n\nNext, checking if it's in second place. Looking at row 13 and row 14 and row 15, which are all week 12. Row 13: samba / young hearts run free with a total of 38, result is second place. So that also matches.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"which be in second place.\" The table shows that it's indeed in second place in week 12. However, I notice that the claim mentions \"week,\" but looking at row 8, the samba performance was in week 8, not week 12. Wait a minute, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, no, row 13 is week 12. So Goodman gave 9 points to samba / young hearts run free in week 12, which resulted in second place. However, in the claim, it's said as \"samba / young heart run free,\" but in row 8, that dance was also done by someone else (probably tonioli and dixon scored higher). Wait, no\u2014row 13 is a different week.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the rows:\n\nRow 8: week 8, samba / young hearts run free. Goodman scored 9. Result was safe.\n\nThen in row 12 (week 11), another samba / young hearts run free with Goodman scoring 10, but that's a different week.\n\nWait no\u2014looking again:\n\nRow 13 is week 12: dance/song samba / young hearts run free. Goodman scored 9, which resulted in second place.\n\nSo the claim says that Goodman gave 9 to this dance, and it was second place. Both of these are true for row 13 (week 12).\n\nWait, but earlier in week 8, Goodman also scored 9 for samba / young hearts run free, but the result was safe, not second place.\n\nSo the claim is about a specific instance where Goodman gave 9 and it was second. So that would be week 12, row 13.\n\nTherefore, the claim's statement is TRUE because in week 12, Goodman scored 9 for samba / young hearts run free, which placed it in second place.\n\nI need to check if all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n\nLooking at the relevant cells:\n\n- For Goodman's score: row_index 13, column_name \"goodman\".\n- For the dance/song: row_index 13, column_name \"dance / song\".\n- For the result being second place: row 13, column_name \"result\".\n\nSo these are the cells to include in relevant_cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by data from Row 13 where Goodman scored 9 for samba / young hearts run free, resulting in second place.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"dance / song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"dixon give the score 10 to the song samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" \n\nFirst, I'll go through the table row by row to find any relevant information.\n\nLooking at Row 8, week 8: dance/song is samba / young hearts run free. The scores are horwood:9, goodman:9, dixon:10, tonioli:10. Dixon scored 10 here. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, checking the results column for Row 8, it says \"safe.\" So the result isn't second place there; it's safe. But wait, in Rows 13 and 14, week 12 also has samba / young hearts run free. Row 13: dixon gives 10 again, horwood:9, goodman:9, dixon:10, tonioli:10. The result is \"second place.\" So that's when it was second.\n\nWait, the claim mentions Dixon giving a score of 10 in week 11 for samba / young hearts run free. But looking back at Row 12 (week 11), dance/song is tango / hung up. The samba isn't there in week 11; it's in week 8 and week 12.\n\nSo the claim might be mixing up weeks. Let me check again: \n\nRow 13 is week 12, dance/song samba, Dixon scores 10, result second place.\n\nBut the claim says week 11 for both the song and Dixon giving 10. However, in week 11 (Rows 10 and 11), the samba isn't present except in Row 12. So maybe the claim is referring to week 8 or week 12.\n\nWait, but the claim specifically mentions \"samba / young heart run free\" and Dixon giving a score of 10, which does happen in week 8 (Row 8) and week 12 (Row 13). In both cases, it's Dixon scoring 10. \n\nBut for second place, Row 13's result is \"second place,\" while Row 14 is another second place but different dance/song.\n\nSo the claim says Dixon gave a score of 10 to that song which was in second place. That happens in week 12, not week 11. But does it appear in week 11? No, because in week 11 (Row 12), it's tango. So maybe the claim is incorrect about the week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me look again:\n\nIn Row 8: week 8, samba, Dixon 10, result safe.\n\nRow 13: week 12, same song, Dixon 10, result second place.\n\nSo the song was in second place once (week 12). But in the claim, it's saying \"which be in second place,\" so that part is correct. However, the claim mentions Dixon giving 10 in week 11, but the actual occurrence is in week 12.\n\nWait, no, in Row 13, week 12, and Row 8, week 8. So the song was in week 8 (safe) and week 12 (second place). Therefore, the claim says Dixon gave a score of 10 to the song in second place, which is correct because that happened in week 12.\n\nBut wait, in the table, does Dixon give 10 to that song in week 11? No, because in week 11, it's Row 12: tango. So maybe the claim is wrong about the week. It says \"samba / young heart run free\" was in week 11, but actually, it's week 8 and 12.\n\nSo Dixon did give a score of 10 to that song, which was in second place (week 12). However, the week mentioned in the claim is incorrect\u2014it's not week 11. So the claim is FALSE because the week is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say it happened in week 11, but it didn't.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nRow 8: week 8, samba, Dixon 10, result safe.\n\nRow 13: week 12, same song, Dixon 10, result second place.\n\nSo the song was in second place once (week 12) and safe once (week 8). So the claim says \"samba / young heart run free\" was in second place. That's true for week 12. But the claim also mentions Dixon giving a score of 10 to that song, which is correct because he did so in weeks 8 and 12.\n\nBut the problem is whether the song was in second place when Dixon gave the 10. In week 12, yes. So part of the claim is correct, but perhaps the week is wrong.\n\nWait, the claim says \"samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" So it's saying that the song was in second place. That's true for week 12. But does Dixon give a score of 10 to it? Yes, in both weeks 8 and 12. \n\nHowever, the issue is whether the claim correctly attributes both the 10 score and the second place to the same week or not. The claim says \"which be in second place,\" so it's saying that when Dixon gave the 10, the song was in second place. That happened in week 12.\n\nBut wait, in week 8, it was safe, not second place. So the 10 score in week 8 didn't have second place; that came later in week 12.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because the second place occurred in a different week than when Dixon gave the 10. But actually, in week 12, he gave 10 and it was second place. So the 10 and the second place both happened together.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct: Dixon gave a score of 10 to that song which was in second place (week 12). However, the claim mentions \"samba / young heart run free\" being in week 11, but it's actually week 8 and 12. So the week mentioned is wrong.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table:\n\nRow 8: week 8\n\nRow 13: week 12\n\nSo the song appears in weeks 8 and 12, not week 11. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that the song was in week 11. That's a problem because it's actually in weeks 8 and 12.\n\nBut Dixon did give a score of 10 to that song (weeks 8 and 12) which was in second place in week 12.\n\nSo the claim is partially correct but wrong about the week. Therefore, the entire claim is false because it incorrectly states the week as 11 instead of 12.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to week 12, but the claim says week 11. So since the week is incorrect, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because \"samba / young heart run free\" was not in week 11; it was in weeks 8 and 12. Dixon did give a score of 10 to that song, but only in week 12 when it was second place.\n\nAnswer: The claim is incorrect because the song was not in week 11; it was in weeks 8 and 12. Dixon scored 10 for that song in week 12 when it was second place. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe JSON would reflect this conclusion as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reason\": \"The claim incorrectly states that 'samba / young heart run free' was in week 11 with a score of 10 from Dixon and second place. The song was actually in week 8 (score 10, result safe) and week 12 (score 10, result second place). Thus, the claim is false.\",\n  \"verdict\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"1 song receive a 10 from goodman and be rated 7 by tonioli\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for any rows in the table where a song received a 10 score from Goodman. Looking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: dance/song is cha-cha-cha/ain't no mountain high enough. Goodman's score is 8.\n- Week 2: foxtrot/she said. Goodman is 8.\n- Week 3: quickstep/dreaming of you. Goodman is 7.\n- Week 4: Charleston/forty-second street. Goodman is 9.\n- Week 5: Argentine tango/bat out of hell. Goodman is 8.\n- Week 6: Viennese waltz/where the wild roses grow. Goodman is 9.\n- Week 7: rumba/too lost in you. Goodman is 9.\n- Week 8: samba/young hearts run free. Goodman is 9.\n- Week 10: jive/soul bossa nova. Goodman is 8.\n- Week 11: salsa/spinning around. Goodman is 7.\n- Weeks 11,12,13,14,15: some have Goodman as n/a or 9 or 8.\n\nLooking through this, I see that in week 4, Goodman scored a 9 for Charleston/forty-second street. That's one song with a 10 from Goodman? Wait, no, Goodman scored 9 there, not 10. So no row where Goodman gives 10.\n\nWait, the claim says \"1 song receive a 10 from goodman\". I don't see any Goodman scores of 10 in the table provided. The highest is 10 for Dixon and Tonioli sometimes, but Goodman's max seems to be 9. So that part isn't true.\n\nNext part: being rated 7 by Tonioli. Let's check if any song got a 7 from Tonioli.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: Tonioli is 8.\n- Week 2: Tonioli is 8.\n- Week 3: Tonioli is 8.\n- Week 4: Tonioli is 8.\n- Week 5: Tonioli is 9.\n- Week 6: Tonioli is 9.\n- Week 7: Tonioli is 9.\n- Week 8: Tonioli is 10.\n- Week 10: Tonioli is 9.\n- Week 11: Tonioli is n/a for two dances, and 7 in another (salsa/spinning around). So yes, one song got a 7 from Tonioli.\n- Weeks 12-15: Tonioli scores are 10 or 9.\n\nSo there's at least one song that received a 7 from Tonioli. Now the claim says \"be rat 7 by tonioli\". Wait, \"rat\" might be a typo; probably means \"rated\".\n\nBut does any song receive both a 10 from Goodman and a 7 from Tonioli? From what I see:\n\n- Week 11: salsa/spinning around. Goodman is 7, but not 10. So that's the only 7 by Tonioli in week 11 for that dance. However, the other dance in week 11 (swing/in the mood) has n/a scores.\n\nWait, week 8: samba/young hearts run free. Goodman is 9, Tonioli is 10. Week 4: Goodman is 9, Tonioli 8. So no song got both 10 from Goodman and 7 from Tonioli.\n\nTherefore, the claim's first part isn't correct (no 10 from Goodman), but the second part (7 from Tonioli) is true for one song. However, since both conditions need to be met, it's false because there's no song with a 10 from Goodman.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again at each row for Goodman:\n\nWeek 1:8\n\nWeek2:8\n\nWeek3:7\n\nWeek4:9\n\nWeek5:8\n\nWeek6:9\n\nWeek7:9\n\nWeek8:9\n\nWeek10:8\n\nWeek11:7 (salsa/spinning around)\n\nWeek12: two dances, one with Goodman n/a.\n\nSo the only 10 from Goodman is nowhere; he never scored a 10 in this table. Therefore, the first condition of the claim isn't satisfied by any song.\n\nHence, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that one song received a 10 from Goodman and was rated 7 by Tonioli. After reviewing the table:\n\n- No song received a 10 from Goodman.\n- One song (Week 11's salsa/spinning around) received a 7 from Tonioli.\n\nSince both conditions aren't met for the same song, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 0,\n        \"column_name\": \"Revenue\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"Employees\"\n    }\n]\n```",

The claim says: \"goodman give 8 to all song with second place result , which receive a 7 from horwood and have a total score of 31\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let me break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions that Goodman gives 8 points to songs that resulted in second place. These songs must meet two conditions: they received a 7 from Horwood, and their total score is 31. So, for each row where the result is 'second place', I need to check if Goodman scored exactly 8, Horwood scored 7, and the total was 31.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to see which ones fit this description.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: week 1. The result is 'n / a' so it doesn't apply.\n- Row 2: week 2, result is 'safe'. Not second place.\n- Row 3: week 3, result 'safe'.\n- Row 4: week 4, result 'safe'.\n- Row 5: week 5, result 'safe'.\n- Row 6: week 6, result 'safe'.\n- Row 7: week 7, result 'safe'.\n- Row 8: week 8, result 'safe'.\n- Row 9: week 10, result 'safe'.\n- Row 10: week 11, result 'safe'.\n- Row 11: week 11, dance is swing. Result is 'safe' and the total is 2nd /4 points. Not second place as per results.\n- Row 12: week 11, result is 'safe'. So not applicable.\n- Rows 13,14,15: these are week 12. Their results are 'second place'.\n\nSo rows 13,14,15 might be relevant.\n\nNow checking each of these:\n\nRow 13: dance/song: samba / young hearts run free. Horwood:9, Goodman:9, Dixon:10, Tonicoli:10. Total:38. Result: second place. So Goodman gave himself 9 points here, not 8. So this doesn't fit the claim.\n\nRow14: dance/song: showdance / i like the way (you move). Horwood:7, Goodman:9, Dixon:9, Tonicoli:9. Total:34. Result: second place. Goodman scored 9, not 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nRow15: dance/song: paso doble / don't let me be misunderstood. Horwood:9, Goodman:8, Dixon:9, Tonicoli:9. Total:35. Result: second place. Here, Goodman scored 8. Now check Horwood: he scored 9, not 7. So the first condition isn't met.\n\nWait, in the claim, it says the song must receive a 7 from Horwood. But in row15, Horwood is 9, so this doesn't fit either.\n\nSo none of the rows where the result is second place meet all three conditions: Goodman giving 8 points, Horwood giving 7, and total score 31.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I missed something. Let's look at each row with 'second place' result.\n\nRows 13,14,15:\n\nRow13: Goodman=9, Horwood=9, Total=38. Not matching.\n\nRow14: Goodman=9, Horwood=7? Wait, in Row14, Horwood is 7. Oh! So in this case, Horwood gave 7, Goodman gave 9, but total is 34, not 31. So even though Horwood is 7 and result is second place, the total isn't 31.\n\nWait, no: Row13's Horwood is 9, so that doesn't fit. Row14's Horwood is 7, but Goodman is 9. Total is 34, not 31.\n\nRow15: Horwood=9, Goodman=8. So only one condition met, and total isn't 31 either.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table, rows after 12 are weeks 11, 12. Wait, week10 is row9, week11 is rows10-12, week12 is rows13-15.\n\nSo for week12, which is rows13-15, their results are second place.\n\nIn these rows:\n\nRow13: Goodman=9, Horwood=9, Total=38 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nRow14: Goodman=9, Horwood=7, Total=34 \u2192 Only two conditions met, but not 31.\n\nRow15: Goodman=8, Horwood=9, Total=35 \u2192 Again, only one condition met.\n\nSo none of the rows with second place result meet all three criteria. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **false** because none of the songs with a 'second place' result received an 8 from Goodman while also having a total score of 31 and receiving a 7 from Horwood.\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Goodman\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Goodman\"}\n]\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"goodman give score 4 to samba / young heart run free , which be in second place.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down what each part of the claim means. It mentions \"goodman,\" so I need to look at the 'goodman' column in the table. Then, it refers to a specific dance/song pair: \"samba / young heart run free.\" So I'm looking for rows where the dance is samba and the song is that particular one.\n\nNext, the claim states that this score was given by Goodman, but wait, looking at the table, each row has 'goodman' as a score. Wait no, in the table, it's more about other scorers like horwood, goodman, dixon, tonioli, and then the total score. So 'goodman' refers to their individual scores for that dance.\n\nNow, the claim says Goodman gave a score of 4. But looking through the table, I don't see any 4s in the 'goodman' column. The lowest I see is 7 or sometimes 8 or higher. So that part might be incorrect.\n\nThen, it says \"which be in second place.\" So, does this dance get a second-place position? Looking at the 'result' column, most entries say 'safe,' except for rows 13,14,15 which say 'second place.' But I need to check if any of these are for samba / young heart run free.\n\nLooking at row 8: week 8, dance is samba, song is young hearts run free. Let's see the 'result' there\u2014it says 'safe,' so it wasn't second place that week. Now, rows 13 and 14 mention 'second place,' but those are for week 12 with different dances: row 13 is samba again? Wait, no, row 13 is dance samba / young hearts run free as well, right? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, row 13: week 12, dance is samba, song is young hearts run free. So the result there is 'second place.' So Goodman's score for that would be in the goodman column. Let me see what the scores were for row 13.\n\nLooking at row 13: horwood:9, goodman:9, dixon:10, tonioli:10, total:38, result: second place. Wait, so Goodman scored 9 for that performance. The claim says Goodman gave a score of 4, which is not the case here.\n\nSo the claim has two issues: Goodman didn't give a 4 (she gave at least 7s), and the specific dance mentioned in the claim actually got a 9 from Goodman, not a 4, but it did place second. However, the main issue is that Goodman's score was 9, not 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Goodman didn't give a 4, and the second-place result doesn't align with a 4-score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Goodman gave a 9, not a 4, and the dance/song was in second place but with a different score. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"goodman\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
