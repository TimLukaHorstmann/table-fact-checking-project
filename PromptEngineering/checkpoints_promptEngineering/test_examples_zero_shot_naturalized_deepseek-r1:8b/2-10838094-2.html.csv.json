    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about the new Trabzon stadium's capacity is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim: \"the new trabzon stadium have a capacity of 41513 people.\" So, I need to check if there's a row in the table that matches this description.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different stadium with details like stadium name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. My task is to find the relevant row for \"new trabzon stadium.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one until I find the matching stadium name. \n\nRow 1: Timsah Arena - not Trabzon.\nRow 2: Vodafone Arena - Istanbul, Be\u015fikta\u015f. Not Trabzon.\nRow 3: New Konya Stadium - Konya. Nope.\nRow 4: New Trabzon Stadium - Capacity 41513, City Trabzon. That's the one!\n\nSo, the relevant row is row 4 with the column name \"capacity.\" The claim states that the capacity is 41513, which matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant rows, but from the list given, only row 4 matches both the stadium name and the capacity mentioned in the claim. \n\nTherefore, since all the information in the claim aligns perfectly with the data in the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"capacity\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking against the provided table. The claim states: \"the stadium with the largest capacity opening after 2015 be new trabzon stadium that hold 41513\". \n\nFirst, I should break down what this claim is saying. It's about a stadium that opened after 2015 and has the largest capacity among all listed. The specific stadium mentioned is \"new trabzon stadium\" with a capacity of 41,513.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different stadium with details like stadium name, capacity, city, club, and opening year. I'll need to go through each row to find out which ones opened after 2015 and then check their capacities.\n\nStarting from Row 1 to Row 16:\n\n- **Row 1**: Opening in 2014 \u2192 before 2015.\n- **Row 2**: Opening in 2015 \u2192 exactly 2015. The claim says \"after 2015\", so this might not qualify as it's just 2015.\n- **Row 3**: 2014 \u2192 too early.\n- **Row 4**: 2016 \u2192 after 2015. Capacity is 41,513. This matches the stadium name mentioned in the claim.\n- **Row 5**: 2015 \u2192 same as Row 2, so probably not included since it's \"after\" 2015.\n- **Row 6**: 2016 \u2192 after 2015. Capacity is 34,658. Less than 41k.\n- **Row 7**: 2016 \u2192 after 2015. Capacity is 33,200. Also less.\n- **Row 8**: 2016 \u2192 same as above. Capacity 33,000.\n- **Row 9**: 2016 \u2192 capacity 28,710.\n- **Row 10**: 2015 \u2192 not included.\n- **Row 11**: 2015 \u2192 same reason.\n- **Row 12**: 2014 \u2192 too early.\n- **Row 13**: 2014 \u2192 nope.\n- **Row 14**: 2014 \u2192 nope.\n- **Row 15**: 2015 \u2192 same as before, not after 2015.\n- **Row 16**: 2014 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the only stadium that meets both criteria (opened after 2015 and has a capacity larger than others) is Row 4: New Trabzon Stadium with a capacity of 41,513. \n\nWait, I should double-check if there are any other stadiums opened after 2015 with higher capacities. From the data provided:\n\n- After 2015, only Rows 4 to 9 and 15,16 (but those have lower capacities). The highest among them is indeed Row 4 at 41k.\n\nSo the claim is correct because New Trabzon Stadium is the one with the largest capacity opening after 2015.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as \"new trabzon stadium\" has the highest capacity of 41,513 and opened in 2016, which is after 2015. The relevant cells are Row 4 for stadium details.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"in trabzon, the lowest capacity match have a capacity of 11'000.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify where Trabzon is in the table. Scanning through each row's city column, I see that Row 4 is about Trabzon. So, Trabzon's stadium details are in Row 4.\n\nLooking at Row 4: stadium: new trabzon stadium, capacity: 41513, city: trabzon, club: trabzonspor, opening: 2016. The capacity listed here is 41,513. Now, the claim mentions that the lowest capacity match in Trabzon has a capacity of 11,000. That doesn't seem to align with the number I see in the table.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there are multiple stadiums in Trabzon or if this is the only one. From the table, each row seems to represent a different stadium in various cities. So, Row 4 is the only one for Trabzon, and its capacity is over 41,000. There's no other row with Trabzon as the city, so that must be the only stadium listed there.\n\nTherefore, the claim saying the lowest capacity match in Trabzon has 11,000 doesn't hold because the stadium's capacity is much higher than that. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in Trabzon, the lowest capacity match has a capacity of 11,000. However, checking Row 4 of the table, which lists Trabzon's stadium with a capacity of 41,513, this information contradicts the claim. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n  ]\n}",
