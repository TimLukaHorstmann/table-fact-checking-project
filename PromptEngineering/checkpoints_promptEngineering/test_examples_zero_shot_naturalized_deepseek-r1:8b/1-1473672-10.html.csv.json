    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and instructions. The claim says: \"rene lambert play right wing and be draft with the 146th pick.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the player's position, which is right wing. The second part is about his draft pick number, 146th.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row corresponds to a specific pick number and details about the player. My task is to find if there's a row that matches both conditions: player name \"rene lambert\" in the position of right wing and being picked at 146th overall.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one. \n\nRow 1: Player is Garry Howatt, position left wing. Doesn't match.\nRow 2: Steve Lyon, defenceman. No.\nRow 3: Rene Lambert, right wing. Position matches, pick number is 146. That seems to fit both conditions.\n\nI should also check if there's any other player named Rene Lambert, but looking through the table, only Row 3 has his name. So, it's confirmed that he was picked 146th and plays right wing.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. Rene Lambert is indeed a right wing and was drafted with the 146th pick.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then list the relevant cells. The claim is: \"right wing , rene lampert , be pick 145th\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three things: right wing, Rene Lambert, and being picked at the 145th position. So I need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has rows from 1 to 8, each with specific player information. The columns in each row include pick number, player name, position, nationality, NHL team, and college/junior/club team.\n\nSo first, I need to find out if Rene Lambert is a right wing. Let me look through the players' names in the table. In Row 3, the player is Rene Lambert, position: right wing. That matches, so that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to verify if his pick number is 145th. So I'll check each row until I find a player named Rene Lambert. From the table:\n\n- Row 1: Garry Howatt\n- Row 2: Steve Lyon\n- Row 3: Rene Lambert\nSo Row 3 has pick number 146, which is not 145.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The claim says pick 145th, but in the table, Rene Lambert is at pick 146. So there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. The table lists picks from 144 to 151, so pick numbers are in order. Row 3 is pick 146, which is right wing, Rene Lambert with the New York Islanders and St. Jerome Alouettes. So he's indeed at 146.\n\nTherefore, the claim says \"pick 145th\", but the table shows he was picked 145th? Wait no, wait. Let me check again. The picks are sequential: Row1 is 144, Row2 145, Row3 146, etc. So yes, pick number increases by 1 each row.\n\nSo if Rene Lambert is at pick 146 (Row3), the claim that he was picked 145th would be incorrect. That means the claim is false because his actual pick is 146.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything else. The claim also mentions \"right wing\", which matches Rene Lambert's position in Row3, so that part is correct.\n\nSo overall, while the position and the name match, the pick number doesn't. So the claim is false because it says he was picked 145th, but he was actually picked 146th.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rene Lambert is a right wing who was picked 145th. Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Rene Lambert** is indeed a right wing (Row3).\n- However, his pick number is listed as 146, not 145.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the pick number is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
