    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"d beadman be the jockey at rosehill and the weight be 57.5 kg.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about d beadman being the jockey at Rosehill. The second part is about the weight being 57.5 kg.\n\nLooking through each row of the table to find where d beadman was a jockey at Rosehill with that specific weight.\n\nStarting from Row 1: result won, date 03 aug 2002, race missile stakes, venue rosehill, group g3, distance 1100 m, weight 57.5 kg. Here, jockey is d beadman, and the venue is Rosehill. The weight matches 57.5 kg.\n\nRow 2: result 2nd, date 24 aug 2002, race Warwick stakes, venue Warwick farm. Not relevant as venue isn't Rosehill.\n\nRow 3: won at Randwick, so not relevant.\n\nRow 4: 4th place at George Main stakes, Randwick. Venue is Randwick, but jockey is d beadman, weight 57.5 kg. However, the claim mentions Rosehill, so this row isn't directly relevant for the first part of the claim.\n\nRows 5-7: All these races are at Caulfield, Flemington, and Randwick respectively, none at Rosehill except Row 1.\n\nRow 8: Expressway stakes at Randwick, jockey d beadman, but venue is Randwick. Not relevant for Rosehill.\n\nSimilarly, Rows 9-12: various venues, not Rosehill.\n\nRow 13 (though it's row 12 in the table): Doncaster handicap at Randwick, so irrelevant.\n\nSo, only Row 1 matches both conditions: jockey d beadman at Rosehill with weight 57.5 kg.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by this data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"jockey\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"weight (kg)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the time 1:36.30 show 2nd - platinum scissors as the winner.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns like result, date, race name, venue, group, distance, weight, time, jockey, and winner/2nd. The relevant information here is about a specific time and who finished second.\n\nFirst, I need to identify if there's a time of 1:36.30 in the table where Platinum Scissors was second. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Time is 1:03.53, result is won by Ancient Song as 2nd.\nRow 2: Time is 1:21.85, result is 2nd with Defier winning.\nRow 3: Time is 1:36.30, and Platinum Scissors finished 2nd here. \nRow 4: Time is 1:38.31, with Defier as winner.\nRow 5: Time is 2:00.60, Sunline was 2nd.\nRow 6: Time is 2:06.27, Northerly won.\nRow 7: Time is 2:02.64, Royal Code was 2nd.\nRow 8: Time is 1:10.66, Belle du Jour finished 2nd.\nRow 9: Time is 1:22.49, Hoeburg was second.\nRow 10: Time is 1:37.93, Shogun Lodge was 2nd.\nRow 11: Time is 1:30.71, Dash for Cash finished 2nd.\nRow 12: Time is 1:36.85, Grand Arme\u00e9 won.\n\nSo, in Row 3, the time matches 1:36.30 and Platinum Scissors was indeed second. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct based on this row.\n\nBut wait, I should check all rows to make sure no other matching exists or if there's any discrepancy. However, only Row 3 has that exact time with Platinum Scissors as 2nd.\n\nTherefore, since all details in the claim are present in Row 3, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. The claim says: \"beadman be the jockey at warwick farm and the weight be 57.8 kg.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the two parts of the claim separately.\n\nPart 1: Beadman is the jockey at Warwick Farm.\nLooking through each row in the table, I see that several races took place at different venues like Rosehill, Warwick Farm, Randwick, etc. The claim specifies \"Warwick Farm,\" so I should look for rows where venue is Warwick Farm.\n\nRow 2: race: Warwick Stakes, venue: Warwick Farm.\nRow 10: race: Chipping Norton Stakes, venue: Warwick Farm.\n\nSo, Beadman was the jockey at Warwick Farm in these races. Therefore, this part of the claim seems to be TRUE based on these rows.\n\nPart 2: The weight is 57.8 kg.\nLooking through each row again, the weight for each race is listed. I need to see if any row has a weight of exactly 57.8 kg.\n\nRow 1: 57.5 kg\nRow 2: 57.5 kg\nRow 3: 57.5 kg\nRow 4: 57.5 kg\nRow 5: 57.5 kg\nRow 6: 56.5 kg\nRow 7: 57.5 kg\nRow 8: 57.5 kg\nRow 9: 58.0 kg\nRow 10: 58.0 kg\nRow 11: 58.0 kg\nRow 12: 57.5 kg\n\nI notice that none of the weights listed are 57.8 kg. The closest is 56.5 and 57.5, but not 57.8. Therefore, this part of the claim is FALSE.\n\nSince both parts of the claim need to be TRUE for it to be overall TRUE, but since the weight part is FALSE, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The jockey information is in the \"jockey\" column, so all rows where Beadman was the jockey at Warwick Farm are relevant. Specifically, rows 2 and 10 because they are the ones where venue is Warwick Farm.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row_index 2 (for Warwick Stakes) and row_index 10 (Chipping Norton Stakes), both looking at the \"jockey\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"jockey\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when the time is 1:44:30, 2nd - platinum scissors show as the winner.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the data. Each row in the table represents a race with several attributes like result, date, race name, venue, group, distance, weight, time, jockey, and the winner or second place.\n\nThe claim is about a specific time (1:44:30) and that platinum scissors finished second as the winner. Wait, that wording is confusing. \"2nd - platinum scissors show as the winner\" \u2013 maybe it means that in that race, platinum scissors came second but somehow acted as the winner? That doesn't make much sense. Perhaps the claim meant to say that platinum scissors won, but they were second in the race? Or maybe it's a typo and should be \"winner\" instead of \"show as the winner.\"\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Time is 1:03:53\nRow 2: Time is 1:21:85\nRow 3: Time is 1:36:30\nRow 4: Time is 1:38:31\nRow 5: Time is 2:00:60\nRow 6: Time is 2:06:27\nRow 7: Time is 2:02:64\nRow 8: Time is 1:10:66\nRow 9: Time is 1:22:49\nRow 10: Time is 1:37:93\nRow 11: Time is 1:30:71\nRow 12: Time is 1:36:85\n\nNone of these times match 1:44:30. So the time condition in the claim isn't met by any row.\n\nAdditionally, checking if platinum scissors ever came second and won:\n\nLooking at each row's winner/2nd column:\n- Row 3: winner is 2nd - platinum scissors (so they finished second but were not the winner)\n- No row shows platinum scissors as the winner. They only finished second once in Row 3.\n\nSo the claim has two issues: the time doesn't match any race, and platinum scissors didn't win; they only came second.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there is no race at 1:44:30 where \"2nd - platinum scissors\" won. Platinum Scissors only finished second in one race, not as the winner.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner / 2nd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
