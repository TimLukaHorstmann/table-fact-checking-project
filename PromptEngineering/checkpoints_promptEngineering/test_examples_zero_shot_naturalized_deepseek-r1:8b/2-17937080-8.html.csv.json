    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of this means. Rank refers to the position in some sort of ranking, which could be related to how many goals a player has scored, their performance over a season, or perhaps some other metric. The claim is specifically about players ranked at number 11 and whether they have less than 1.237 goals per match.\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent a different player with various statistics. The columns include rank, name, season, club, goals, apps (which I assume stands for appearances), and goals per match. So, each of these rows is a separate entry for a player in a specific season.\n\nThe key here is to find the player ranked at position 11 and check their goals per match against the claim. The claim is about whether that player has less than 1.237 goals per match. \n\nNow, I'll go through each row to locate the one where rank is 11. Scanning the table:\n\nRow 1: Rank 1\nRow 2: Rank 2\nRow 3: Rank 2\nRow 4: Rank 4\nRow 5: Rank 5\nRow 6: Rank 5\nRow 7: Rank 7\nRow 8: Rank 7\nRow 9: Rank 7\nRow 10: Rank 10\nRow 11: Rank 11 \u2192 This is the player we need. \nContinuing:\nRow 12: Rank 12\nRow 13: Rank 12\nRow 14: Rank 12\nRow 15: Rank 12\nRow 16: Rank 15\nRow 17: Rank 16\n\nSo, Row 11 has rank 11. Let's look at the data for this player.\n\nIn Row 11, name is Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, season 1956/57, club Real Madrid, goals 43, apps 43, goals per match 1.0. \n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense because 43 goals divided by 43 appearances would be exactly 1.0 goals per match, not 1.237. But hold on, I think I might have misread the row.\n\nLooking again: The row for rank 11 says name: alfredo di st\u00e9fano, season: 1956 / 57, club: real madrid, goals: 43, apps: 43, goals per match: 1.0.\n\nSo, according to this, Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano scored 43 goals in 43 matches, which is exactly 1 goal per match. The claim says that the player on rank 11 has less than 1.237 goals per match. Since 1.0 is less than 1.237, this should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I'm looking at the correct row. Could there be another player with rank 11? Let's see:\n\nThe rows after row 11 are ranks 12 and above, so no, only Row 11 has rank 11.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes goal per match can be a decimal, but in this case, it's exactly 1.0, which is less than 1.237. So the claim holds true for this player.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cell is row 11, where goals per match is 1.0, which is indeed less than 1.237.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The user is asking whether rank 11.0 has a goals per match (GPM) higher than 1.237. So I need to look at the table and check for any player with rank 11 and GPM > 1.237.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: rank, name, season, club, goals, apps, and goals_per_match. My focus is on the \"rank\" and \"goals_per_match\" columns, specifically for players ranked 11.\n\nI'll go through each row to see if any player with rank 11 has a GPM higher than 1.237.\n\nStarting from Row 11: rank 11, name Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, season 1956/57, goals 43, apps 43, GPM is exactly 1.0. That's way below 1.237.\n\nRow 12 and onwards mention players with rank 12 or higher. Since the claim is about rank 11, I don't need to check beyond that unless there are multiple ranks at 11, but looking at the table, only Row 11 has rank 11.\n\nWait, actually, in some rows, especially higher-numbered ones, rank could be 11 again, but in this case, the highest rank we see is 16. So I need to check if any player with rank 11 has GPM >1.237. \n\nLooking through all rows, only Row 7 mentions Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s in season 1959/60 with GPM 1.237. But that's rank 7, not 11. None of the other ranks at 11 have higher than 1.237.\n\nSo, since there are no players ranked 11 with GPM over 1.237, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't show any player ranked 11 with a goals per match above 1.237.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals_per_match\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"goals_per_match\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Lionel Messi is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Lionel Messi's rank should be 2.\n2. He scored 73 goals in the 2011/12 season.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find relevant information about Lionel Messi for that specific season.\n\nLooking at Row 1: It's from the 2011/12 season at Barcelona, and it shows Lionel Messi with rank 1, goals 73. Hmm, so in this row, his rank is 1, not 2 as claimed.\n\nWait, maybe there are other rows for 2011/12? Let me check all the rows. The second row is also from 2011/12 but it's about Cristiano Ronaldo with rank 3 and goals 60. No, that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, in Row 1, Lionel Messi has rank 1, which contradicts the claim of him being rank 2. Therefore, this part of the claim is false. \n\nAlso, looking at other rows for the same season: Are there any others? Yes, Row 3 is Cristiano Ronaldo from the same season with different stats. But that doesn't affect Messi's rank.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if there's another row where Messi has rank 2 in 2011/12. Let me scan through all rows. Hmm, nope. Only Row 1 and Row 6 mention 2010/11, and other years. So, it seems like the only data point for 2011/12 is Row 1.\n\nTherefore, since Messi's rank was 1 in that season, not 2, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Lionel Messi was ranked 2 during the 2011/12 season when, according to the table, he was actually ranked 1 with 73 goals. No relevant cells support the claim's ranking.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
