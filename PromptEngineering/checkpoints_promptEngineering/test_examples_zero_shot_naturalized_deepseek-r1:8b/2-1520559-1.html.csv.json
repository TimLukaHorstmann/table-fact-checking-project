    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng win with the lowest number of strokes.\" So I need to look through each row in the table and see if both these champions have the lowest scores.\n\nFirst, let me understand the data. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2013, I think. The columns relevant here are 'champion', which is their name, and the 'score' they achieved. So I need to check for both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng and see if their scores are among the lowest across all champions listed.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the champions and their corresponding years:\n\n- 2013: Stacy Lewis\n- 2012: Ji-Yai Shin\n- 2011: Yani Tseng\n- 2010: Yani Tseng\n- 2009: Catriona Matthew\n- 2008: Ji-Yai Shin\n- 2007: Lorena Ochoa\n- 2006: Sherri Steinhauer\n- 2005: Jeong Jang\n- 2004: Karen Stupples\n- 2003: Annika S\u00f6renstam\n- 2002: Karrie Webb\n- 2001: Se Ri Pak\n\nNow, I need to compare their scores. The 'score' column shows the total score achieved by each champion. A lower number means a better performance, as it's \"to par\" in negative strokes.\n\nLooking at Annika S\u00f6renstam first. She is only mentioned once in 2003, with a score of 278. I'll need to see what the other scores are for that year and compare across all champions.\n\nNext, Yani Tseng appears multiple times: in 2011, 2010, and 2005. Her scores were 272, 277, and 272 respectively.\n\nNow, let me list out all the scores:\n\n- 2013: 280\n- 2012: 279\n- 2011: 272 (Yani)\n- 2010: 277 (Yani)\n- 2009: 285\n- 2008: 270\n- 2007: 287\n- 2006: 281\n- 2005: 272 (Yani)\n- 2004: 269\n- 2003: 278 (Annika)\n- 2002: 273\n- 2001: 277 (Se Ri Pak)\n\nLooking at these, the lowest score is 269 by Karen Stupples in 2004. Next lowest are 270 and 272, then 273, etc.\n\nAnnika's score was 278, which isn't the lowest. The lowest overall was 269. So Annika didn't win with the lowest number of strokes; she finished higher than that. \n\nYani Tseng had scores of 277 in 2010, 272 in 2011 and 2005. Her best score was 272, which is higher than 269 but lower than some others.\n\nSo both Annika and Yani didn't have the lowest number of strokes; someone else (Karen Stupples) did. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng win with the lowest number of strokes\" is false because their scores are not the lowest across all listed years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"Yani Tseng be the runner up in 2008 and become the champion in 2010 and 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I should break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Was Yani Tseng the runner-up in 2008?\n2. Did she become the champion in both 2010 and 2011?\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table to find relevant information.\n\nStarting with Row 6 (since it's 2008):\n- Year: 2008\n- Dates: July 31 - Aug 3\n- Venue: Sunningdale Golf Club\n- Champion: Jiyai Shin (South Korea)\n- Score: 270, To Par: -18\n- Margin of Victory: 3 strokes\n- Runner(s)-Up: Yani Tseng\n\nSo, in 2008, the champion was Jiyai Shin, and the runner-up was Yani Tseng. That checks out for the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking if she became champion in 2010 and 2011:\nLooking at Row 4 (2010):\n- Champion: Yani Tseng\nSo that's correct for 2010.\n\nRow 3 (2011):\n- Champion: Yani Tseng\nThat's also correct for 2011.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported. All parts are verified in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table confirms that Yani Tseng was the runner-up in 2008 and won in both 2010 and 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the table provided. The claim says, \"se ri pak be the champion in 2001 , then come 2nd place 2 year after.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two specific things: \n1. Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001.\n2. Two years after that, she came in second place.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with various details like champion, country, venue, etc. So I'll need to find the rows related to 2001 and see if Se Ri Pak is indeed the champion there. Then, check if two years later (which would be 2003) she came in second place.\n\nLet's start by finding the 2001 row. Scanning through the table, I see that Row 13 has the year 2001. The champion listed for that row is Se Ri Pak from South Korea. That part checks out\u2014Se Ri Pak was indeed the champion in 2001. So that's one condition satisfied.\n\nNext, I need to check if she came in second place two years after 2001. Two years after 2001 would be 2003. Looking at Row 11, which is for 2003, the champion is Annika S\u00f6renstam from Sweden. The runners-up are Se Ri Pak and another player. Wait, the \"runner(s) - up\" column in Row 11 lists Se Ri Pak as one of them, but it's stated as \"se ri pak,\" which might be a typo, but assuming it's correct, she is indeed in second place.\n\nSo, putting this together: In 2001, Se Ri Pak was champion. Two years later, in 2003, she came in second place. Both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runner(s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2012 open with 9 stroke.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. Champion: Jiyal Shin\n2. Competitor: Inbee Park\n3. Year: 2012\n4. Event: The Open (likely referring to The Women's British Open as it's a major tournament)\n5. Score difference: 9 strokes\n\nNow, I'll look through the table row by row.\n\nRow 1: 2013, no mention of Jiyal Shin or Inbee Park.\nRow 2: 2012, venue Royal Liverpool Golf Club, champion Jiyai Shin (probably a misspelling; might be Jiyal?), country South Korea. The margin is 9 strokes against Inbee Park. So this seems relevant.\n\nI'll note that in row 2, the year matches, and the margin of victory is indeed 9 strokes with Jiyai Shin as champion over Inbee Park. The names might be slightly different in spelling, but \"jiyal\" vs \"jiyai\" could be a variation. It's likely they're referring to the same person.\n\nSo, checking other rows: no other 2012 entries besides row 2. Therefore, only row 2 is relevant for this claim.\n\nNow, looking at the columns:\n\n- Year: 2012 (matches)\n- Champion: Jiyai Shin (possibly the correct name variant)\n- Margin of victory: 9 strokes\n- Runner-up: Inbee Park\n\nAll these elements are present in row 2. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n\nNo other rows have conflicting information that would disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out as true based on row 2 of the table, which confirms Jiyai Shin's victory over Inbee Park with a 9-stroke margin in 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36517 more than yani tseng in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I should figure out what each part of the claim refers to. Let's break it down.\n\nLooking at the year 2012, from the table, row 2 corresponds to 2012. The champion in that row is jiyai shin, and her score is 279. To par is -9, margin of victory is 9 strokes, runners-up include Inbee Park, purse is 2,750,000, and winner's share is 428,650.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"jiyal shin earned 36517 more than yani tseng in 2011.\" So I need to find out how much jiyai shin earned in 2012 compared to yani tseng in 2011. \n\nLooking at row 3 (year 2011), the champion is Yani Tseng, and her winner's share is 392,133. The claim says that in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36,517 more than Yani Tseng did in 2011. So I need to calculate the difference between jiyai shin's 2012 winner's share and Yani Tseng's 2011 winner's share.\n\nJiyai Shin's 2012 winner's share is 428,650. Yani Tseng's 2011 winner's share is 392,133. The difference would be 428,650 minus 392,133, which equals 36,517. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nSo the claim is comparing the winner's shares directly between these two years and players, which are both present in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares jiyai shin's 2012 earnings with yani tseng's 2011 earnings using their respective winner's shares from the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"annika s\u00f6renstam and catriona matthew win with the lowest number of stroke.\" Hmm, I think it means they have the lowest margin of victory. So first, I should look through the table for both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew.\n\nStarting with Annika S\u00f6renstam: I see she appears in a few rows. Let me check each one. In row 13 (year 2001), her score is 277, to par -11, margin of victory is 2 strokes. That seems lower than some others but not the absolute lowest. Wait, maybe I should look for her with the lowest.\n\nLooking further, in row 3 (2011), it's Yani Tseng, so that's not her. Row 12 (2002) mentions Karrie Webb, not Annika. In row 11 (2003), she has a margin of victory of 1 stroke, which is pretty low. That might be the lowest for her.\n\nNow checking Catriona Matthew: looking at the table, in row 5 (2009), she's the champion with a margin of victory of 3 strokes. That's higher than some but not the lowest overall.\n\nWait, the claim says both Annika and Catriona have the lowest. So I need to check if there are any rows where both of them have the same or lower margins. For example, in row 11, Annika has a margin of 1 stroke, which is pretty low. But Catriona's lowest is 3 strokes.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The claim says \"lowest number of stroke,\" so perhaps it refers to the lowest total score? No, the term 'stroke' here likely refers to margin of victory. So Annika has a margin of 1 in 2003 and Catriona has 3 in 2009.\n\nSo, is that the lowest? Let me check other champions. For example, in row 12 (2002), Karrie Webb had 2 strokes. In row 7 (2007), Lorena Ochoa won with 4 strokes. So Annika's 1 stroke is lower than some. Catriona's 3 isn't the lowest, but maybe she and others also have low margins.\n\nWait, the claim says both of them win with the lowest number of strokes. So I need to see if both Annika and Catriona have the same lowest margin or individually the lowest.\n\nLooking at their individual margins: Annika's lowest is 1 (2003), Catriona's is 3 (2009). Since 1 is lower than 3, maybe the claim isn't accurate because they don't share the same lowest. Or perhaps the claim refers to both having some of the lowest margins, but not necessarily the absolute lowest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any row where either of them has a margin lower than others. But Annika's 1 is definitely lower than most. Catriona's 3 isn't the lowest. So the claim might be incorrect because only Annika has the lowest, and Catriona doesn't share that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could mean they both have low margins compared to others. But if Annika has a margin of 1 and Catriona 3, then it's true that both have among the lower margins but not necessarily the absolute lowest together.\n\nWait, no, because 1 is lower than 3, so Catriona doesn't have the lowest. So the claim might be incorrect because only Annika has the lowest, not both of them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew won with the lowest number of strokes (margin of victory). \n\n- Annika S\u00f6renstam achieved a margin of 1 stroke in 2003, which is the lowest recorded in the table.\n- Catriona Matthew's lowest margin was 3 strokes in 2009.\n\nSince only Annika has the absolute lowest margin, the claim that both have the lowest is incorrect. \n\n**Answer: FALSE**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So already there's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Row 4: year 2010, champion is Yani Tseng. So the claim is incorrect here because it says Ji Yal Shin was champion in 2010, but actually it was Tseng.\n\nAlso, looking at the margin of victory for row 2010, it's 1 stroke. The claim mentions a 9-stroke margin, which doesn't match.\n\nSo even if there were a Ji Yal Shin who beat Inbee Park, in 2010, according to the table, that's not what happened. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Ji Yal Shin was the champion in 2010 and won by 9 strokes against Inbee Park, which doesn't align with the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the golf tournament table is true or false. The claim says: \"in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36517 less than yani tseng in 2011.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the data provided in the table. Each row represents a different year, from 2003 to 2013. The claim specifically mentions two years: 2012 and 2011, so I'll focus on rows related to these years.\n\nLooking at the table, for 2012 (Row 2), the champion is \"jiyai shin\" with a purse of 2,750,000 and a winner's share of 428,650. For 2011 (Row 3), the champion is \"yani tseng\" with a purse of 2,500,000 and a winner's share of 392,133.\n\nWait, the claim mentions that in 2012, jiyal shin earned 36,517 less than yani tseng in 2011. But looking at the numbers, jiyai shin's winner's share in 2012 is 428,650, and Yani Tseng's in 2011 is 392,133. The difference between these two would be 428,650 minus 392,133.\n\nLet me calculate that: 428,650 - 392,133 = 36,517. So the claim states that jiyai shin earned exactly this amount less than Yani Tseng in 2011. That seems to align with the numbers given.\n\nWait, but I should double-check the spelling of the names because sometimes there might be variations. The table lists \"jiyai shin\" and \"yani tseng.\" The claim says \"jiyal shin,\" which is a slight variation. Could it be a typo? Maybe, but assuming that both refer to the same person, then it's correct.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that there isn't any other relevant data that might affect this comparison, such as total purse or margin of victory, but the claim specifically mentions the winner's share, so those are the key cells.\n\nSo, based on the table data, in 2012, jiyai shin's winner's share was indeed $36,517 less than yani tseng's in 2011. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to compare the \"winner 's share\" of Jiyai Shin in 2012 with Yani Tseng's in 2011.\n\n- **Row 3 (2011)**: Champion is Yani Tseng with a winner's share of $392,133.\n- **Row 2 (2012)**: Champion is Jiyai Shin with a winner's share of $428,650.\n\nThe difference between these two amounts is:\n$428,650 - $392,133 = $36,517\n\nThis matches the claim that in 2012, Jiyal Shin earned $36,517 less than Yani Tseng in 2011. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
