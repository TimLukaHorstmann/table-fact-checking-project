    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the title of episode 102 in the series be we gotta stop meeting like this.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. It's talking about a specific episode, episode number 102, and its title. So, I need to find out if in the table provided, there is an entry for row corresponding to episode 102 with the title \"we gotta stop meeting like this.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has several columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, and us viewers (million). The rows are numbered from 1 to 17, but I notice that some row numbers don't start at 1; for example, row 16 is labeled as \"no in series: 117,\" which suggests that the episode numbers might not be continuous. Wait, actually, looking closer, each row has a \"no in series\" and \"no in season\" field. So, the first column seems to track the episode number within the season, and the second column tracks the season number.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's better to look at how the data is structured. Each row represents an individual episode with its details. For example, row 1 has \"no in series: 100,\" which likely means that it's the 100th episode in the series. Similarly, \"no in season: 1\" indicates it's the first episode of a particular season.\n\nSo, for the claim, I need to find the row where no in series is 102 because that would correspond to the 102nd episode in the series. Let me scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: no in series:100\nRow 2: no in series:102\nAh, here it is. So, row 2 has \"no in series:102,\" which matches the episode number we're looking for.\n\nNow, let's check the title of that row. The title listed for row 2 is \"we gotta stop meeting like this.\" That exactly matches the title given in the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. There's no discrepancy or missing information. So, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data as row 2 has the correct episode number and matching title.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"kenny smith write number 11 in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"kenny smith\" refers to a person, presumably a writer or director involved with the series. The name appears in several rows as the written_by column. For example, in Row 9, Kenny Smith is listed as the writer, and similarly in other rows like Row 10 and Row 14.\n\nNext, \"write number 11 in the season.\" I'm interpreting this as Kenny Smith being involved with Episode 11 in Season 1. So, I need to look at the table to see if there's an episode where Kenny Smith is listed as a writer for that specific episode, specifically in Season 11 or something similar.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: no_in_series, no_in_season, title, directed_by, written_by, original_air_date, and us_viewers. Since the claim mentions \"number 11,\" I think this refers to the episode number. So, I need to check if any row corresponds to Episode 11.\n\nWait, but the table starts with Row 1 as no_in_series: 100-101, which seems like the starting point. The episodes are numbered incrementally, and each row is an individual episode. So, looking for \"no_in_series: 11\" would indicate that this is Episode 11 in the series.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 11: no_in_series: 111, so that's beyond 11. Hmm, actually, maybe I need to check if any row has \"no_in_series: 11\". Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, each row starts with no_in_series and no_in_season numbers. So, for example, Row 1 is no_in_series:100-101, so that's the first two episodes in Series 1? Or maybe it's a numbering system I'm not fully getting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"number 11\" refers to Episode Number 11 of Season 1. So, looking through the table for an episode where written_by is Kenny Smith and no_in_series is 11 or something indicating that specific episode.\n\nWait, actually, in the table provided, each row has a unique no_in_series number, so perhaps each row corresponds to one episode in the series. So, to find Episode 11, I should look for a row where no_in_series is 11.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: no_in_series:100-101\nRow 2:102\nRow3:103\nRow4:104\nRow5:105\nRow6:106\nRow7:107\nRow8:108\nRow9:109\nRow10:110\nRow11:111\nRow12:112\nRow13:113\nRow14:114\nRow15:115\nRow16:117\nRow17:118\n\nWait, there's no row with no_in_series:11. The first rows are starting from 100-101 as Series 1? Or perhaps the numbering is per season. Wait, \"no in series\" and \"no in season\" columns.\n\nWait, maybe \"no_in_series\" refers to the episode number in the series, while \"no_in_season\" refers to the episode number within a particular season. So, for example, if a show has multiple seasons, each season might have 10 episodes, so no_in_series would be like S1E1, etc.\n\nBut in the table provided, it seems that \"no_in_series\" is an incremental number starting from 100-101 as Row 1. That's a bit confusing because usually, episode numbers don't go into the hundreds unless it's a very long-running show or perhaps the data is presented differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps each row represents one episode, with \"no_in_series\" being a unique identifier for that specific episode in the entire series. So, for example, Row 1 is Episode 100-101? That seems odd because episodes are usually numbered individually. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be \"no_in_series: 11\" or something similar.\n\nBut given that the claim mentions \"number 11,\" I think we're looking for an episode where Kenny Smith is the writer of Episode 11 in some season.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 9: no_in_series:109, written_by: Kenny Smith. So that's Episode 109? That doesn't match 11.\n\nWait, maybe \"number 11\" refers to the episode number within a season, like Season 1, Episode 11.\n\nSo in the table, looking for an entry where the episode is part of Season 11 or something else, but I don't see any rows indicating that. Alternatively, perhaps each row's no_in_series and no_in_season correspond to the overall series and individual season numbers.\n\nWait, maybe \"no_in_series\" refers to the overall series number, and \"no_in_season\" refers to the season within the series. For example, if a show has multiple seasons, then no_in_season would be 1 for Season 1, etc.\n\nBut in the table, the first row is no_in_series:100-101, which seems too high unless it's a different format.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"no_in_series\" is a typo and should be \"no_in_episode\" or something else. But given that I have to work with what's provided, I need to figure out if Kenny Smith wrote Episode 11 in any season.\n\nLooking through each row for written_by: Kenny Smith.\n\nRow 9: written_by: Kenny Smith\nRow 10: written_by: Kenny Smith\nRow14: written_by: Kenny Smith\n\nSo Episodes 109, 110, and 114 were written by Kenny Smith. None of these are Episode 11 in their respective seasons.\n\nTherefore, since there's no row where Kenny Smith is the writer for Episode 11 (assuming \"number 11\" refers to Episode 11), the claim must be FALSE.\n\nSo, I need to check which cells would support this conclusion. The relevant cells would be any rows where written_by is Kenny Smith, specifically if one of them corresponds to Episode 11 in a season.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"written_by\"},{\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"written_by\"},{\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"written_by\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"eric laneuville direct episode 106 in the series.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should identify what each part of the claim means. \"Eric Laneuville\" is a director's name, and \"episode 106\" refers to a specific episode number in the series. So the claim is stating that Eric Laneuville directed episode 106.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has information about an episode. The columns relevant here are \"directed by\" and \"no in series\". But wait, \"no in series\" seems like it's just a numbering for the episodes within the season or series. So, I should focus on the \"directed by\" column.\n\nI need to find row 106 because that's the episode number mentioned. However, looking through the table rows, I don't see a row with \"no in series\": 106. The closest are rows 5 and 6 with \"no in series\" values 105 and 106. Wait, no, row 5 is no in series:105, row 6 is no in series:106? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the table starts from Row 1 to Row 17. Each row has a \"no in series\" number. So, for example:\n\nRow 1: no in series:100\nRow 2: no in series:102\n...\nRow 5: no in series:105\nRow 6: no in series:106\n\nWait, so row 6 is no in series:106? That would mean that the actual episode number in the table is row 6, not row 106. So there's a confusion here between \"no in series\" as an internal season episode number and the actual overall episode number.\n\nBut in the table, each row has a unique \"no in series\" value starting from 100 up to 117 or so. So for example, Row 1 corresponds to no in series:100, which is the first episode of the season or series. So when looking for Eric Laneuville directing episode 106, I need to find the row where the directed by column is Eric Laneuville and \"no in series\" is 106.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: no series:100, directed by Salim Akil\nRow 2: no series:102, directed by Salim Akil\n...\nRow 5: no series:105, directed by Mary Lou Belli\nRow 6: no series:106, directed by Mary Lou Belli\n\nSo row 6 is the one with \"no in series\":106. The director for that episode is Mary Lou Belli, not Eric Laneuville.\n\nThen, looking further down:\n\nRow 7: no series:107, directed by Mary Lou Belli\nRow 8: no series:108, directed by Bille Woodruff\nRow 9: no series:109, directed by Salim Akil\nRow 10: no series:110, directed by Bille Woodruff\n...\nContinuing down, I see that Eric Laneuville is mentioned as the director in row 17: no series:118. So he directed episode 118.\n\nBut the claim is about episode 106 being directed by Eric Laneuville, which isn't the case because in row 6 (no series:106), Mary Lou Belli is the director.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Eric Laneuville directed episode 106. However, checking the table, row 106 doesn't exist as \"no in series\" goes up to 117. The actual episode 106 (row 6) was directed by Mary Lou Belli. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down the claim first.\n\nThe term \"air multiple time\" likely refers to an episode being aired more than once, perhaps in different contexts like reruns, syndication, or international broadcasts. So I need to check if episode 102 was aired multiple times according to the data provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a specific episode with details like title, director, writer, original air date, and US viewers count. The claim is about episode 102 specifically. \n\nI'll look for the relevant information in the table that pertains to whether this episode was aired multiple times. In the table, the columns related to airing are \"original air date\" and perhaps any other column indicating reruns or repeats.

Let me carefully go through each row of the table and look for instances where Kenny Smith is involved as a writer.\n\nFirst, I'll identify which columns are relevant. The claim mentions \"written by: kenny smith,\" so I should focus on the 'written_by' column. Additionally, since the claim talks about episodes before Season 11, I need to check all rows where the 'no_in_series' number is less than 111 because Series 111 would be the start of Season 11.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: written_by is mara brock akil\nRow 2: erica montolfo - bura\nRow 3: marcos luevanos\nRow 4: kenya barris\nRow 5: hale rothstein, mary lou belli (directed by)\nWait, no\u2014written_by is hale rothstein and mary lou belli.

This is the first occurrence of Kenny Smith as a writer.\nSo this is one relevant row.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 10: written by kenny smith again.\nRow 11: directed by billie woodruff, written by marcos luevanos\nRow 12: mary lou belli and jenifer rice - genzuk henry\nRow 13: nzingha stewart director, written_by hale rothstein\nRow 14: kenny smith as writer again.\nRow 15: written by jenifer rice - genzuk henry\nRow 16: erica montolfo - bura\nRow 17: eric laneuville director, written by kenya barris\nRow 18 (no data given? Or is it a typo, since the last row is Row 17).\n\nWait, actually, looking at the table, there are 17 rows listed. So I think the last entry is Row 17.\n\nSo, from Rows 9, 10, and 14, Kenny Smith is the written_by. Now, I need to check if all these episodes are before Season 11.\n\nThe claim says \"before season 11.\" Looking at 'no_in_series' numbers:\n\nRow 9: no_in_series: 109, which is less than 111 (since Season 1 starts at 101 and goes up; so 110 would be the last of Season 10, and 111 is Season 11).\n\nWait, actually, each row has \"no_in_series\" as a unique number, starting from 100 to 117, but sometimes there are gaps. For example, Row 16 is no_in_series: 116? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRow 1: 100-101\nRow 2: 102\nWait, actually, each row's 'no_in_series' seems to be sequential but with some missing numbers. However, for determining before Season 11, any episode where 'no_in_series' is less than 111 would be considered before Season 11.\n\nSo, checking the rows where Kenny Smith wrote:\n\nRow 9: no_in_series: 109 (Season 10)\nRow 10: no_in_series: 110 (Season 10)\nRow 14: no_in_series: 114 (Season 10)\n\nWait, looking at the table again:\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check each row's 'no_in_series':\n\nRow 1: no_in_series: 100-101\nRow 2: 102\nRow 3:103\nRow4:104\nRow5:105\nRow6:106\nRow7:107\nRow8:108\nRow9:109\nRow10:110\nRow11:111 (no data? Wait, no\u2014the rows go up to Row 17.\n\nWait, perhaps the 'no_in_series' is just a range or individual numbers. It's unclear, but I think for each row, the 'no_in_series' is unique and sequential starting from 100 onwards, possibly with some skipped numbers.\n\nBut regardless of whether it's a range or individual, the key point is that any episode where Kenny Smith wrote before no_in_series reaches 111 (i.e., Season 11) would count. So in the table, all episodes up to Row 17 are considered, but if an episode has 'no_in_series' less than 111, it's before Season 11.\n\nSo Rows 9,10,14 have 'written_by' as Kenny Smith and their no_in_series is 109,110,114. These are all before 111, so they are indeed before Season 11.\n\nTherefore, Kenny Smith wrote episodes that are before Season 11, which supports the claim.
