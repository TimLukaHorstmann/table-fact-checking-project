    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. First, let me understand the claim. It seems like it's saying that no games were played when the goals for are less than 30. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense because if a team has fewer than 30 goals for, does that mean they didn't play any games? Or maybe the claim is trying to say that in all games, the team scored at least 30 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team with various statistics. The columns relevant here are \"goals for\" and possibly others like \"games played,\" but let's focus on the claim first. The claim seems to imply that for every game a team played, they had at least 30 goals for. So I need to check if any team has a goals for total less than 30 in their games.\n\nWait, no, actually, the claim might be miswritten. It says \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30.\" Maybe it's saying that there are no games where the goals for are less than 30. Alternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue and the intended meaning is that in any game, the team scored at least 30 goals. But looking at the table, I can check each row's \"goals for\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Ottawa Hockey Club - Goals For: 90\nRow 2: Montreal Wanderers - 74\nRow 3: Montreal Victorias - 76\nRow 4: Quebec Hockey Club - 57\nRow 5: Montreal Hockey Club - 49\nRow 6: Montreal Shamrocks - 30\n\nSo, all teams have at least 30 goals for. Wait, but the last row has exactly 30. So according to this, no team has less than 30. Therefore, in every game they played, their goals for were not less than 30.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because the claim is phrased as \"no game be play when...\" which might mean that if any game had goals for less than 30, such games shouldn't have been played. But according to the table, none of them are below 30. So the claim would be TRUE because there are no games where goals for are less than 30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is that no team played a game with goals for less than 30. Since all teams have at least 30, then yes, it's TRUE.\n\nSo the relevant cells to check would be each row's \"goals for\" column because we need to ensure none are below 30. But since they're all above or equal, it's TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that no games were played when the goals for were less than 30. All teams in the table have at least 30 goals for, so the claim holds true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
