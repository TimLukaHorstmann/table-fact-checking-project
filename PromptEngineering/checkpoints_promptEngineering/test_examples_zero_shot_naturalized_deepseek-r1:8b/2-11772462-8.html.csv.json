I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table and then identify the relevant cells that support my conclusion.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"On March 27, Washington be the visitor when they play Tampa Bay.\" So, I'm looking for a game where the home team is Tampa Bay, the visitor is Washington, and the date is March 27.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with several attributes: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. The key columns here are \"date,\" \"visitor,\" \"home,\" and possibly others like \"score\" or \"decision.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check for March 27:\n\n- Row 1: March 1\n- Row 2: March 3\n- Row 3: March 5\n- Row 4: March 8\n- Row 5: March 9\n- Row 6: March 12\n- Row 7: March 14\n- Row 8: March 16\n- Row 9: March 18\n- Row 10: March 19\n- Row 11: March 21\n- Row 12: March 25\n- Row 13: March 27\n- Row 14: March 29\n\nSo, the game on March 27 is row 13.

The claim says: \"after the March 8 game at home, Boston have a record of 32 - 29 - 8.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asserting. It's about Boston's record after a specific game on March 8 when they were playing at home. So I need to find in the table the row where the date is March 8 and the visitor is Boston because that would be the home team for Boston.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\nRow 1: March 1, visitor Toronto, so home is Washington.\nRow 2: March 3, visitor Boston, but wait, no. Wait, in Row 2, the visitor is Boston, so the home is Washington.\nWait, no, actually, the visitor is the team that's visiting, so when the visitor is Boston, it means they're away, and the home team would be whoever's home, which is Washington.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"after the March 8 game at home, Boston have a record...\" So I need to find the row where the date is March 8, the home is Boston. Hmm, let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 1: March 1, visitor Toronto, home Washington.\nRow 2: March 3, visitor Boston, home Washington.\nRow 3: March 5, visitor Washington, home Buffalo.\nRow 4: March 8, visitor Washington, home Boston. Oh, wait, so on March 8, the home team is Boston because the visitor is Washington.\n\nSo in Row 4, date is March 8, and the home is Boston. So that's the game after which Boston's record is being checked.\n\nNow, looking at the 'record' column for Row 4: it says 32 - 29 - 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The claim says \"after the March 8 game at home, Boston have a record of 32 - 29 - 8.\" So that would be after this particular game, so we need to check if their record is indeed 32-29-8.\n\nLooking at Row 4's 'record' cell: it's 32 - 29 - 8. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the row for March 8 and the 'record' column, which is in Row 4.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The date is March 8, home is Boston, so that's the game after which their record is checked. So yes, in Row 4, after this game, their record would be 32-29-8.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true, and the relevant cells are Row 4 (index 3) and the 'record' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the March 8 row where Boston's home game resulted in a 32-29-8 record. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is about the home team Washington having a specific record on March 12. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the table. It looks like each row represents a game with several attributes: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row has multiple data points.\n\nThe claim is: \"on march 12, the home team of washington have a record of 33 - 30 - 8.\" So, I need to check if on March 12, Washington's home record is exactly 33-30-8.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that there are 14 rows. I should scan through each row to find the one where the date is March 12 and the home team is Washington.\n\nLet me go row by row:\n\nRow 1: March 1, visitor Toronto, score 3-2... Home is Washington. So this is a game on March 1, not March 12.\nRow 2: March 3, visitor Boston, home Washington. Not March 12.\nRow 3: March 5, visitor Washington, home Buffalo. Not relevant for the home team being Washington on March 12.\nRow 4: March 8, visitor Washington, home Boston. Again, not March 12 and home is Boston here.\nRow 5: March 9, visitor Pittsburgh, home Washington. Not March 12.\nRow 6: March 12, visitor Calgary, home Washington. This seems to be the relevant row because the date matches March 12 and the home team is Washington.\n\nNow, looking at Row 6's record column, it shows \"33 - 30 -8\". Wait, that's exactly what the claim says. So on March 12, when Washington was the home team, their record was indeed 33-30-8.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Their record is 33-30-8.\n\nI'll go through the table row by row to check these conditions.\n\nStarting from Row 0: date is March 1, visitor is Toronto, so not March 12 and home isn't Washington yet.\nRow 1: March 3, home is Washington but score is 2-10. The record here is 31-28-8, which doesn't match.\nRow 2: March 5, home is Buffalo, so no.\nRow 3: March 8, home is Boston, not Washington.\nRow 4: March 9, home is Washington with a record of 32-30-8. Close but not 33-30-8.\nRow 5: March 12. Let's check this one carefully. Date matches March 12. Visitor is Calgary, home is Washington. The score is 2-3. Now the record for this row is 33-30-8. That seems to match all conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if any other rows also meet these criteria on March 12. Since each date is unique in a month, there's only one March 12 row, which is Row 6. So that's the only relevant row for this claim.\n\nSo, the record on March 12 when Washington was home is indeed 33-30-8.

Not Carolina.\n\nRow 3: home: washington, but visitor: buffalo. No.\n\nWait no, row 3 is March 5, home: washington, visitor: buffalo? Wait the table says Row 3: visitor: washington, so it's visitor: washington, home: buffalo. So not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each row to see if home is Washington and visitor is Carolina.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 1: March 1, home: washington, visitor: toronto.\n\nRow 2: March 3, home: washington, visitor: boston.\n\nRow 3: March 5, home: buffalo, visitor: washington.\n\nWait, in Row 3, the home is buffalo and visitor is washington.

Let me check each row carefully.\n\nLooking at Row 1: visitor is Toronto, not Boston.\nRow 2: visitor is Boston, score 2-10, home is Washington, record is 31-28-8.\nRow 3: visitor is Washington, so that's about Washington as the away team; no Boston here.\nRow 4: visitor is Washington again, not Boston.\nRow 5: visitor is Pittsburgh, not relevant.\nRow 6: visitor is Calgary, nope.\nRow 7: Atlanta, no.\nRow 8: Boston is the visitor here, so this is about Washington as home vs. Boston visitors. The record for this game is 35-30-8.\nRow 9: visitor is Washington, not Boston.\nRow 10: visitor is Washington again.\nRow 11: visitor is Washington, nope.\nRow 12: Calgary again? Wait, no, Row 12's visitor is Washington, home is Carolina.\nRow 13: Washington visitor, home Tampa Bay.\nRow 14: Washington visitor, home Florida.\n\nWait a second, I'm looking for rows where the \"visitor\" is Boston because that would mean Boston is playing away games. So when visitor is Boston, we can check their records.\n\nLooking at Row 2: visitor is Boston, record is 31-28-8.\nRow 8: visitor is Boston, record is 35-30-8.\nWait, but the claim says 34-30-9, which I don't see in any row. Let me confirm each row where \"visitor\" is Boston.\n\nRow 2: March 3, visitor Boston, home Washington, record after game: 31-28-8 (wins, losses, ties). So that's 31 wins, 28 losses, 8 ties.\nRow 8: March 16, visitor Boston, home Washington, record becomes 35-30-8. So after this game, the record is 35 wins, 30 losses, 8 ties.\n\nNowhere in the table does a row with \"visitor\" as Boston show a record of 34-30-9. The closest I see is Row 2 at 31-28-8 and Row 8 at 35-30-8. So the claim must be FALSE because there's no instance where Boston has a home record of 34-30-9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"at home.\" Wait, in the table, each row's \"home\" field indicates which team is hosting. So when \"visitor\" is Boston, their away games are against the home team listed (like Washington or others). Therefore, to check Boston's home record, we'd need rows where \"home\" is Boston and \"visitor\" is someone else. But looking through all 14 rows, I don't see any row where \"home\" is Boston. The only times Boston is mentioned are as visitors.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data showing Boston's home games, the claim about their 34-30-9 record at home can't be verified because the necessary information isn't present in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"boston have a 34 - 30 - 9 record at home\" is **FALSE** because there are no rows in the provided table where Boston is the home team with such a record.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
