The claim is: \"76059 attend when the result be l 20 -17\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It seems like it's saying that there was a game where the attendance was 76,059 and the result was a loss (l) with a score of 20-17.\n\nI'll start by looking at each row in the table to find where the attendance is 76,059 and check if the corresponding result is a loss of 20-17. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 1: attendance 57406\nRow 2: 62063\nRow 3: 69814\nRow 4: 44433\nRow 5: 64578\nRow 6: 52728\nRow 7: 76059 \u2192 This is the attendance we're looking for.\nNow, what's the result in row 7? The result column says \"l 20 -17\". So that matches both the attendance and the result specified in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because there's a row where attendance was 76,059 and the result was a loss by 20-17.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 7 where attendance is 76059 and the result is l 20 -17.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
