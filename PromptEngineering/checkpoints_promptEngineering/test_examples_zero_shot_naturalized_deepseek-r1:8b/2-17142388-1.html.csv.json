    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe table has six rows, each representing different events with details like date (from), aircraft, carrier, air wing, tail code, and area. The columns are: from, aircraft, carrier, air wing, tail code, and area.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the area be westpac the from be 7 june 1962 and 1 august 1963 while when the area be vietnam war with tail code np - 3xx the from be 18 july 1968\"\n\nI need to check if this statement is accurate by referring to the table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. When the area is westpac, the dates are 7 June 1962 and 1 August 1963.\n2. When the area is vietnam war and the tail code is np-3xx, the date is 18 July 1968.\n\nLet me check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: Area westpac with from dates 7 June 1962 and 1 August 1963.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: from 7 June 1962, area westpac. Tail code is ah-3xx.\nRow 2: from 1 August 1963, area westpac. Tail code is ah-3xx.\n\nSo both these dates are indeed associated with westpac and different tail codes (ah-3xx in both cases). That matches the first part of the claim. So far, this looks correct.\n\nNow, the second part: Area vietnam war with tail code np-3xx, from date 18 July 1968.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 6 is the only one where area is vietnam war and tail code is np-3xx. The from date here is 18 July 1968. So that matches as well.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any other rows with vietnam war and np-3xx. Scanning through all six rows:\n\nRows 1-5: area is westpac except for Row 6 which is vietnam war.\n\nSo only Row 6 has the combination of vietnam war and np-3xx, and the date matches 18 July 1968.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI need to identify which cells in the table support this. For each part:\n\nFirst part: Area westpac with from dates 7 June 1962 (Row 1) and 1 August 1963 (Row 2). The columns for these would be row_index and area, but actually, the claim is about when area is westpac, so we need to find rows where area is westpac. So relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 1: area=westpac\n- Row 2: area=westpac\n\nSecond part: Area vietnam war and tail code np-3xx in Row 6.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be Rows 1,2,6.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"when the carrier be cva - 34 the air wing be cvg - 16 with tail code ah - 3xx and area westpac.\" So, the claim is stating that all these attributes\u2014carrier, air wing, tail code, and area\u2014are specific values when certain conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several fields: from, aircraft, carrier, air wing, tail code, area. My task is to check if there's any row where the carrier is CVA-34, the air wing is CVG-16, the tail code starts with AH-3 (so AH-3xx), and the area is Westpac.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: \n- Carrier: CVA-34\n- Air Wing: CVG-16\n- Tail Code: AH-3xx\n- Area: Westpac\nAll conditions are met here. So this row supports the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Carrier: CVA-34\n- Air Wing: CVW-16 (not CVG-16)\n- Tail Code: AH-3xx\n- Area: Westpac\nHere, the air wing doesn't match CVG-16; it's CVW-16. So this row doesn't support all conditions.\n\nRow 3:\n- Carrier: CVA-34\n- Air Wing: CVW-16 (same as above)\n- Tail Code: AH-3xx\n- Area: Vietnam War (not Westpac)\nThe area doesn't match, so no support.\n\nRow 4:\nSame as Row 3, all same values except area is still Vietnam War. No support.\n\nRow 5:\nSame carrier, air wing CVW-16, area Vietnam War. No support.\n\nRow 6:\nCarrier: CVA-19 (not CVA-34)\nAir Wing: CVW-21\nTail Code: NP-3xx\nArea: Vietnam War\nNone of these match the claim's conditions.\n\nSo only Row 1 satisfies all the attributes mentioned in the claim.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. Let's start by understanding the claim and then checking each relevant cell.\n\nThe claim states: \"the tail code be ah - 3xx for every section except for 1 when the tail code be np - 3xx with from 18 july 1968.\"\n\nBreaking this down, the claim is saying that in all sections except one (specifically when it's row 1), the tail code is AH-3XX. However, there's a point where on \"from 18 July 1968,\" the tail code becomes NP-3XX instead.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 1: from June 7, 1962, tail code AH-3XX\nRow 2: August 1, 1963, same tail code\nRow 3: April 5, 1965, AH-3XX\nRow 4: May 26, 1966, AH-3XX\nRow 5: June 16, 1967, AH-3XX\nRow 6: July 18, 1968, NP-3XX\n\nSo, in all rows except row 1 (which is the first one), does the tail code switch to NP-3XX on a specific date?\n\nWait, the claim says \"except for 1 when...\" So row 1 is the exception. Then, from July 18, 1968 onwards, it should be NP-3XX.\n\nBut in the table, only row 6 (July 18, 1968) has NP-3XX. The other rows have AH-3XX except for row 1 and 2 which are earlier dates.\n\nWait, the claim seems to say that all sections except row 1 use AH-3XX, but when a certain date (July 18, 1968), it switches to NP-3XX.\n\nBut in the table, only row 6 has NP-3XX. So, does this mean that from that point onward, the tail code changes? But looking at the dates:\n\nRow 1: June 7, 1962\nRow 2: August 1, 1963\nRow 3: April 5, 1965\nRow 4: May 26, 1966\nRow 5: June 16, 1967\nRow 6: July 18, 1968\n\nSo each row represents a different date. Now, the claim is saying that except for row 1 (the first entry), all others have AH-3XX until July 18, 1968, when it becomes NP-3XX.\n\nBut in the table, after row 5 comes row 6 with NP-3XX. So from row 2 onwards, the tail code is AH-3XX except for row 6 where it's NP-3XX.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"except for 1 when...\", so maybe the exception is row 1, and then when a specific date occurs, it changes. So, after July 18, 1968 (row 6), does the tail code change? But in the table, only row 6 has NP-3XX, and there are no further rows beyond that.\n\nSo, looking at all the sections except row 1 (which uses AH-3XX), but from a certain point (July 18, 1968) onwards, it should switch to NP-3XX. However, in the table, only one instance of NP-3XX exists, so perhaps the claim is referring to that.\n\nBut let's analyze each row:\n\nRow 1: tail code AH-3XX\nRow 2: same as above\nRow 3: same\nRow 4: same\nRow 5: same\nRow 6: NP-3XX\n\nSo, from row 2 onwards (up to row 5), it's AH-3XX. Then on July 18, 1968, it switches to NP-3XX.\n\nThe claim says that except for row 1, all other sections have AH-3XX until a specific date when it becomes NP-3XX. But in the table, only one instance of NP-3XX exists. So does this mean that after that date, the tail code remains NP-3XX? Or is it just on that date?\n\nThe claim's wording is a bit unclear. It says \"the tail code be ah - 3xx for every section except for 1 when the tail code be np - 3xx with from 18 july 1968.\"\n\nSo, perhaps it means that in all sections except row 1 (which uses AH-3XX), on the date July 18, 1968, it changes to NP-3XX.\n\nBut in the table, only row 6 is after that point. So maybe the claim is implying that from that date onwards, all subsequent entries would use NP-3XX. However, in the given table, there are no further rows beyond row 6. So perhaps the claim is saying that except for row 1, all others up to a certain point (row 5) have AH-3XX, and then on July 18, it changes.\n\nBut looking at the data, the tail code doesn't change for each row after row 5. Only row 6 has NP-3XX, which is a single instance.\n\nSo the claim is saying that except for row 1, all other sections (rows 2-6) have AH-3XX until July 18, 1968, when it becomes NP-3XX.\n\nBut in reality, only row 6 changes. So does the tail code change only once on that date, or does it continue to be NP-3XX after that?\n\nThe table doesn't show any further rows, so we can't know if after July 18, 1968, the tail code remains NP-3XX.\n\nBut the claim specifically mentions \"from 18 july 1968,\" which suggests that on or after that date, the tail code is NP-3XX. So in row 6, it's NP-3XX, but beyond that, there are no more rows to check.\n\nSo, considering the table provided, does the claim hold?\n\nYes, because except for row 1, all other rows (rows 2-5) have AH-3XX until July 18, 1968. On that date (row 6), it changes to NP-3XX.\n\nBut wait, in the table, row 6 is on July 18, 1968, and the tail code becomes NP-3XX. There are no more rows after that, so we can't confirm if it remains NP-3XX beyond that point. However, the claim doesn't specify that it must remain NP-3XX after that date but just mentions the switch on that date.\n\nTherefore, considering only the given data, the tail code does switch to NP-3XX on row 6 (July 18, 1968), which aligns with the claim. All other rows except row 1 have AH-3XX up until that point.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the claim is true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe statement holds true based on the provided data. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Data:**\n   - The table lists six entries with dates from 1965 to 1968.\n   - Each entry has a \"Tail Code\" which is either AH-3XX or NP-3XX.\n\n2. **Analyze the Tail Codes:**\n   - **Row 1 (May 26, 1966):** AH-3XX\n   - **Rows 2 to 5 (various dates up to June 16, 1967):** AH-3XX\n   - **Row 6 (July 18, 1968):** NP-3XX\n\n3. **Interpret the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that except for Row 1, all other sections have AH-3XX until July 18, 1968, when it switches to NP-3XX.\n\n4. **Evaluate Consistency with Data:**\n   - From Rows 2 to 5, the tail code is consistently AH-3XX.\n   - On July 18, 1968 (Row 6), it changes to NP-3XX.\n   - There are no subsequent rows in the data beyond Row 6.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The provided data supports the claim that except for the first entry, all other entries have AH-3XX until July 18, 1968, when the tail code switches to NP-3XX.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is true based on the given data.",

The claim says: \"when the carrier be cva - 34 the air wing be cvg - 21 with tail code ah - 3xx and area westpac.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim to see what it's asking for. The claim mentions three main things: the carrier (CVA-34), the air wing (CVG-21), the tail code (AH-3XX), and the area (WESTPAC). So, I need to check if there are any rows in the table that match all these conditions.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: Carrier is CVA-34, but the air wing is CVG-16, which doesn't match CVG-21. The tail code here is AH-3xx, same as in the claim, and the area is WESTPAC. So this row matches carrier and area but not the air wing.\n\nRow 2: Carrier is CVA-34, air wing is CVW-16 (again not CVG-21), tail code AH-3xx, area WESTPAC. Similar to Row 1, so it's close but doesn't satisfy all conditions.\n\nRow 3: Carrier CVA-34, air wing CVW-16, same as above. Tail code and area match. So again, not the air wing specified in the claim.\n\nRow 4: Same as Row 3. All except area are the same; area is Vietnam War, which doesn't match WESTPAC.\n\nRow 5: Again, CVA-34, CVW-16 for air wing, AH-3xx, and Vietnam War area. Not matching all conditions.\n\nRow 6: Here, carrier is CVA-19 instead of CVA-34, so that's already a mismatch. Air wing is CVW-21, which matches the claim. But since the carrier doesn't match, this row can't be used to support the claim.\n\nSo none of the rows have all three conditions met: carrier CVA-34, air wing CVG-21, and tail code AH-3xx in WESTPAC area.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by any row in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by understanding the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the area be westpac the from be 7 june 1962 and 1 august 1965 while when the area be vietnam war with tail code np - 3xx the from be 18 july 1968.\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. I think it's trying to say that for the area WestPac, two specific dates are associated (7 June 1962 and 1 August 1965), and for Vietnam War with tail code NP-3XX, only one date applies (18 July 1968).\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row has \"from\" dates, aircraft details, carrier, air wing, tail code, and area. Let me go through each relevant column.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the claim is about specific areas: WestPac and Vietnam War. So columns like Area are important here.\n\nThe claim mentions two dates for WestPac:\n- 7 June 1962\n- 1 August 1965\n\nLooking at the table, I see that Row 1 has \"from\" as 7 June 1962 with area WestPac. That's one date from the claim.\n\nRow 2 is 1 August 1963, but the area isn't specified. Wait, in the table, does it have an Area column? Let me check: Yes, each row ends with \"area:\" followed by a value. So Row 2's area is WestPac as well because the user didn't specify otherwise. So, both Rows 1 and 2 are part of WestPac.\n\nWait, but the claim says when the area is WestPac, the from dates are 7 June 1962 and 1 August 1965. However, in Row 2, the \"from\" date is 1 August 1963, not 1965. So that doesn't match the claim's second date.\n\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim seems to suggest two from dates for WestPac: June 7, 1962 and August 1, 1965. But in the table, only Row 1 has June 7, 1962, and Row 2 is August 1, 1963, which doesn't align with the claim's second date of August 1, 1965.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. It could be that for WestPac, there are two specific dates: one in 1962 (7 June) and another in 1965 (1 Aug). Let me check if any other rows have area WestPac with those dates.\n\nLooking at Row 3 to Row 6, their areas are Vietnam War. So, only Rows 1 and 2 are WestPac. Row 1 has 7 June 1962, but Row 2 is 1 August 1963, not 1965. Therefore, the claim's second date (1 Aug 1965) isn't present in the table for WestPac.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each row again:\n\nRow 1: 7 June 1962, area WestPac.\nRow 2: 1 August 1963, area WestPac? Wait, no\u2014the user didn't specify Row 2's area in the table. Wait, looking back, each row ends with \"area: westpac\" or similar.\n\nWait no, actually, in the initial problem statement, the table is given as:\n\nEach row starts with \"from:\" and then has various fields, ending with \"area: ...\".\n\nSo Row 1: area is WestPac.\nRow 2: area is also WestPac? Because it's not specified otherwise. But wait, no\u2014the user might have missed that. Let me see the exact wording.\n\nWait, looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: from: 7 june 1962, ... area: westpac.\nRow 2: from: 1 august 1963, ..., area: westpac.\nRow 3: from: 5 april 1965, ..., area: vietnam war.\nAnd so on.\n\nSo Rows 1 and 2 are WestPac. So the claim says that when area is WestPac, \"from\" dates are 7 June 1962 and 1 August 1965. But in the table, Row 2's from date is 1 Aug 1963, not 1965. Therefore, the claim's second date doesn't match.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe it's saying that for WestPac, two dates are used: 7 June 1962 and 1 August 1965. But in the table, only Row 1 matches the first date, and there's no Row with 1 Aug 1965 for WestPac.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider if any other rows in WestPac have from dates around that period. Let me check:\n\nRow 2 is 1 August 1963\u2014maybe it's a typo, but the claim mentions 1 August 1965, which isn't present.\n\nSo for the first part of the claim (WestPac), only Row 1 matches the date. Therefore, the second part (1 Aug 1965) isn't present in the table as a WestPac area row.\n\nNow, moving on to the Vietnam War part: tail code NP-3XX and from date 18 July 1968.\n\nLooking at the table, Rows 3 to 6 have area Vietnam War. Let's see:\n\nRow 3: 5 April 1965\nRow 4: 26 May 1966\nRow 5: 16 June 1967\nRow 6: 18 July 1968\n\nSo only Row 6 has the from date matching 18 July 1968, and it's associated with tail code NP-3XX.\n\nTherefore, for the Vietnam War part of the claim, the from date 18 July 1968 does exist in the table with area Vietnam War and tail code NP-3XX.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim says that when area is WestPac, two dates (7 June 62 and 1 Aug 65) are used. But only 7 June 62 exists; 1 Aug 65 doesn't. However, for the Vietnam War with NP-3XX, the date 18 July 68 does exist.\n\nSo since one part of the claim isn't fully supported (only one date instead of two), but the other part is correct, does that make the whole claim false?\n\nWait, the claim is a bit unclear. It says \"when area be westpac the from be 7 june 1962 and 1 august 1965 while when area be vietnam war with tail code np - 3xx the from be 18 july 1968.\"\n\nSo it's asserting two things:\n\n1. For WestPac, the from dates are 7 June 62 and 1 Aug 65.\n\nBut in reality, only 7 June 62 exists for WestPac.\n\n2. For Vietnam War with NP-3XX, the from date is 18 July 68\u2014which does exist.\n\nTherefore, since one part is incorrect (only one date instead of two), the claim isn't fully accurate. Hence, the answer should be that the claim is false because it incorrectly specifies dates for WestPac.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether the given statement about specific dates associated with certain areas is correct based on the provided data.\n\n**Given Statement:**\n- When the area is WestPac, the \"from\" dates are July 7, 1962, and August 1, 1965.\n- When the area is Vietnam War with a tail code of NP-3XX, the \"from\" date is July 18, 1968.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **WestPac Section:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 1 (7 June 1962) matches the first date.\n     - No row exists with August 1, 1965, under WestPac.\n   - Conclusion: Only one of the two specified dates is correct for WestPac.\n\n2. **Vietnam War Section:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 6 (18 July 1968) matches the given date and tail code.\n   - Conclusion: This part of the statement is accurate.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\nThe claim is partially correct but not fully accurate because it incorrectly specifies the second date for WestPac. Therefore, the entire statement is false based on the provided data.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"When the from be 26 may 1966 the area be vietnam war and when the from be 16 june 1968 the from be also vietnam war.\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Maybe it's trying to say that on May 26, 1966, and June 16, 1968, the area was Vietnam War for both instances.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has several columns: from (date), aircraft, carrier, air wing, tail code, and area.\n\nFirst, I'll focus on the first part of the claim: when \"from\" is May 26, 1966. Looking through the table, let's see if there's a row with that date.\n\nRow 4 has \"from\": 26 May 1966. The area for this row is Vietnam War. So that condition checks out.\n\nNow, the second part: when \"from\" is June 16, 1968, and the area is also Vietnam War. Let me check the table again. Row 5 is June 16, 1967, which is the same as one of the rows but not June 1968. Row 6 has \"from\": 18 July 1968, but the carrier is CVA-19 instead of CVA-34 and the air wing is CVW-21, so it's a different row.\n\nWait, there's no row with from: 16 June 1968. The closest dates are Row 5 (June 16, 1967) and Row 6 (July 18, 1968). So the claim mentions June 16, 1968, but the table doesn't have that exact date. Therefore, there's no row with from: 16 June 1968.\n\nSince one part of the claim isn't supported by the table\u2014there's no entry for June 16, 1968\u2014it means the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is checking two dates: May 26, 1966, and June 16, 1968. The first date corresponds to a row where the area is Vietnam War. However, there is no such row as June 16, 1968 in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"When the 'from' be 18 July 1968, the area be Vietnam War; and when the 'from' be 7 June 1962, the area also be from Vietnam War.\" So essentially, it's asserting that for two specific dates (18 July 1968 and 7 June 1962), the corresponding row entries in the table both have \"Vietnam War\" listed under the \"area\" column.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: from=7 June 1962, area=Westpac\nRow 2: from=1 August 1963, area=Westpac\nRow 3: from=5 April 1965, area=Vietnam War\nRow 4: from=26 May 1966, area=Vietnam War\nRow 5: from=16 June 1967, area=Vietnam War\nRow 6: from=18 July 1968, area=Vietnam War\n\nFirst, I need to check the row where \"from\" is 18 July 1968. That's Row 6, and its \"area\" is indeed Vietnam War.\n\nNext, the claim also mentions when \"from\" is 7 June 1962. Looking at Row 1, that's the first row with \"from\" as 7 June 1962. The area there is Westpac, not Vietnam War.\n\nSo, the claim says both these rows have Vietnam War as their area. But for 7 June 1962, it's actually Westpac. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because one of the two specified 'from' dates doesn't match the \"Vietnam War\" area.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that both dates specified (18 July 1968 and 7 June 1962) have \"Vietnam War\" as their area. However, upon checking the table:\n\n- **18 July 1968** (Row 6): Area is Vietnam War.\n- **7 June 1962** (Row 1): Area is Westpac.\n\nSince Row 1's area doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"area\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"area\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the tail code be ah - 3xx for every section except for 2 when the tail code be np - 3xx with from 18 july 1968.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about the \"tail code\" which seems to refer to a specific identifier in the table. The term \"section\" isn't clearly defined here. Maybe it refers to different operational areas or time periods covered by each row.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Tail code is AH-3XX\n- Row 2: Tail code is AH-3XX\n- Row 3: Tail code is AH-3XX\n- Row 4: Tail code is AH-3XX\n- Row 5: Tail code is AH-3XX\n- Row 6: Tail code is NP-3XX\n\nThe claim says that except for one section, the tail code is AH-3XX. It also mentions that in another section, specifically from 18 July 1968, the tail code changes to NP-3XX.\n\nSo I need to check if all sections (rows) have AH-3XX except for Row 6, which has NP-3XX. Also, the claim refers to a specific date: 18 July 1968, which is Row 6.\n\nLet me list out each row:\n\n1. 7 June 1962 - AH-3XX\n2. 1 August 1963 - AH-3XX\n3. 5 April 1965 - AH-3XX\n4. 26 May 1966 - AH-3XX\n5. 16 June 1967 - AH-3XX\n6. 18 July 1968 - NP-3XX\n\nSo except for Row 6, all others have AH-3XX. The claim says that the only exception is when the tail code becomes NP-3XX from 18 July 1968. That matches exactly with Row 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because in every section (row) except Row 2 (since it's the one where the change happens), the tail code is AH-3XX, and Row 6 uses NP-3XX starting from that specific date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Tail Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Tail Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Tail Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Tail Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Tail Code\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Tail Code\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
