The claim says: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean, release november 27th, 2012, be the stable version of the software.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if any match this description.\n\nRow 1 mentions the browser as Android Browser with an operating system of Android. The latest stable release is listed as 4.2.1 Jelly Bean from November 27, 2012. It also has specific values for Theora, H264, VP8, and VP9. This seems to directly match the claim.\n\nRow 2 is about Chromium, with no specific browser version mentioned except it's N/A. So this doesn't relate.\n\nRow 3 talks about Google Chrome but lists a different release date (October 15, 2013) and a newer stable release number than Jelly Bean. So not relevant.\n\nRows 4-9 mention other browsers like Internet Explorer, Konqueror, Safari, etc., with their own versions and dates, none of which match the specific claim about Android's 4.2.1 Jelly Bean from November 27, 2012.\n\nSo the only row that matches is Row 1. I need to check what columns are relevant here. The claim refers to \"browser: android browser,\" \"operating system: android,\" and \"latest stable release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 ).\" Therefore, the relevant columns are browser, operating system, and latest stable release.\n\nI'll structure this into a JSON object with row_index as 0 and the three column names.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on Row 1 of the table where the Android Browser's stable release matches the description.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table has information about different browsers and their versions across various operating systems. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim says: \"the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0.\" So I need to check if this statement matches any data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different browser, along with details like operating system, latest stable release, Theora, H264, VP8/WebM, and VP9/WebM. The columns are: browser, operating system, latest stable release, Theora, h264, vp8 (webm), vp9 (webm).\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"android browser\" running on Android. So I should look for a row where both the browser name is 'Android Browser' and the operating system is 'Android'.\n\nLet's scan through each row:\n\nRow 1: browser is 'android browser', OS is 'android'. That seems to fit. Let me check its Theora and H264 versions.\n\nIn Row 1, Theora is 2.3, which matches the claim. H264 is 3.0, so that's also a match. So this row supports both parts of the claim.\n\nI should also consider if there are other rows that might accidentally fit, but since each browser name is unique (like Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer), and only Row 1 has 'android browser', that's the only relevant row.\n\nSo both Theora and H264 versions in this row match the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is Row 1 with column 'Theora' and 'h264'.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theora\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"}]}",

The claim is: \"google chrome support both vp8 (webm) 6.0 and vp9 (webm) 29.0.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table provided because it contains detailed information about different browsers and their respective versions of these video codecs. My goal is to verify if Google Chrome indeed supports both VP8 WebM 6.0 and VP9 WebM 29.0.\n\nI'll start by locating rows related to Google Chrome in the table. Scanning through the table, I see that Row 3 is about Google Chrome. Let's look at the relevant columns for this row: \n\n- Browser: Google Chrome\n- Operating System: 30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\n- Latest stable release: 30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\n- VP8 WebM: 6.0\n- VP9 WebM: 29.0\n\nSo, according to Row 3, Google Chrome does support both VP8 WebM version 6.0 and VP9 WebM version 29.0.\n\nI should check if there are any other rows for Google Chrome, but from the table provided, it seems that only Row 3 is relevant to Google Chrome. The other browsers listed (like Chromium, Internet Explorer, Safari, Konqueror) don't pertain to this claim since they are different browsers or operating systems.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in Row 3 of the table, the claim holds true because both VP8 and VP9 WebM versions mentioned by the claim are supported by Google Chrome.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we check the relevant row for Google Chrome. The table shows that in Row 3, Google Chrome supports VP8 (WebM) 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) 29.0.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about Konqueror supporting only VP8 WebM 4.4 but not VP9 is true or false by checking the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant rows in the table. The claim mentions Konqueror, so I should look for rows where the browser is Konqueror. Checking each row:\n\nRow 1: Browser is Android, not Konqueror.\nRow 2: Browser is Chromium.\nRow 3: Google Chrome.\nRow 4: Internet Explorer.\nRow 5: Internet Explorer again.\nRow 6: Another Internet Explorer.\nRow 7: Browser is Konqueror. So this is the relevant row.\n\nNext, I need to check the columns related to VP8 and VP9 for Konqueror. The claim says Konqueror supports only VP8 WebM 4.4 but not VP9. \n\nLooking at Row 7:\n- vp8 (webm): 4.4\n- vp9 (webm): no\n\nSo, the VP8 is supported with version 4.4, and VP9 is not supported as it's marked 'no'.\n\nNow, comparing this to the claim: The claim states that Konqueror supports only VP8 WebM 4.4 but not VP9. This matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are in Row 7 for both VP8 and VP9 columns.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether the claim about Konqueror supporting only VP8 (WebM) 4.4 but not VP9 (WebM) is true, I checked the relevant row in the table.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: The row where the browser is Konqueror is Row 7.\n2. **Check VP8 and VP9 support**:\n   - For VP8 (WebM), the value is 4.4.\n   - For VP9 (WebM), the value is \"no\".\n3. **Compare with the claim**: The claim matches exactly what's in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are in Row 7 for both columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"when theora be 2.3 and the h264 be 3.0 , the vp8 ( webm ) be r47759.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its conditions. There are two conditions here:\n\n1. Theora version must be 2.3.\n2. H264 version must be 3.0.\n\nAnd based on these, we need to check if Vp8 (WebM) is r47759.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find any rows that satisfy both conditions.\n\nStarting with Row 1:\n- Theora: 2.3\n- H264: 3.0\nSo, this row has both conditions met. Now, check Vp8 (WebM): it's 2.3 in this row. But the claim says it should be r47759. So this doesn't match.\n\nRow 2:\n- Theora: r18297 (not 2.3)\nSo condition not met. Skip.\n\nRow 3:\n- Theora: 3.0\nNot matching 2.3. Skip.\n\nRow 4:\n- Theora: manual install (not 2.3). Skip.\n\nRow 5:\n- Theora: no. Skip.\n\nRow 6:\n- Theora: no. Skip.\n\nRow 7:\n- Theora: 4.4. Doesn't match. Skip.\n\nRow 8:\n- Theora: no. Skip.\n\nRow 9:\n- Theora: manual install. Not 2.3. Skip.\n\nSo, only Row 1 meets both conditions of Theora being 2.3 and H264 being 3.0. In this row, Vp8 (WebM) is listed as 2.3, which does not equal r47759. Therefore, the claim's assertion about Vp8 being r47759 isn't correct for any matching rows.\n\nSince none of the relevant rows support the claim, it must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theora\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"h264\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me first understand the claim.\n\nThe claim states: \"When VP8 (WebM) be 6.0, and VP9 (WebM) be 29.0, the operating system be window.\" \n\nSo, I need to check if there's any row in the table where both VP8 is 6.0 and VP9 is 29.0, and the operating system is Windows.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: VP8 is 2.3, so no.\nRow 2: VP8 is r47759, which doesn't look like a version number we're checking for.\nRow 3: VP8 is 6.0 and VP9 is 29.0. Operating system here is \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\". Wait, the OS isn't explicitly stated as Windows. It just says \"operating system: 30.0.1599.101...\" without specifying the name. So maybe this row doesn't clearly say the OS is Windows.\n\nRow 4: VP8 is manual install and VP9 is no.\nRow 5: Both are no.\nRow 6: No for both.\nRow 7: VP8 is 4.4, so no.\nRow 8: Neither is 6.0 or 29.0.\nRow 9: VP8 is manual install.\n\nWait, in Row 3, the operating system might be a Windows version since it's mentioned as \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\". Maybe that implies it's Windows? Or could it be another OS?\n\nThe claim specifies that when both VP8 and VP9 are at specific versions, the OS is window (Windows). So I need to see if any row matches all three: VP8=6.0, VP9=29.0, OS=Windows.\n\nLooking again, only Row 3 has VP8=6.0 and VP9=29.0. But what's its OS? It says \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\". The term in parentheses is usually the build number for Windows, like major.minor.patch.build. So this is likely a Windows version. Therefore, the OS is Windows.\n\nSo Row 3 matches all conditions: VP8=6.0, VP9=29.0, and OS=Windows. That would make the claim TRUE because there's at least one row that satisfies all parts of the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by Row 3 where VP8 is 6.0, VP9 is 29.0, and the operating system is Windows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"vp8 (webm)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"vp9 (webm)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"operating system\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 ) be the stable version where the h264 be 9.0 and vp9 (webm) be no.\"\n\nFirst, I need to identify which parts of the claim correspond to the table data. Let's look at the table provided.\n\nRow 1: It mentions the browser as Android Browser with an operating system of Android. The latest stable release is listed as \"4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )\". Under video codecs, h264 is 3.0 and vp9 is no.\n\nSo, looking at the claim, it's talking about a version where h264 is 9.0 and vp9 is no. In Row 1, h264 is 3.0, not 9.0. So that doesn't match. Also, vp9 is marked as no, which does match.\n\nRow 4: It's for Internet Explorer on Windows with a release date of October 17, 2013, but the claim refers to November 27, 2012, so this row isn't relevant.\n\nRow 5 and Row 6 also refer to different browsers (Internet Explorer) and don't match the version dates mentioned in the claim.\n\nLooking at Row 1 again, the h264 is 3.0, not 9.0 as claimed. The vp9 is no, which aligns with the claim, but since h264 isn't matching, the entire statement isn't fully supported.\n\nI think the key points are that the version in question (4.2.1 jelly bean) should have h264 at 9.0 and vp9 as no. But from Row 1, h264 is only 3.0. Therefore, the claim is not entirely correct because one of the conditions isn't met.\n\nSo, I need to check which cells are relevant. The version mentioned in the claim corresponds to Row 1.
