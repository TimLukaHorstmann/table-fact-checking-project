Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim itself. It states that Frank Lobiondo is a member of the Republican Party. To verify this, I need to check the relevant information in the table.\n\nLooking through each row, I should find where Frank Lobiondo is mentioned. Let me scan each row's \"incumbent\" column. \n\nRow 1: Incumbent is Rob Andrews (Democratic)\nRow 2: Incumbent is Frank Lobiondo\nRow 3: Jim Saxton\nRow 4: Chris Smith\nRow 5: Marge Roukema\nRow 6: Bob Franks\nRow 7: Bill Pascrell\nRow 8: Steve Rothman\nRow 9: Don Payne\nRow 10: Rodney Frelinghuysen\nRow 11: Mike Pappas lost re-election, and the incumbent is him.\n\nSo, Frank Lobiondo is in Row 2. Now, looking at that row's \"party\" column, it says Republican. That matches the claim. \n\nAdditionally, checking the results, he was re-elected with 66% against Derek Hunsberger. So, his party affiliation as Republican is confirmed.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information elsewhere in the table that would suggest otherwise.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. Each row represents a district in New Jersey with various details: district number, incumbent, party, first elected year, election results, and candidates' percentages. My goal is to find information about Jim Saxton's party affiliation.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions \"jim saxton be in the republican party.\" So I need to verify if Jim Saxton is affiliated with the Republican Party according to the table.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table:\n\n- Row 1: The incumbent is Rob Andrews, party Democratic.\n- Row 2: Frank Lobiondo, Republican.\n- Row 3: Jim Saxton is listed here as the incumbent, party Republican. So this directly shows his affiliation.\n- The rest of the rows don't mention Jim Saxton.\n\nSince Row 3 explicitly states that Jim Saxton's party is Republican, there's no need to check other rows. This provides clear evidence supporting the claim.\n\nI should also make sure I'm interpreting the data correctly. Each row starts with \"district: new jersey X\", followed by incumbent details.

The claim is: \"frank lobiondo be a republican and be first elect in 1994\". \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into two parts. The first part is that Frank Lobiondo is a Republican. The second part is that he was first elected in 1994.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to see if any mention Frank Lobiondo. Starting from Row 1, district 1: the incumbent is Rob Andrews, so not him. Row 2: district 2 has Frank Lobiondo as the incumbent with party Republican. So that checks out for the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the year he was first elected. The row 2 states his first elected year is 1994. That matches the second part of the claim.\n\nWait, but I should make sure there are no other entries for Frank Lobiondo in the table. Scanning through all rows, only Row 2 has him as incumbent. So, it seems he was indeed a Republican and first elected in 1994.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"Frank Lobiondo be a republican and be first elect in 1994,\" we need to check if Frank Lobiondo is a Republican and when he was first elected.\n\n1. **Check Party Affiliation**: Look for rows where the incumbent is Frank Lobiondo.

The claim seems to state that these two are the candidates where the incumbent is Bill Pascrell.\n\nAdditionally, the claim might be saying that the incumbent is Bill Pascrell, which matches the 'incumbent' column in Row 8.

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the candidate in the district whose incumbent be bill pascrell bill pascrell and rodney frelinghuysen\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down. It seems to be saying that there are two incumbents mentioned: Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen. The claim is about the candidate in the district where either of these incumbents is running.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all districts where Bill Pascrell or Rodney Frelinghuysen are the incumbents. \n\nFirst, let me go through each row to identify who the incumbents are:\n\n- Row 1: Incumbent is Rob Andrews (D)\n- Row 2: Frank Lobiondo (R)\n- Row 3: Jim Saxton (R)\n- Row 4: Chris Smith (R)\n- Row 5: Marge Roukema (R)\n- Row 6: Bob Franks (R)\n- Row 7: Bill Pascrell (D) \u2192 This is one of the names mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 8: Steve Rothman (D)\n- Row 9: Don Payne (D)\n- Row 10: Rodney Frelinghuysen (R) \u2192 This is the other name mentioned in the claim.\n- Row 11: Mike Pappas (R), but he lost re-election.\n\nSo, the relevant districts are District 7 and District 10 because those are where Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen are incumbents respectively.\n\nNow, I need to check if the claim is about these two districts. The claim mentions \"the candidate in the district whose incumbent be...\" which suggests it's referring to a specific district, but the wording is unclear. It could mean either of those two districts or both.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is trying to say that there are candidates where the incumbents are Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen. So, in each of their respective districts, who are the candidates running against them?\n\nLooking at District 7 (Row 7): Incumbent is Bill Pascrell (D), and he was re-elected with 62% against Matthew Kirnan (R). The candidate is Bill Pascrell.\n\nDistrict 10 (Row 10): Incumbent is Rodney Frelinghuysen (R) who was re-elected with 68% against John Scollo (D).\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the candidate in the district whose incumbent be...\" So for each of these districts, the candidate is the incumbent. However, the wording seems off because the incumbents are the candidates themselves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that both Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen were candidates in their respective districts, but they are incumbents, so they are already the candidates.\n\nI'm a bit confused about what exactly the claim is asserting. It says \"the candidate in the district whose incumbent be bill pascrell bill pascrell and rodney frelinghuysen.\" That could mean that there's a district where both are incumbents, but looking at the table, each district has only one incumbent.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is saying that in the districts of Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen, those candidates are running. But since they're incumbents, their names are already listed as the candidates in their respective districts.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is trying to say that both Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen are candidates in the same district, but from the table, each has their own distinct districts: District 7 for Pascrell and District 10 for Frelinghuysen. So they aren't in the same district.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be incorrect because Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen are incumbents in different districts, not the same one. Alternatively, if the claim is stating that there are two candidates named Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen, but looking at the table, each district has only one incumbent.\n\nWait another angle: maybe the claim is saying that in their respective districts, both of them are candidates, which they are as incumbents. So perhaps the claim is TRUE because it's referring to the correct districts where these incumbents are running.\n\nBut the way the claim is phrased is a bit unclear. It says \"the candidate in the district whose incumbent be...\" which might imply that there's only one such district, but from the table, there are two: District 7 and District 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to both as if they're in the same district or implying they're running against each other, which isn't the case. They are in different districts.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the claim: \"the candidate in the district whose incumbent be bill pascrell bill pascrell and rodney frelinghuysen\"\n\nThe wording is a bit confusing. It could be that it's trying to say that in some district, the incumbent is either Bill Pascrell or Rodney Frelinghuysen, but both are being mentioned together.\n\nBut looking at the table, each district has only one incumbent. So if we consider all districts where these two are incumbents, there are two such districts: 7 and 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be incorrect because it's referring to two separate districts, not a single district where both are incumbents. Or perhaps the claim is correct in pointing out that these two are the candidates in their respective districts, but the phrasing is unclear.\n\nI think I need to determine whether the claim is asserting something accurate about the data.\n\nThe claim mentions \"the candidate\" in the plural sense with \"be bill pascrell and rodney frelinghuysen,\" which might mean that there are multiple districts where these are the candidates. But each district only has one candidate as the incumbent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo or misphrasing. Maybe it should say that both are incumbents in their respective districts, so the statement is accurate but the phrasing is confusing.\n\nIn any case, based on the table, the claim seems to be pointing towards two specific districts where these individuals are the candidates (incumbents). Therefore, the information is correct, but the wording might be unclear.\n\nSo, considering that the claim refers to the existence of these two incumbents in their respective districts, I think it's a correct statement. Thus, the answer would be that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe statement asserts that there are candidates in specific districts where Bill Pascrell and Rodney Frelinghuysen are the incumbents. Based on the provided data:\n\n- In District 7, Bill Pascrell (D) is the incumbent candidate.\n- In District 10, Rodney Frelinghuysen (R) is the incumbent candidate.\n\nThese are two separate districts with their respective incumbents. Therefore, the statement is accurate as it correctly identifies these candidates in their respective districts. \n\n**Answer:** The statement is TRUE.",
