    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"hoboken , new jersey be where a private school that be found in 1870 be locate\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about a location in Hoboken, New Jersey where a private school was founded in 1870 is located. So essentially, it's asking if there's a private school listed in the table with both the location as Hoboken, New Jersey and a founding year of 1870.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find any schools that match these criteria. The table has 25 rows, each representing a different school with various attributes like school name, location, control (public or private), type, enrollment, and founded year.\n\nI'll go row by row:\n\nRow 1: Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Not relevant as it's in Ohio, not New Jersey.\n\nRow 2: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. No.\n\nRow 3: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA. No.\n\nRow 4: California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA. No.\n\nRow 5: Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY. No.\n\nRow 6: Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO. No.\n\nRow 7: Colorado Technical University, Colorado Springs, CO. No.\n\nRow 8: Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL. No.\n\nRow 9: Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA. No.\n\nRow 10: Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL. No.\n\nRow 11: MIT, Cambridge, MA. No.\n\nRow 12: Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI. No.\n\nRow 13: Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO. No.\n\nRow 14: Montana Tech of the University of Montana, Butte, MT. No.\n\nRow 15: New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ. Location matches Hoboken? Wait, Hoboken is another location in New Jersey, but this school is in Newark. So not Hoboken.\n\nRow 16: New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM. No.\n\nRow 17: Oregon Institute of Technology, Klamath Falls, OR. No.\n\nRow 18: Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY. Not NJ.\n\nRow 19: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY. No.\n\nRow 20: Rochester Institute of Technology, Henrietta, NY. No.\n\nRow 21: Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, IN. No.\n\nRow 22: South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD. No.\n\nRow 23: Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ. Oh, this one is in Hoboken, New Jersey. Let's check the founded year. Founded: 1870. That matches both criteria\u2014location and founding year.\n\nSo, Stevens Institute of Technology fits the claim perfectly. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a private school founded in 1870 is located in Hoboken, New Jersey. The table shows that Stevens Institute of Technology is located in Hoboken, New Jersey and was founded in 1870, making it a private institution.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Stevens Institute for Technology be based in Rapid City, South Dakota\" is TRUE or FALSE by checking the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem is asking.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's stating that Stevens Institute for Technology has its base in Rapid City, South Dakota. So, I need to verify if this information matches any row in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like name, location, control type, and others. My task is to check the relevant columns for Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nThe first step is to locate the exact row in the table that corresponds to Stevens Institute of Technology. I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Air Force Institute of Technology\n- Row 2: California Institute of Technology\n- ...\n- Continuing until I reach Row 23: Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nSo, Row 23 is the correct row for Stevens Institute of Technology.\n\nNow, looking at Row 23's details:\n- School Name: Stevens Institute of Technology\n- Location: Hoboken, New Jersey\n\nThe claim says that Stevens is based in Rapid City, South Dakota. However, according to the table, Stevens is actually located in Hoboken, New Jersey. There's no mention of Rapid City or South Dakota in its location.\n\nNext, I'll check other relevant columns beyond just the location. The claim might also be referring to other attributes like control type, enrollment, or founding year, but since the main information is about the location, that's what's critical here.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in other columns for Stevens Institute of Technology that would support the claim. Therefore, the claim doesn't align with the table data provided.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim must be FALSE because Stevens Institute of Technology is not located in Rapid City, South Dakota.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Stevens Institute of Technology is based in Rapid City, South Dakota. However, upon reviewing the table, Stevens Institute of Technology is actually located in Hoboken, New Jersey. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"location\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim states: \"air force institute of technology be a private institute found in 1889.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n1. It is a private institution.\n2. It was founded in 1889.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various attributes like control (public or private), and the founding year. The task is to find if the relevant cells match these conditions for \"air force institute of technology.\"\n\nI'll start by locating the row for \"air force institute of technology.\" Scanning through the rows, I see it's Row 1.\n\nNow, checking the control column for Row 1: It says \"public.\" This means the claim about it being a private institution is incorrect. So already, one part of the claim doesn't hold up.\n\nNext, verifying the founding year. The founded column for Row 1 shows \"1919,\" which is later than 1889 as stated in the claim. This second part also doesn't match.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are not met (it's actually public and was founded in 1919), the entire claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"control\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
