    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about the table provided is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"the people from the country / region of vietnam speak the language vietnamese.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly needs to be verified here. It seems like the claim is stating that in Vietnam, the language spoken is Vietnamese. So, I should look into the table to find information related to Vietnam and its languages.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are 25 rows, each representing a different country or region along with their respective languages, premiere dates, seasons, and status. Let's focus on the row for Vietnam, which is Row 25.\n\nIn Row 25:\n- Country/Region: vietnam\n- Languages: vietnamese\n- Premiere: 2012 - 09 - 15 to 15 - 09 - 2012\n- Seasons: 1 2\n- Status: ongoing\n\nSo, the table directly lists \"vietnamese\" as the language spoken in Vietnam. This matches exactly with the claim. Therefore, there's no discrepancy here.\n\nNow, considering whether any other rows might be relevant. The claim is specifically about Vietnam, so I should only consider Row 25. However, to ensure thoroughness, I'll quickly scan through all other rows to see if any country speaks a language called \"vietnamese\" or if there's any conflicting information elsewhere.\n\nUpon reviewing the entire table:\n- None of the other countries list \"vietnamese\" as their language.\n- Each row corresponds to specific countries and their languages, which don't overlap with Vietnam in this aspect.\n\nTherefore, Row 25 is the only relevant cell that supports the claim. There's no need to consider other cells because the claim is about Vietnam, and all other rows are unrelated to this specific statement.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim holds true as supported by the information in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the show in Israel be in the Hebrew language and be ongoing.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows might be relevant to this claim. Since the claim mentions Israel, I'll look for rows where the country/region is Israel. Scanning through the table, I see Row 12: country / region: Israel.\n\nNext, I need to check the languages column for that row. The languages listed are Hebrew. That matches the first part of the claim regarding the language.\n\nNow, checking the status column, it says \"discontinued.\" Hmm, the claim states that the show is ongoing, but according to this, it's discontinued. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the row. Let me double-check Row 12. Yes, country/region: Israel, languages: Hebrew, seasons: 1 2 3, status: discontinued. So it's not ongoing as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while the language part is correct, the status is incorrect. The show in Israel is not ongoing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"status\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
