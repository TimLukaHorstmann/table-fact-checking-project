The claim is: \"marc surer score 4 more point in 1985 compare to 1984.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out who Marc Surer is and how he's involved with these entries. Looking at the table, each row represents a different entrant in various years, with details like year, team, chassis, engine, and points.\n\nI need to identify if there's an entry for Marc Surer in 1984 and 1985, specifically checking if his points increased by 4 from 1984 to 1985. Alternatively, maybe the claim is about someone else, but given the name \"marc surer,\" I should look for that exact name.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: 1979, entrant: team ensign... Doesn't mention Marc Surer.\nRow 2: 1980, team ats... No Marc Surer.\nRow 3: Same year as above, same entrant. No.\nRow 4: 1981, entrant: ensign racing... Not Marc Surer.\nRow 5: 1981, theodore racing team... No Marc Surer here either.\nRows 6-8: 1982 and 1983 entries for arrows racing team. No mention of Marc Surer.\nRow 9: 1984, entrant: barclay nordica arrows bmw. Not Marc Surer.\nRow 10: Same as above but different chassis. Still not Marc Surer.\nRow 11: 1985, motor racing developments ltd, Brabham BT54... Hmm, is that Marc Surer? The entrant here is \"motor racing developments ltd,\" which doesn't match Marc Surer's name.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Is there a row where the entrant is Marc Surer in either 1984 or 1985?\n\nLooking through all rows, none of them have \"marc surer\" as the entrant. So it seems like there's no data supporting that Marc Surer was an entrant in these years with points increasing by 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to a different driver or team named Marc Surer that isn't listed here. But without any entries in the table matching his name, I can't confirm any points for him in 1984 and 1985.\n\nTherefore, since there's no relevant data about Marc Surer in the provided table, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Marc Surer scoring 4 more points in 1985 compared to 1984. After examining each row of the table, none mention Marc Surer as an entrant in those years.

The claim says that Marc Surer scored a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986. \n\nFirst, I should look through each row of the table to see if any mention Marc Surer. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: year 1979, entrant is team ensign... doesn't seem like it mentions Marc Surer.\nRow 2: 1980, entrant is team ats... nope.\nRow 3: same as above, just different chassis number. No Marc Surer here either.\nRow 4: 1981, entrant is ensign racing... not him.\nRow 5: 1981, theodore racing team... still nothing.\nRow 6: 1982, arrows racing team with a4 chassis.

Maybe?\nWait, the column for points might be relevant here, but I don't see any mention of drivers' names.\n\nLooking at all the rows, there's no entry that explicitly mentions Marc Surer. So even though row11 has 5 points in 1985, without a name match, it doesn't support the claim.

The claim is: \"marc surer score 4 point 1 time less than he score 0 point.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Marc Surer, in some context where he scored 4 points, finished 1st compared to when he scored 0 points. Wait, maybe it's about race positions? So, is it claiming that when Surer scored 4 points, he finished 1st overall, while another time he scored 0 points and perhaps didn't finish as well?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year with details like entrant, chassis, engine, and points. I need to find if Marc Surer is mentioned in this table. Scanning through the 'entrant' column: team ensign, team ats, ensign racing, theodore racing team, arrows racing team, barclay nordica arrows bmw, motor racing developments ltd, barclay arrows bmw. I don't see Marc Surer listed as an entrant.\n\nWait, maybe Marc Surer isn't in this table? Or perhaps he's part of another team not listed here. But without seeing his name, it's hard to verify anything about him specifically. The claim refers to \"marc surer,\" so if he's not in the table, then there might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term 'points' is being used differently\u2014could it refer to points scored in a race? But without knowing which races Marc Surer participated in, or how his points compare across different years, it's difficult to assess. \n\nBut since the table doesn't mention Marc Surer at all, any claim about him would not be verifiable from this data. Therefore, the claim is based on information that isn't present in the table, making it either unsupported or outright false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could 'surer' refer to something else? Or perhaps the points and rankings are inferred elsewhere. No, without his specific entries, it's not possible to confirm the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the claim is about Marc Surer's performance in terms of points and finishing position. The table doesn't mention him, so there's no data to support or refute the claim. Therefore, the answer must be false because there's no evidence to back up the statement.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Marc Surer's performance, but his name isn't present in any row of the table.

The claim says: \"marc surer score 2 time as many point in 1986 than 1983.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly the claim is saying. It seems like it's about Marc Surer's points in 1986 versus 1983. Specifically, it suggests that in 1986, he scored twice as many points as he did in 1983.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find any entries related to Marc Surer for those years. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Year is 1979, so not relevant.\nRow 2: 1980, no mention of Marc Surer.\nRow 3: Also 1980, same as above.\nRow 4: 1981, entrant is Ensign Racing. Not Marc Surer.\nRow 5: 1981, Theodore Racing Team. No match.\nRow 6-8: These are for Arrows Racing Team in 1982 and 1983. No mention of Marc Surer here either.\nRow 9: 1984, Entrant is Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW. Not Marc Surer.\nRow 10: 1984 again, same entrant as above.\nRow 11: 1985, Motor Racing Developments Ltd with Brabham BT54. No match.\nRow 12: 1986, Entrant is Barclay Arrows BMW. Again, not Marc Surer.\n\nWait a minute, I just realized that the table might not have any entries for Marc Surer at all. Let me double-check each year to make sure.\n\nLooking through all the rows, the entrants are mostly teams like Ensign, ATS, Theodore, Arrows, Barclay Nordica, and Motor Racing Developments. None of these seem to be Marc Surer or any team associated with him in those years.\n\nIf Marc Surer isn't present in the table for either 1983 or 1986, then there's no data to verify his points for those years. Without that information, we can't confirm whether he scored twice as many points in 1986 compared to 1983 because there's nothing to compare.\n\nTherefore, since there's no relevant data about Marc Surer in the table for those specific years, the claim cannot be fully supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score a total of 8 points in the 2 race of 1981\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by breaking down what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"marc surer.\" I'm not immediately familiar with this name, but from the context of racing teams and points, it might refer to a driver or team associated with a specific chassis or engine. The years mentioned are 1981, specifically in two races. The total points scored is 8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an entry in a race, with details like year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. My goal is to find any rows that match the criteria of Marc Surer scoring 8 points in 2 races from 1981.\n\nI'll go through the table row by row, focusing on 1981 entries first. Let's see:\n\nRow 4: Year 1981, entrant Ensign Racing, chassis N180B, engine Cosworth V8, points 4.\nRow 5: Year 1981, entrant Theodore Racing Team, chassis TY01, engine Cosworth V8, points 4.\n\nI don't see any mention of Marc Surer in these rows. The entrants are Ensign and Theodore teams. Maybe Marc Surer wasn't racing in 1981? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the context.\n\nWait, maybe \"marc surer\" refers to a driver or team that's associated with one of these chassis types. For example, if Marc Surer was driving a car with a specific engine or chassis, that might be relevant. But looking at the table, there's no direct link provided between entrants and drivers. The entries are mostly about teams and their cars.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to total points over two races in 1981. So maybe Marc Surer participated in two races in 1981, each scoring 4 points, totaling 8. But in the table, the only entries for 1981 are rows 4 and 5, both with 4 points each but different entrants.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if there's a third race in 1981 where Marc Surer scored another 0 points, bringing the total to 8 over three races. But that doesn't fit the claim of two races.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"marc surer\" refers to an engine or chassis type. The table mentions Cosworth V8 and BMW STR-4T/C engines. Maybe in 1981, Marc Surer's cars had a total points from two races of 8. But again, without specific entries for Marc Surer, it's hard to confirm.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the claim is misinterpreted. Maybe \"marc surer\" refers to a team or car model that scored points across multiple years, but I'm not sure.\n\nLooking through all the rows, there are two entries in 1981 with 4 points each (rows 4 and 5). There's also row 8 for 1983 where arrows scored 4 points, but that's a different year. In 1984, there are two entries with 1 point each.\n\nI don't see any rows that mention Marc Surer or any entry in 1981 with 8 points. The highest points per race in 1981 are 4, and only two races are listed for that year.\n\nSo, based on the table provided, there's no evidence to support that Marc Surer scored a total of 8 points in two races of 1981. Therefore, the claim is likely FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"marc surer score a total of 8 point in the 2 race of 1981\" isn't supported by the table provided. There are no entries for Marc Surer or a team named Marc Surer in the year 1981 with points totaling 8 over two races.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim involves a specific driver or team (\"marc surer\") scoring 8 points across two races in 1981.\n   \n2. **Examine the Table for 1981 Entries:**\n   - Rows 4 and 5 (1981 entries) show different teams with 4 points each but no mention of Marc Surer.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - No data supports Marc Surer's participation in two races in 1981 totaling 8 points.\n   \n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in both races in 1981. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the table provided and find all the rows related to Marc Surer from 1981. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nLooking at row 4: year is 1981, entrant is \"ensign racing,\" so that's probably not Marc Surer. Then row 5: year 1981, entrant \"theodore racing team.\" Hmm, that doesn't match Marc Surer either. \n\nWait, I might be missing something. Maybe Marc Surer was part of another team in 1981. Let me check the other rows. Row 6 is 1982 with arrows racing, and row 7 is also 1982 with arrows a5. Then rows 8,9,10 are 1983 and 1984. Row 11 is 1985 with motor racing developments, so that's after 1981.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm not looking at the right team names. Let me think\u2014Marc Surer was an entrant in some races. He might have been part of the Theodore Racing Team or another team around that time. Let me see if there are any rows with his name in 1981.\n\nWait, row 5 is Theodore Racing Team in 1981, but it's points are 4. If Marc Surer was driving for them, maybe he scored those points. But the claim says he scored the same points in both races of 1981. So I need to check if there were two races that year where he participated and got the same points.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, row 4 is 1981 with Ensign Racing, points 4, and row 5 is Theodore Racing Team, points 4 as well. If Marc Surer was in both of these entries, but I think he might have been only in one of them. Or maybe he wasn't involved at all in 1981.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to two races where he scored the same points, but from the table, it's not clear if he was even present that year. Maybe I'm missing some data or perhaps the team names don't match up.\n\nWait, looking again: row 4 is Ensign Racing with 4 points in 1981, and row 5 is Theodore Racing Team also with 4 points in 1981. If Marc Surer was part of both teams, which seems unlikely, then maybe he scored the same points. But that doesn't make sense because a driver can't be driving for two different teams in the same race.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to two races where he had the same points, but I don't see any other rows with his name or team in 1981. So maybe the claim is false because there's only one entry for 1981 and it's unclear if he even participated that year.\n\nWait, no\u2014Marc Surer did race in 1981. Let me think again. He was part of the Theodore Racing Team, I believe. So row 5 would be him, with points 4. But I don't see another entry for him in 1981 where he scored the same points. Maybe the claim is false because there's only one race that year where he participated, so he can't have the same points in both races.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to two races within 1981 where he got the same points, but from the table, it seems he had only one race that year. So maybe the claim is false because there aren't two races that year for him.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The claim says Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in both races in 1981. To verify this, I need to check if he participated in at least two races that year and got the same points in each.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 4: 1981, Ensign Racing, points 4.\n\nRow 5: 1981, Theodore Racing Team, points 4.\n\nSo, if Marc Surer was part of both these teams in 1981, which doesn't make sense because a driver can only be with one team at a time. So perhaps he was only part of one of them, meaning there's only one race that year for him, so the claim is false because he didn't have two races to compare.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he did participate in multiple races that year but didn't score the same points each time. From the table, it seems both entries are for 1981 with points 4, but I don't know if they're separate races or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the two entries are from different races. So if Marc Surer was part of Ensign Racing in one race and Theodore Racing Team in another, he might have scored 4 points each time, making the claim true. But that's assuming he was part of both teams, which is impossible because a driver can't drive for two teams simultaneously.\n\nSo, perhaps the claim is false because Marc Surer couldn't have been in both teams at the same time, meaning he didn't have two races where he scored 4 points each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in both races in 1981 is **FALSE**. This is because there is only one entry for 1981 involving Marc Surer (the Theodore Racing Team with 4 points), indicating he likely participated in a single race that year, making it impossible to have two races with the same points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says that Marc Surer scored a total of 6 points in 1986, which is 3 more than in 1985. \n\nFirst, I should understand what each column represents. From the table structure, it looks like each row has information about the year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. The 'entrant' column likely refers to the team name, but Marc Surer's name isn't directly listed here. Hmm, maybe 'Marc Surer' is not explicitly mentioned in the table, which could be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to infer that Marc Surer was part of one of these teams? Or maybe the points are associated with drivers rather than teams. The term \"points\" might refer to driver points. So each row might represent a different entrant (team) and their performance in various races, possibly with different drivers.\n\nLooking at the claim again: it's about Marc Surer's points in 1986 being 6, which is 3 more than in 1985. So I need to find Marc Surer's points for those two years.\n\nBut in the table provided, I don't see any entry for Marc Surer. The entrants listed are team ensign, team ats, ensign racing, theodore racing team, arrows racing team, and barclay nordica arrows bmw, among others. None of these seem to include Marc Surer.\n\nIf Marc Surer isn't in the table, then there's no data to support or contradict the claim. Therefore, I can't verify whether he scored 6 points in 1986 or 3 more than in 1985 because his information isn't present here.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim cannot be fully supported because the relevant data about Marc Surer isn't provided in the table. Thus, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if Marc Surer's points in 1986 were 6 and 3 more than in 1985.

The claim is: \"marc surer score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total.\" Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It mentions \"marc surer\" and talks about his points. The wording is a bit confusing though. It says he scored 6 point 2 times more than he scored 2 points in total. Wait, that doesn't make much sense at first glance. Maybe it's trying to say that Marc Surer's score is six points two (like 6.2) times higher than his score of two points. Or perhaps it's a typo or misphrasing.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to see if there's any data related to Marc Surer. Let me scan through each row's entrant column. The table has entries from 1979 to 1986. Each row lists the year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. So, for example, in Row 4, the entrant is \"ensign racing,\" not Marc Surer.\n\nI don't see any rows where the entrant is \"Marc Surer\" or any variation of his name. This suggests that there's no data about him in this table. Therefore, the claim can't be verified because he doesn't appear as an entrant in any of the years listed. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Could the name be spelled differently? Let me check again. The entries include teams like \"team ensign,\" \"team ats,\" \"ensign racing,\" \"theodore racing team,\" \"arrows racing team,\" and \"barclay nordica arrows bmw.\" None of these match Marc Surer. \n\nSo, since there's no data on Marc Surer in the table, the claim can't be supported or contradicted by it. Therefore, the answer would be FALSE because the information needed to assess the claim isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim references \"marc surer,\" but his name doesn't appear as an entrant in the table, so the necessary data is absent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"marc surer score the same amount of points in 3 races in 1982.\" \n\nFirst, I should check if Marc Surier even exists as an entrant in the year 1982. Looking through each row, I see that the entries are for teams like arrows racing team, ensign racing, Theodore Racing Team, etc., but I don't spot any mention of \"Marc Surer\" or \"Surier\" in any of the rows from 1980 to 1984. \n\nWait, let me look more carefully. Scanning each row, the entrant names are team ensign, team ats, ensign racing, Theodore Racing Team, arrows racing team, motor racing developments ltd, and barclay arrows bmw. There's no Marc Surier listed as an entrant in 1982.\n\nSo if Marc Surer didn't race in 1982, then he couldn't have scored points in three races that year. Therefore, the claim must be false because there's no evidence of him racing in 1982 with those three races and the same points.\n\nI should also make sure to identify which cells are relevant. Since all rows from 1980 to 1984 don't list Marc Surier as an entrant, but especially for 1982, looking at rows 6-8: in row 6, arrows a4 with points 3; row7, arrows a5 with points 3; row8, arrows a6 with points 4. These are the races in 1982 by arrows racing team. But since Marc Surier isn't listed as their entrant, those cells might not be relevant to his score.\n\nWait, actually, if Marc Surier wasn't an entrant in 1982, then he didn't participate, so his points for that year would be zero or non-existent.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"marc surer score a total of 9 point in his 4 race in 1982\". \n\nFirst, I should identify who Marc Surer is and look for his entries in the table. Looking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: entrant is team ensign.\nRow 2: entrant is team ats.\nRow 3: same as row 2.\nRow 4: entrant is ensign racing.\nRow 5: entrant is theodore racing team.\nRow 6: entrant is arrows racing team.\nRow 7: same as row 6.\nRow 8: same as row 6.\nRow 9: entrant is barclay nordica arrows bmw.\nRow 10: same as row 9.\nRow 11: entrant is motor racing developments ltd.\nRow 12: entrant is barclay arrows bmw.\n\nNone of these entrants are Marc Surer. So, I don't see any entries for him in the table. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Maybe his name is spelled differently or he's listed under another name. But no, all entrants seem to be team names, not individual drivers.\n\nSo if Marc Surer isn't present in any of the rows, then there's no data to support his points in 1982. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE because it's based on information that doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",
