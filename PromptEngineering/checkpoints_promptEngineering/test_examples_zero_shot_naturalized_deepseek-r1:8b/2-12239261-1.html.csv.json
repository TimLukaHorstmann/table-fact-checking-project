    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"During season 1991, west indies be the holder at the end of the series and the host england be 5 and have the result of series drawn.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to series number 14 because it's mentioned as the 1991 season. Series 14 is indeed in the table as Row 14.\n\nLooking at Row 14: The series is 14, season is 1991, host is England. The tests are 5, England has 2 wins, West Indies has 2, and there's a draw. The result of the series is 'series drawn', and the holder at the end is West Indies.\n\nNow, I need to check each part of the claim against this row. \n\n1. Host: The claim says host is England. Row 14 confirms that.\n2. Holder at the end: Claim states it's West Indies. Row 14 also shows West Indies as the holder.\n3. Series result: Claim mentions it's a series drawn. According to Row 14, yes, it's a draw.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other relevant rows for context, but since each series is separate and series 14 directly corresponds to 1991, it's the primary row needed. Other rows might not be necessary unless they provide conflicting information, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by Row 14.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\"}]}",
