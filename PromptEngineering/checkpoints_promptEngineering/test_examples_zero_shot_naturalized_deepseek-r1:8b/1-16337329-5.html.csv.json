Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do' be the imperative and \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the past habitual.\" So, I need to check each part of this statement against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, which has rows 1 through 7. Each row corresponds to different grammatical categories like simple present/future, imperative, etc., for different pronouns and numbers.\n\nThe claim is talking about two forms: the imperative and the past habitual. The imperative form given in the claim is \"gar\u00e9s gares\" (from Row 3) which translates to \"may you do.\" So I need to check if this is indeed the imperative as per the table.\n\nIn the table, under Row 3 (second person singular low-grade), the imperative is listed as \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares. Yes, that matches the claim. So the first part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, the past habitual form mentioned in the claim is \"garis gari.\" I need to find this in the table. Looking through each row, Row 3 again has the past habitual form listed as \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis. That's exactly what the claim states. So that part also matches.\n\nI should make sure there are no other relevant cells beyond these two because sometimes tables can have similar forms across different rows, but in this case, I don't see any duplicates for imperative or past habitual that would conflict. The claim specifically refers to Row 3's second person singular low-grade forms, which seem unique and correctly matched.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.

Let's break it down.\n\nThe first part of the claim says \"garis\u0304 gari\" is the past habitual. Looking at the table, the past habitual column is labeled as such. So I should check the third person singular low-grade row (Row 3) for garis\u0304 because that would be you (second person) in a lower grade. Wait, no, Row 3 is second person singular low-grade, so \"garis\" is the past habitual there.\n\nWait, let me correct that: The claim refers to \"you did,\" which is second person. So I'm looking for the past habitual form in the second person singular. That would be Row 3's past habitual column, which is \"\u0917aris\u0304 garis 'you did'.\" So yes, that matches.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim says \"garchas\" is the probable future. The probable future is listed under each row as well. For second person singular low-grade, the probable future is in Row 3's first column: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do.' So that also matches.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The claim says \"garis\u0304 gari\" and \"garchas.\" From the table:\n\nRow 3:\n- Past habitual: garis\u0304 garis 'you did'\n- Probable future: garchass garchas 'you (will) do'\n\nSo yes, both parts are correctly referring to Row 3's columns.

The relevant rows here are probably rows 6 and 7 because they deal with third person singular (Row 6) and perhaps others.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo is the injunctive form.\n2. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo is the past habitual form.\n\nI need to check if these correspond correctly based on the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo in Row 6, column \"injunctive.\" The table shows that for third person singular low-grade, the injunctive is indeed \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo. So this seems correct.\n\nNext, the second part: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo. Looking at Row 6 again under \"past habitual,\" it's listed as \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo. However, in Row 7, which deals with third person middle-grade/plural masculine, the past habitual is given as \u0917\u0930\u0947 gare. But the claim refers to \"he did,\" which would correspond to the singular form.\n\nWait, but the table for Row 6's past habitual is indeed \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo, so that should be correct. However, I'm a bit confused because in the table, the past habitual for third person middle-grade/plural masculine (Row 7) is \u0917\u0930\u0947 gare. But the claim refers to \"he did,\" which would be singular. So does garyo in Row 6 correspond correctly?\n\nYes, because Row 6 is about third person singular low-grade, so garyo is correct for past habitual there. The claim doesn't specify the grade level beyond singular, so it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}]}",

The rows are labeled as Row 1 to Row 7. Each row has several columns: probable future, simple present/future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative.\n\nThe claim is making two statements:\n1. \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual.\"\n2. \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does' be the probable future.\"\n\nI need to check if these are correct based on the table provided.\n\nStarting with the first part: \" \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual.\" Looking through each row, I'll focus on Row 6 because it's about third person singular low-grade. In Row 6, under past habitual, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". So that matches. So the first part is correct.\n\nNext, the second part: \" \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does' be the probable future.\" Again, checking Row 6, under probable future, it's stated as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\". That also matches. Therefore, both parts of the claim are supported by Row 6.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check to make sure there isn't another row that might contradict or provide more information. Let me quickly scan through the other rows:\n\n- Row 1: First person singular (probable future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0941 garchu 'i will do'\"), so not relevant.\n- Row 2: First person plural, not relevant for third person.\n- Row 3: Second person singular low-grade; same as above.\n- Row 4: Second person middle/plural masculine.\n- Row 5: High grade, not about third person singular.\n- Row 6: Third person singular low-grade, which matches both parts of the claim.\n- Row 7: Third person middle plural masculine, so doesn't affect third singular.\n\nSo yes, only Row 6 is relevant here. Therefore, both statements in the claim are correctly supported by the table data. Hence, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI should also note that each part of the claim points to specific cells in Row 6: past habitual and probable future.

Let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions two forms: \"garis\" and \"gares\". From the table, I should look for these forms in their respective rows and columns.\n\nLooking at Row 3 of the table (second person singular low-grade), the past habitual is listed as \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (garis). So that's correct. The claim correctly identifies this form as \"you did\".\n\nNext, it says \"be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do'\". Wait, the claim seems to be equating \"gari\" with \"gares\". But looking at Row 3 again, the imperative is \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d (gares), which means \"may you do.\" It's a command form. However, \"garis\" is past habitual, while \"gares\" is imperative.\n\nThe claim seems to mix up these forms. It says \"the imperative of the past habitual \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do'.\" This suggests that \"gari\" is being used as an imperative form, but according to the table, \"gares\" is the imperative, and \"garis\" is past.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrectly associating \"gari\" with the imperative. Instead, \"gari\" should correspond to the past habitual, not the imperative. The imperative is a separate form, which is \"gares.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim has an error in mapping the forms. It's mixing up past habitual and imperative. Since this mix-up is present, the statement isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates \"gari\" with the imperative instead of recognizing it as past habitual, while correctly identifying \"gares\" as imperative but mislabeling it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The table provided seems to be related to different grammatical forms of verbs in Hindi, particularly focusing on conjugations for \"do\" or similar actions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you do,' be the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'.\" So, it's asserting a relationship between two forms of the verb: \"garis\" and \"garchas.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row seems to represent different grammatical persons. For instance, Row 3 deals with second person singular, low-grade forms, while Row 2 is for first person plural, etc. Each column within a row lists various tenses or forms: simple present/future, past habitual, imperative, and so on.\n\nSo, the claim mentions \"garis\" as the past habitual form of \"garchas.\" Let me check the table to see if this is accurate.\n\nIn Row 3, under second person singular low-grade, I can see several columns. The past habitual form there is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis.\" The probable future form is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas,\" which is the simple present/future for that tense.\n\nSo, according to the table, \"garchas\" is the base form (simple present/future), and its past habitual is indeed \"garis.\" Therefore, the claim seems correct because it correctly identifies the past habitual form corresponding to \"garchas.\"\n\nI don't see any discrepancy here.

The claim is stating that \"garyo\" (past habitual) is the correct form for \"garcha\" (simple present/future, third person singular low-grade). So I need to check if in the table, under third person singular low-grade, the past habitual column corresponds to the simple present/future of \"gar\u093e\".\n\nLooking at the table, let's focus on Row 6. The row index is 5 (since rows start from 0 or 1? Wait, the first row is Row 1, as per the given structure. Wait no, the user's example shows rows starting at 0 perhaps? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the table provided:\n\nRow 1: first person singular\nRow 2: first person plural\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade\nRow 4: second person middle-grade / plural\nRow 5: high grade\nRow 6: third person singular low-grade\nRow 7: third person middle-grade / plural masculine\n\nSo Row 6 is third person singular low-grade. So looking at Row 6, the columns are:\n\nsimple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u093e garcha 'he does'\npast habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\n\nYes, so in Row 6, past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\", and simple present/future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\" (but wait, no\u2014looking again:\n\nWait, the table's first column under Row 6 says \"simple present / future: third person singular low-grade, probable future: \u0917\u0930\u093e garcha 'he does'\". Then in past habitual, it's \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\".\n\nSo yes, the past habitual form is indeed \"garyo\" for the verb \"garcha\". Therefore, the claim that \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\" is TRUE.\n\nNow, to check which cells are relevant. The claim mentions two forms: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he do , ' be the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\". So it refers to two cells:\n\n1. In Row 6 (third person singular low-grade), the past habitual column, which has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\".\n2. In Row 6, the simple present/future column, which is \"\u0917\u0930\u093e\".\n\nWait, no, wait: The claim says \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\". So in Row 6, the simple present/future form is \"gar\u093e\", and the past habitual is \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\". Therefore, both columns are relevant.\n\nSo the relevant_cells should be for Row 6, both columns: \"simple present / future\" and \"past habitual\".\n\nWait, but looking back at the claim: it's about whether \"garyo\" is the past habitual of \"garcha\", so we need to check that in Row 6, under past habitual, it's \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\". So the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row index 5 (since rows start from 0?), or wait no\u2014Row 1 is first person singular. Wait, the user didn't specify if the rows are 0-indexed or 1-indexed in their initial problem statement.\n\nWait, looking at the table structure: \n\nRow 1: first person singular\n\nRow 2: first person plural\n\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade\n\nRow 4: second person middle / plural\n\nRow 5: high grade\n\nRow 6: third person singular low-grade\n\nRow 7: third person middle / plural masculine.\n\nSo Row numbers are from 1 to 7. Therefore, the row index for Row 6 is 5 (since in programming rows often start at 0). Wait no, in JSON, it's zero-based or one-based? In the user's example, he uses 0-based indexing: {\"row_index\": 0, ...}, so I think the table's first row is row index 0. Let me check:\n\nIn the example given by the user, their answer has row_index as 0 and 1 for Revenue and Employees. So in the actual table provided, Row 1 corresponds to row_index 0.\n\nTherefore, in the claim, we need to refer to:\n\n- For \"garcha\" (third person singular low-grade), which is in Row 6 of the table (row index 5?), no, wait: Row 1 is first person singular, so Row 6 would be row index 5. But let me count:\n\nRow 1: first person singular \u2192 row index 0\n\nRow 2: first person plural \u2192 index 1\n\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade \u2192 index 2\n\nRow 4: second person middle / plural \u2192 index 3\n\nRow 5: high grade \u2192 index 4\n\nRow 6: third person singular low-grade \u2192 index 5\n\nRow 7: third person middle / plural \u2192 index 6.\n\nYes, so Row 6 is row_index 5. Therefore:\n\n- The past habitual of \"garcha\" is in Row 6 (row index 5), under the column \"past habitual\": \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\".\n\nSo to verify the claim, we need to check two things: that the verb is \"garcha\", and its past form is \"garyo\". Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n1. In Row 6 (index 5), the past habitual column: \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\"\n\n2. In Row 6, the simple present/future column: \"gar\u093e\"\n\nBut wait, no\u2014the claim doesn't specify whether it's referring to the correct form of \"garcha\" being in that row. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about whether \"garyo\" is the past form of \"garcha\", and in Row 6, \"gar\u093e\" is present, and its past is \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\", so both columns are relevant.\n\nTherefore, the two cells to check are:\n\n- row_index:5 (Row6), column: past habitual \u2192 \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\"\n\n- row_index:5, column: simple present/future \u2192 \"gar\u093e\"\n\nSo in the JSON response, the answer should have these two cells.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether the statement is true and identify relevant data cells.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"statement\": {\n    \"is_true\": true,\n    \"reasoning\": \"In Row 6 (third person singular low-grade), the past habitual form of 'garcha' is indeed 'garyo'.\",\n    \"cells\": [\n      {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\", \"value\": \"gar\u094d\u092f\u094b\"},\n      {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"simple present/future\", \"value\": \"gar\u093e\"}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe statement is true because in Row 6 (third person singular low-grade), the past habitual form of \"garcha\" is \"garyo\".

The columns here include probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. In this row, the simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s\", which corresponds to \"you will (probably) do\". Wait, but in the claim, it's referring to \"garis\" as the simple past. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong row.\n\nWait no, let me check each row carefully. The claim mentions \"garis\" as the simple past and \"gares\" as the injunctive. So I need to find a row where the past tense is \"garis\". \n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: Simple past is \"\u0917\u0922\u093e\u0938\u094d garh\u0101s\" for second person singular low-grade. Wait, no, in the table it's written as \"simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s 'you will (probably) do'.\" So that's not \"garis\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. The claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\", so I need to find the row where the simple past is \"gari\". \n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: Simple past is \"\u0917\u0922\u093e\u0938\u094d garh\u0101s\" which translates to \"you will (probably) do\", not \"garis\".\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. Row 3's columns are: probable future, simple present/future, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nWait, looking at the table structure, each row has several columns:\n\n- The first part is \"!simple present / future\" which seems to be a heading, then for each category like probable future, simple past, etc., each cell is under that sub-column.\n\nSo in row 3, the cells are:\n\n- probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\n- simple present/future: second person singular low-grade\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d garl\u0101s 'you will (probably) do'\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'you did'\n- injunctive: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis 'you used to do'\n- imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\n\nAh, so in row 3, the past habitual is \"garis\" and the injunctive is \"garthis\". \n\nBut the claim says that \"gares\" (imperative) is the injunctive for \"garis\" (past habitual). Wait, no. The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did'.\" So it's saying that the imperative form is the injunctive. But in the table, the imperative is a separate column from the injunctive.\n\nWait, no. The columns are:\n\n- probable future\n- simple present/future (which is the conjugation type)\n- simple past\n- past habitual\n- injunctive\n- imperative\n\nSo in row 3, the past habitual is \"garis\" and the injunctive is \"garthis\". So the claim is saying that \"gares\" is the injunctive form of \"garis\", but according to the table, the injunctive is \"garthis\" for \"you did\". Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. The claim is stating that \"gares\" (imperative) is the same as the injunctive for \"garis\" (past habitual). But in the table, the imperative and the past habitual are different forms. So the claim is wrong because it's mixing up the imperative with the injunctive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me check again: In row 3, the past habitual is \"garis\", and the injunctive is \"garthis\". Therefore, the claim that \"gares\" (imperative) is the same as the past habitual's injunctive is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do' be the injunctive for \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did'.\" So it's saying that the imperative form (gares) is the same as the injunctive of garis. But according to the table, the past habitual is garis and its injunctive is garthis. Therefore, the claim is false because the injunctive is not gares but garthis.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \"FALSE\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the imperative form with the past habitual's conjunctive, which is a mistake based on the table provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"past_habitual\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

It's saying that \"garis\" is the simple past form of \"garchas\". According to grammar rules, certain verbs have irregular past forms. So, checking the table, specifically looking for the row where the verb is in second person singular.\n\nLooking at Row 3, under second person singular low-grade, the columns are: probable future, simple past, etc. The second column here is the simple past tense. For \"garchas\" (second person singular), the simple past is listed as \"garis\". That matches exactly with what the claim is stating.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in other rows. Each row seems to handle different grammatical persons and grades, so Row 3 is specifically for second person singular low-grade.

Hmm, wait, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Let me parse it.\n\nFirst, I should identify the key elements in the claim. The claim mentions two forms:\n\n1. The past habitual of \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\" (gari) which is \"you did\".\n2. And it claims this should be equal to \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\" (gares), which is listed as the imperative form.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, each row corresponds to different grammatical categories for the root verb \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\" (garnu). Let me check the table structure again.\n\nThe table has rows 1 through 7. Each row represents a different grammatical person and tense. For example:\n\n- Row 3: Second person singular low-grade.\n- Row 4: Second person middle-grade/plural.\n- Row 5: High grade.\n- Row 6: Third person singular low-grade.\n- Row 7: Third person middle-grade plural masculine.\n\nEach row has several columns for different tenses: simple present/future, past habitual, etc. Let me check each column to see if \"past habitual\" and \"imperative\" align correctly as per the claim.\n\nThe claim is comparing the past habitual form of a verb with its imperative form. Specifically, it's saying that the past habitual of \"\u0917ari\" (which I think corresponds to row 3) is equal to the imperative form \"gares\".\n\nLooking at Row 3 in the table:\n\n- Past Habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares\n\nSo according to the table, the past habitual is indeed \"garis\" and the imperative is \"gares\". Therefore, the claim seems correct.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused. The claim says that \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do'.\" So it's stating that the past habitual (garis) is equal to the imperative (gares). But in reality, they are different forms but related.\n\nWait no, actually, looking at the table:\n\nIn Row 3, the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\" which is garis, and the imperative is \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0947\u0938\" gares. So yes, they are separate conjugations but both exist for the same grammatical person (second person singular low-grade). Therefore, the claim is stating that these two forms are equivalent, which isn't correct because they are different tenses.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me read it again: \"the past habitual of \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did' be \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do'\". So it's saying that the past habitual is equal to the imperative. But according to the table, they are different forms but both part of the same grammatical category.\n\nSo perhaps the claim is incorrect because it's equating two different tenses\u2014past habitual and imperative\u2014as if they're the same form, which they're not. So the answer would be FALSE.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The past habitual is \"garis\" and the imperative is \"gares\". They are both in Row 3 but under different columns. Therefore, the claim is asserting that these two forms are the same, which they aren't. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the past habitual form \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\" (gari) is equal to the imperative form \"gar\u0947\u0938\" (gares). According to the table, these are distinct grammatical aspects of the verb and not equivalent forms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

So, I need to see if the probable future form, which is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\", becomes the past habitual form \"\u0917\u0922\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo\" or something else in the past.\n\nLooking at Row 3 of the table. The row index is 2 (since it's zero-indexed), and the section is second person singular low-grade. The probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas, which matches the claim. Now, I need to check what the past habitual form is for this category.\n\nIn Row 3, the past habitual is given as \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis. So, when the present/future is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d, the past is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d. But the claim says that the probable future becomes \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari. Wait, the claim seems to suggest that in the past, it would be \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d, but looking at the table, the past habitual for second person singular low-grade is indeed garis.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again. The claim says \"the probable future of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari 'you did'\". So, when you look at the probable future form, it's \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d, and then in the past, it becomes \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938.\n\nBut looking back at Row 3: the past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis. So, yes, that matches. Therefore, the claim seems to be correct because the probable future does become the past habitual as stated.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. The claim says \"be \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 gari\", which implies that in the past, it's \"you did,\" which is indeed what Row 3 shows for past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis.\n\nSo, yes, the probable future of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938 is indeed \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table data.

The phrase garnuhunthyo is in the injunctive form, so I need to find where that is located.\n\nLooking at row 1: simple present/future for first person singular, with various forms like imperative, etc., but the injunctive there is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd 'i used to do.'\n\nRow 2: second person plural, with injunctive form \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169.\n\nRow 3: second person singular low-grade, injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis.\n\nRow 4: second person middle-grade/plural, injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau.\n\nRow 5: high grade, but seems to be third person, so maybe not relevant for \"you.\"\n\nRows 6 and 7 are about third person, so probably not relevant unless the claim refers to them, which it doesn't.\n\nSo the phrase garnuhunthyo is not directly listed in any of these rows. Let me double-check each row's injunctive forms:\n\nRow 1: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\nRow 2: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\nRow 3: \u0917\u0930\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis\nRow 4: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c garthyau\n\nNone of these match \"garnuhunthyo.\" That makes me think that maybe the claim is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rows.\n\nWait, row 5's injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo. So in row 5, which is third person singular high grade, the injunctive form is indeed \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo. But wait, the claim says \"you used to do,\" which would be second person.\n\nSo the claim is connecting gar\u0169l\u0101 (first person simple past) with garnuhunthyo (third person singular high grade, injunctive). That doesn't seem right because they're different persons and grammatical categories.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. It's trying to link first person simple past to third person injunctive, which isn't accurate based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly links two phrases from different rows and persons, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break down what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"the phrase \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do' in the probable future be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do' in the imperative.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant parts of the table. The phrase \"gar\u091bau\u0901\" is in Row 2, first person plural. According to the table, Row 2's probable future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do'\". So that part matches.\n\nNow, the claim says this phrase is used in the probable future and becomes \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do'\" in the imperative. Wait, the term \"gar\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" from Row 6, third person singular low-grade, past habitual is \" \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did'\". But here it's being used as an imperative? That doesn't seem right.\n\nLooking at the imperative column for each row:\n\n- Row 2: Imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901 gara\u0169 'may we do, let's do'\". So in the table, the imperative form isn't \"gar\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\"; that's from a different row. The claim seems to mix up the past habitual and imperative forms.\n\nThe phrase \"gar\u091bau\u0901\" in Row 2's probable future should correspond to its own imperative, which is \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\", not \"gar\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\". Therefore, the claim incorrectly states that \"gar\u094d\u091bau\u0901\" becomes \"gar\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" in the imperative. That doesn't align with the table.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because it misrepresents how the imperative form is structured for \"we (will) do\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding the claim and then cross-referencing it with the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares 'may you do'.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. I think the claim is trying to say that \"\u0917archas\" in the future tense corresponds to the imperative form \"gares\" in the simple past. Wait, no, maybe it's saying that \"garchas\" as used in the probable future (second person singular) is mistakenly considered the simple past for \"gares,\" which is an imperative.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows related to second person singular and their tenses. Let me check each row:\n\nRow 3 deals with second person singular low-grade. It has columns like probable future, simple past, etc. So, in Row 3:\n\n- Probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas (you will do)\n- Simple past: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938 garl\u0101s (you will probably do)\nWait, no, actually looking back, the columns are \"simple present/future\", so for Row 3, second person singular low-grade:\n\nProbable future: \u0917\u0930\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas (you will do)\nSimple past tense: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938 garl\u0101s (you did [probably])\nPast habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938 garis (you did)\nImperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938 gares (may you do)\n\nWait, so \"garchas\" is the probable future form. The claim says that \"garchas\" (future) is the simple past for \"gares\" (imperative). But according to the table, the simple past for second person singular low-grade is \"garl\u0101s,\" not \"garchas.\" So the claim seems incorrect.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The claim says that \"garchas\" (future) is the simple past for \"gares\" (imperative). But in reality, according to the table:\n\n- \"garchas\" is the future tense form.\n- The imperative is \"garas,\" which translates to \"may you do.\"\n- The simple past for this would be \"garl\u0101s,\" as per Row 3.\n\nSo the claim is mixing up the future tense with the imperative. Therefore, it's incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the future tense \"\u0917archas\" with the simple past of the imperative form \"gares.\" According to the table, the correct simple past for second person singular low-grade is \"garl\u0101s,\" not \"garchas.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"simple past\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
