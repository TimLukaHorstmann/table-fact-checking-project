    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"montreal be the visitor on march 6\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see if there's a match where Montreal is the visitor on March 6. The table has multiple rows, so I should go through them one by one.\n\nStarting from Row 1: Date is March 1, Visitor is Philadelphia. Not Montreal, so move on.\n\nRow 2: March 2, Visitor is NY Rangers. No, still not Montreal.\n\nRow 3: March 4, Visitor is Philadelphia again. Nope.\n\nRow 4: March 6. Okay, this is the date in question. Let me check who the visitor is here. The \"visitor\" column says Montreal. So yes, on March 6, the visitor is indeed Montreal.\n\nNow, to make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let's scan through the other rows just to confirm there isn't another occurrence of Montreal as the visitor on March 6 elsewhere in the table. Since each date is unique and March 6 only appears once in the \"date\" column (Row 4), there are no other entries for that specific date.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"montreal be the visitor on march 6\" is fully supported by the information in Row 4 of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"visitor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is asking.\n\nThe claim says that before March 6, Montreal was the visitor in a game where they were visiting Philadelphia. So I'm looking for instances in the table where the visitor is Montreal and the date is before March 6.\n\nLooking at each row in the table:\n\nRow 1: March 1, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 2: March 2, visitor is NY Rangers.\nRow 3: March 4, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 4: March 6, visitor is Montreal. Wait, but the date here is March 6, which is the same as the claim's date. The claim says \"before\" March 6, so this might not count because it's on March 6, not before.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other rows where the visitor is Montreal with a date before March 6. Scanning through:\n\nRow 5: March 8, visitor is Carolina.\nRow 6: March 11, visitor is Buffalo.\nRow 7: March 12, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 8: March 15, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 9: March 17, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 10: March 18, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 11: March 21, visitor is New Jersey.\nRow 12: March 22, visitor is Philadelphia.\nRow 13: March 25, visitor is Ottawa.\nRow 14: March 28, visitor is Toronto.\n\nSo, in the table provided, the only row where the visitor is Montreal is Row 4 on March 6. Since the claim says \"before March 6,\" and this instance is exactly on March 6, it doesn't qualify as before. Therefore, there are no instances of Montreal being the visitor before March 6.\n\nHence, the claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Montreal was only the visitor on March 6, not before that date. Since the claim specifies \"before March 6,\" there are no relevant instances.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}",
