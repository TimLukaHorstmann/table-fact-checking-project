    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the St Louis Stampede play in the Scottrade Center until 1995.\" I need to verify if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows and columns are relevant. The key elements of the claim are:\n\n1. Team: St Louis Stampede\n2. Venue: Scottrade Center\n3. Years: Until 1995\n\nSo, I'll look for the row where the team is \"St Louis Stampede.\" Scanning through the table, that's Row 1.\n\nNow, in Row 1, under the \"venue\" column, it says \"scottrade center.\" That matches the venue mentioned in the claim. Good so far.\n\nNext, I need to check when the St Louis Stampede left St Louis. The \"left st louis\" column in Row 1 is 1995. The claim states they played there until 1995, which aligns perfectly.\n\nAdditionally, the \"began in st louis\" for the Stampede is 1994. However, this doesn't directly impact the claim about their tenure at Scottrade Center, so it's not necessary to consider unless the claim were about when they started playing there.\n\nSo, focusing on the relevant columns: \"venue\" and \"left st louis.\" Both are in Row 1.\n\nTherefore, all conditions of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"left st louis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false by checking each condition against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"the St Louis start in 1950 but do not win any championship.\"\n\nI need to parse this into parts. The key points are:\n1. \"St Louis\" refers to a team.\n2. The team \"started\" in 1950.\n3. They did not win any championships.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find all teams named with \"St Louis\" and check their details.\n\nStarting with each row:\n\nRow 7: Spirits of St Louis, established 1967, began 1974. Doesn't match 1950.\nRow 8: St Louis Hawks, established 1946, began 1955. Not 1950.\nRow 9: St Louis Bombers, established 1946, began 1950. This seems relevant because they started in 1950.\n\nNext, check if this team won any championships. Looking at Row 9, \"championships in st louis: 0.\" So no championships.\n\nSo, the claim that St Louis started in 1950 and didn't win any championship is true for the St Louis Bombers.\n\nI should also check other teams to see if any might be relevant. For example:\n\nRow 15: St Louis Ambush started in 1992, but not 1950.\nOthers like Row 6 (St Louis Stars) started earlier but left before 1950. So, only Row 9 is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, we need to identify if there's a St. Louis team that began in 1950 and didn't win any championships. The table shows:\n\n- **Row 9**: St. Louis Bombers established in 1946, began in 1950. They have \"championships in st louis: 0.\"\n  \nThis matches the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"began in st louis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the arena football team do not record a championship\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which teams are considered \"arena football teams.\" Looking at the table, there's only one sport mentioned that's related to arena football, which is Row 1: St. Louis Stampede. The other sports listed are baseball, basketball, hockey, and football, but I think in this context, \"arena football\" specifically refers to a type of football played in an arena, maybe similar to indoor football.\n\nNext, the claim says that these arena football teams do not record a championship. So, I need to check if any of the arena football teams have recorded championships. Looking at Row 1 for the St. Louis Stampede, the column \"championships in st louis\" is listed as 0. That suggests they don't have any championships. \n\nSince there's only one arena football team in the table, and that team hasn't won any championships, the claim seems to be true based on the information provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"championships in st louis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"1937 be the year the negro american league be establish.\" So first, I should look for a row in the table where the team's sport is baseball and the league is the Negro American League, and check when it was established.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 3: team St Louis Stars, sport Baseball, league Negro American League, established 1937. That matches the criteria. So this row directly supports the claim about the establishment year of the Negro American League in 1937.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other rows that might conflict or provide additional info. But from scanning all rows, only Row 3 fits the bill. Therefore, the claim is supported by this row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is based on whether the Negro American League was established in 1937. Checking the table, Row 3 for St Louis Stars (Baseball) established in 1937 and part of the Negro American League confirms the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"established\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"1974 be the year the negro american league join\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the claim. It mentions the \"negro american league\" joining in 1974. So, I should look for rows related to the Negro American League (NAL) and see when they were established or joined.\n\nLooking through the table, Row 3: team: st louis stars, sport: baseball, league: negro american league, established: 1937. This row mentions that the St. Louis Stars played in the NAL since 1937. The claim says the league joined in 1974, but according to this row, it was already established in 1937 and began in St. Louis in 1939.\n\nRow 6: team: st louis stars, sport: baseball, league: negro national league, established: 1922. Wait, this is about the Negro National League (NNL), not the NAL. The NNL was a different league. So that's probably not relevant here.\n\nAnother row to note is Row 7: team: spirits of st louis, sport: basketball, league: american basketball association, established: 1967. That's about basketball, so unrelated to the Negro American League in football or baseball.\n\nNow, considering the claim again: it says the NAL joined in 1974. But from Row 3, the St. Louis Stars were part of the NAL as early as 1937. So the league existed before 1974. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the NAL wasn't established or joined in 1974; it was already there since 1937.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are Row 3 for the establishment year and possibly any other row that shows the NAL's founding year. Since only Row 3 mentions the NAL, I'll focus on that.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the Negro American League existed earlier than 1974.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that \"1974 was the year the Negro American League joined,\" we need to check if any team in the table represents the Negro American League and when it began. \n\nRow 3: team: st louis stars, sport: baseball, league: negro american league, established: 1937 indicates the St. Louis Stars were part of the NAL since 1937. This shows the league existed before 1974.\n\n**Answer**: \"FALSE\"\n\n**Relevant Cells**:\n- Row 3, column: \"established\" (to show when the NAL was established).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"established\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"st louis stampede be the team who play scottrade center and leave in 1954.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two main points:\n1. The St. Louis Stampede plays at Scottrade Center.\n2. They left St. Louis in 1954.\n\nI need to check each part against the table. Let's look through each row for the team name \"St. Louis Stampede.\"\n\nRow 0: team: St. Louis Stampede, sport: Arena Football, league: Arena Football League, established: 1987, began in St. Louis: 1994, venue: Scottrade Center, championships in St. Louis: 0, left St. Louis: 1995.\n\nFrom this row, I see that the St. Louis Stampede plays at Scottrade Center and left St. Louis in 1995. The claim says they left in 1954, which doesn't match. So this part is incorrect.\n\nNext, I should check if there's another team named \"St. Louis Stampede\" playing at Scottrade Center around 1954. Looking through the rows, Row 0 is the only one for St. Louis Stampede, and it's established in 1987, began in 1994, so it can't be related to 1954.\n\nNow, checking other teams with \"Stampede\" or similar names doesn't seem to fit the venue or the year mentioned. For example, Row 15 mentions St. Louis Ambush playing at Scottrade Center, but that's a different team and left in 2000. \n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues: the team didn't play at Scottrade Center before 1994, and they left in 1995, not 1954.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim, I checked each row for \"St. Louis Stampede\" and found that their departure year is 1995, not 1954, and they began in 1994.
