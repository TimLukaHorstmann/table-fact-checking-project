Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Bellevue has proposed a new station located at a hospital. So, I need to look through the table for any entries related to Bellevue and hospitals or transit centers near a hospital.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different station with various details like city/neighborhood, extension, projected opening, park and ride, and funding source. The relevant columns here would be \"city / neighborhood,\" which tells us where the station is located, and the specific name of the station to see if it's related to a hospital.\n\nStarting from row 1 to row 24:\n\n- Row 19: Station is named \"hospital,\" extension is east link, city/neighborhood is Bellevue. Projected opening is 2021, park and ride is no, funded by ST2: yes.\n\nSo, this station is located in Bellevue and is named \"hospital.\" That seems directly related to the claim. However, I should check if there are other stations in Bellevue that might also be relevant or if any others mention a hospital.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- Row 17: Station is \"east main,\" city/neighborhood is Bellevue, but it's not named \"hospital.\"\n- Row 18: \"bellevue transit center\" is in downtown Bellevue.\n- Row 19: As mentioned, the \"hospital\" station in Bellevue.\n\nNo other stations in Bellevue mention a hospital. So, only row 19 seems to directly relate.\n\nAlso, checking if any other neighborhoods have hospitals but that's not necessary since the claim specifies Bellevue.\n\nTherefore, there is at least one station in Bellevue named \"hospital,\" supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"station\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"overlake village have 1 park and ride project propose\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim mentions that Overlake Village has exactly one park and ride project proposed. So, I should look for any rows in the table related to \"Overlake Village\" specifically. \n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Station is Boeing Access Road, not relevant.\n- ...\nWait, actually, the table structure has columns like station, extension, city/neighborhood, etc. So I need to look for rows where \"city / neighborhood\" is Overlake Village.\n\nI'll scan through all the rows:\n\nRow 23: station: overlake village, city / neighborhood: overlake. Hmm, not directly Overlake Village.\nWait, maybe it's a typo or different name? Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking further, I see Row 22 and 23 both mention \"overlake\" as the city/neighborhood. Wait, is that \"Overlake\" without the 's'? The claim refers to \"overlake village,\" so perhaps it's looking for \"Overlake Village.\"\n\nBut in the table, I don't see any row where city/neighborhood is \"Overlake Village.\" Instead, there are entries like \"overlake\" and \"overlake transit center,\" but not specifically \"overlake village.\"\n\nWait, maybe Row 24: station: se redmond, city / neighborhood: redmond. Not relevant either.\n\nSo, from the table provided, there's no row where the city/neighborhood is Overlake Village. However, I should check if any of these might be related. Maybe it's a typo in the table? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding which rows to consider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"overlake village\" refers to multiple stations or entries. But looking at the data, I don't see a specific park and ride project proposed for Overlake Village itself. The closest might be Row 23: overlake transit center with park and ride as yes, but that's in the same neighborhood.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is suggesting that there's exactly one park and ride project proposed at Overlake Village. If the table doesn't mention any such station or project under Overlake Village, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me go through each row again more carefully:\n\nRow 22: overlake village's park and ride is yes.\nWait no, Row 22 is station: overlake village, extension: east link, city / neighborhood: overlake, projected opening: 2021, park and ride: yes, funded by st2 : yes.\n\nWait, so the city/neighborhood for that row is \"overlake,\" not \"overlake village.\" So it's a different entry. Therefore, there might be no direct mention of Overlake Village in any row's city/neighborhood column.\n\nTherefore, if none of the rows have \"overlake village\" as the city/neighborhood, then the claim that \"overlake village have 1 park and ride project propose\" is not supported by the table data. Hence, it should be considered FALSE.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because Row 22 mentions \"overlake village,\" but in the column for city/neighborhood, it's listed as \"overlake.\" Maybe that's a typo or inconsistency in the table. So perhaps the actual row doesn't exist under Overlake Village, making the claim false.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The claim is about Overlake Village having one park and ride project.\n- In the table, no row explicitly mentions \"Overlake Village\" as the city/neighborhood with a park and ride.\n- The closest related entries are for \"overlake\" or other locations, not specifically \"overlake village.\"\n- Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the answer should be FALSE because there's no evidence in the table of an Overlake Village with one park and ride project.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"City / Neighborhood\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the redondo / star lake station be fund by st2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. I need to carefully check each relevant cell in the table to verify the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: it's about the funding source for the Redondo / Star Lake station. Specifically, the claim says that this station is \"fund by ST2.\" \n\nNow, I'll scan through each row of the table to locate the station named \"Redondo / Star Lake.\" From the table provided:\n\n- **Row 10**: station: redondo / star lake, extension: south link, city / neighborhood: federal way, projected opening: 2023, park and ride: yes, funded by st2 : yes.\n\nThis row directly mentions the Redondo / Star Lake station. The relevant columns here are \"station,\" \"funded by st2.\" \n\nLooking at the \"funded by st2\" column for this row, it's marked as \"yes.\" This aligns perfectly with the claim that the station is funded by ST2.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other rows that might refer to Redondo / Star Lake, but skimming through all 24 rows, only Row 10 matches. So, there's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the data, the statement is supported and TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is confirmed by the relevant row in the table, where \"funded by st2\" is marked as yes for Redondo / Star Lake station.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"funded by st2\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"1 park and ride haven't be propose for overlake village.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to find any rows related to \"overlake village\" in the table. Looking through each row, I see:\n\n- Row 22: station: overlake village, extension: east link, city / neighborhood: overlake, projected opening: 2021, park and ride: yes, funded by st2 : yes.\n- Row 23: station: overlake transit center, extension: east link, city / neighborhood: overlake, projected opening: 2021, park and ride: yes, funded by st2 : yes.\n\nSo both these rows are about Overlake Village or related. Now, the claim says that \"1 park and ride haven't be propose for overlake village.\" But in the table, both entries have \"park and ride: yes\". That seems contradictory because if they already have park and rides, then the claim is false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be saying that a specific park and ride hasn't been proposed yet. So perhaps it's referring to a future proposal. But in the table, for both Overlake Village and Overlake Transit Center, the park and ride status is yes as of their projected opening in 2021.\n\nSo whether the park and ride was proposed before or not isn't indicated here. The table just shows if they have it at the time of the data entry. If \"proposed\" means it's planned, then maybe it's already been proposed. But the claim says it hasn't been proposed yet, implying that as of now, it's not there. However, according to the table, both stations do have park and ride.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that a specific type of park and ride hasn't been proposed, but without more context, it's hard to tell. But based on the data given, both Overlake entries have park and ride yes. Therefore, the claim seems false because they do have park and rides.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"1 park and ride haven't be propose for overlake village.\" However, upon examining the table, both \"overlake village\" (Row 22) and \"overlake transit center\" (Row 23) have their park and ride status listed as yes. This contradicts the claim, indicating that a park and ride has indeed been proposed or is in place for these locations.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Locate rows related to \"overlake village.\" Found in Row 22 and Row 23.\n2. **Check Park and Ride Status:** For both identified rows, the park and ride status is marked as yes.\n3. **Analyze Claim Against Data:** The claim asserts that no park and ride has been proposed for Overlake Village. However, the data shows it exists, contradicting the claim.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since the table indicates that a park and ride is present, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break down what the claim says and then check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"overlake have a propose station of bellevue transit center , an extension of east link , and a propose parking and ride.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify the components of this claim:\n\n1. Overlake has a proposed station named Bellevue Transit Center.\n2. This station is part of an extension called East Link.\n3. There's a proposed parking and ride facility at this station.\n\nNow, I'll go through the table row by row to see if any relevant information matches these points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different station with various details like name, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, and funding. \n\nI start by searching for \"Bellevue Transit Center\" in the station column. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 18: Station is Bellevue Transit Center, extension East Link, opens in 2020, no park and ride, funded by ST2.\n- Rows 17 to 19 mention other stations related to Bellevue but specifically, only row 18 directly mentions \"Bellevue Transit Center.\"\n\nNow, checking if Overlake is associated with this station. The city/neighborhood for Row 18 is downtown Bellevue, not Overlake. So Overlake might be a different location.\n\nNext, I check if there's a station named Overlake related to East Link. Looking through the table:\n\n- Rows 21-23: Stations like Overlake Transit Center and Overlake are part of the East Link extension, but these are in Redmond, not Overlake.\n\nWait, the claim says \"overlake have a propose station,\" so perhaps I should look for any Overlake stations in the table. However, scanning through all rows, there's no station named Overlake except possibly Row 24: Se Redmond mentions Redmond, but nothing about Overlake itself.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. The claim says \"Overlake\" has a proposed station. But in the table, I don't see an Overlake station mentioned. All East Link stations are either in Bellevue or Redmond areas.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each row carefully again:\n\nRow 22: Overlake Transit Center is in Overlake (Redmond) with East Link opening in 2021, yes park and ride, ST2 funding.\nRow 23: Overlake same as above.\n\nNo, there's no station named \"Overlake\" itself. The closest is Overlake Transit Center in Redmond. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to a non-existent Overlake station.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim meant that Overlake (Redmond) has a proposed station at Bellevue Transit Center? That doesn't make much sense geographically.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The claim might be saying that Overlake has its own proposed station called Bellevue Transit Center, which is part of East Link and has a park and ride. But from the table, Bellevue Transit Center is in downtown Bellevue, not Overlake.\n\nSo the claim seems to mix up locations: Bellevue Transit Center isn't in Overlake. Also, there's no proposed Overlake station mentioned in the table\u2014only Overlake Transit Center which is in Redmond.\n\nTherefore, the claim might be FALSE because:\n\n- There's no station named \"Overlake\" with a proposed Bellevue Transit Center.\n- The Bellevue Transit Center is located in downtown Bellevue, not Overlake.\n- While there are stations in Overlake (like Overlake Transit Center), they're not in Bellevue.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions \"proposed parking and ride,\" but for each station, park and ride status is either yes or no. For Bellevue Transit Center, it's no; for Overlake stations, it's yes or no depending on the row.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any Overlake station has a proposed parking and ride. From the table:\n\n- Row 22: Overlake Transit Center in Redmond, yes park and ride.\n- Row 24: Se Redmond, no park and ride.\n\nSo maybe if the claim is about Overlake having a proposed station with East Link and park and ride, then it's partially true for Overlake stations but not specifically for Bellevue Transit Center.\n\nBut the main issue is that the claim states \"overlake have a propose station of bellevue transit center,\" which doesn't exist. So the first part is incorrect, making the entire claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there's no station named \"Overlake\" with a proposed Bellevue Transit Center as described. The Bellevue Transit Center is located in downtown Bellevue, not Overlake.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Station\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Station\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"Station\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"1 neighborhood doesn't have a station proposed at a hospital\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there's one neighborhood where no station is proposed at a hospital. So essentially, I'm looking for a row in the table where the city/neighborhood column mentions a specific area (a hospital), and according to the 'station' or 'extension' columns, there isn't a station proposed at that location.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several pieces of information: station name, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, and funding. I need to focus on the 'city / neighborhood' column and see if any of these correspond to a hospital. Additionally, I should check the 'station' or 'extension' columns to determine if a station is proposed at that location.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0:** Station: Boeing Access Road, Extension: Central Link, City/Neighborhood: Tukwila, Projected Opening: Deferred Indefinitely, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n   - The city is Tukwila. There's no mention of a hospital here.\n\n2. **Row 1:** Station: Jackson Park, Extension: North Corridor HCT, City/Neighborhood: Shoreline, Projected Opening: 2023, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: Yes.\n   - No hospital mentioned in Shoreline.\n\n3. **Row 2:** Station: Shoreline, Extension: North Corridor HCT, City/Neighborhood: Shoreline, Projected Opening: 2023, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: Yes.\n   - Again, no mention of a hospital in Shoreline.\n\n4. **Row 3:** Station: Mountlake Terrace, Extension: North Corridor HCT, City/Neighborhood: Mountlake Terrace, Projected Opening: 2023, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: Yes.\n   - No hospital here either.\n\n5. **Row 4:** Station: Lynnwood, Extension: North Corridor HCT, City/Neighborhood: Lynnwood, Projected Opening: 2023, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: Yes.\n   - Lynnwood doesn't have a hospital mentioned.\n\n6. **Row 5:** Station: Alderwood, Extension: Future North Corridor, City/Neighborhood: Alderwood Mall & Lynnwood, Projected Opening: 2023, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n   - The neighborhood here is a combination of Alderwood Mall and Lynnwood. No hospital noted.\n\n7. **Row 6:** Station: 164th / Ash Way, Extension: Future North Corridor, City/Neighborhood: Lynnwood, Projected Opening: 2023, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: No.\n   - Lynnwood again, no hospital mentioned.\n\n8. **Row 7:** Station: Everett Station, Extension: Future North Corridor, City/Neighborhood: Everett, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: No.\n   - Everett's city name doesn't indicate a hospital.\n\n9. **Row 8:** Station: Highline Community College, Extension: South Link, City/Neighborhood: Des Moines, Projected Opening: 2020, Park and Ride: Yes, Funded by ST2: Yes.\n   - Des Moines, no mention of a hospital.\n\n10. **Row 9:** Station: Redondo / St. Redmond, Extension: East Link, City/Neighborhood: Redmond, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n    - The city is Redmond, but the station name includes 'St.' which might stand for something else, not necessarily a hospital.\n\n11. **Row 10:** Station: SE Redmond, Extension: East Link, City/Neighborhood: Redmond, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n    - Again, the city is Redmond. The station name 'SE Redmond' doesn't specify a hospital.\n\n12. **Row 11:** Station: Se Redmond, Extension: East Link, City/Neighborhood: Redmond, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n    - This seems to be the same as Row 10, perhaps a typo or duplicate.\n\n13. **Row 12:** Station: Se Redmond, Extension: East Link, City/Neighborhood: Redmond, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n    - Same as above, so no hospital in Redmond.\n\n14. **Row 13:** Station: Se Redmond, Extension: East Link, City/Neighborhood: Redmond, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n    - Again, same as before.\n\nWait, looking at Row 24:\n\n**Row 24:** Station: SE Redmond, Extension: East Link, City/Neighborhood: Redmond, Projected Opening: Unknown, Park and Ride: No, Funded by ST2: No.\n- The city is Redmond. The station name is 'SE Redmond', which might refer to something else.\n\nI'm noticing that the table doesn't explicitly mention any hospitals in the 'city/neighborhood' column. However, some cities have hospitals, so perhaps I need to look for rows where the city has a hospital and check if a station is proposed there.\n\nFor example, if a row says City: Bellevue, and Bellevue has a hospital, does the table show a station at that hospital?\n\nLooking through all the rows again, I don't see any 'city/neighborhood' column entries that mention hospitals. Therefore, it seems like none of the neighborhoods listed have a proposed station at a hospital.\n\nWait, but the claim is \"1 neighborhood doesn't have station propose at a hospital.\" So if there are multiple neighborhoods without such stations, does this make the statement TRUE?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim could be saying that in one specific neighborhood, no station is proposed at a hospital. Since none of the neighborhoods have a hospital mentioned, then technically, each neighborhood doesn't have a station propose at a hospital. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut to verify this, I need to check if any row's 'city/neighborhood' includes a hospital and whether a station exists there. If not, then the statement holds.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- None of the city/neighborhood entries mention hospitals.\n- Therefore, in every neighborhood listed, there isn't a proposed station at a hospital.\n- The claim is specifically about \"1 neighborhood,\" so it's true that at least one exists where this is the case. Since all neighborhoods fit this condition, the statement holds.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because there are neighborhoods without proposed stations at hospitals, and the claim specifies at least one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that at least one neighborhood lacks a proposed station at a hospital. Upon reviewing the table, none of the listed neighborhoods explicitly mention hospitals in their 'city/neighborhood' column, indicating no station is proposed there.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"City / Neighborhood\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
