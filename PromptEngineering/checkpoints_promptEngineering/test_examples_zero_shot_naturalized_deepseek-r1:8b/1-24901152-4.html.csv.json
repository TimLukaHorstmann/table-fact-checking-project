The claim says, \"in 2003, the player was the winner at the championship in rome and also the championship in toronto.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table data for the year 2003. Let me go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner, year 2003, location is rome. So that's one of the championships mentioned in the claim. The surface is clay, partner is Martina Navratilova, opponents are Jelena Dokic and Nadia Petrova, with a score of 6-4, 5-7, 6-2. That seems relevant.\n\nRow 2: Also year 2003, location toronto. Outcome is winner again. Surface is hard, partner same as before, opponents different. The score is 3-6, 6-1, 6-1. So this matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both row 1 and row 2 are from 2003, and they both have outcome as winner for rome and toronto respectively.

The claim says: \"the partner for both the championship in rome in 2003 and the championship in toronto in 2003 be martina navratilova.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see which ones are relevant. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nRow 1 talks about the Rome championship in 2003. The partner there is Martina Navratilova. So that seems relevant because it matches the claim.\n\nRow 2 is about the Toronto championship in 2003. Again, the partner is Martina Navratilova. That's also relevant because the claim mentions both Rome and Toronto for this year.\n\nRow 3 is from 2004 in Indian Wells. It says runner-up with a different partner, so probably not relevant to the specific claim about 2003 tournaments.\n\nRow 4 is also from 2004 in Miami, another runner-up situation, so again not relevant to the years mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 5 is about Miami in 2005, which isn't part of the claim at all. So it's irrelevant here.\n\nSo the relevant cells are Row 1 and Row 2. Each of these has the column \"partner\" with Martina Navratilova as the value.

The player should have been the runner-up in two specific tournaments: Indian Wells (2004) and Miami (2004). So I need to check these two tournaments in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 3: outcome is runner-up, year 2004, championship: Indian Wells. Surface is hard, partner: Elena Likhovtseva, opponents: Virginia Ruano Pascual Paola Su\u00e1rez, score: 6-1, 6-2.

In 2005, the opponent was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\n2. In Rome in 2003, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\nThere are five rows, each representing a different event. Each row has several columns: outcome (winner or runner-up), year, championship location, surface type, partner, opponents, and score.\n\nLet me go through each relevant part of the claim against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim about 2005:\n- The claim says that in 2005, the opponent was Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs.\nLooking at the table, Row 5 is from 2005. It's outcome is a winner, location is Miami, surface is hard, partner is Alicia Molik, opponents are Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. So this matches exactly. Therefore, the first part of the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim about Rome in 2003:\n- The claim states that in Rome in 2003, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\nLooking at Row 1: It's from 2003, location is Rome, surface is clay. Partners are Martina Navratilova, and opponents are Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. So this also matches exactly.\n\nWait a second, but let me check if there's another row that might also have information about Rome in 2003. Row 1 is the only one from 2003, and it's in Rome. So yes, opponents are Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nPutting it all together, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check:\n\n- For 2005: Only Row 5 has year 2005, opponents Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs.\n- For Rome in 2003: Only Row 1 matches location, year, surface (clay), and the opponents are as stated.\n\nSo yes, both conditions in the claim are fully supported by the table.

Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 2003 , the player be the winner at the 2004 championship in miami and also the championship in indian well\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions two championships: one in Miami for 2004 and another in Indian Wells, also for 2004. The player is claimed to have won both of these.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, the years are 2003, 2003, 2004, 2004, and 2005. So rows 0-1 are 2003, rows 2-3 are 2004, and row 4 is 2005.\n\nThe claim refers to two specific championships: Miami in 2004 and Indian Wells in 2004. I need to check if any of the players won both these titles in 2004.\n\nLooking at row 0: outcome is winner, year 2003, championship Rome (clay), partner Martina Navratilova, etc. So this is about 2003, not 2004, so it doesn't apply here.\n\nRow 1: also 2003, different location, Toronto, surface hard. Again, not relevant for 2004.\n\nRows 2 and 3 are 2004: row 2 is Indian Wells, surface hard, outcome runner-up; row 3 is Miami, also 2004, outcome runner-up. So in 2004, the player was a runner-up in both Indian Wells and Miami. That means they didn't win either of them that year.\n\nRow 4 is 2005: different year, so not relevant here.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in 2003\" the player won both 2004 championships. That seems impossible because you can't win a 2004 championship in 2003. Championships are held in specific years, and winners are determined then. So if someone won Indian Wells or Miami in 2004, they couldn't have done so in 2003.\n\nBut the table doesn't show any player winning both Indian Wells and Miami in 2004. Both times, the outcome is runner-up. So regardless of that, the claim is making a statement about 2003 when it refers to 2004 championships, which seems contradictory because you can't win a future year's championship in the past.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it combines a past year (2003) with future championship wins (2004). Also, from the table, no player won both in 2004 as per their outcomes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that a player won both the 2004 Miami and Indian Wells championships in 2003, which is impossible.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the partner for both the championship in rome in 2003 and the championship in toronto in 2003 be alicia molik.\" So, it's saying that Alicia Molik was the partner in both the 2003 Rome Championship and the 2003 Toronto Championship.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nRow 1: This is for the 2003 Rome Championship. The outcome is winner, year is 2003, championship location is Rome, surface is clay, partner is Martina Navratilova, opponents are Jelena Dokic and Nadia Petrova, with a score of 6-4, 5-7, 6-2.\n\nRow 2: This is for the 2003 Toronto Championship. The outcome is winner, year is 2003, championship location is Toronto, surface is hard, partner is Martina Navratilova, opponents are Mar\u00eda Vento-Kabchi and Angelique Widjaja, with a score of 3-6, 6-1, 6-1.\n\nRow 3: This is for the 2004 Indian Wells Championship. The outcome is runner-up, year 2004, etc., partner is Elena Likhovtseva, so not relevant here.\n\nRow 4: Also for 2004 Miami, same as above.\n\nRow 5: For 2005 Miami, winner with partner Alicia Molik, so this row is relevant because it mentions her being a partner in a different year and location.\n\nNow, focusing on the two championships mentioned in the claim: Rome (2003) and Toronto (2003). \n\nFor the 2003 Rome Championship (Row 1), the partner is Martina Navratilova. So that's different from Alicia Molik.\n\nFor the 2003 Toronto Championship (Row 2), again, the partner is Martina Navratilova. So neither of these two has Alicia Molik as their partner in 2003.\n\nBut wait, there is a Row 5 for 2005 Miami where Alicia Molik was the partner. But that's in a different year, so the claim specifically refers to 2003 championships.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Alicia Molik wasn't the partner in either Rome or Toronto in 2003.

They were also the runner-up at the 2004 Toronto Championship.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to find out if any row supports these statements.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing different championships, years, surfaces, partners, opponents, and scores. The relevant information for the claim would likely be in rows where the outcome is \"runner - up\" and the year is 2004, specifically for Rome and Toronto.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Outcome is winner, year 2003, championship Rome. So not runner-up in 2004.\nRow 2: Outcome is winner, year 2003, championship Toronto. Also a win, so doesn't apply.\nRow 3: Outcome is runner - up, year 2004, championship Indian Wells. Not Rome or Toronto.\nRow 4: Runner - up, year 2004, championship Miami. Again, not the ones mentioned in the claim.\nRow 5: Winner, year 2005, so not relevant for 2004.\n\nWait, but looking at the rows again, none of them mention runner-ups specifically for Rome or Toronto in 2004. The only runner-up in 2004 is Row 3 and 4, which are Indian Wells and Miami. There's no row that mentions runner-up in Rome or Toronto for 2004.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim seems to be making statements about two specific runner-ups in 2004 at those championships, but there's no data supporting it in the table.

Let me start by understanding both the claim and the table.\n\nThe table has five rows, each representing a different event, probably tennis matches or championships. Each row includes details like outcome (whether the player won or was the runner-up), the year, the championship location, the surface type, the partner in the doubles match, the opponents, and the score.\n\nLooking at the claim: \"the opponent in 2005 be jelena doki\u0107 and nadia petrova and in rome in 2003 , the opponent be lisa raymond rennae stubbs.\" \n\nSo the claim is making two specific points. First, in 2005, when there was a championship, Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova were the opponents. Second, in Rome in 2003, Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs were the opponents.\n\nI need to check both parts against the table provided.\n\nStarting with the 2005 part of the claim. Looking at the table, Row 5 is for 2005. The championship was in Miami, not Rome, so that's different. Wait, but the claim says \"opponent in 2005,\" and the table shows that in 2005, the opponents were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs (from row 5). However, the claim is saying that in 2005, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. So that's conflicting because according to the table, it's not those two but a different pair.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me check again. Row 5: year 2005, championship Miami, surface hard, partner Alicia Molik, opponents Lisa Raymond Rennae Stubbs. So yes, in 2005, the opponents were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, not Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is incorrect because it's referring to the wrong opponents for 2005. However, let me make sure I'm interpreting \"opponent\" correctly. The term might be used differently, but in doubles matches, the partners are separate from the opponents, so the opponents would be the other two players. So in row 5, the opponents were Lisa and Rennae, not Jelena and Nadia.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the claim: in Rome in 2003, the opponents were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. From the table, Row 1 is for 2003, location Rome, surface clay, partners Martina Navratilova, opponents Jelena Doki\u0107 Nadia Petrova, score 6-4 etc.\n\nSo the claim says that in Rome (championship), the opponents were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs. But according to Row 1, the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova. So both parts of the claim are incorrect: the 2005 opponents are not as claimed, and the 2003 opponents in Rome are also not as claimed.\n\nWait a second\u2014wait, I'm confused because the table's row 1 is for 2003, Rome, partners Martina Navratilova, opponents Jelena Doki\u0107 Nadia Petrova. So the claim says that in 2003 Rome, the opponents were Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, but according to the table, it was Jelena and Nadia.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are wrong: the 2005 opponents are not as claimed, and the 2003 opponents in Rome are also not as per the table. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up partners and opponents. In doubles matches, each player partners with someone else, so the opponents would be the other two players on the opposing team. So for example, if Martina Navratilova was the partner in 2003 Rome, then the opponents were Jelena Doki\u0107 and Nadia Petrova.\n\nSo yes, the claim incorrectly states that Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs were the opponents in both 2005 and 2003 Rome. But actually, in 2003 Rome, they weren't; it was Jelena and Nadia, and in 2005 Miami, it's Lisa and Rennae.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the opponent in 2005 be...\" So is it referring to both players or just one? Probably both since they're listed as opponents. So yes, the claim is incorrect on both counts.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the opponents for both 2003 Rome and 2005 Miami, making it false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Outcome is runner-up, partner is Elena Likhovtseva, opponents are Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Su\u00e1rez, score 6-1,6-2.\n\nRow 4: 2004 Miami, hard court. Runner-up, partner again Elena Likhovtseva, opponents Nadia Petrova and Meghann Shaughnessy, score 6-2,6-3.\n\nRow 5: 2005 Miami, hard court. Winner, partner Alicia Molik, opponents Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs, score 7-5,6-7 (with a tiebreak),6-2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim. The first part says in 2004 at Indian Wells, the partner was Martina Navratilova. Looking at Row 3, it shows that in 2004 at Indian Wells, the partner was Elena Likhovtseva, not Navratilova. So this part of the claim seems false.\n\nThe second part says in 2003 at Toronto, the partner was Lisa Raymond. Checking Row 2, it's about 2003 Toronto with partner Martina Navratilova, not Lisa Raymond. So that part is also false.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table provided.\n\nI need to make sure I'm checking the right cells. The relevant cells for each part of the claim would be:\n\n- For 2004 Indian Wells: Check if partner is Martina Navratilova. So row_index 3 (since rows start at 0, so 3 is Row 4? Wait no, wait the table has 5 rows, indexed from 0 to 4.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The first row is index 0: outcome: winner, year:2003, championship:rome,...\n\nRow 1: index 1\n\nRow 2: index 2 (championship: toronto)\n\nRow 3: index 3 (indian wells)\n\nRow 4: index 4 (miami)\n\nRow5: index5? No, the rows are up to 5? Wait no, the table has 5 rows, so row indices 0-4.\n\nWait no, actually looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe table is given as:\n\nRow 1: outcome: winner, year: 2003, championship: rome,...\n\nSo each row corresponds to a different event. So Row 1 is index 0, Row 2 is index 1, etc., up to Row5 being index4.\n\nWait no, the user wrote it as:\n\nRow 1: ... (index 0)\n\nRow 2: ... (index 1)\n\nRow3: ... (index2)\n\nRow4:... (index3)\n\nRow5:...(index4)\n\nSo for the first part of the claim, 2004 Indian Wells, partner is Martina. So looking at Row3 (index2) is about 2004 Indian Wells.\n\nWait no: Row1: 2003, Rome\n\nRow2: 2003, Toronto\n\nRow3: 2004, Indian Wells\n\nRow4:2004, Miami\n\nRow5:2005, Miami\n\nSo the partner in 2004 Indian Wells is Elena Likhovtseva (Row3), not Navratilova.\n\nFor the second part, 2003 Toronto: Row2 has partner Martina Navratilova, not Lisa Raymond. So the claim is incorrect on both points.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\n- For the first assertion (2004 Indian Wells): row_index=2 (Row3), column_name='partner'\n\n- For the second assertion (2003 Toronto): row_index=1 (Row2), column_name='partner'\n\nSo the JSON would include these two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"partner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
