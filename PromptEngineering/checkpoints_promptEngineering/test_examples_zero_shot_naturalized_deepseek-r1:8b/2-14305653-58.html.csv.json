    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score of 2:1.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the type of game is 'friendly'. In the table, there are three such matches:\n\n- Row 1: March 22 vs. Uruguay, friendly, result 2:1\n- Row 3: April 26 vs. Poland, friendly, result 2:1\n- The claim mentions \"both of its friendly matches,\" implying two matches, but I count three in the table.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If there are only two matches, but the table shows three, does that mean the claim is incorrect? Or perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLooking again: Row 1 and Row 3 are definitely friendly matches with 2:1 results. That makes two wins. The third friendly match is on August 27 (Row 4), which is a Balkan Cup game, not a friendly match. So the claim refers to both of its friendly matches, which would be Rows 1 and 3.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"both of its friendly match\" in singular. Maybe it's a typo, but regardless, looking for two matches. The user probably meant to refer to two games, so checking if they won both with a score of 2:1.\n\nIn Row 1, Yugoslavia beat Uruguay 2:1.\nIn Row 3, Yugoslavia beat Poland 2:1.\n\nSo the claim is correct in that they won both friendly matches by 2:1. The third row's result isn't relevant here because it's not a friendly match but a Balkan Cup.\n\nWait, but the table shows three friendly matches: Rows 1, 3, and maybe Row 7? No, Row 7 is an opponent match, so no, only Rows 1 and 3 are friendly. So two wins by 2:1 each.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both friendly matches were won with a score of 2:1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by two rows where Yugoslavia won their friendly matches with a 2:1 scoreline.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 1:4 in the balkan cup against romania on august 27.\" \n\nSo, I need to check if there's a match on August 27 where Yugoslavia played against Romania in the Balkan Cup and the result was 1:4. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 4 has date: august 27, city: bucharest , opponent: romania, results: 1:4, type of game: balkan cup.\n\nSo, this row seems to match all parts of the claim. The date is August 27, opponent is Romania, result is 1:4, and it's a Balkan Cup game. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"suffer its worst outcome.\" I should check if 1:4 is indeed their worst result in the table. Let me scan through all rows:\n\nRow 1: Friendly vs Uruguay, 2-1\nRow 2: Balkan Cup vs Romania, 2-0\nRow 3: Friendly vs Poland, 2-1\nRow 4: Balkan Cup vs Romania, 1-4 (this is a loss)\nRow 5: 1982 WCQ vs Luxembourg, 5-0\nRow 6: 1982 WCQ vs Denmark, 2-1\nRow 7: 1982 WCQ vs Italy, 0-2\n\nSo the results are 2-1 (friendly), 2-0, 2-1, 1-4, 5-0, 2-1, 0-2. The worst outcome would be the biggest loss, which is 0-2 or 1-4? Wait, in football terms, a higher goal difference for the opponent means worse outcome. So 0-2 (against Italy) and 1-4 (against Romania). Both are losses, but which one is worse? Yugoslavia lost 1-4 to Romania, which is more goals conceded than 0-2 against Italy. So 1-4 is indeed their worst outcome in this context.\n\nTherefore, the claim is correct based on Row 4. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is Row 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 0:2 against italy.\" So, they're saying that Yugoslavia lost a World Cup qualifier match against Italy with a score of 0-2 and failed to score in that game. That means in that particular match, Yugoslavia didn't score any goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all matches where Yugoslavia (I assume \"Yugoslavia\" is referred to as Serbia or another name in the table, but I'll check) played against Italy in World Cup qualifiers. Let's see each row:\n\nRow 7: date: november 15, city: torino , italy, opponent: italy, results: 0:2, type of game: 1982 wcq.\n\nSo this is a match between Yugoslavia and Italy on November 15, 1982, in Turin. The result was 0-2, so Yugoslavia lost the game and didn't score any goals. That directly matches the claim mentioned. \n\nNow, I should check if there are other relevant rows to ensure that this is the only occurrence where they failed to score against Italy in a World Cup qualifier. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: vs Uruguay (friendly)\nRow 2: vs Romania (Balkan Cup)\nRow 3: vs Poland (friendly)\nRow 4: vs Romania (Balkan Cup)\nRow 5: vs Luxembourg (1982 WCQ)\nRow 6: vs Denmark (1982 WCQ)\nRow 7: vs Italy (1982 WCQ)\n\nSo only Row 7 is the match against Italy in the World Cup qualifier, and Yugoslavia lost that game with a score of 0-2. They didn't score any goals there.\n\nThe claim says they \"fail to score only 1 time,\" which I think refers to this specific instance where they failed to score against Italy in a World Cup qualifier. So, this is supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is Row 7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table and then identify which cells are relevant. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"the yugoslavian national team lose the balkan cup against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4.\" I need to check each part of this statement against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has details about a match. The columns are date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. My goal is to see if there's any match that fits the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions a loss by Yugoslavia in the Balkan Cup against Romania with an aggregate score of 3:4. I know that an aggregate score implies both home and away matches combined, but looking at the table, each entry seems to be for a single match. So maybe the term \"aggregate\" refers to the total over two legs.\n\nNow, going through each row:\n\nRow 1: March 22 vs Uruguay in Sarajevo, friendly match. Not Romania or Balkan Cup.\nRow 2: March 30 vs Romania in Belgrade, Balkan Cup. Yugoslavia lost 0:2 here. But is this the only game? Wait, if it's a two-legged tournament, maybe there was another game at home against Romania.\n\nLooking further down, I see Row 4: August 27 in Bucharest against Romania for the Balkan Cup. The result here is 1:4. If these are two games (home and away), then adding them up would give a total of 3:6, not 3:4 as claimed.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the table's results? No, I should rely on what's given. So if Row 2 is 0:2 for Yugoslavia against Romania in Belgrade (away), and Row 4 is 1:4 when Yugoslavia played Romania at home, then total would be 1:6, not 3:4. But the claim says 3:4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding which games are part of the same tournament. Maybe there's another match in the table that fits. Let me check all rows again.\n\nRow 5 and Row 6 are about 1982 World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Denmark respectively. Rows 1,3 are friendly matches. So only Rows 2 and 4 are related to Romania in Balkan Cups.\n\nIn Row 2: Yugoslavia vs Romania, result 0:2.\nIn Row 4: Yugoslavia vs Romania, result 1:4.\n\nIf these are two games, the aggregate would be 1 (from home) + 0 (away) = 1 goal for Yugoslavia, and 4 + 2 = 6 goals against. So total score is 1:6, not 3:4. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. Now, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The claim refers to a loss in the Balkan Cup against Romania with a specific aggregate score. From the table, both Row 2 and Row 4 involve matches between Yugoslavia and Romania in the Balkan Cup. So the relevant cells would be Row 2 (results: 0:2) and Row 4 (results:1:4). The opponent column is also relevant because it's Romania in both cases.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions an aggregate score of 3:4. Since Yugoslavia scored 1 goal at home and 0 away, total is 1, not 3. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the table has incorrect data or the claim is misstated. But based on the given table, the total goals are 1:6, so the aggregate score isn't 3:4.\n\nTherefore, I need to mark Rows 2 and 4 as relevant because they relate to the opponent (Romania) in the Balkan Cup matches which the claim refers to.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because the total goals scored by Yugoslavia against Romania in the Balkan Cup are 1:6, not 3:4. The relevant cells are Rows 2 and 4.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim about the Yugoslavian national team is true or false based on the table provided. Let me start by carefully reading both the claim and the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 3 1982 world cup qualify match.\" So, it's stating that Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and allowed 3 goals across three matches during the 1982 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nRow 1: March 22, Sarajevo vs. Uruguay, friendly game, result 2-1.\nRow 2: March 30, Belgrade vs. Romania, Balkan Cup, result 2-0.\nRow 3: April 26, Borovo vs. Poland, friendly, 2-1.\nRow 4: August 27, Bucharest vs. Romania, Balkan Cup, 1-4.\nRow 5: September 10, Luxembourg vs. Luxembourg, 1982 WCQ, 5-0.\nRow 6: September 27, Ljubljana vs. Denmark, 1982 WCQ, 2-1.\nRow 7: November 15, Torino vs. Italy, 1982 WCQ, 0-2.\n\nWait, the last match is against Italy with a score of 0-2, but the claim mentions three matches in 1982 World Cup qualifiers. So, I need to check which rows correspond to the 1982 World Cup qualify matches.\n\nLooking at row 5: September 10, Luxembourg vs. Luxembourg, results 5-0, type is 1982 wcq.\nRow 6: September 27, Ljubljana vs. Denmark, 2-1, 1982 wcq.\nRow 7: November 15, Torino vs. Italy, 0-2, 1982 wcq.\n\nSo rows 5, 6, and 7 are the three matches in question for the 1982 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nNow, let's check the goals. The claim says Yugoslavia scored 7 goals in total across these three matches. Let me add up their scores:\n\nRow 5: Yugoslavia vs. Luxembourg, result 5-0. So, Yugoslavia scored 5.\nRow 6: Yugoslavia vs. Denmark, 2-1. So, scored 2.\nRow 7: Yugoslavia vs. Italy, 0-2. So, they didn't score here.\n\nTotal goals scored by Yugoslavia: 5 + 2 + 0 = 7. That matches the claim.\n\nNext part of the claim: allow 3 against. That means opponents scored 3 goals in total across these three matches.\n\nOpponents are Luxembourg (5-0), Denmark (2-1), and Italy (0-2).\n\nGoals allowed:\n\nRow 5: Opponent scored 0.\nRow 6: Opponent scored 1.\nRow 7: Opponent scored 2.\nTotal allowed goals: 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. That matches the claim.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table provided. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks out with the table data as both the goals scored and goals allowed align perfectly across the three specified matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

It states: \"the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score 0:2.\" So, they're claiming that in all their friendly matches, Yugoslavia won with a score of 0-2.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: date, city, opponent, results, and type of game. I'm interested in the rows where the type of game is \"friendly\" because the claim is about friendly matches.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 1: Date March 22, City Sarajevo, Opponent Uruguay, Results 2:1, Type Friendly.\nHere, Yugoslavia (assuming they're the home team) scored 2 goals against Uruguay. The result is a win for them with a score of 2-1. This doesn't match the claim's 0-2 score.\n\nRow 3: Date April 26, City Borovo, Opponent Poland, Results 2:1, Type Friendly.\nAgain, Yugoslavia won 2-1 against Poland. Not matching the claimed 0-2 result.\n\nRows 4 and 5 are about Balkan Cup matches and World Cup Qualifiers (1982), which are different types of games, so they don't count for friendly matches.\n\nWait, row 7: November 15 in Torino against Italy, Results 0:2. Type is 1982 wcq, not friendly. So that's a loss, but it's not a friendly match as per the claim.\n\nSo, from the table, there are only two friendly matches where Yugoslavia played:\n\nRow 1: March 22 vs Uruguay (they won 2-1)\nRow 3: April 26 vs Poland (they won 2-1)\n\nNeither of these matches resulted in a 0-2 score. In fact, they both ended with Yugoslavia winning by 2 goals. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that both friendly matches were won 0-2, but the table shows wins of 2-1.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. The claim says \"win both of its friendly match by a score 0:2.\" So, in both games, Yugoslavia should have lost with a 0-2 score. But according to the table, they didn't lose any friendly matches; they won both.\n\nSo the claim is false because the table shows that in both friendly matches, Yugoslavia scored 2 goals and won, not losing 0-2.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Yugoslavia won both of its friendly matches by a score of 0:2. However, examining the table:\n\n- In Row 1 (Friendly), Yugoslavia beat Uruguay 2:1.\n- In Row 3 (Friendly), Yugoslavia beat Poland 2:1.\n\nNeither match resulted in a 0:2 loss, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"results\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 2:1 in the balken cup against poland on march 22.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into key components:\n\n1. **Yugoslavian National Team**: This is the subject of the claim.\n2. **Worst outcome**: This implies the highest or most significant loss.\n3. **Lose 2:1**: The score of the match.\n4. **Balken Cup**: The type of competition.\n5. **Against Poland on March 22**: The opponent and date.\n\nNext, I'll check each row in the table to see if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at Row 1:\n- Date: March 22\n- City: Sarajevo\n- Opponent: Uruguay\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type of game: Friendly\n\nThis is a friendly match against Uruguay, not Poland. So it's not the right opponent or competition type mentioned in the claim.\n\nRow 2:\n- Date: March 30\n- City: Belgrade\n- Opponent: Romania\n- Results: 2:0\n- Type of game: Balkan Cup\n\nThis is a Balkan Cup match against Romania, but it's on March 30, not March 22. Also, the opponent isn't Poland.\n\nRow 3:\n- Date: April 26\n- City: Borovo\n- Opponent: Poland\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type of game: Friendly\n\nHere, the date is April 26, which doesn't match March 22. The opponent is Poland and the result is a win for Yugoslavia with a score of 2:1. But since the claim refers to a loss, this row might not directly support it unless there's more context.\n\nRow 4:\n- Date: August 27\n- City: Bucharest\n- Opponent: Romania\n- Results: 1:4\n- Type of game: Balkan Cup\n\nThis is another Balkan Cup match against Romania but on a different date. The result is a loss, but again, the opponent isn't Poland.\n\nRow 5:\n- Date: September 10\n- City: Luxembourg\n- Opponent: Luxembourg\n- Results: 5:0\n- Type of game: 1982 wcq\n\nThis seems to be a World Cup qualifying match against Luxembourg.\n\nRow 6:\n- Date: September 27\n- City: Ljubljana\n- Opponent: Denmark\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type of game: 1982 wcq\n\nAnother World Cup qualifier, this time against Denmark.\n\nRow 7:\n- Date: November 15\n- City: Torino, Italy\n- Opponent: Italy\n- Results: 0:2\n- Type of game: 1982 wcq\n\nHere, Yugoslavia lost to Italy with a score of 0:2 in the World Cup qualifiers.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim again. It mentions a loss of 2:1 against Poland in the Balkan Cup on March 22. From the table, I see that on March 22 (Row 1), Yugoslavia played a friendly match against Uruguay and won 2:1. The only time Yugoslavia lost to Poland was on April 26 (Row 3) with a score of 2:1, but it was a friendly game, not a loss in the Balkan Cup.\n\nAdditionally, looking for losses in the Balkan Cup, the only match listed is against Romania on March 30 (Row 2) and August 27 (Row 4). In those matches, Yugoslavia didn't lose to Poland; they lost to Romania. So there's no record of a loss against Poland in the Balkan Cup.\n\nThe claim mentions the worst outcome, which typically would be a significant defeat. However, based on the table provided, Yugoslavia did not have a 2:1 loss against Poland in the Balkan Cup on March 22. Their only loss to Poland was in April, but that wasn't a Balkan Cup match and resulted in a win for Yugoslavia.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be incorrect as per the given data.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": []}",

Let me break it down. The claim is saying that Yugoslavia lost a match against Italy, and the total score was 3-4. But looking at the table, I need to check each row for matches between Yugoslavia (which I think is represented by \"Yugoslavia\" in some contexts, but here it's just the team, so perhaps we're referring to their opponents) against Italy or Romania.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the table, the opponents are listed. So first, let me see which matches involve both Italy and Romania against Yugoslavia.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Yugoslavia vs Uruguay in Sarajevo. Doesn't involve Italy or Romania.\n\nRow 2: Yugoslavia vs Romania in Belgrade. That's one match, but not against Italy.\n\nRow 3: Yugoslavia vs Poland in Borovo. Not relevant.\n\nRow 4: Romania vs Romania? Wait, that seems odd. Opponent is Romania and the city is Bucharest. So it's a Romania vs Romania match? Maybe a friendly or something else, but that doesn't involve Italy.\n\nRow 5: Luxembourg vs Luxembourg? That can't be right. It should probably be Yugoslavia vs Luxembourg since they're playing in the 1982 WCQ. Wait, looking at row 5 again: opponent is romania? No, wait, no\u2014row 5 says \"opponent: romania\" but earlier rows have Romania as an opponent. Wait no, let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let's list out each row properly:\n\nRow 1:\n- Date: March 22\n- City: Sarajevo\n- Opponent: Uruguay\n- Results: 2:1\n- Type: Friendly\n\nSo Yugoslavia (assuming they are the home team) played against Uruguay.\n\nRow 2:\n- March 30, Belgrade, Romania is the opponent. So Yugoslavia vs Romania in a Balkan Cup match, score 2-0.\n\nRow 3:\n- April 26, Borovo, Poland. Score 2-1.\n\nRow 4:\n- August 27, Bucharest, opponent: Romania. Wait, so Romania is playing against whom? The opponent is Romania again. So it's a Romania vs Romania match? That seems unusual unless it's a friendly or some other type of game. Maybe a mistake in the data.\n\nRow 5:\n- September 10, Luxembourg, opponent: romania? Or is it that the opponent is actually Yugoslavia? Wait, looking back, row 5 says \"opponent: romania\". But then row 6 is against Denmark in WCQ. So perhaps row 5 is a mistake because Romania vs Romania doesn't make sense unless it's a typo and should be Yugoslavia vs Romania.\n\nBut regardless, the claim is about Yugoslavia losing to Italy with a score of 3-4 aggregate.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to see if there's any match where Yugoslavia played against Italy.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Uruguay\n\nRow 2: Romania\n\nRow 3: Poland\n\nRow 4: Romania again, but same team.\n\nRow 5: opponent is romania (could be a typo, perhaps meant Yugoslavia vs Romania), results 1-4 in Balkan Cup? Wait, no, row 4 was Romania vs Romania with 1-4. So row 5 is probably another match, maybe Yugoslavia vs Romania again?\n\nWait, the user provided data as:\n\nRow 1: opponent: uruguay\n\nRow 2: opponent: romania\n\nRow 3: opponent: poland\n\nRow 4: opponent: romania\n\nRow 5: opponent: romania (but maybe it's a typo)\n\nWait no, looking back, row 5 says \"opponent: romania\" and the results are 1:4, type of game: balkan cup. So that would be Romania vs Romania again? That seems odd.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Maybe each row is for the Yugoslovenian team's matches, so the opponent is who they played against.\n\nWait, no, in row 5, it says \"opponent: romania\", which would mean that the Yugoslovenian team played against Romania with a score of 1-4 in a Balkan Cup. So that's one match where Yugoslavia lost to Romania.\n\nSimilarly, in row 2, Yugoslavia beat Romania 2-0 in a Balkan Cup.\n\nSo, in row 5, they lost 1-4. That's a loss against Romania.\n\nNow, the claim is about losing to Italy with a total score of 3-4.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find if there's any match where Yugoslavia played against Italy.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Uruguay\n\nRow 2: Romania\n\nRow 3: Poland\n\nRow 4: Romania again (maybe it's a typo and should be Yugoslavia vs Romania)\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"Italy\", so we need to see if any match is against Italy.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nNo row has an opponent as Italy. The opponents listed are Uruguay, Romania, Poland, and then in row 5 and 6: wait, no. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the table's \"opponent\" column sometimes refers to Yugoslavia? No, I think each row is a match that Yugoslavia played, so the opponent is who they were playing against.\n\nSo looking for any opponent as Italy in the table:\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\nRow 1: Uruguay\n\nRow 2: Romania\n\nRow 3: Poland\n\nRow 4: Romania\n\nRow 5: Romania\n\nRow 6: Denmark (in 1982 WCQ)\n\nRow 7: Italy (opponent is italy, so Yugoslavia vs Italy in a 1982 WCQ match.\n\nWait, row 7 says:\n\nDate: November 15, City: torino, opponent: italy, results: 0:2, type of game: 1982 wcq.\n\nSo that's the Yugoslovenian team (assuming they are the home team) playing against Italy in a World Cup qualifying match. The result was 0-2 loss.\n\nSo that's one match where Yugoslavia lost to Italy with a score of 0-2, not 3-4.\n\nThe claim says they lost to Italy with an aggregate score of 3-4. So the total across two matches would be 3-4, but looking at the table, they only played Italy once, resulting in a 0-2 loss.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the aggregate score isn't 3-4; it's just 0-2 from one match.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions \"lose the italy against romania\", which seems like a typo or misunderstanding. It should be Yugoslavia vs Italy, not against Romania.\n\nSo the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Yugoslovenian national team lost to Italy with an aggregate score of 3-4. Upon examining the table, there's only one match between them (Row 7), resulting in a 0-2 loss, not a 3-4 aggregate. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"type\": \"Answer\",\n    \"text\": \"The claim is false because the Yugoslovenian team only lost to Italy once with a score of 0-2, not an aggregate of 3-4.\"\n  }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table. The claim says: \"the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It mentions two main points: failing to score only once in a match and losing a World Cup qualifying match 2:1 against Denmark.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify any matches where Yugoslavia (since it's about the Yugo national team) played against Denmark in a World Cup qualifier. The column for type of game includes '1982 wcq', which probably stands for World Cup qualification. So, the relevant rows would be those with '1982 wcq' and an opponent of Denmark.\n\nChecking the table:\n\nRow 6: date: september 27, city: ljubljana, opponent: denmark, results: 2:1, type of game: 1982 wcq.\n\nThis matches. So, there's at least one match where Yugoslavia played against Denmark in a World Cup qualifier. Now, looking at the result, it was 2:1 in favor of Yugoslavia. Wait, but the claim says they \"drop\" (lost) the match. Hmm, that seems contradictory because 2:1 means Yugoslavia won.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The opponent is Denmark, so if Yugoslavia scored 2 and Denmark 1, then Yugoslavia won, not lost. So the claim might be incorrect here.\n\nNext part of the claim: failing to score only once. Let me check all matches where Yugoslavia failed to score or scored once. Looking through each row:\n\nRow 1: Yugoslavia vs Uruguay, friendly match, result 2:1 \u2013 they scored twice.\nRow 3: Yugoslavia vs Poland, friendly, 2:1 \u2013 scored twice.\nRow 4: Yugoslavia vs Romania, Balkan Cup, lost 1:4 \u2013 scored once.\nRow 5: Yugoslavia vs Luxembourg, WCQ, won 5:0 \u2013 scored five times.\nRow 6: Yugoslavia vs Denmark, WCQ, 2:1 \u2013 scored twice.\nRow7: Yugoslavia vs Italy, WCQ, lost 0:2 \u2013 didn't score.\n\nSo, in the match against Romania (row4), they scored once. Against Italy (row7), they didn't score at all. So, there are multiple instances where they failed to score or scored only once. However, the claim specifically mentions \"fail to score only 1 time\" and losing a WCQ against Denmark.\n\nFrom the table, Yugoslavia played against Denmark only in row6. In that match, Yugoslavia won 2:1, so they didn't drop (lose) the match. Therefore, the claim's assertion about dropping the match is incorrect. Also, while they did have matches where they scored once or none, the specific instance of losing to Denmark doesn't hold.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Yugoslavia didn't lose that match and their score in that game was a win, not a loss.\n</think>\n\nThe claim's assertion about Yugoslavia dropping a World Cup qualifier against Denmark is incorrect as Yugoslavia won 2:1. Additionally, while they had other matches with limited scores, the specific instance doesn't support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about the Yugoslavian national team is true or false based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" I need to parse this to see what exactly is being claimed.\n\nThe claim mentions two main statistics: scoring 7 goals and allowing 3 goals. It also specifies that this happened \"in the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" So, I'm looking for matches in 1982 World Cup qualifiers where Yugoslavia scored 7 goals while conceding 3.\n\nNow, I'll look at each row of the table to find relevant information. \n\nRow 1: March 22, Sarajevo vs. Uruguay \u2013 friendly match, result 2-1. Doesn't mention any goal counts beyond the score, so probably not relevant for the specific numbers in the claim.\n\nRow 2: March 30, Belgrade vs. Romania \u2013 Balkan Cup, result 2-0. Again, only the final score is given, but no total goals in the match, so it doesn't help.\n\nRow 3: April 26, Borovo vs. Poland \u2013 friendly, result 2-1. Similar to Row 1, not enough info.\n\nRow 4: August 27, Bucharest vs. Romania \u2013 Balkan Cup, result 1-4. Here, Yugoslavia scored once and allowed four goals. Doesn't match the claim.\n\nRow 5: September 10, Luxembourg vs. Yugoslavia \u2013 1982 WCQ, result 0-5. Yugoslavia scored five goals here but allowed zero. Not matching the claim's 7-3 ratio.\n\nRow 6: September 27, Ljubljana vs. Denmark \u2013 1982 WCQ, result 2-1. Again, only a partial score provided, not enough for our check.\n\nRow 7: November 15, Torino vs. Yugoslavia \u2013 1982 WCQ, result 0-2. Yugoslavia scored zero and allowed two goals. Doesn't fit the claim.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. The claim says \"the 2 1982 world cup qualify score.\" Does that mean two matches in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers? So perhaps adding up all goals across multiple matches?\n\nLet me think: Looking for total goals in all Yugoslavian matches in the 1982 WCQ. Let's see each match:\n\n- Row 5: Yugoslavia scored 5, conceded 0.\n- Row 6: Scored 2, conceded 1.\n- Row 7: Scored 0, conceded 2.\n\nTotal scoring: 5+2+0=7 goals.\nConceded: 0+1+2=3 goals.\n\nSo across these three matches, Yugoslavia scored 7 and allowed 3. That seems to align with the claim.\n\nNow, checking each of these relevant rows (5,6,7) for the columns mentioned in the claim:\n\n- \"results\" column gives the score for each match.\n- \"type of game\" column tells us if it's a WCQ.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in Row 5,6,7 under \"results\" and \"type of game.\" But wait, the claim mentions two matches: maybe only Rows 5 and 6? Or all three?\n\nThe term \"2 1982 world cup qualify score\" might be referring to a specific match or two. However, from the table, there are three WCQ matches (Rows 5,6,7). The total across these is 7 goals scored and 3 conceded.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be Rows 5,6,7 for both results and type of game columns because they provide the necessary data to calculate the total goals and confirm that it's a World Cup qualifier.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on the sum of goals from these matches. The answer should list all three rows as relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"results\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"type of game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
