Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim is: \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie.\" So, they're saying that any team that has exactly 3 losses also has no ties in their games played.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different team with their respective statistics. The columns relevant here are \"losses\" and \"ties\". \n\nI'll go through each row to check if there's any team that has exactly 3 losses but also has any number of ties greater than zero.\n\nRow 1: Montreal Hockey Club - 3 losses, 0 ties.\nRow 2: Ottawa Hockey Club - 3 losses, 0 ties.\nRow 3: Montreal Victorias - 3 losses, 0 ties.\nRow 4: Quebec Hockey Club - 3 losses, 0 ties.\nRow 5: Montreal Crystals - 8 losses, 0 ties.\n\nWait a minute, in all these rows, every team with 3 losses has exactly 0 ties. So the claim is stating that if a team has 3 losses, they have 0 ties, which seems to be true because in the table, none of them have any ties when they have 3 losses.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I should check if there are any teams with exactly 3 losses and any number of ties other than zero. From the data given, all teams either have 0 or more ties but don't mix having 3 losses with non-zero ties.\n\nWait, no team in the table has both 3 losses and some ties. So does that mean the claim is true because whenever a team has exactly 3 losses, they indeed have 0 ties?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the wording of the claim. It says \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie.\" So perhaps it's saying that all teams with 3 losses have 0 ties.\n\nLooking back at the data, every team with 3 losses does have 0 ties. So the claim is true because there are no counterexamples in the table where a team has exactly 3 losses and some ties.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that any team with exactly 3 losses has 0 ties. Reviewing each row:\n\n- All teams with 3 losses (Rows 1, 2, 3, 4) have 0 ties.\n- No team with 3 losses has ties > 0.\n\nThus, the claim holds true in the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
