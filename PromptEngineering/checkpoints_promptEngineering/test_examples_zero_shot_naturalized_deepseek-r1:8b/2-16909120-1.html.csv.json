    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to verify the claim: \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The claim is saying that 217 is the smallest 1st lbsc number assigned to the granville name in the table provided. So, I need to check if there are any other entries with \"granville\" as their lbsc name and a lower 1st lbsc number than 217.\n\nLooking at the table, I should scan through each row to find rows where the lbsc name is \"granville.\" Let me start from the beginning of the table. \n\nRow 31 has 215 as the 1st lbsc number for Salisbury. Row 32 is granville with 216. Then, moving further down, in row 33, it's 217 again for Northcote. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the claim is about granville, so I need to focus only on rows where lbsc name is \"granville.\"\n\nWait, let me correct myself. Row 32 has granville with 216 as 1st lbsc number. Then row 33 is Northcote with 217. So that's a different name. Next, looking further down, in row 34 it's Beaconsfield, and so on until I get to rows where the name might be \"granville\" again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the table provided, after row 32 (granville 216), the next granville entry is nowhere else. Let me check all the rows carefully. \n\nWait, looking at the data, I see that the rows are numbered from 0 to 36 or so. For example, row 30: gladstone with 214. Then row 31: Salisbury 215. Row 32: granville 216. Row 33: Northcote 217. So, granville is only in row 32 with number 216.\n\nWait, but the claim says that 217 is the lowest 1st lbsc number for granville. That doesn't make sense because 216 is lower than 217. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant to say that 216 is the lowest, not 217. Or perhaps there's another row where granville has a lower number. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Various names, not granville.\n- ...\n- Row 30: gladstone, etc.\n- Row 31: Salisbury\n- Row 32: granville 216\n- Then rows beyond that don't have granville again.\n\nSo the lowest number for granville is 216. Therefore, the claim stating that 217 is the lowest must be incorrect because 216 is lower and belongs to granville as well.\n\nWait, but in row 33, it's Northcote with 217. So that's a different name. So the granville entry is at 216. Hence, 217 isn't even for granville; it's for Northcote.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the actual lowest number for granville is 216, not 217.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville,\" we need to check if there are any entries for granville with a lower 1st lbsc number than 217.\n\n**Step-by-Step Verification:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows with lbsc Name \"Granville\":**\n   - Scanning each row, the only occurrence of \"granville\" is in row 32 with a 1st lbsc number of 216.\n\n2. **Determine the Lowest Number for Granville:**\n   - The lowest number associated with granville is 216 (row 32).\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 217 is the lowest number, which is incorrect since 216 is lower and belongs to granville.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since 216 is the actual lowest number for granville, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
