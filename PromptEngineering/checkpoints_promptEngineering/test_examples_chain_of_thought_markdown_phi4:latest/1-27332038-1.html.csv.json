The writer's credit.\n\nLet's go through these steps systematically:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Episodes Written by Elaine Ko**: \n   - From the table, locate the row where \"written by\" is listed as \"elaine ko.\"\n\n2. **Check the Director of That Episode**:\n   - Once we have identified the correct episode, check who directed it under the \"directed by\" column.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the episode written by Elaine Ko was directed by Michael Spiller.\n   - Cross-reference the director from step 2 with Michael Spiller to verify if they match.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Step 1**: Locate Elaine Ko as a writer.\n  - By scanning through the table, we find:\n    - Row 15: \"princess party\" is written by elaine ko.\n\n- **Step 2**: Check who directed this episode.\n  - In the same row (Row 15), under \"directed by,\" it lists Michael Spiller as the director.\n\n- **Step 3**: Verify if the claim matches our findings.\n  - The claim states that the episode written by Elaine Ko was directed by Michael Spiller. Our findings from step 2 confirm this is true for the episode \"princess party.\"\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe information extracted confirms that the episode titled \"princess party,\" written by Elaine Ko, was indeed directed by Michael Spiller.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
