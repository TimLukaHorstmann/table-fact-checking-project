The opponent is listed as \"cleveland barons,\" which seems incorrect based on the claim. However, this row shows a game date of December 21st.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - In Row 31, the score for the game on December 21st is \"4 - 0\" in favor of the team listed as \"cleveland barons.\" This indicates that the Cleveland Barons scored no points against their opponent.\n   - The claim mentions Philadelphia Flyers, but the table does not list them as an opponent. Instead, it lists \"cleveland barons,\" which seems to be a mistake in labeling.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Despite the potential error in labeling (Cleveland Barons vs. themselves), the score of \"4 - 0\" confirms that Cleveland Barons scored no points on December 21st.\n   - The absence of Philadelphia Flyers in the table means the claim is technically true based on the scoring outcome, even though the opponent is mislabeled.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 31: Date (December 21), Opponent (\"cleveland barons\"), Score (\"4 - 0\").\n\nBased on this reasoning, the claim is TRUE because the Cleveland Barons scored no points against their opponent on December 21st, despite the mislabeling of the opponent.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the Cleveland Barons scored no points against the Philadelphia Flyers on December 21st.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Philadelphia Flyers' win by three points against the Boston Bruins during the 1977-78 season is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against the Boston Bruins:**\n   - We need to locate any games in the table where the opponent is \"boston bruins.\"\n\n2. **Examine Game Outcomes:**\n   - For each game against the Boston Bruins, check the score column to determine the result (win or loss) for the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\n3. **Determine Score Margin:**\n   - If there was a win, calculate the margin of victory by subtracting the opponent's score from the Flyers' score.\n\n4. **Verify the Specific Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies a win by three points. We need to see if any game against the Boston Bruins resulted in such a score difference.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Game 28:** \n  - Date: December 15\n  - Opponent: boston bruins\n  - Score: 6 - 4\n  - Result: Philadelphia Flyers won by 2 points (6 - 4 = 2)\n\n- **Game 32:**\n  - Date: December 23\n  - Opponent: boston bruins\n  - Score: 1 - 6\n  - Result: Philadelphia Flyers lost to the Boston Bruins\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe table shows two games against the Boston Bruins.
