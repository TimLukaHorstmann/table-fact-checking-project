This indicates they have indeed won multiple (more than one) bronze medals.\n\n4. **Check Other Nations for Multiple Bronze Medals:**\n   - Row 1 (China): 0 bronze medals.\n   - Row 3 (Bulgaria): 0 bronze medals.\n   - Row 4 (Switzerland): 0 bronze medals.\n   - Row 5 (Canada): 0 bronze medals.\n   - Row 6 (France): 0 bronze medals.\n   - Row 7 (Japan): 0 bronze medals.\n   - Row 8 (Russia): 1 bronze medal.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - No other nation in the table has won more than one bronze medal.
