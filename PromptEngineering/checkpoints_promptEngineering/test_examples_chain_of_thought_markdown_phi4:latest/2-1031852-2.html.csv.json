    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kansas City have no post-season record in 2013\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Year**: The claim concerns the year 2013.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for 2013**: In the markdown table, each row corresponds to a season (year). The row with \"season\" as 2013 is:\n   - | 2013     | brian buchanan | 44 - 42  |     512 | -                      | -                     | kansas city |\n\n3. **Check for Post-Season Record**: In the table, post-season records are found in two columns: \"post - season record\" and \"post - season win %\". For the year 2013:\n   - \"post - season record\": \"-\"\n   - \"post - season win %\": \"-\"\n\n4. **Verify the MLB Affiliate**: The claim specifies Kansas City, so we check the \"mlb affiliate\" column for this row to ensure it aligns with the claim.\n   - \"mlb affiliate\": \"kansas city\"\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Data**: Since both post-season columns show \"-\", it indicates that there is no post-season record for Kansas City in 2013.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that for the year 2013, the 'post - season record' and 'post - season win %' columns both have '-' indicating no post-season record.
