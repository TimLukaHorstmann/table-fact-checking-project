    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"from 2008 to 2011, the number of attempts be 888\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data provided for each year from 2008 to 2011 and then sum up the \"attempts\" for these years.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"attempts\" column for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n   \n2. **Extract Attempts for Each Year:**\n   - **2008:** The value is \"redshirt\", which means there were no attempts made as the player was redshirting that year.\n   - **2009:** The number of attempts is 87.\n   - **2010:** The number of attempts is 8.\n   - **2011:** The number of attempts is 404.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Attempts from 2008 to 2011:**\n   - Sum the attempts for each year:\n     \\[\n     0 (\\text{for 2008}) + 87 (\\text{for 2009}) + 8 (\\text{for 2010}) + 404 (\\text{for 2011}) = 499\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states the total number of attempts from 2008 to 2011 is 888.\n   - Our calculated total is 499, which does not match the claimed total of 888.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since our calculated total (499) does not equal the claimed total (888), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 2, Column \"attempts\" for 2008: \"redshirt\"\n- Row 3, Column \"attempts\" for 2009: 87\n- Row 4, Column \"attempts\" for 2010: 8\n- Row 5, Column \"attempts\" for 2011: 404\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that from 2008 to 2011, the number of attempts is 888.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze each part of it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Vanderberg's Attempts**: The claim states \"404 attempt be there for vanderberg on iowa.\" We need to find which row corresponds to this data point. Looking at the \"attempts\" column, we see that in 2011, Vanderberg (iowa) had 404 attempts.\n\n2. **Identify the Record Yardage**: The claim also mentions \"when the record yard be 2249.\" We need to verify if 2249 yards is recorded for a different year. Checking the \"yards\" column:\n   - In 2008, it's redshirt.\n   - In 2009, it's 470.\n   - In 2010, it's 45.\n   - In 2011, it's 3022.\n   - In 2012, it's 2249.\n\n3. **Cross-Reference the Years**: The claim implies a condition where Vanderberg had 404 attempts when the yardage was 2249. However:\n   - 404 attempts occurred in 2011 with 3022 yards.\n   - 2249 yards occurred in 2012, not associated with 404 attempts.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since 404 attempts and 2249 yards do not occur in the same year for Vanderberg on iowa, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For 404 attempts: Row index 3 (2011), Column \"attempts\"\n- For 3022 yards: Row index 3 (2011), Column \"yards\"\n- For 2249 yards: Row index 4 (2012), Column \"yards\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires Vanderberg to have 404 attempts when the yardage was 2249.
