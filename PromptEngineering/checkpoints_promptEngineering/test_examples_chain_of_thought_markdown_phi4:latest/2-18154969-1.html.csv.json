Although the aggregate score is tied, this indicates that the tie was resolved by penalties, which means the aggregate result itself was initially tied before penalties.\n   - Row 5: `karaorman` vs `borec mhk`: Aggregate is `( a ) 4 - 4`, indicating a tie.\n\n4. **Counting Tied Matches**:\n   - From the above review, we have identified three matches with ties in aggregate scores:\n     - pelister vs sileks\n     - rabotni\u010dki vs \u0161kendija hb (before penalties)\n     - karaorman vs borec mhk\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states there are 3 teams with tied aggregate results, which aligns with our findings.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Row 2, \"agg\" column: `( a ) 5 - 5`\n   - Row 3, \"agg\" column: `3 - 3 (1 - 3 p)`\n   - Row 5, \"agg\" column: `( a ) 4 - 4`\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify matches with tied aggregate scores by examining the 'agg' column.\",\n    \"Rows with tie scores are indicated by equal numbers (e.g., X-X).\",\n    \"Row 2: pelister vs sileks, Aggregate is `( a ) 5 - 5`, indicating a tie.\",\n    \"Row 3: rabotni\u010dki vs \u0161kendija hb, Aggregate is `3 - 3 (1 - 3 p)`, initially tied before penalties.\",\n    \"Row 5: karaorman vs borec mhk, Aggregate is `( a ) 4 - 4`, indicating a tie.\",\n    \"Count the number of ties: pelister/sileks, rabotni\u010dki/\u0161kendija hb, and karaorman/borec mhk.\",\n    \"The claim states there are 3 teams with tied aggregates, which matches our findings.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
