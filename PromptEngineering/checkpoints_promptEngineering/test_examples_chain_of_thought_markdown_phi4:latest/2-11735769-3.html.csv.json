All entries involve \"iCarly.\"\n\n3. **Year 2011**:\n   - Check for rows where `year` is 2011 and see if there are any awards related to \"Tuff Puppy.\"\n   - The entry at row index 7 mentions \"Tuff Puppy\" with a nomination in the 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards, but this does not apply to 2011.\n\n4. **Verification of Claim**:\n   - The claim states Jerry Trainor (through his role as Tuff Puppy) was nominated for 2 awards in 2010 and won 2 awards in 2011.\n   - There are no nominations or wins related to \"Tuff Puppy\" in 2010 or 2011 based on the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are no relevant entries for \"Tuff Puppy\" in 2010 or 2011, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined to find entries related to 'Tuff Puppy' for the years 2010 and 2011.
