    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the opponent be the yankee when the record be 4 - 5\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Record 4 - 5:**\n   - We need to find the row in the table where the `record` column has the value \"4 - 5\".\n\n2. **Check the Opponent for that Row:**\n   - Once we identify the correct row, we will check the `opponent` column to see if it is \"yankees\".\n\n3. **Verify the Date and Consistency:**\n   - To ensure consistency, verify the dates around this record to confirm the sequence of matches.\n\nLet's go through these steps using the table:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Record 4 - 5:**\n   - Scan the `record` column for \"4 - 5\". \n   - We find that on April 12, the `record` is \"4 - 5\".\n\n2. **Check the Opponent for that Row:**\n   - In the row where the date is April 12 and the record is \"4 - 5\", check the `opponent` column.\n   - The opponent listed is \"yankees\".\n\n3. **Verify the Date and Consistency:**\n   - Check the sequence of records around this date to ensure consistency:\n     - On April 11, the record was \"4 - 4\".\n     - On April 12, it changed to \"4 - 5\".\n     - On April 13 (no game), the record remained \"4 - 5\".\n     - On April 14, the record changed to \"5 - 5\".\n\nThe sequence is consistent with the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is true. The relevant cells are from the row where the date is April 12, and the columns `record` and `opponent`.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row with the record '4 - 5'. This occurs on April 12. Next, check the opponent for that date, which is 'yankees'.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to carefully examine the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states: \"when the record be 4 - 5, the opponent be yankee on april 11.\"\n   - We need to check if there's a game with the date of April 11 against the Yankees where the team's record was 4-5.\n\n2. **Identify Records in the Table:**\n   - Locate all entries where the \"record\" column is \"4 - 5\".\n   - According to the table, this occurs on:\n     - **April 12** (opponent: Yankees, record: 4 - 5).\n\n3. **Verify Date and Opponent:**\n   - Check if there's an entry with the date April 11 against the Yankees.\n   - On April 11, the opponent is indeed the Yankees.\n\n4. **Check Record on April 11:**\n   - The \"record\" for April 11 is listed as \"4 - 4\".\n   - This indicates that before playing the game on April 11, the record was 4-4.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that when the record is 4-5, the opponent should be Yankees on April 11.\n   - However, on April 11, the record was 4-4, not 4-5.\n   - Therefore, the condition of having a 4-5 record on April 11 against the Yankees is not met.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires that on April 11, when playing against the Yankees, the record should be 4-5.
