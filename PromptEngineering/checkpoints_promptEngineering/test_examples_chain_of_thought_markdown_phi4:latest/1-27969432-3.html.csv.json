    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"of all of the series that be list the lowest number of episode of 1 series be 11.\"\n\nThis can be interpreted as asking if the minimum number of episodes listed for any series in this table is 11.\n\n### Steps to Evaluate the Claim:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**:\n   - We need to examine the \"no in series\" column because it represents the episode numbers within a series.\n\n2. **Determine Series Boundaries**:\n   - Each entry in the \"no in season\" column indicates a new season. \n   - The first row starts with \"no in season = 1\", which is also where we start counting episodes for that series.\n   - Subsequent rows continue until there's a change in \"no in season\". A new value here suggests the beginning of a new series or continuation into another series.\n\n3. **Count Episodes per Series**:\n   - Count the number of consecutive entries (rows) with the same starting \"no in season\" until it changes to a different number.\n   - This will give us the total number of episodes for each series.\n\n4. **List Episode Counts**:\n   - From the table, count the episodes for each series:\n\n     - **Series 1**: Starts at row 1 (\"no in season = 1\") and ends before row 11 (\"no in season changes to 2\"). Total: 11 episodes.\n     - **Series 2**: Starts at row 11 (\"no in season = 11\") and ends at row 13 (\"no in season changes to 12\"). Total: 3 episodes.\n     - **Series 3**: Starts at row 13 (\"no in season = 12\") and continues through the end of the table. Total: 11 episodes.\n\n5. **Find Minimum Episode Count**:\n   - The episode counts for each series are 11, 3, and 11 respectively.\n   - The minimum number is 3.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the lowest number of episodes in a series is 11.\n   - However, we found that one series has only 3 episodes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there exists at least one series with fewer than 11 episodes (specifically, 3 episodes).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim was evaluated by identifying the 'no in season' column to determine the boundaries of each series.

According to the table, this corresponds to:\n     - `row_index: 20`\n     - `column_name: title`\n\n2. **Verify the Episode Number in Series:**\n   - Each episode has a unique number within its series indicated by the column \"no in series\".\n   - For the row corresponding to \"remember me\", we check the value under \"no in series\" to see if it matches 20.\n   - According to the table, this corresponds to:\n     - `row_index: 20`\n     - `column_name: no in series`\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that \"remember me\" is the 20th episode in its series.\n   - From step 2, we see that the value under \"no in series\" for \"remember me\" is indeed 20.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the table confirms that \"remember me\" has a \"no in series\" value of 20, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the structured JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row for 'remember me' based on the title column.
