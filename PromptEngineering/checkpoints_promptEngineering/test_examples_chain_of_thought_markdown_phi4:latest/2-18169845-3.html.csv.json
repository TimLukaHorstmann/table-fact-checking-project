However, the claim only specifies \"nominated,\" so we focus on the count of nominations without wins.\n\n5. **Count the Outer Critics Circle Award Nominations:**\n   - Excluding the win in row 19, there are four nominations for individual performances (rows 15-18).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that \"The Addams Family Musical have not won any Tony award, but be nominated for 2,\" which is true based on the data.\n   - The claim also states it has been nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Award twice, but there are four nominations (excluding wins). However, since the claim does not specify excluding wins from the count, this part of the claim is misleading or incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is partially true regarding Tony Awards but false regarding the number of Outer Critics Circle Award nominations if considering all nominations. The claim's wording about \"nominated for 2\" in relation to the Outer Critics Circle Awards does not align with the data, which shows four nominations (excluding wins).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows two Tony Award nominations with no wins, matching the claim.
