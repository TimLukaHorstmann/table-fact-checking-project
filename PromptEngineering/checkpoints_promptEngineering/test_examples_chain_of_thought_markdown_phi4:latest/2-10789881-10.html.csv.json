The second largest crowds are at two different venues with a crowd size of 11000 each.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, extract all the crowd sizes from the table and list them: 4000, 11000, 11000, 9000, 10000, 16000.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 - third of home team have score higher than 10.0\" is true or false, we must first evaluate the number of home teams with scores higher than 10.0 goals (i.e., where the first digit after the decimal point in their home team scores is greater than 10).\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the claim**: The statement \"2 - third\" suggests that approximately two-thirds (or about 66.67%) of the home teams should have a score higher than 10 goals.\n\n2. **Identify relevant data**: We need to examine the \"home team score\" column for each row in the table and determine how many scores are greater than 10.0 goals.\n\n3. **Extract home team scores**:\n   - Row 1: Hawthorn - 14.12 (96) \u2192 14 goals\n   - Row 2: Fitzroy - 8.10 (58) \u2192 8 goals\n   - Row 3: Richmond - 8.18 (66) \u2192 8 goals\n   - Row 4: Geelong - 7.10 (52) \u2192 7 goals\n   - Row 5: Essendon - 12.9 (81) \u2192 12 goals\n   - Row 6: South Melbourne - 10.12 (72) \u2192 10 goals\n\n4. **Count scores greater than 10.0 goals**:\n   - Hawthorn: 14 goals (greater than 10)\n   - Fitzroy: 8 goals (not greater than 10)\n   - Richmond: 8 goals (not greater than 10)\n   - Geelong: 7 goals (not greater than 10)\n   - Essendon: 12 goals (greater than 10)\n   - South Melbourne: 10 goals (equal to, not greater than 10)\n\n5. **Calculate the proportion**: \n   - Total number of home teams = 6\n   - Number of home teams with scores > 10.0 goals = 2 (Hawthorn and Essendon)\n\n6. **Determine if it satisfies \"two-thirds\"**:\n   - Two-thirds of 6 is approximately 4 (since \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = 4 \\)).\n   - Only 2 teams have scores greater than 10.0 goals.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since only 2 out of 6 home teams scored more than 10 goals, which is not \"two-thirds\", the claim is false.\n\nNow, we compile this information into a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, interpret the statement '2 - third' as approximately two-thirds (66.67%). Next, extract and evaluate each home team's score to see if it exceeds 10 goals. We find that only Hawthorn and Essendon have scores greater than 10.0 goals, making it 2 out of 6 teams.
