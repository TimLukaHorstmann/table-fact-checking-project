These matches could be representative of state games.\n   - Row 4's player is facing Queensland at Gabba, which likely doesn't involve a Tasmania game.\n\n5. **Count the Relevant Games**:\n   - **Bellerive Oval**: Two potential entries (Rows 2 and 3) where players might represent Tasmania.\n   - **Gabba**: No entries that suggest a Tasmania match (Row 4 involves Queensland).\n\n6. **Compare Counts**:\n   - Bellerive Oval: 2 games potentially involving Tasmania.\n   - Gabba: 0 games involving Tasmania.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the player played at Bellerive Oval one more time than at Gabba for Tasmania.
