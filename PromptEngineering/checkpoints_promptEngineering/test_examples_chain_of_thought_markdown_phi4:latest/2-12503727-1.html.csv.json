Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim states that all broadcast frequencies (in megahertz) should be classified under \"class D.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Table Structure:**\n   - The relevant columns for our task are:\n     - `frequency mhz` which lists the broadcast frequency.\n     - `class` which indicates the class of each entry.\n\n3. **Check Each Row:**\n   - We need to verify that for every row, the value under the \"class\" column is \"D.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate Rows Individually:**\n   - **Row 1:** Frequency = 93.5 MHz, Class = D\n   - **Row 2:** Frequency = 107.5 MHz, Class = D\n   - **Row 3:** Frequency = 103.9 MHz, Class = D\n   - **Row 4:** Frequency = 100.5 MHz, Class = D\n   - **Row 5:** Frequency = 106.7 MHz, Class = D\n   - **Row 6:** Frequency = 93.3 MHz, Class = D\n   - **Row 7:** Frequency = 96.7 MHz, Class = D\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Every frequency listed in the table has a corresponding class of \"D.\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that all broadcast frequencies are indeed classified as class D.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is verified by checking each row in the 'class' column to ensure it matches 'd'.
