    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"twickerham, london have less than 16 against\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the entries in the table for games played at Twickenham, London, and sum up the scores of those specific matches.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Matches**: We first need to find all matches that took place at \"twickenham, london\". From the table:\n   - The match against Wales on 04/02/1978.\n   - The match against Ireland on 18/03/1978.\n   - The match against New Zealand on 25/11/1978.\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Relevant Matches**: For each of these matches, we need to find the \"against\" column which represents scores conceded by the home team (assumed to be playing at Twickenham):\n   - Against Wales: Scored against = 9\n   - Against Ireland: Scored against = 9\n   - Against New Zealand: Scored against = 16\n\n3. **Sum the Scores**: Add up these scores:\n   \\[\n   9 (\\text{Wales}) + 9 (\\text{Ireland}) + 16 (\\text{New Zealand}) = 34\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that Twickenham, London have \"less than 16 against\". However, our calculated total is 34, which is more than 16.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the total score against at Twickenham, London (34) is greater than 16, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified matches played at 'twickenham, london': Wales, Ireland, New Zealand.
