    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to assess whether Motherwell is one of three teams against whom Llanelli AFC has only one victory. Let's break down the steps needed to evaluate this:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Against Motherwell:**\n   - We first locate any entries in the table involving the team \"motherwell\" as opponents.\n   - From the table, we find:\n     - Row 5: The match against motherwell resulted in a home leg score of \"0 - 3\" and an away leg score of \"1 - 0\", with an aggregate score of \"1 - 3\".\n\n2. **Determine Number of Victories Against Motherwell:**\n   - A victory for Llanelli AFC would mean they scored more goals than their opponent in a match.\n   - In the home leg against motherwell, Llanelli AFC lost with a score of 0 - 3 (motherwell won).\n   - In the away leg, Llanelli AFC won with a score of 1 - 0. Therefore, Llanelli AFC has one victory against motherwell.\n\n3. **Count Teams With Only One Victory:**\n   - We need to check other teams in the table to see how many matches resulted in only one victory for Llanelli AFC.\n   - For each opponent listed:\n     - Gefle IF (Row 1): Home leg \"0 - 0\" and away leg \"2 - 1\". Aggregate score is \"2 - 1\", indicating one win for Llanelli AFC.\n     - OB Odense (Row 2): Both legs were losses (\"1 - 5\" and \"0 - 1\"). No victories.\n     - FK V\u00e4tra (Row 3): Home leg victory \"5 - 3\", away loss \"1 - 3\". Aggregate \"6 - 6\", one win for Llanelli AFC.\n     - FK Ventspils (Row 4): Both legs were losses (\"1 - 0\" and \"0 - 4\"). No victories.\n     - Tauras (Row 6): Home leg draw \"2 - 2\", away loss \"2 - 3\". No victories.\n     - Dinamo Tbilisi (Row 7): Home leg victory \"2 - 1\", away loss \"0 - 5\". Aggregate \"2 - 6\", one win for Llanelli AFC.\n     - Kups (Row 8): Both legs were losses (\"1 - 1\" and \"1 - 2\"). No victories.\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Teams with Exactly One Victory:**\n   - The teams against whom Llanelli AFC has exactly one victory are:\n     - Gefle IF\n     - FK V\u00e4tra\n     - Dinamo Tbilisi\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - According to our findings, Motherwell is indeed among the teams (Gefle IF, FK V\u00e4tra, and Dinamo Tbilisi) against whom Llanelli AFC has only one victory.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is TRUE.
