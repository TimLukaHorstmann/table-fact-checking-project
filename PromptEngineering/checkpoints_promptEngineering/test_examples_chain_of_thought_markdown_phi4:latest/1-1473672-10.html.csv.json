    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"right wing, Rene Lambert, be pick 145th\" is true or false, let's analyze each component of the claim based on the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Position:**\n   - The claim states that the player \"Rene Lambert\" plays as a \"right wing.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - For pick 146, Rene Lambert is listed under the position \"right wing.\"\n   - Therefore, the position component of the claim is correct.\n\n2. **Identify Player:**\n   - The claim specifies the player as \"Rene Lambert.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - Rene Lambert appears in row with pick number 146.\n   - Thus, the player name component matches what is provided in the table.\n\n3. **Identify Pick Number:**\n   - The claim states that Rene Lambert was picked 145th.\n   - However, from the table:\n     - Rene Lambert is actually associated with pick number 146.\n   - This means the pick number component of the claim is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the pick number for Rene Lambert. Although his position and name are correct, the pick number provided in the claim (145th) does not match the actual pick number from the table (146th).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 3 (Pick 146): Contains information about Rene Lambert.\n  - **Cell:** \"pick\" with value 146\n  - **Cell:** \"player\" with value \"Rene Lambert\"\n  - **Cell:** \"position\" with value \"right wing\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Rene Lambert was a right wing picked 145th.
