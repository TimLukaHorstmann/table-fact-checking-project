First, identify which universities are part of this conference by their type (either \"private / sbc\" or another identifier that might be associated with the Southern Baptist Convention or similar).\n\n#### Relevant Rows:\n- **Campbellsville University**: Type: private / sbc\n- **University of the Cumberlands**: Type: private / sbc\n- **Georgetown College**: Type: private / sbc\n\nThese institutions are associated with \"sbc,\" which often relates to the Southern Baptist Convention, indicating they might be part of a conference like the Ohio Valley Conference or something similar. However, we will assume based on the type that these universities could potentially align with the context of the claim.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Locations\n\nNow, let's identify where each of these institutions is located:\n\n- **Campbellsville University**: Kentucky\n- **University of the Cumberlands**: Kentucky\n- **Georgetown College**: Kentucky\n\nAll three identified Mid-South Conference institutions are located in Kentucky.\n\n### Step 3: Count Institutions by Location\n\nCount how many Mid-South Conference institutions are in each state mentioned (Ohio and Kentucky):\n\n- **Kentucky**: 3 institutions (Campbellsville University, University of the Cumberlands, Georgetown College)\n- **Ohio**: 0 institutions\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"2 times as many\" Mid-South Conference institutions are located in Ohio than in Kentucky. Mathematically, this means if \\( x \\) is the number of institutions in Kentucky, then there should be \\( 2x \\) institutions in Ohio.\n\n- From our count: In Kentucky = 3\n- In Ohio = 0\n\nFor the claim to be true:\n\\[ 0 = 2 \\times 3 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ 0 = 6 \\]\n\nThe equation does not hold, indicating the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE. Here are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Campbellsville University**: Row 2, Column \"location (population)\"\n- **University of the Cumberlands**: Row 4, Column \"location (population)\"\n- **Georgetown College**: Row 5, Column \"location (population)\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified three institutions as part of the Mid-South Conference based on their 'private / sbc' type.
