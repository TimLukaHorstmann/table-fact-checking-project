We will examine each row in this range to see if Jackie Oliver is mentioned as an entrant.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Jackie Oliver's Name:**\n   - **1967:** \"lotus components ltd\" does not mention Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1968:** Both entries list \"gold leaf team lotus.\" Again, no mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1969:** All three rows list \"owen racing organisation,\" with no mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1970:** The first row lists \"owen racing organisation\" and the second \"yardley team brm.\" No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1971:** Both entries list \"bruce mclaren motor racing,\" without mentioning Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1972:** The entry is \"marlboro brm,\" with no mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1973:** The entry is \"uop shadow racing team.\" No mention of Jackie Oliver.\n   - **1977:** The entry is \"shadow racing team,\" which does not explicitly list Jackie Oliver.\n\n3. **Check for Any Implicit References:**\n   - We need to consider if any of these teams could be associated with Jackie Oliver, as he was known to race under different team names during his career. However, the table does not provide enough context or additional information to make this connection directly.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Table Data:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention Jackie Oliver in any of the rows for the years 1967 to 1977.\n   - Without additional context or data linking these teams to Jackie Oliver, we cannot confirm his participation based solely on the information provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, there is no direct evidence in the table that confirms Jackie Oliver competed in any races from 1967 to 1977.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about Jackie Oliver's last race being with Lotus Components Ltd, we need to analyze the table data based on the relevant historical context and information available in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"Jackie Oliver's last race was with Lotus Components Ltd.\"\n   - We need to verify if Jackie Oliver raced for Lotus Components Ltd, and if it was indeed his last racing team or car constructor in Formula 1.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - The table lists various F1 teams/enterprises by year along with their chassis, engine types, and points.\n   - To assess the claim, we need to find any mention of Jackie Oliver associated with these entries.\n\n3. **Historical Context about Jackie Oliver**:\n   - Jackie Oliver was a British racing driver who raced in Formula 1 from 1967 to 1978.\n   - He drove for several teams including Lotus, McLaren, and BRM during his career.\n\n4. **Checking the Table Entries**:\n   - The table includes entries for \"lotus components ltd\" in 1967 with a Lotus 48 chassis powered by a Cosworth straight-4 engine, earning 0 points.\n   - Jackie Oliver did indeed race for Lotus Components Ltd in 1967.\n   \n5. **Identifying Jackie Oliver's Last Team**:\n   - Jackie Oliver\u2019s last Formula 1 season was in 1978.\n   - There is no entry for the year 1978 or any subsequent years in this table, nor an entry indicating \"Lotus Components Ltd\" for such a time period.\n\n6. **Verifying His Last Race**:\n   - After reviewing his career, Jackie Oliver\u2019s last race in Formula 1 was with Shadow Racing Team during the 1978 British Grand Prix.\n   - This information can be cross-referenced with historical records outside of this table, confirming that \"Shadow Racing Team\" is not listed for 1978 in this table but appears in 1973 and 1977.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data provided, while Jackie Oliver did race for Lotus Components Ltd in 1967, it was not his last team.\n   - His final association with a team in F1 was with Shadow Racing Team in 1978.\n\n### Relevant Cells from Table:\n- The relevant cell indicating Jack Oliver's racing year and team is: `lotus components ltd` entry under the year 1967.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim concerns Jackie Oliver\u2019s last F1 race association.\",\n    \"Jackie Oliver raced with Lotus Components Ltd in 1967 as per the table.\",\n    \"However, he continued racing until 1978 with his final team being Shadow Racing Team.\",\n    \"There is no entry for Jackie Oliver with Lotus Components Ltd after 1967 or a mention of 1978 teams within this dataset.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim that Lotus Components Ltd was his last team is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
