    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate the performance of Corinthians throughout their season based on the given table. The claim states that Corinthians are 5 games away from being undefeated for their entire season.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand what \"undefeated\" means**: A team is considered undefeated if it has not lost any matches during the season.\n\n2. **Check Corinthians' current performance**:\n   - According to the table, Corinthians have played 20 games.\n   - They have won 35 points in these 20 games.\n   - Points can be awarded as follows: a win typically gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point, and a loss gives 0 points.\n\n3. **Calculate Corinthians' wins, draws, and losses**:\n   - From the table: \n     - Wins = (Total Points - Draws) / 3\n     - Draws = 3\n     - Losses = 1\n\n4. **Calculate points from wins and draws**:\n   - Points from wins = Wins \u00d7 3\n   - Points from draws = Draws \u00d7 1\n   - Total points = Points from wins + Points from draws = 35\n\n5. **Determine the number of wins**:\n   - Let \\( W \\) be the number of wins.\n   - \\( 3W + 3 = 35 \\)\n   - Solving for \\( W \\): \n     - \\( 3W = 32 \\)\n     - \\( W = 10.67 \\), which is not possible, so let's verify:\n     - Correct calculation: \\( 3W + 3 = 35 \\) implies \\( 3W = 32 \\), thus \\( W = 10 \\).\n\n6. **Verify the number of games played**:\n   - Total games = Wins + Draws + Losses\n   - Total games = 10 (wins) + 3 (draws) + 1 (loss) = 14\n\n7. **Determine remaining games**:\n   - Corinthians have played 20 games, so they have no remaining games in the season.\n\n8. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim states Corinthians are \"5 games away from being undefeated.\"\n   - Since they have already lost 1 game and there are no more games left to play (as they've completed all 20), they cannot achieve an undefeated record by playing additional games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Corinthians have already played all their scheduled games and cannot play any more games to avoid being considered undefeated. They are not \"5 games away\" from being undefeated; rather, they have already lost a game this season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Corinthians are currently undefeated except for one loss.
