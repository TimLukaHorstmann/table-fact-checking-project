This column provides information on wins and losses as games are played.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Record Format:**\n   - The 'record' column format is \"wins-losses\". We need to extract these values for each game to determine the number of wins and losses.\n\n2. **Extracting Wins and Losses:**\n   - Let's go through each entry in the table to count the total number of wins and losses.\n   \n3. **Counting Wins and Losses:**\n   - Game 47: Record is `24-23`, which means 24 wins, 23 losses.\n   - Game 48: Record is `24-24`, adding one loss gives us 24 wins, 24 losses.\n   - Game 49: Record is `24-25`, adding another loss results in 24 wins, 25 losses.\n   - Game 50: Record is `25-25`, adding a win results in 25 wins, 25 losses.\n   - Game 51: Record is `26-25`, adding one more win gives us 26 wins, 25 losses.\n   - Game 52: Record is `26-26`, adding another loss results in 26 wins, 26 losses.\n   - Game 53: Record is `27-26`, adding a win results in 27 wins, 26 losses.\n   - Game 54: Record is `27-27`, adding one more loss gives us 27 wins, 27 losses.\n   - Game 55: Record is `27-28`, adding another loss results in 27 wins, 28 losses.\n   - Game 56: Record is `27-29`, adding a final loss results in 27 wins, 29 losses.\n\n4. **Final Count of Wins and Losses:**\n   - Total Wins = 27\n   - Total Losses = 29\n\n5. **Evaluating the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the bobcat have a record of more win than loss\".\n   - Based on our count, they have fewer wins (27) than losses (29).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 27 wins are less than 29 losses, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'record' column shows the cumulative number of wins and losses after each game.
