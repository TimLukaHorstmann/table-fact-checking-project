McBridey being the coach for the Ohio Valley conference in 1953, 1959, and 1961 is true or false, we need to examine the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: The claim involves specific years: 1953, 1959, and 1961. We will check these rows in the table.\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Coach**:\n   - For the year 1953:\n     - Locate row where \"year\" is 1953.\n     - Check the \"coach\" column to see if it lists Paul S. McBridey.\n   - For the year 1959:\n     - Locate row where \"year\" is 1959.\n     - Check the \"coach\" column to see if it lists Paul S. McBridey.\n   - For the year 1961:\n     - Locate row where \"year\" is 1961.\n     - Check the \"coach\" column to see if it lists Paul S.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Guy R Strong be the coach of the Ohio Valley conference in 1953\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Year**: We are interested in the year 1953.\n   - Locate the row where the \"year\" column has the value 1953.\n\n2. **Check the Coach for 1953**:\n   - In the identified row, check the \"coach\" column to see who was the coach in 1953.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Guy R Strong was the coach in 1953.\n   - Verify if the name in the \"coach\" column for the year 1953 matches \"Guy R Strong\".\n\n4. **Determine the Truth of the Claim**:\n   - If the coach listed for 1953 is indeed \"Guy R Strong\", then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the table:\n  - The row with \"year\" as 1953 shows the \"coach\" column as \"paul s mcbrayer\".\n  - This does not match \"Guy R Strong\".\n\nTherefore, the claim that Guy R Strong was the coach in 1953 is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row for 1953: \n  - Column \"year\": \"1953\"\n  - Column \"coach\": \"paul s mcbrayer\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row where 'year' is 1953.
