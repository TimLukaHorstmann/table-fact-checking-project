    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"universal city, california, usa be mention 2 time in the table\" is TRUE or FALSE, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: The table is organized with columns representing ranks (from 1 to 10) and locations across different years from 2008 to 2012.\n\n2. **Identify \"Universal City, California, USA\" in the Location Column**:\n   - We need to scan through the \"location\" column for entries matching \"universal city, california, usa\".\n\n3. **Count Mentions of \"Universal City, California, USA\"**:\n   - As we locate each occurrence, we count how many times it appears.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Compare the counted mentions with the claim stating there are 2 mentions.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells Identification**: Identify and list the specific cells where \"universal city, california, usa\" is mentioned for verification.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Step 1 & 2**: Scan the \"location\" column for entries of \"universal city, california, usa\":\n  - Row 9: Contains \"universal city, california, usa\".\n\n- **Step 3**: Count mentions:\n  - We find that \"universal city, california, usa\" appears only once in the table.\n\n- **Step 4**: Compare with claim:\n  - The claim states there are 2 mentions. Our count is 1, so the claim is FALSE.\n\n- **Step 5**: Identify relevant cells:\n  - Relevant cell where \"universal city, california, usa\" is mentioned: Row 9, \"location\".\n\nThus, the final answer to the claim is FALSE, as it appears only once in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
