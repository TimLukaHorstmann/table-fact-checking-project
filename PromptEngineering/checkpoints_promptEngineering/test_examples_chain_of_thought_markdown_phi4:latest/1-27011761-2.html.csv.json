    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate the departure and arrival times for each train listed in the table and calculate the window of time between these two events. A 5-minute window implies a duration of exactly 5 minutes between arrival and departure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Kanpur - Farrukhabad Express:**\n   - Arrival Time: 10:55\n   - Departure Time: 11:05\n   - Duration: From 10:55 to 11:05 is exactly 10 minutes.\n   \n2. **Farrukhabad - Kanpur Express:**\n   - Arrival Time: 17:25\n   - Departure Time: 17:30\n   - Duration: From 17:25 to 17:30 is exactly 5 minutes.\n\n3. **Kanpur - Bhiwani Kalindi Express:**\n   - Arrival Time: 17:15\n   - Departure Time: 17:25\n   - Duration: From 17:15 to 17:25 is exactly 10 minutes.\n\n4. **Bhiwani - Kanpur Kalindi Express:**\n   - Arrival Time: 11:00\n   - Departure Time: 10:55 (Note: This suggests the train departs before it arrives on this schedule, which may indicate a typographical error or an overnight journey not accurately reflected in the table)\n   - Duration: From 10:55 to 11:00 is 5 minutes backward; typically, this should be considered as negative time for this context.\n\n5. **Kanpur - Kasganj Express:**\n   - Arrival Time: 10:45\n   - Departure Time: 10:55\n   - Duration: From 10:45 to 10:55 is exactly 10 minutes.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The \"Farrukhabad - Kanpur express\" has a 5-minute window between arrival and departure.\n- The \"Bhiwani - Kanpur Kalindi Express\" also effectively has a 5-minute interval, but it's in reverse time order (departure before arrival).\n- Therefore, the claim that the \"Kanpur - Farrukhabad express\" is the only train with a 5-minute window is false because the \"Farrukhabad - Kanpur express\" also has a 5-minute window.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"For each train, calculate the duration between arrival and departure.\",\n    \"Kanpur - Farrukhabad Express: Duration is 10 minutes.\",\n    \"Farrukhabad - Kanpur Express: Duration is exactly 5 minutes.\",\n    \"Kanpur - Bhiwani Kalindi Express: Duration is 10 minutes.\",\n    \"Bhiwani - Kanpur Kalindi Express: Has a 5-minute reverse window (departure before arrival).\",\n    \"Kanpur - Kasganj Express: Duration is 10 minutes.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false because Farrukhabad - Kanpur Express also has a 5-minute window.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"arrival\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"departure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"arrival\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"departure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"arrival\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"departure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"arrival\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"departure\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
