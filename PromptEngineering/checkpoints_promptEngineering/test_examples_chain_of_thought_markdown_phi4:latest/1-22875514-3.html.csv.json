    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"cole have 18 - 50 360 field goal\" is true or false, we need to verify the details provided in the table for the player named \"Cole\" under the column \"field goals.\" Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We first locate the row corresponding to the player \"Cole\" in the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Column for Field Goals:**\n   - Within Cole\u2019s row, identify the data under the column titled \"field goals.\"\n\n3. **Extract the Data from the Table:**\n   - According to the markdown table, the entry under \"field goals\" for Cole is \"18 - 50 360.\"\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Cole has \"18 - 50 360 field goal.\" We compare this directly with what we extracted from the table.\n\n5. **Determine the Validity of the Claim:**\n   - Since both the entry in the table and the claim are identical, the statement is true.\n\nHere's a summary of relevant cells used in the verification process:\n- The row index for \"Cole\" is 9 (considering zero-based indexing starting from the header).\n- The column name relevant to this claim is \"field goals.\"\n\nThus, based on these steps, we conclude that the claim is true.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Cole's field goals is true, let's analyze the information from the table step by-step:\n\n1. **Locate Cole's Row**: First, we need to find Cole's data in the table. We identify that Cole is listed as the ninth player.\n\n2. **Review Field Goals for Cole**:\n   - The field goal entry for Cole is \"18 - 50 360\".\n   - This indicates that Cole made 18 successful field goals out of 50 attempts.\n   - The number following this, 360, represents Cole's shooting percentage (field goal percentage).\n\n3. **Calculate Shooting Percentage**:\n   - To verify the shooting percentage, calculate it using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Shooting Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Field Goals Made}}{\\text{Field Goal Attempts}} \\right) \\times 100\n     \\]\n   - Substituting Cole's numbers:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Shooting Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{18}{50} \\right) \\times 100 = 36.0\\%\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Table Value**:\n   - The table states Cole's shooting percentage as 360, which seems incorrect based on our calculation.\n   - The correct shooting percentage should be 36.0%, not 360.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"Cole have 18 out of 50 field goal for a 360 average.\"\n   - While Cole indeed made 18 out of 50 field goals, the average (shooting percentage) is incorrectly stated as 360 in the claim.\n   - The correct shooting percentage should be 36.0%.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The numerical part of the claim regarding successful attempts and total attempts is accurate.\n   - However, the shooting percentage provided in the claim is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE due to the incorrect shooting percentage stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
