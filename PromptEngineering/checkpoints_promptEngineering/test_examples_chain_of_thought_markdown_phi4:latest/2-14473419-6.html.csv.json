    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Boston Bruins' record on March 12 being \"27 - 11 - 9\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant game entry:**\n   - We are interested in the game played against the Boston Bruins.\n   - From the table, there are two entries for games against the Boston Bruins:\n     - Game 47 on March 12 with a score of \"2 - 1\".\n     - Game 48 on March 14 with a score of \"0 - 0 ot\".\n\n2. **Check the record before the game on March 12:**\n   - We need to determine if the record \"27 - 11 - 9\" is accurate for March 12.\n   - Before Game 47, we should look at the record from the previous game (Game 46):\n     - Game 46 was played against the New York Americans on March 10 with a score of \"4 - 2\".\n     - The record after this game was \"27 - 10 - 9\".\n\n3. **Determine the impact of Game 47:**\n   - Since Game 47 was won by our team (score \"2 - 1\"), the win-loss-tie record should be updated.\n   - Winning a game increases the number of wins, so the record becomes:\n     - Previous record before Game 47: \"27 - 10 - 9\"\n     - After winning Game 47: \"27 - 11 - 9\" (adding one win).\n\n4. **Confirm the date and record match:**\n   - The game against the Boston Bruins on March 12 resulted in a record of \"27 - 11 - 9\".\n   - This matches the claim that the record was \"27 - 11 - 9\" on March 12.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe analysis shows that the record for the team after winning against the Boston Bruins on March 12 is indeed \"27 - 11 - 9\".
