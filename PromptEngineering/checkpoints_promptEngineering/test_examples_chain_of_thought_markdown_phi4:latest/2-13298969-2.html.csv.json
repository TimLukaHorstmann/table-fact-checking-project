    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze each specified match from the table: against Sultan Aliev and Lavar Johnson.\n\n1. **Identify Matches**:\n   - First, locate the row for the opponent \"Sultan Aliev\".\n   - Next, find the row for the opponent \"Lavar Johnson\".\n\n2. **Determine Outcome Method**:\n   - For each identified match, check the column labeled \"method\" to see how the match was decided.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Match**:\n   - **Match against Sultan Aliev**:\n     - From the table: \n       - Row 2 (Sultan Aliev): The method is listed as \"decision (split)\".\n     - Conclusion: This match was not decided by submission; it was a decision.\n\n   - **Match against Lavar Johnson**:\n     - From the table:\n       - Row 22 (Lavar Johnson): The method is listed as \"tko (corner stoppage)\".\n     - Conclusion: This match was also not decided by submission; it was a TKO due to corner stoppage.\n\n4. **Final Evaluation**:\n   - Since neither of the two matches was decided by submission, the claim that both were decided by submission is false.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the rows for 'Sultan Aliev' and 'Lavar Johnson'.
