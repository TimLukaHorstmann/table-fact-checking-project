    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the steps using the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify BATE's Position:**\n   - Look for the team \"bate\" in the table.\n   - The row corresponding to \"bate\" indicates:\n     - Position in 2003 is `2`.\n\n2. **Identify Lokomotiv's Position:**\n   - Look for the team \"lokomotiv\" in the table.\n   - The row corresponding to \"lokomotiv\" shows:\n     - They finished in \"first league, 1\".\n   - This means Lokomotiv was in a different league from the main standings shown (since they are listed as finishing first in the First League).\n\n3. **Compare Positions:**\n   - BATE's position is `2` in the main league standings.\n   - Lokomotiv finished \"first league, 1\", indicating they were first in a separate division and did not compete directly with teams like BATE in the top-tier league.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Lokomotiv was in the First League and not in the same competition level as BATE, it is appropriate to conclude that BATE had a higher position in the main league standings compared to Lokomotiv's position in their respective division.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv in 2003\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **BATE Position:**\n  - Row index: 2\n  - Column name: `position in 2003`\n  \n- **LOKOMOTIV Position:**\n  - Row index: 15\n  - Column name: `position in 2003`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"BATE's position in the main league for 2003 is 2. Lokomotiv finished first in the First League, not competing directly with BATE in the top-tier league. Therefore, BATE had a higher position than Lokomotiv.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
