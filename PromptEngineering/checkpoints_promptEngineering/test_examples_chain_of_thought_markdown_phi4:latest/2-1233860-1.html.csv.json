However, there is no information about Ivor Bueb driving these entries. Thus, without additional data confirming his participation, the claim cannot be verified as true based solely on this table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that a Cooper T51 chassis was used twice in 1959 by British Racing Partnership.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table data for any entries related to Ivor Bueb using an Alta Straight-4 engine between 1958 and 1959.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Frame:**\n   - The claim specifies the years 1958 and 1959.\n   \n2. **Locate Entries for Alta Straight-4 Engine:**\n   - We need to look at the \"engine\" column to find entries with \"alta straight - 4\".\n   - From the table:\n     - In 1957, Connaught Engineering used an Alta Straight-4 engine.\n     - In 1958, BC Ecclestone used a Connaught Type B chassis with an Alta Straight-4 engine.\n\n3. **Check for Ivor Bueb:**\n   - The claim mentions Ivor Bueb. We need to see if any entries in the specified years (1958 or 1959) involve him.\n   - The table does not list \"Ivor Bueb\" as an entrant in either 1958 or 1959.\n\n4. **Verify Usage of Alta Straight-4:**\n   - In 1958, BC Ecclestone used the Alta Straight-4 engine once.\n   - There are no entries for 1959 using an Alta Straight-4 engine.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states Ivor Bueb used the Alta Straight-4 engine twice between 1958 and 1959. However, there is only one entry in 1958 with this engine type, and it does not mention Ivor Bueb.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for entries between 1958 and 1959 using an Alta Straight-4 engine.
