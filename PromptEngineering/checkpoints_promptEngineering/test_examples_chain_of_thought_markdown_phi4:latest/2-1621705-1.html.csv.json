Here's how we can systematically approach this:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that every regulatory citation for pollutants in the given table should be part of \"40 CFR 50\". This means all citations must start with \"40 cfr 50\".\n\n2. **Inspect Each Entry**: Examine each row in the 'regulatory citation' column to check if they begin with \"40 cfr 50\".\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 1**: \"so 2, primary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.4 (b)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 2**: \"so 2, primary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.4 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 3**: \"so 2, secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.5 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 4**: \"pm 10, primary and secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.6 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 5**: \"pm 2.5, secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.7 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 6**: \"pm 2.5, primary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.7 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 7**: \"co, primary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.8 (a) (2)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 8**: \"co, primary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.8 (a) (1)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 9**: \"o 3, primary and secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.9 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 10**: \"o 3, primary and secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.10 (a)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 11**: \"no 2, primary and secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.11 (a) and (b)\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n   - **Row 12**: \"pb, primary and secondary\" has a regulatory citation of \"40 cfr 50.12\". This starts with \"40 cfr 50\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Every entry in the 'regulatory citation' column starts with \"40 cfr 50\", which confirms that all citations are within the specified regulation range.\n\nBased on this systematic examination, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each regulatory citation in the table was checked to ensure it starts with '40 cfr 50'.
