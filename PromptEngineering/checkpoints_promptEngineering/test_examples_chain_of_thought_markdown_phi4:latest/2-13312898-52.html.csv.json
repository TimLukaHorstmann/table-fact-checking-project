    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the first player selected by the colt in this draft be bob sander\" is true or false, we need to examine the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure:**\n   - The table lists players drafted by a team (referred to as \"the colts\") across several rounds.\n   - Each row provides information about a specific player selected in that round: their pick number, overall selection order, name, position, and college.\n\n2. **Identify Key Terms in the Claim:**\n   - The claim mentions \"the first player selected by the colt\" which implies we are looking for the player who was picked first overall.\n   - The name mentioned is \"bob sander,\" but note there's a slight discrepancy in spelling compared to the table.\n\n3. **Locate the First Overall Pick:**\n   - Look at the column labeled \"overall\" to find the smallest number, which indicates the first pick across all rounds.\n   - The smallest number in the \"overall\" column is 44.\n\n4. **Verify Details of the First Overall Pick:**\n   - Row with \"overall\": 44\n     - Check the corresponding details:\n       - Round: 2\n       - Pick: 12\n       - Name: bob sanders (note the correct spelling)\n       - Position: safety\n       - College: iowa\n\n5. **Compare to Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"bob sander\" was selected first, but the table shows \"bob sanders\" with an overall pick of 44.\n   - The name in the claim is misspelled (missing the second 's').\n   - Despite the spelling error, the details match for the player selected first overall.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is essentially true if we account for the minor spelling discrepancy.
