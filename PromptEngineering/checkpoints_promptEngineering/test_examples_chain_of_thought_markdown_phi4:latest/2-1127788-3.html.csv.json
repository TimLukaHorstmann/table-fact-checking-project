    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mexico lose 1 of 2 time in international competition when Rafael M\u00e1rquez score a goal\" is true or false, we will analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Rafael M\u00e1rquez's Goals:**\n   - We need to identify which goals in the table were scored by Rafael M\u00e1rquez. Since the table does not explicitly mention the player who scored each goal, we must rely on external knowledge or assumptions that Rafael M\u00e1rquez is associated with these goals.\n\n2. **Determine the Result of Matches When Rafael M\u00e1rquez Scored:**\n   - For each identified goal, check the \"result\" column to see if Mexico won, lost, or drew the match.\n\n3. **Filter for International Competitions:**\n   - We focus only on matches listed as international competitions (e.g., World Cup qualifiers, Gold Cups) and not friendly matches.\n\n4. **Count Wins, Losses, and Draws:**\n   - Count how many times Mexico won, lost, or drew in the matches where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Mexico lost 1 out of 2 times when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored. We need to verify if there are exactly two instances where he scored and check if one of those is a loss for Mexico.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n- **Goal 3:** \n  - Date: 3 September 2000\n  - Competition: 2002 World Cup qualifier\n  - Result: 7 - 1 (Mexico won)\n\n- **Goal 4:** \n  - Date: 12 May 2002\n  - Competition: Friendly\n  - Not an international competition, so it is excluded.\n\n- **Goal 6:** \n  - Date: 19 June 2004\n  - Competition: 2006 World Cup qualifier\n  - Result: 3 - 0 (Mexico won)\n\n- **Goal 7:** \n  - Date: 7 September 2005\n  - Competition: 2006 World Cup qualifier\n  - Result: 5 - 0 (Mexico won)\n\n- **Goal 8:** \n  - Date: 24 June 2006\n  - Competition: 2006 FIFA World Cup\n  - Result: 1 - 2 (aet) (Mexico lost)\n\n- **Goal 9:** \n  - Date: 28 March 2007\n  - Competition: Friendly\n  - Not an international competition, so it is excluded.\n\n- **Goal 10:** \n  - Date: 10 September 2008\n  - Competition: 2010 World Cup qualifier\n  - Result: 2 - 1 (Mexico won)\n\n- **Goal 12:** \n  - Date: 12 June 2011\n  - Competition: 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup\n  - Result: 4 - 1 (Mexico won)\n\n- **Goal 13:** \n  - Date: 30 October 2013\n  - Competition: Friendly\n  - Not an international competition, so it is excluded.\n\n**Relevant Matches for the Claim:**\n\n- **Matches where Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in International Competitions:**\n  - Goal 3: Win (7 - 1)\n  - Goal 6: Win (3 - 0)\n  - Goal 7: Win (5 - 0)\n  - Goal 8: Loss (1 - 2 aet)\n  - Goal 10: Win (2 - 1)\n  - Goal 12: Win (4 - 1)\n\n- **Count of Wins and Losses:**\n  - Wins: Goals 3, 6, 7, 10, 12\n  - Loss: Goal 8\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRafael M\u00e1rquez scored in international competitions on four occasions where Mexico won and one occasion where they lost. Therefore, Mexico did not lose exactly once out of two times when Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored in international competitions.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified matches where Rafael M\u00e1rquez likely scored based on the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim regarding Rafael M\u00e1rquez's scoring record in international competitions during the years 2001, 2009, and 2012, we need to analyze the table for any goals scored by him during those specific years across different types of competitions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim is that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not remain scoreless (i.e., he scored at least one goal) in international competition in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n   \n2. **Identifying Relevant Rows**:\n   - We need to check each row for the date and year corresponding to 2001, 2009, and 2012.\n\n3. **Checking Each Year Individually**:\n\n   - **Year 2001**:\n     - Look at all rows where the 'date' column falls within the year 2001.\n     - There are no entries in the table for dates within the year 2001.\n\n   - **Year 2009**:\n     - Look for any row with a date from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2009.\n     - The closest date is \"28 March 2007\" (row 9), and there are no entries in 2009.\n\n   - **Year 2012**:\n     - Check all rows for dates within the year 2012.\n     - There are no entries in the table for dates within the year 2012. The closest entry is \"30 October 2013\" (row 13).\n\n4. **Conclusion from Analysis**:\n   - Since there are no rows with dates falling in 2001, 2009, or 2012, Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not have any recorded goals during those years in the table.\n\n5. **Verifying Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that he \"do not remain scoreless,\" which translates to him having scored at least one goal.\n   - Given that there are no entries for these specific years and thus no goals, it implies he remained scoreless.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, Rafael M\u00e1rquez did indeed remain scoreless in international competition during 2001, 2009, and 2012 according to this table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored at least one goal in 2001, 2009, or 2012.
