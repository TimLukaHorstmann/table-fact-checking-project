    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"canton rfc gain the fourth - least point through 20 game\" is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that Canton RFC has the fourth-lowest total points among all clubs listed in the table.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"points\" column of the table since it shows the total points for each club.\n\n3. **Extract Points from Table**:\n   - Pontyclun RFC: 86\n   - Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n   - Barry RFC: 63\n   - St Albans RFC: 55\n   - Deri RFC: 52\n   - Hirwaun RFC: 51\n   - Penygraig RFC: 43\n   - Cowbridge RFC: 37\n   - Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n   - Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n   - Canton RFC: 10\n\n4. **Sort Points in Ascending Order**: \n   - Canton RFC: 10\n   - Dinas Powys RFC: 19\n   - Old Penarthians RFC: 33\n   - Cowbridge RFC: 37\n   - Penygraig RFC: 43\n   - Hirwaun RFC: 51\n   - Deri RFC: 52\n   - St Albans RFC: 55\n   - Barry RFC: 63\n   - Cilfynydd RFC: 74\n   - Pontyclun RFC: 86\n\n5. **Determine the Fourth-Lowest Points**:\n   - The clubs with the lowest points are:\n     1. Canton RFC (10)\n     2. Dinas Powys RFC (19)\n     3. Old Penarthians RFC (33)\n     4. Cowbridge RFC (37)\n\n6. **Compare with Claim**: According to our sorted list, Canton RFC is in the first position for the lowest points, not fourth.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The claim that \"canton rfc gain the fourth - least point through 20 game\" is false because Canton RFC has the lowest points, not the fourth-lowest.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are those containing the \"points\" column data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim about Canton RFC having the fourth-least points, we examined the 'points' column for all clubs. We sorted these values in ascending order to find the positions of each club. Canton RFC had the lowest points (10), making it first in this list. The fourth-lowest points were 37, belonging to Cowbridge RFC. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
