    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to examine two parts:\n\n1. **Earnings Comparison**: Check if Tom Kite earned $3,000,000 more than Greg Norman.\n2. **Wins Comparison**: Verify if Tom Kite has 2 more wins than Greg Norman.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning step-by-step using the table provided:\n\n### Step 1: Earnings Comparison\n\n- **Greg Norman's earnings**: $9,592,829\n- **Tom Kite's earnings**: $9,337,998\n\nCalculate the difference in their earnings:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 9,337,998 - 9,592,829 = -254,831 \\]\n\nTom Kite earned $254,831 less than Greg Norman, not more. Therefore, the claim that Tom Kite earned $3,000,000 more is false.\n\n### Step 2: Wins Comparison\n\n- **Greg Norman's wins**: 17\n- **Tom Kite's wins**: 19\n\nCalculate the difference in their wins:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = 19 - 17 = 2 \\]\n\nTom Kite has 2 more wins than Greg Norman, which matches the claim.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe earnings part of the claim is false because Tom Kite earned less than Greg Norman. The wins part of the claim is true as Tom Kite does have 2 more wins than Greg Norman. However, since both conditions in the claim must be true for it to be correct and the earnings condition is not met, the overall claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Earnings for Greg Norman: Row 1, Column \"earnings\"\n- Wins for Greg Norman: Row 1, Column \"wins\"\n- Earnings for Tom Kite: Row 2, Column \"earnings\"\n- Wins for Tom Kite: Row 2, Column \"wins\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, compare the earnings of Tom Kite and Greg Norman.

Next, compare their wins: Tom Kite has 19 wins and Greg Norman has 17 wins, so Tom Kite has 2 more wins than Greg Norman.
