Specifically, we will look at the 'position' column to identify any players playing more than one position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate John Brill's Entry:**\n   - Find the row corresponding to \"John Brill\" in the table.\n   - The relevant cell is in row 58 under the 'position' column, which states \"left / right wing.\"\n\n2. **Check for Other Players with Multiple Positions:**\n   - Review each player's entry in the 'position' column to see if any other players are listed as playing more than one position.\n   - For this task, we need to identify entries where two positions are explicitly mentioned (e.g., \"left / right wing\").\n\n3. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - Go through each row from 43 to 63 and check the 'position' column:\n     - Rows 43-57, 59-61, and 63 list players with a single position.\n     - Row 58 (John Brill) lists \"left / right wing,\" indicating two positions.\n     - Row 62 (Kris Draper) is listed as \"defence\" only.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - John Brill is the only player explicitly mentioned as playing two positions (\"left / right wing\").\n   - No other players in the table have more than one position listed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis, the claim that \"John Brill be the only player on the list who play 2 position\" is TRUE.
