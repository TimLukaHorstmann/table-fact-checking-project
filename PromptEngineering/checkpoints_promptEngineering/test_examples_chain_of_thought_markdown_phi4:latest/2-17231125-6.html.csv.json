Weibring tying for 5th place is true, we need to examine the table data related to their scores, places, and other relevant details.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Relevant Players:**\n   - Identify where Larry Mize is listed in the table.\n   - Identify where D.A. Weibring is listed in the table.\n\n2. **Check Their Rankings:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Larry Mize is at row 5 with a rank of \"t5\".\n     - D.A. Weibring is also at row 6 with a rank of \"t5\".\n\n3. **Examine the Scores and Total Points:**\n   - Both players have identical scores:\n     - Larry Mize's total score: 69 + 67 + 72 = 208\n     - D.A. Weibring's total score: 71 + 69 + 68 = 208\n\n4. **Assess the \"To Par\" Values:**\n   - Both players have identical \"to par\" values:\n     - Larry Mize: -5\n     - D.A. Weibring: -5\n\n5. **Evaluate the Place Column:**\n   - The table indicates a tie at 5th place with \"t5\" for both players.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both players are listed as tied (\"t5\") and have identical scores, total points, and \"to par\" values, the claim that Larry Mize and D.A.
