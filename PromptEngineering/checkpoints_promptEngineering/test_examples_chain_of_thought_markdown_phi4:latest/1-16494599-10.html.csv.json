This counts as one player who plays guard.\n   - Casey Jacobsen: Position listed as \"guard - forward\". This also includes \"guard\", so this is another player who plays guard.\n   - Alexander Johnson: Position listed as \"power forward\".

Does not include \"guard\".\n   - Dahntay Jones: Position listed as \"guard - forward\". This includes \"guard\", so this is another player who plays guard.\n   - Damon Jones: Position listed as \"shooting guard\".
