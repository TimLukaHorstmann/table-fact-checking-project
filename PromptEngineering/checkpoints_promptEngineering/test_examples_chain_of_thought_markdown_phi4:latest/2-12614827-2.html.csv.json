    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, let's analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Record Columns**: The table contains two columns related to records: `res` (result) and `record`. We need to focus on the `record` column as it provides detailed win-loss-draw statistics for each fight.\n\n2. **Understand the Format of Records**: \n   - Each entry in the `record` column follows a format that includes wins, losses, and sometimes draws: \"wins - losses (draws)\".\n   - For example, an entry like \"13 - 10 (1)\" means 13 wins, 10 losses, and 1 draw.\n\n3. **Identify Rob Emerson's Record**: \n   - We need to find the record associated with Rob Emerson in this table.\n   - By inspecting each row, we identify that one of the entries is \"win | 13 - 10 (1) | jared downing\".\n\n4. **Verify Consistency Across Entries**:\n   - The record \"13 - 10 (1)\" appears once under the result `win` against Jared Downing in Bellator 104.\n   - We need to ensure this is the only instance and represents his highest win record.\n\n5. **Check for Other High Records**:\n   - Reviewing other records, none match or exceed \"13 - 10\" except potentially later in the fighter's career if there are multiple entries with higher wins (but no such entry exists).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - The claim states Rob Emerson has a highest win record of \"13 - 10\".\n   - Based on our review, this is correct as per the provided table data.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'record' column shows wins-losses-draws. The entry 'win | 13 - 10 (1) | jared downing' indicates Rob Emerson has a record of 13 wins, 10 losses, and 1 draw at this point.

If we find exactly one such entry, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Examination of Relevant Rows:\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - \"res\": win\n  - \"method\": tko (punches)\n  - This matches our criteria as a KO victory by punches.\n\n- **Row 10:**\n  - \"res\": win\n  - \"method\": ko (punches)\n  - This is another match for a KO victory by punches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe found two instances where Rob Emerson won using the KO (punches) method.
