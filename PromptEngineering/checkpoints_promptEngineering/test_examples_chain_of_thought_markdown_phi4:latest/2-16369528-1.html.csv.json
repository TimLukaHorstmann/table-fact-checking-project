Specifically, we must find if there are more than three such instances.\n\nLet's go through the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Year 1996**: \n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: jon cleary\n\n2. **Year 1997**:\n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: alan yates (aka carter brown)\n\n3. **Year 1998**:\n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: na\n\n4. **Year 1999**:\n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: peter corris\n\n5. **Year 2000**:\n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: na\n\n6. **Year 2001**:\n   - Reader's Vote: bleeding hearts by lindy cameron\n   - Lifetime Achievement: professor stephen knight\n\n7. **Year 2002**:\n   - Reader's Vote: apartment 255 by bunty avieson\n   - Lifetime Achievement: patrick gallagher\n\n8. **Year 2003**:\n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: kerry greenwood\n\n9. **Year 2004**:\n   - Reader's Vote: na\n   - Lifetime Achievement: bob bottom\n\n10. **Year 2005**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: stuart coupe\n\n11. **Year 2006**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: andrew rule and john silvester\n\n12. **Year 2007**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: sandra harvey and lindsay simpson\n\n13. **Year 2008**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: marele day\n\n14. **Year 2009**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: shane maloney\n\n15. **Year 2010**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: peter doyle\n\n16. **Year 2011**:\n    - Reader's Vote: na\n    - Lifetime Achievement: na\n\nNow, identify the rows where both \"Reader's Vote\" and \"Lifetime Achievement\" are not \"na\":\n\n- Year 2001: \n  - Reader's Vote: bleeding hearts by lindy cameron\n  - Lifetime Achievement: professor stephen knight\n\n- Year 2002:\n  - Reader's Vote: apartment 255 by bunty avieson\n  - Lifetime Achievement: patrick gallagher\n\nThese are the only two instances where both columns have non-\"na\" values.\n\nSince there are only two such instances, the claim that there are \"over 3 time when the reader's vote be not n/a and the lifetime achievement be also na\" is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check each year for both 'Reader's Vote' and 'Lifetime Achievement' columns being non-'na'.\",\n    \"Year 2001: Both columns have values.\",\n    \"Year 2002: Both columns have values.\",\n    \"No other years meet the criteria.\",\n    \"Only two instances exist, which is not over three.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Reader's Vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Lifetime Achievement\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Reader's Vote\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Lifetime Achievement\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
