Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the First Five Rounds:**\n   - We focus on rows corresponding to round numbers 1 through 5.\n\n2. **Extract Player Positions from These Rounds:**\n   - Round 1, Pick 11: Brad Marsh (D) - Defenseman\n   - Round 3, Pick 47: Tim Bernhardt (G) - Goaltender\n   - Round 4, Pick 64: Jim Macrae (F) - Forward\n   - Round 5, Pick 80: Gord Wappel (D) - Defenseman\n   - Round 6, Pick 97: Greg Meredith (D) - Defenseman\n\n3. **Count the Number of Defensemen in These Rounds:**\n   - From the extracted positions:\n     - Brad Marsh (Round 1) is a defenseman.\n     - Gord Wappel (Round 5) is a defenseman.\n     - Greg Meredith (Round 6) is also listed as a defenseman, but he was picked in Round 6, which is outside our range of interest.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - We have identified only two defensemen within the first five rounds (rounds 1 to 5): Brad Marsh and Gord Wappel.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"3 of their first 5 draft picks were defensemen\" is not supported by the data.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is false because only two of the first five picks are defensemen.\n\nHere's the relevant information in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
