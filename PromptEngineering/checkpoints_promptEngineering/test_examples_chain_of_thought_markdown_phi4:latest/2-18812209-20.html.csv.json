    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the points scored by each constructor and calculate the maximum difference between them.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Points Column:**\n   - We are interested in the \"points\" column as it contains the scores for each constructor.\n   \n2. **Extract Points for Each Constructor:**\n   - Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team: 456 points\n   - BP Ford World Rally Team: 337 points\n   - Citro\u00ebn Junior Team: 217 points\n   - Stobart M-Sport Ford Rally Team: 176 points\n   - Munchi's Ford World Rally Team: 58 points\n\n3. **Determine the Maximum and Minimum Points:**\n   - Maximum points: 456 (Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team)\n   - Minimum points: 58 (Munchi's Ford World Rally Team)\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - The difference between the maximum and minimum points is \\(456 - 58 = 398\\).\n\n5. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there should be a difference of at most 11 points.\n   - Since 398 is much greater than 11, the claim is FALSE.\n\n6. **List Relevant Cells:**\n   - We need to list the cells containing the points for each constructor:\n     - Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team (456)\n     - BP Ford World Rally Team (337)\n     - Citro\u00ebn Junior Team (217)\n     - Stobart M-Sport Ford Rally Team (176)\n     - Munchi's Ford World Rally Team (58)\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the points for each constructor, calculated the maximum and minimum points, found their difference to be 398, which is greater than the claimed 11. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
