    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Dave Hynek and Robin Lang being from Canada and part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players**:\n   - The claim mentions two players: Dave Hynek and Robin Lang.\n   \n2. **Locate Dave Hynek in the Table**:\n   - Row 4 corresponds to player \"Dave Hynek\".\n   - Check his nationality column to verify if he is from Canada.\n     - In Row 4, under \"nationality\", it states \"canada\". Therefore, Dave Hynek is indeed from Canada.\n\n3. **Locate Robin Lang in the Table**:\n   - Row 5 corresponds to player \"Robin Lang\".\n   - Check his nationality column to verify if he is from Canada.\n     - In Row 5, under \"nationality\", it states \"canada\". Therefore, Robin Lang is also from Canada.\n\n4. **Verify Players' Association with the Philadelphia Flyers**:\n   - The claim specifies that both players were part of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers.\n   - The table does not provide information about which NHL team the players were associated with during any specific season (including the 1976-77 season). It only provides their draft round, position, nationality, and previous teams/colleges.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While both Dave Hynek and Robin Lang are confirmed to be Canadian based on the table, there is no information in the table about their association with the Philadelphia Flyers or any NHL team during the 1976-77 season.\n   - Therefore, without additional information confirming their membership in the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers, we cannot verify this part of the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim \"Dave Hynek and Robin Lang, of the 1976-77 Philadelphia Flyers, be both from Canada\" is partially verified for nationality but not for team association based on the table provided. Therefore, it is **FALSE** regarding the complete assertion as stated.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table confirms that both Dave Hynek and Robin Lang are Canadian.
