This column indicates who was leading in the general classification after each stage.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understand the Context**: The claim involves identifying different riders who led the race at various points during the stages. We are specifically interested in instances where someone other than Tony Rominger was listed as the leader in the \"general classification\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Stage**:\n   - **Stage 1**: mario cipollini is listed as the leader.\n   - **Stage 2 to Stage 10**: tony rominger becomes and remains the leader.\n   - **Stage 11 onwards (including final)**: tony rominger continues to be listed as the leader.\n\n3. **Identify Different Leaders**:\n   - From the table, only mario cipollini is mentioned as a leader at any point before Tony Rominger takes over and maintains leadership from Stage 2 onward.\n   \n4. **Count Distinct Riders Leading**: \n   - mario cipollini leads during Stage 1.\n   - tony rominger leads from Stage 2 to the final stage.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only two riders are listed as leaders: mario cipollini and Tony Rominger.\n   - Therefore, only one rider (mario cipollini) led at a different point before Tony Rominger took over for the remainder of the race.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that \"3 riders lead Tony Rominger at different points,\" but our analysis shows only two riders did so: mario cipollini and then Tony Rominger himself.
