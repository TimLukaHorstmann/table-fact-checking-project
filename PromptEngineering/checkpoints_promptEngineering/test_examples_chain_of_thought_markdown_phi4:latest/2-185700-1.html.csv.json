    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is true or false, we need to compare the points obtained by the songs \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" and \"croire.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - Locate the row in which the song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" appears.\n   - Locate the row in which the song \"croire\" appears.\n\n2. **Extract Points for Each Song:**\n   - For \"vivo (ti scrivo),\" find the value in the \"points\" column.\n   - For \"croire,\" find the value in the \"points\" column.\n\n3. **Compare the Points:**\n   - Compare the points obtained by \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" with those obtained by \"croire.\"\n\n4. **Determine Truthfulness of Claim:**\n   - If the points for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" are greater than those for \"croire,\" the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, the claim is false.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Locate \"vivo (ti scrivo)\":**\n   - The song \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" is in row 18.\n   - In this row, under the \"points\" column, the value is `52`.\n\n2. **Locate \"croire\":**\n   - The song \"croire\" is in row 17.\n   - In this row, under the \"points\" column, the value is `90`.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Points for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\" = 52\n   - Points for \"croire\" = 90\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 52 (for \"vivo (ti scrivo)\") is less than 90 (for \"croire\"), the claim that \"vivo (ti scrivo) obtain higher point than croire\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the song 'vivo (ti scrivo)' in row 18 and find its points as 52. Next, locate the song 'croire' in row 17 and find its points as 90. Compare these values: 52 is less than 90, hence 'vivo (ti scrivo)' did not obtain higher points than 'croire'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
