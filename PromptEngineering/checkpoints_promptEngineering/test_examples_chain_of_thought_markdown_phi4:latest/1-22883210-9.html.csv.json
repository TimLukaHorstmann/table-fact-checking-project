    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the games against Golden State and Oklahoma City being played at AT&T Center with over 19,000 attendance is true or false, we need to examine specific rows of the table for these two games.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - The game against Golden State occurred on March 19.\n   - The game against Oklahoma City happened on March 22.\n\n2. **Locate Rows in the Table:**\n   - For the game against Golden State (March 19):\n     - Row index: 67\n     - Check \"location attendance\" to see if it was played at AT&T Center and confirm the attendance.\n   - For the game against Oklahoma City (March 22):\n     - Row index: 69\n     - Similarly, check \"location attendance\".\n\n3. **Verify Location and Attendance for Each Game:**\n   - **Golden State Game (Row 67):**\n     - Location attendance: \"at&t center 18581\"\n     - This confirms the game was played at AT&T Center with an attendance of 18,581.\n   - **Oklahoma City Game (Row 69):**\n     - Location attendance: \"ford center 18203\"\n     - This indicates that the game was not played at AT&T Center; it was held at Ford Center with an attendance of 18,203.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim:**\n   - The claim specifies both games must be at AT&T Center with over 19,000 in attendance.\n   - While the Golden State game meets the location requirement (at ATT Center), its attendance is below 19,000 and thus does not fully satisfy the claim.\n   - The Oklahoma City game was neither held at AT&T Center nor did it have an attendance over 19,000.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- **Golden State Game**:\n  - Location: At ATT Center (TRUE)\n  - Attendance > 19000: FALSE\n\n- **Oklahoma City Game**:\n  - Location: At ATT Center: FALSE\n  - Attendance > 19000: FALSE\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The game against Golden State was played at AT&T Center with an attendance of 18,581.
