    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to examine the years each player played based on the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - The players mentioned in the claim are Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Javier Morales.\n   \n2. **Locate Their Data:**\n   - Find the rows corresponding to these players in the table:\n     - **Kyle Beckerman** is in row 3.\n     - **Chris Wingert** is in row 4.\n     - **Javier Morales** is in row 6.\n\n3. **Extract Years of Play:**\n   - For each player, check the \"years\" column to determine their years of play:\n     - Kyle Beckerman (Row 3): \"2007 - present\"\n     - Chris Wingert (Row 4): \"2007 - present\"\n     - Javier Morales (Row 6): \"2007 - present\"\n\n4. **Compare the Years:**\n   - All three players, Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Javier Morales, have played from \"2007 - present\".
