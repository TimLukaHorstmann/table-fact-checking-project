In VFL/AFL scoring:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total points} = (9 \\times 6) + (6 \\times 1) = 54 + 6 = 60\n       \\]\n     - This confirms that both formats represent the same total score of 60.\n   - Geelong's score is given in two formats: 10.11 and 71.\n     - The first format, 10.11, represents 10 goals and 11 behinds:\n       \\[\n       \\text{Total points} = (10 \\times 6) + (11 \\times 1) = 60 + 11 = 71\n       \\]\n     - This confirms that both formats represent the same total score of 71.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Calculate the difference between Geelong's and Hawthorn's scores:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = 71 - 60 = 11\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Difference:**\n   - The claim states that Hawthorn\u2019s score should be higher by 1.5 than Geelong\u2019s.\n   - In terms of actual points, this would mean:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Hawthorn's score} = \\text{Geelong's score} + 1.5\n     \\]\n   - Convert 1.5 in VFL/AFL scoring to points:\n     - 1 goal is worth 6 points and 0.5 goals would be half of that, which is 3 points.\n     - Therefore, 1.5 goals = \\(6 + 3 = 9\\) points.\n\n5. **Check the Validity of the Claim:**\n   - If Hawthorn\u2019s score were higher by 1.5 goals (or 9 points) than Geelong\u2019s, then:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Hawthorn's score} = 71 + 9 = 80\n     \\]\n   - However, Hawthorn\u2019s actual score is 60, which is not higher than Geelong\u2019s score of 71.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"Hawthorn's away team score of 9.6 (60) be higher by 1.5 than that of Geelong\" is false because the scores show that Hawthorn's score is actually lower than Geelong's, not higher by any margin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant scores for Hawthorn and Geelong from the table.
