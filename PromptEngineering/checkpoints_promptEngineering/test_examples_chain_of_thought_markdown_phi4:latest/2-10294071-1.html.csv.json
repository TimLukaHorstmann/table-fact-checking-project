    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"29 be the number of tie play with a debut year of 1930\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Players with Debut Year 1930:**\n   - Look at the column labeled \"debut\" and find entries that match the year 1930.\n\n2. **Verify Ties Played for Each Player Found:**\n   - For each player identified in step 1, check the value in the \"ties played\" column to see if it matches 29.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Based on Findings:**\n   - The claim is true only if there exists at least one player with a debut year of 1930 who has exactly 29 ties played.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Players with Debut Year 1930:**\n   - From the table, we see that \"franjo kukuljevi\u0107\" has a debut year of 1930.\n\n2. **Verify Ties Played for Franjo Kukuljevi\u0107:**\n   - Check the \"ties played\" column for franjo kukuljevi\u0107. The value is 18.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since no player with a debut year of 1930 has 29 ties played (franjo kukuljevi\u0107 has only 18), the claim is FALSE.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified franjo kukuljevi\u0107 as the player with a debut year of 1930.
