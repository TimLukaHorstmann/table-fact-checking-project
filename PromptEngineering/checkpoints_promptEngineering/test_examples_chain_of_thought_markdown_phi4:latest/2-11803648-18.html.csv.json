    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than half of Ottawa's draft picks be acquire by trade\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Ottawa's Draft Picks**: First, identify which entries in the table correspond to teams associated with Ottawa. According to the table, Ottawa 67\u2019s (OHl) appears under the \"club team\" column for Corey Cowick at round 6.\n\n2. **Check for Trades**: Look at whether any of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired through trades. The table specifies if a pick was obtained via trade by noting \"(from [team])\". For Ottawa, only one entry is available:\n   - Corey Cowick: Position \"lw\", Nationality \"canada\", Club Team \"ottawa 67 's (ohl)\", Round 6, Overall 160.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that more than half of Ottawa's draft picks were acquired by trade. Since only one pick is listed for Ottawa and it was not obtained through a trade (no \"(from [team])\" notation), zero out of one (or 0/1) were trades.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: For the statement to be true, more than half (i.e., at least two out of four or any number greater than 50%) of Ottawa's picks must have been acquired by trade.
