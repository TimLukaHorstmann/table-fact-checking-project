Union Bank of California Tower (years 1969 - 1970)\n\n4. **Check if Any Other Buildings Contain 'Bank' in Their Names**:\n   - There are no other buildings in the table with \"bank\" in their names.\n\n5. **Count Total Number of Times a Building Was Tallest**:\n   - According to the claim, we need three instances where bank-related buildings were the tallest.\n   - We have only two distinct periods from the above list when a building related to banks was the tallest.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are only two periods in which bank buildings were the tallest, not three as claimed, the statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells that pertain to this analysis include those containing \"name\" and \"years as tallest\" for the identified bank-related buildings:\n\n- Row 3: \n  - name: American Bank Building\n  - years as tallest: 1913 - 1927\n- Row 8:\n  - name: Union Bank of California Tower\n  - years as tallest: 1969 - 1970\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that 3 bank buildings were the tallest at different times.
