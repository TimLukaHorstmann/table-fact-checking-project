This confirms that \"olimpia\" is indeed in position 10.\n\n3. **Check the Number of Wins**:\n   - Next, we need to verify how many wins \"olimpia\" has.\n   - In row 9, under the \"wins\" column, it shows a value of 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both conditions in the claim are satisfied: \"olimpia\" is in position 10 and has 2 wins.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The chain of thought confirms that the claim is accurate.\n- The relevant cells from the table are those containing the position and number of wins for \"olimpia\".\n\nHere's the JSON output with the reasoning steps:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate 'olimpia' in the table, which is found in row 9.\",\n    \"Check the 'position' column for 'olimpia'.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero.\" This implies that we need to check if there are any teams with a position greater than 10 and calculate their scores.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Teams**:\n   - The table contains only 10 rows, representing teams ranked from positions 1 to 10.\n   - Therefore, no team has a position higher than 10 in this dataset.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Score for These Non-Existent Teams**:\n   - Since there are no teams with positions greater than 10, the total number of goals scored by such teams is zero by default because they do not exist.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim that \"the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero\" is true because there are no teams in positions higher than 10 to contribute any scores.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- We reviewed all rows (1 to 10) and identified none with a position greater than 10, confirming no additional scoring data exists beyond these rows.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the total number score of teams positioned higher than 10 is zero.
