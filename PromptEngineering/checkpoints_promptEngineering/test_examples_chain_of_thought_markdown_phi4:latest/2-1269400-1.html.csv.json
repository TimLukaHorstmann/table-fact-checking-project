This indicates that no specific individual's placement is recorded for this event in the \"individual\" category.\n\n3. **Check Sprint Placement**:\n   - For the same event (1994 Lillehammer), look at the column labeled \"sprint\". The table shows a placement of \"32nd\".\n\n4. **Determine Specific Individual Participation**:\n   - The claim specifically mentions Tomasz Sikora, but the table does not list any individual names for any events. It only provides rankings in various categories without naming individuals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the table confirms that there was a 32nd place finish in the sprint at the 1994 Lillehammer event, it does not specify who achieved this placement.\n   - Therefore, based on the information provided in the table alone, we cannot confirm that Tomasz Sikora participated or came in 32nd at the sprint.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The claim about Tomasz Sikora's participation and his specific placement is unsupported by the data in the table.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows a '32nd' placement for the sprint event at 1994 Lillehammer but does not specify any individual's name, including Tomasz Sikora.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table carefully:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure**: The table lists events and corresponding results for different categories (individual, sprint, pursuit, mass start, relay) across several years.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We are asked about Tomasz Siko\u0301ra's result in the \"individual\" category for the event in 2011 Vancouver.\n   - Check if there is a row corresponding to the year 2011 and location Vancouver in the table.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for 2011 Vancouver**:\n   - The years listed are: 1994 Lillehammer, 1998 Nagano-Nozawa, 2002 Salt Lake City, 2006 Turin, and 2010 Vancouver.\n   - There is no row that lists the year 2011 or location Vancouver.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no entry for a 2011 Vancouver event in the table, it implies that there cannot be any data for Tomasz Siko\u0301ra's \"individual\" category result for such an event.\n   - The claim states there is a value for Tomasz Siko\u0301ra in the individual category for the 2011 Vancouver event. Since this event does not exist in the table, the claim must be false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - No cells are relevant because there is no row or column entry for a 2011 Vancouver event.\n\nBased on these steps, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table does not have an entry for a 2011 Vancouver event. Therefore, it cannot contain any result for Tomasz Siko\u0301ra in the 'individual' category for such an event.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
