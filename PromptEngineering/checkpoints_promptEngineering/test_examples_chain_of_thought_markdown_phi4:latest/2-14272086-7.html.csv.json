    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Texas Rangers' highest game attendance being against the Yankees is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on two columns: \"opponent\" and \"attendance\". The relevant rows are those where the opponent is the \"yankees\".\n\n2. **Extract Attendance for Yankees Games**:\n   - Look at each row where the opponent is \"yankees\".\n   - Extract the attendance figures from these rows.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Games**:\n   - Identify the highest attendance figure among all games listed in the table, regardless of the opponent.\n   - Compare this highest overall attendance figure to the attendance figures for games against the Yankees.\n\n4. **Determine the Validity of the Claim**:\n   - If the highest attendance figure corresponds to a game against the \"yankees\", then the claim is true.\n   - Otherwise, if a higher attendance figure is recorded for any other opponent, the claim is false.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Yankees Games Attendance**:\n  - July 1: Attendance = 53,223\n  - July 2: Attendance = 52,659\n\n- **Highest Overall Attendance in Table**:\n  - We look at all attendance figures to find the highest one.\n  - July 12 (White Sox): Attendance = 39,209\n  - This is higher than any of the Yankees games.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the Texas Rangers' highest game attendance was when they played against the Yankees is false.
