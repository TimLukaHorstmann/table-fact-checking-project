    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the attendance of a game on June 9, 2004, against the Mariners (Texas Rangers' 9th game) being over 40,000 is true or false, we need to analyze the table carefully.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for June 9**: \n   - Locate the entry in the \"date\" column that matches \"june 9\". This corresponds to row index 9.\n\n2. **Verify Opponent**:\n   - Check if the opponent listed on June 9 is indeed the Mariners, as per the claim. The table shows \"mariners\" under the \"opponent\" column for this date.\n\n3. **Confirm Game Number**:\n   - Confirm that June 9 marks the 9th game of the season. By counting each non-postponed entry from the start of the season (June 1), we find:\n     - June 1: 1st game\n     - June 2: 2nd game\n     - June 4: 3rd game\n     - June 5: 4th game\n     - June 6: 5th game\n     - June 7: 6th game\n     - June 8: Postponed (not counted)\n     - June 9: 7th game\n\n   The table shows that the 9th game actually occurs on June 22 against the Mariners. Therefore, the claim about the 9th game being on June 9 is incorrect.\n\n4. **Check Attendance**:\n   - Even though the opponent and date match for June 9, it's not the 9th game. However, for completeness, check the attendance for June 9.\n   - The \"attendance\" column shows \"n / a\" for June 9, indicating no available data or that the game was postponed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because:\n- The game on June 9 against the Mariners is not the 9th game of the season.\n- There is no attendance data available for June 9 as it was marked \"n / a\".\n\nThus, the final answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the 9th game on June 9 against the Mariners had an attendance over 40,000.
