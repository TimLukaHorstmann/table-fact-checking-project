    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The statement suggests two pieces of information: \n   - Kansas City Chiefs were the opponent in Week 14.\n   - The attendance for that game was 74,524.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to check the row corresponding to Week 14 in the table.\n   - Specifically, we should verify both the \"opponent\" and \"attendance\" columns for Week 14.\n\n3. **Locating Week 14 Data**:\n   - From the table, locate Row 13 (index starting from 0):\n     ```\n     |    14 | december 16 , 2001 | kansas city chiefs   | l 26 - 23 |        77778 |\n     ```\n\n4. **Checking Opponent**:\n   - The opponent listed for Week 14 is \"kansas city chiefs\", which matches the claim.\n\n5. **Checking Attendance**:\n   - The attendance recorded for Week 14 is 77,778.\n   - This does not match the claimed attendance of 74,524.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the opponent part of the claim is correct, the attendance figure is incorrect.\n   - Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this verification are:\n     - Row index 13, Column \"opponent\": \"kansas city chiefs\"\n     - Row index 13, Column \"attendance\": 77778\n\nBased on these steps, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Kansas City Chiefs were the opponent in Week 14 with an attendance of 74,524. By checking the table, we find that Kansas City Chiefs are indeed listed as the opponent for Week 14. However, the attendance is recorded as 77,778, not 74,524. Therefore, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
