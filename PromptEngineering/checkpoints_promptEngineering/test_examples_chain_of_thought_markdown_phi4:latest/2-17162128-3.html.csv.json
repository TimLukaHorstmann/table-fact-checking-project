The player must be from the United States.\n2. The \"to par\" value should be +11 and the \"total\" should be more than 151.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Table\nLet's go through each row to check if any satisfy both conditions:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Player: Ernie Els\n  - Country: South Africa\n  - To Par: +8\n  - Total: 148\n  - Does not meet either condition.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Player: Fuzzy Zoeller\n  - Country: United States\n  - To Par: +11\n  - Total: 151\n  - Meets the \"to par\" condition but does not satisfy the \"total > 151\" condition (Total is exactly 151).\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - Player: Curtis Strange\n  - Country: United States\n  - To Par: +12\n  - Total: 152\n  - Does not meet the \"to par\" condition.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Player: Jack Nicklaus\n  - Country: United States\n  - To Par: +13\n  - Total: 153\n  - Does not meet the \"to par\" condition.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Player: Steve Jones\n  - Country: United States\n  - To Par: +14\n  - Total: 154\n  - Does not meet the \"to par\" condition.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Player: Hale Irwin\n  - Country: United States\n  - To Par: WD (Withdrawn)\n  - Total: WD\n  - Does not meet either condition.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nUpon reviewing all rows, no player from the United States has a \"to par\" of +11 with a total greater than 151. The only player who meets the \"to par\" condition is Fuzzy Zoeller, but his total is exactly 151, not more than 151.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires both 'to par' to be +11 and 'total' to be greater than 151 for a player from the United States.
