    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to analyze specific aspects of the table: both promotion and relegation occurrences during the postseason.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Promotion Events in Postseason:**\n   - Look through the \"postseason\" column for entries indicating a team was promoted.\n   - The term \"promotion playoffs\" indicates an attempt to be promoted, which we assume leads to promotion if successful.\n   - In 1998-99, the entry is \"promotion playoffs,\" indicating a postseason promotion event.\n\n2. **Identify Relegation Events in Postseason:**\n   - Look through the \"postseason\" column for entries that indicate relegation.\n   - The term \"relegated\" directly indicates a team was relegated.\n   - In 2001-02, the entry is \"relegated,\" indicating a postseason relegation event.\n\n3. **Determine Sequence of Events:**\n   - We have identified a promotion event in 1998-99 (first such event).\n   - We have identified a relegation event in 2001-02.\n   - The claim states that the first relegation occurred after the first promotion.\n\n4. **Verify Temporal Order:**\n   - Promotion in postseason happened in 1998-99.\n   - Relegation in postseason occurred later, in 2001-02.\n   - Since 2001-02 comes after 1998-99, the order aligns with the claim's requirement that relegation happens after promotion.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.
