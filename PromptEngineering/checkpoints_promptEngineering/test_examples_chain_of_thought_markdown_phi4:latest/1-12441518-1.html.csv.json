    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Kevin Jonas be the only one that do not appear in all season\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table's information about each character and their respective seasons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Kevin Lucas's Seasons:**\n   - According to the table, Kevin Lucas (portrayed by Kevin Jonas) appears in \"seasons 1 - 2\" as part of the main cast.\n   - Additionally, he is listed under \"recurring cast seasons\" as \"appears in all seasons.\"\n\n2. **Verify Other Characters' Seasons:**\n   - Nick Lucas (Nick Jonas): Main cast in \"seasons 1 - 2\" and appears in \"all seasons.\"\n   - Joe Lucas (Joe Jonas): Main cast in \"seasons 1 - 2\" and appears in \"all seasons.\"\n   - Stella Malone (Chelsea Kane): Main cast in \"seasons 1 - 2\" and appears in \"all seasons.\"\n   - Macy Misa (Nicole Anderson): Main cast in \"seasons 1 - 2\" and appears in \"all seasons.\"\n\n3. **Check the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that Kevin Jonas is the only one not appearing in all seasons.\n   - However, the table indicates that Kevin Jonas does appear in all seasons (both as main and recurring cast).\n   - All characters listed are noted to appear in \"all seasons\" under the \"recurring cast seasons\" column.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Kevin Jonas is included in the list of those who appear in all seasons, the claim is incorrect.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Kevin Lucas appears in all seasons as both main and recurring cast.
