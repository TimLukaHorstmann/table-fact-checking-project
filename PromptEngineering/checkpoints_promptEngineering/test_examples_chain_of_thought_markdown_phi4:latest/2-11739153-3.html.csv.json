Each row represents one game.\n\n5. **Compute Average Attendance**:\n   - Divide the total attendance by the number of games to calculate the average attendance.\n\n6. **Compare with Claimed Value**:\n   - Compare the calculated average attendance with the claimed value of 18,568.\n\n7. **Determine True or False**:\n   - If the calculated average matches the claim exactly, then the statement is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n1.
