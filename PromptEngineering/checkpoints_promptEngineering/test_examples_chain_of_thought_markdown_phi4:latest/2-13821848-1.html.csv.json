    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's break down each component step-by-step using the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- \"Albert Butt be draft 23 pick after Cliff Webber in 1985.\"\n\nFrom this statement, we need to verify:\n1. Albert Butts is indeed drafted as a 23rd pick.\n2. This event occurs immediately following Cliff Webber's draft.\n3. The context of the year being 1985.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Draft Pick Numbers\n\n- **Cliff Webber**: From the table, we see that Cliff Webber was picked at number 93 in Round 4.\n- **Albert Butts**: According to the table, Albert Butts was picked at number 116 in Round 5.\n\nTo determine if Albert Butts is the \"23rd pick after\" Cliff Webber:\n- Calculate the difference between their picks: \\(116 - 93 = 23\\).\n\nThe calculation confirms that Albert Butts was indeed the 23rd pick after Cliff Webber, which satisfies part of the claim.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Round Order\n\nNext, we need to confirm if Albert Butts was drafted immediately after Cliff Webber:\n- **Cliff Webber** is in Round 4.\n- **Albert Butts** is in Round 5.\n\nThis confirms that Albert Butts was indeed drafted immediately following Cliff Webber.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Year\n\nThe claim includes a specific year, 1985. However, the table does not provide information about the year of the draft. Since we cannot verify the year from the given data, this part of the claim remains unverifiable based on the provided table alone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The pick order and round sequence align with the claim.\n- The year aspect (1985) is unverified due to lack of information in the table.\n\nGiven that the critical parts about draft position and sequence are verified but not the year, we cannot definitively say the entire claim is true. However, based on the available data, the primary conditions related to pick order and sequence are satisfied.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince the table does not provide information about the year, and assuming the year is crucial for the full validation of the claim, we must conclude that the claim cannot be fully verified as TRUE due to insufficient information regarding the year 1985. Thus, based on the available data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Albert Butts was indeed drafted 23 picks after Cliff Webber, and he was picked in the next round immediately following Cliff Webber's pick.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Andrew Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - The claim mentions two players: Andrew Battle and Chris Remly.\n   - From the table, we see \"Andre Battle\" in row 2 and \"Chris Remly\" in row 6. Note that there is a slight difference in name capitalization (Andrew vs. Andre), but assuming this is a typographical error, we consider them to be the same person.\n\n2. **Determine Pick Numbers:**\n   - For Andre Battle:\n     - Round: 3\n     - Pick Number: 70\n   - For Chris Remly:\n     - Round: 7\n     - Pick Number: 162\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Andrew Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly.\"\n   - Andre Battle was drafted with pick number 70.\n   - Chris Remly was drafted with pick number 162.\n   - Since 70 is less than 80, Andre Battle was indeed drafted as a pick earlier than the 80th pick.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Andrew (Andre) Battle be draft 80 pick before Chris Remly is true because he was drafted at pick number 70, which is before the 80th pick and before Chris Remly's pick number of 162.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Andre Battle's row (Row 2): \n  - `round`: 3\n  - `pick`: 70\n  - `player`: Andre Battle\n- Chris Remly's row (Row 6):\n  - `round`: 7\n  - `pick`: 162\n  - `player`: Chris Remly\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the relevant players from the table: Andre Battle and Chris Remly.
