This confirms that \"minas gerais\" has played 15 games.\n\n3. **Check the 'lost' Column**: Verify how many games \"minas gerais\" have lost.\n   - In row 8, under the column \"lost,\" the value is 9. This indicates that \"minas gerais\" has lost 9 games.\n\n4. **Verify Both Conditions**:\n   - The claim states two conditions: \"play 15\" and \"lost 9.\"\n   - Both conditions are met as per the table data for \"minas gerais.\"\n\nSince both parts of the claim align with the information provided in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Cell at row index 8, column name \"played\": Value = 15\n- Cell at row index 8, column name \"lost\": Value = 9\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The team 'minas gerais' is identified in position 8 of the table.
