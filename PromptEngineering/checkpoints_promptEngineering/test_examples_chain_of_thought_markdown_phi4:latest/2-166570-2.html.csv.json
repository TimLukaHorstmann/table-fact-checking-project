We are specifically looking for entries where the \"year\" column has a value less than 1970.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**: Go through each row in the table to check the year associated with each structure.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - Look for any rows where the \"year\" is before 1970.\n   - Note the corresponding details (structure type, main use, country, town) if found.\n\n4. **Find Entries Before 1970**:\n   - Check row by row:\n     - Row 1: Year 1969\n     - Row 2 to Row 34: All years are from 1970 onwards.\n     - Row 35: Year 1965\n\n5. **Relevant Rows Identified**:\n   - Row 1: Year is 1969, structure type \"guyed mast\", main use \"vhf - uhf transmission\", country \"us\", town \"hemingford , nebraska\".\n   - Row 35: Year is 1965, structure type \"guyed mast\", main use \"vhf - uhf transmission\", country \"us\", town \"roswell , new mexico\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since there are entries with years before 1970 (specifically in rows 1 and 35), the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no structure was erected before 1970.
