The claim states that Corinthians have a difference of 2.\n   \n3. **Check Lost Games:**\n   - Still in row 7, look at the column labeled \"lost.\" The table shows a value of `5` for lost games. The claim states that they have a loss of 5.\n\n4. **Check Against Goals:**\n   - Finally, check the column labeled \"against\" for Corinthians' row (row 7). It has a value of `27`. The claim states that they are against 27 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- All three pieces of information mentioned in the claim match the data from the table:\n  - Difference = 2\n  - Lost games = 5\n  - Goals against = 27\n\nThus, based on the examination of the relevant row (position 7), all parts of the claim are correct.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index: 7, Column name: difference (Value: 2)\n- Row index: 7, Column name: lost (Value: 5)\n- Row index: 7, Column name: against (Value: 27)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
