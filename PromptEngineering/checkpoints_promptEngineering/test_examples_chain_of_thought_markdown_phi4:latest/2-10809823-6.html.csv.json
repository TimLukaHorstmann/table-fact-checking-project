Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows for each venue**:\n   - For Victoria Park, locate the row where \"venue\" is listed as \"victoria park\".\n   - For Princes Park, locate the row where \"venue\" is listed as \"princes park\".\n\n2. **Extract crowd sizes from these rows**:\n   - From the row with \"victoria park\", extract the value in the \"crowd\" column.\n   - From the row with \"princes park\", extract the value in the \"crowd\" column.\n\n3. **Compare the extracted values**:\n   - Compare the crowd size at Victoria Park to the crowd size at Princes Park to see if it is smaller.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps using the table:\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rows\n  - The row for \"victoria park\" is the second row.\n  - The row for \"princes park\" is the third row.\n\n- **Step 2**: Extract crowd sizes\n  - From the second row (Victoria Park), the crowd size is 29,094.\n  - From the third row (Princes Park), the crowd size is 11,958.\n\n- **Step 3**: Compare the values\n  - The crowd at Victoria Park (29,094) is larger than the crowd at Princes Park (11,958).\n\nThe claim states that the crowd at Victoria Park should be smaller than at Princes Park.

Therefore, we focus on rows where the \"date\" column is \"3 may 1980\".\n\n2. **Check All Rows for the Specified Date**:\n   - Row 1: home team = Melbourne, away team = South Melbourne, venue = mcg\n   - Row 2: home team = Collingwood, away team = St Kilda, venue = victoria park\n   - Row 3: home team = Hawthorn, away team = Footscray, venue = princes park\n   - Row 4: home team = Fitzroy, away team = Essendon, venue = junction oval\n   - Row 5: home team = North Melbourne, away team = Carlton, venue = arden street oval\n   - Row 6: home team = Richmond, away team = Geelong, venue = vfl park\n\n3. **Analyze Venues for the Date**:\n   - We have six rows corresponding to games on 3 May 1980.\n   - The venues listed are mcg, victoria park, princes park, junction oval, arden street oval, and vfl park.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that \"the only venue\" was Victoria Park.\n   - However, from our analysis, there are multiple venues (mcg, princes park, junction oval, arden street oval, vfl park) besides Victoria Park on 3 May 1980.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are other venues listed for the specified date, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked all rows with the date '3 may 1980' and identified the venues as mcg, victoria park, princes park, junction oval, arden street oval, and vfl park.
