Therefore, the 1961 season would be the 65th season.\n   - The first season (1897) is counted as the 1st season. Thus, counting up to 1961 gives:\n     \\[\n     1961 - 1896 + 1 = 66\n     \\]\n   - However, considering that the first official season was in 1897, the count from 1897 to 1961 is:\n     \\[\n     1961 - 1897 + 1 = 65\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim aligns with historical data and calculations, confirming that the 1961 VFL season was indeed the 65th season.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The Victorian Football League (VFL) began in 1896, but its first official season was in 1897.

This confirms that all events indeed occurred on this specific date.\n\n2. **Venue Check**:  \n   The claim specifies that all events took place at the Western Oval venue. To verify this:\n   - Row 1: Venue is \"western oval\".\n   - Rows 2-6: Venues are \"brunswick street oval\", \"princes park\", \"junction oval\", and \"punt road oval\" respectively.\n\n   From this, it's clear that not all events took place at the Western Oval; they occurred at various venues.
