    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"she be 6 and 10 in win loss during this open\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table's data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that the player has a career win-loss record of \"6 and 10\". This means she won 6 matches and lost 10 across all tournaments listed.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to verify her total wins and losses from the table, specifically focusing on the \"win - loss\" row at the bottom of each column and the overall career win-loss record.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Column (Year)**:\n   - For 2007: The win-loss record is \"1 - 1\". This means she won 1 match and lost 1.\n   - For 2008: The win-loss record is \"0 - 1\". She lost 1 match.\n   - For 2009: The win-loss record is \"1 - 2\". She won 1 match and lost 2.\n   - For 2010: The win-loss record is \"1 - 3\". She won 1 match and lost 3.\n   - For 2011: The win-loss record is \"0 - 1\". She lost 1 match.\n   - For 2012: The win-loss record is \"1 - 1\". She won 1 match and lost 1.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Wins and Losses**:\n   - Total wins = 1 (2007) + 0 (2008) + 1 (2009) + 1 (2010) + 0 (2011) + 1 (2012) = 4\n   - Total losses = 1 (2007) + 1 (2008) + 2 (2009) + 3 (2010) + 1 (2011) + 1 (2012) = 9\n\n5. **Checking the Career Win-Loss Record**:\n   - The career win-loss record provided in the table is \"4 - 12\". This confirms that she won 4 matches and lost 12 matches across all years.\n\n6. **Comparing with Claim**:\n   - The claim states a record of \"6 wins and 10 losses\", but our calculations show 4 wins and 9 losses from yearly data, and the career total is 4 wins and 12 losses.\n   - Therefore, the claim does not match either the yearly totals or the overall career totals.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim \"she be 6 and 10 in win loss during this open\" is FALSE based on the table data.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are from the \"win - loss\" row and each year's column:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Interpret the claim as needing a total of 6 wins and 10 losses.\",\n    \"Examine the 'win - loss' row for each year to calculate total wins and losses.\",\n    \"Calculate yearly totals: 2007 (1-1), 2008 (0-1), 2009 (1-2), 2010 (1-3), 2011 (0-1), 2012 (1-1).\",\n    \"Sum the results to find total wins = 4 and losses = 9.\",\n    \"Check the career win-loss record in the table: '4 - 12'.\",\n    \"Compare calculated totals with the claim; they do not match.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2007\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2008\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2011\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"win - loss\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
