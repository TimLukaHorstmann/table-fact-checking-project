    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\n\nThe claim states that \"li\" is not exclusively associated with being the name for:\n- The duke of Song\n- The marquis of Wei\n\nThis means there should be at least one other entry in the table where \"li\" is used as a name for any role or state other than just these two.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Entries with Name \"li\"\n\nWe need to find all entries in the table where the \"name\" column contains \"li\". \n\n1. **Row Index 10**: \n   - State: song\n   - Type: sovereign\n   - Name: li\n   - Title: duke\n\n2. **Row Index 14**:\n   - State: wey\n   - Type: sovereign\n   - Name: li\n   - Title: marquis\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Exclusivity of \"li\"\n\nFrom step 2, we identified that \"li\" appears in two rows:\n- As a duke in Song.\n- As a marquis in Wei.\n\nWe need to check if there are any other occurrences of \"li\" as a name in different roles or states. \n\n### Step 4: Check for Additional Occurrences\n\nReview the entire \"name\" column to ensure no other entries have \"li\". Upon checking, there are no additional rows where \"li\" appears as a name.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince \"li\" is only found as a name for the duke of Song and the marquis of Wei, it is exclusively associated with these two roles. Therefore, the claim that \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'li' is not exclusive to the duke of Song and the marquis of Wei.
