    "resp": "To determine whether the claim that \"Richard Krajicek played in 25 championship tennis matches\" is true or false, we need to count the number of rows in the table where Richard Krajicek participated.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**:\n   - The table lists various outcomes (winner/runner-up) along with details about each match including date, championship location, surface type, opponent, and score.\n   \n2. **Identify Matches Involving Richard Krajicek**:\n   - Since there is no explicit column for player names in the outcome rows, we must assume that the table refers to a single player across all these matches. Given the context of tennis history knowledge (Krajicek's career), it's plausible to assume this player is Richard Krajicek.\n   \n3. **Count All Rows**:\n   - Count each row from the table as representing one match in which Richard Krajicek participated.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Matches**:\n   - Manually count all rows: 24 rows are present, and thus there are 24 matches listed.\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Richard Krajicek played in 25 championship tennis matches.\n   - We counted only 24 matches from the table.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 24 does not equal 25, the claim is false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists outcomes and details for 24 different matches.
