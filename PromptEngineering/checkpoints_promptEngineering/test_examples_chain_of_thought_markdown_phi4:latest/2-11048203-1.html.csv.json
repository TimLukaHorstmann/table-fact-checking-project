This is before December 16, 2003, so it does not fall within the specified time frame.\n   - **Row 2:** Date is October 17, 2003. This falls after December 16, 2003, and before October 28, 2013.\n   - **Row 3:** Date is February 18, 2004. This also falls within the specified period.\n   - **Row 4:** Date is August 18, 2004. This is within the time frame.\n   - **Row 5:** Date is February 14, 2006. This date is within the specified range.\n   - **Row 6:** Date is February 22, 2006. Again, this falls within the period.\n   - **Row 7:** Date is January 28, 2009. This date is within the time frame.\n   - **Row 8:** Date is September 9, 2009. This also falls within the specified range.\n   - **Row 9:** Date is October 28, 2013. This is exactly on the end date of the period.\n\n4. **Determine if Competitions Occurred:**\n   - For each row that falls within the time frame (Rows 2 through 9), check if a competition was involved:\n     - Row 2: Competition is \"2004 AFC Asian Cup Qualification.\"\n     - Row 3: Competition is \"2006 FIFA World Cup Qualification.\"\n     - Row 4: It's a \"friendly,\" which is considered a competition.\n     - Row 5: It's a \"friendly,\" also considered a competition.\n     - Row 6: Competition is \"2007 AFC Asian Cup Qualification.\"\n     - Row 7: Competition is \"2011 AFC Asian Cup Qualification.\"\n     - Row 8: It's a \"friendly,\" which counts as a competition.\n     - Row 9: It's a \"friendly,\" also considered a competition.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Hatem Aqel competed in competitions from October 17, 2003, to October 28, 2013, as all relevant rows indicate participation in either official or friendly matches within the specified period.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table entries from October 17, 2003, to October 28, 2013, show that Hatem Aqel participated in various competitions and friendlies.
