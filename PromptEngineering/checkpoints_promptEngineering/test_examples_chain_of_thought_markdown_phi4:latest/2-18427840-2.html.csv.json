Additionally, it's useful to check the records before and after this fight to ensure consistency in understanding the win/loss sequence.\n\n3. **Determine the Outcome of the Fight**: The relevant row should indicate whether the result was a win or a loss against Mateus Trindade.\n\n4. **Verify the Record**: If the result is a win, we check if the record before this fight (in terms of wins and losses) matches what would be expected after adding one more win to it.
