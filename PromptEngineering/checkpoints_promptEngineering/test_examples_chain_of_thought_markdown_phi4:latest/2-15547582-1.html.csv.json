    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze each part of it systematically using the table data:\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **No party has a Labour Panel greater than 1**: We check if any party has more than 1 member in the Labour Panel column.\n2. **Nominated by the Taoiseach less than 11**: We verify that all parties have no more than 10 nominees from this category.\n3. **Cultural and Educational Panel smaller than 0**: Check for any negative values in the Cultural and Educational Panel column.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n1. **Labour Panel**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il: 2\n   - Fine Gael: 1\n   - Labour Party: 2\n   - Clann na Talmhan: 1\n   - Clann na Poblachta: 1\n   - Independent: 2\n\n   From this, we see that the Fianna F\u00e1il, Labour Party, and Independent have more than 1 member in the Labour Panel. This already violates part of the claim.\n\n2. **Nominated by the Taoiseach**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il: 9\n   - Fine Gael: 0\n   - Labour Party: 0\n   - Clann na Talmhan: 0\n   - Clann na Poblachta: 0\n   - Independent: 0\n\n   All parties have nominations less than 11, so this part of the claim is satisfied.\n\n3. **Cultural and Educational Panel**:\n   - Fianna F\u00e1il: 3\n   - Fine Gael: 1\n   - Labour Party: 0\n   - Clann na Talmhan: 0\n   - Clann na Poblachta: 0\n   - Independent: 0\n\n   All values are zero or greater, so no party has a negative value here.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that there should be \"nil\" (none) parties with these conditions:\n- Labour Panel > 1 \n- Nominated by the Taoiseach < 11 \n- Cultural and Educational Panel < 0\n\nSince we have identified parties with Labour Panels greater than 1, this part of the claim is violated. The other parts are satisfied or irrelevant because the first condition already disqualifies the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires no party to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. However, multiple parties have a Labour Panel greater than 1, which violates the first part of the claim. The other parts are satisfied but do not alter this conclusion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": \"Fianna F\u00e1il\", \"column_name\": \"Labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": \"Fine Gael\", \"column_name\": \"Labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": \"Labour Party\", \"column_name\": \"Labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": \"Clann na Talmhan\", \"column_name\": \"Labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": \"Clann na Poblachta\", \"column_name\": \"Labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": \"Independent\", \"column_name\": \"Labour panel\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
