    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"3.0 be the highest number of goal score in the play - offs that have scored 2 in the FA Cup\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the conditions specified in the claim against the data in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - We are looking for players who have scored exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup.\n   - Among these players, we want to find if any have scored more than 3 goals in the play-offs.\n   - The claim suggests that no player has scored more than 3 goals in the play-offs while scoring exactly 2 in the FA Cup.\n\n2. **Identify Players with 2 Goals in the FA Cup**:\n   - From the table, we need to find players who have \"2\" under the \"fa cup\" column.\n   - The relevant rows are:\n     - Paul Barnes (Row 1): 2 goals in FA Cup\n     - Kayode Odejayi (Row 17): 2 goals in FA Cup\n\n3. **Check Play-offs Goals for These Players**:\n   - For each player identified, check the \"play - offs\" column to see how many goals they scored.\n   - Paul Barnes: 1 goal in play-offs\n   - Kayode Odejayi: 0 goals in play-offs\n\n4. **Evaluate Against the Claim**:\n   - The maximum number of goals scored by any player who has scored exactly 2 in the FA Cup is 1 (Paul Barnes).\n   - Therefore, no player has scored more than 3 goals in the play-offs while scoring 2 in the FA Cup.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since no player meets the condition of having more than 3 goals in the play-offs with exactly 2 in the FA Cup, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Paul Barnes: \n  - Row 1, \"fa cup\" column\n  - Row 1, \"play - offs\" column\n\n- Kayode Odejayi:\n  - Row 17, \"fa cup\" column\n  - Row 17, \"play - offs\" column\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify players with 2 goals in the FA Cup.
