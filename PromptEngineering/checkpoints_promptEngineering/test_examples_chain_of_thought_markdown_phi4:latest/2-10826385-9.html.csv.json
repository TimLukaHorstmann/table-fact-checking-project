We need to verify if all games listed are indeed played on this date.\n   - From the \"date\" column in each row, it is confirmed that every game took place on 27 May 1972.\n\n2. **Identify the Teams Involved:**  \n   - The claim specifically mentions two away teams: Richmond and Geelong.\n   - We will look for rows where these teams are listed as the \"away team.\"\n\n3. **Verify Game Results for Each Team:**\n   - For each identified away team, we need to compare their score against the home team's score to determine if they won.\n\n4. **Check Row with Richmond as Away Team:**  \n   - Locate the row where \"richmond\" is listed in the \"away team\" column.\n   - This occurs at:\n     - **Row 2:**\n       - Home team: fitzroy\n       - Home team score: 12.25 (97)\n       - Away team: richmond\n       - Away team score: 16.9 (105)\n       - Venue: junction oval\n\n   - Compare scores:\n     - Richmond's score: 16.9 (105)\n     - Fitzroy's score: 12.25 (97)\n\n   - Conclusion for Richmond: Richmond wins because their score is higher than fitzroy's.\n\n5. **Check Row with Geelong as Away Team:**  \n   - Locate the row where \"geelong\" is listed in the \"away team\" column.\n   - This occurs at:\n     - **Row 4:**\n       - Home team: collingwood\n       - Home team score: 28.16 (184)\n       - Away team: geelong\n       - Away team score: 16.13 (109)\n       - Venue: victoria park\n\n   - Compare scores:\n     - Geelong's score: 16.13 (109)\n     - Collingwood's score: 28.16 (184)\n\n   - Conclusion for Geelong: Geelong loses because collingwood's score is higher than theirs.\n\n6. **Final Evaluation of the Claim:**  \n   - Richmond won their game.\n   - Geelong lost their game.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"2 away teams, Richmond and Geelong, win their game\" is false since only Richmond won.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 2: \n  - Columns: home team (fitzroy), away team (richmond), home team score (12.25 [97]), away team score (16.9 [105])\n- Row 4: \n  - Columns: home team (collingwood), away team (geelong), home team score (28.16 [184]), away team score (16.13 [109])\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Richmond and Geelong won their games on May 27, 1972.
