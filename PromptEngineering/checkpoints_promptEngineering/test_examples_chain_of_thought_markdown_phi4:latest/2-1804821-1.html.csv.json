Gallop's shield animal is a \"falcon.\"\n\nLet's verify each part of the claim step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Check the External Weapon for Gallop\n\n- Look at the row corresponding to \"gallop.\"\n- In the column labeled \"external weapon,\" find the entry for \"gallop.\"\n- According to the table, the external weapon listed is \"sword.\"\n\nThe claim states that gallop has \"two shortswords\" as the external weapon.
