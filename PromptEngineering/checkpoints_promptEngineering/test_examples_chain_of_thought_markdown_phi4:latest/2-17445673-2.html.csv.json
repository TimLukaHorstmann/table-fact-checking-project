    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 2 matches were played through 3 rounds\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table and identify which matches lasted for three rounds.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Matches Lasted 3 Rounds:**  \n   We are interested in finding rows where the match went on for three rounds. This can be determined by checking the \"round\" column for entries with a value of 3.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1 (Index 0):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 2 (Index 1):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 3 (Index 2):** Round = 3\n   - **Row 4 (Index 3):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 5 (Index 4):** Round = 2\n   - **Row 6 (Index 5):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 7 (Index 6):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 8 (Index 7):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 9 (Index 8):** Round = 3\n   - **Row 10 (Index 9):** Round = 2\n   - **Row 11 (Index 10):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 12 (Index 11):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 13 (Index 12):** Round = 1\n   - **Row 14 (Index 13):** Round = 1\n\n3. **Count Matches Lasting 3 Rounds:**\n   From the examination above, we identify that:\n   - Row 3 has a match lasting 3 rounds.\n   - Row 9 also has a match lasting 3 rounds.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   There are only two matches (in rows 3 and 9) that lasted for three rounds. Therefore, the claim \"more than 2 matches were played through 3 rounds\" is false because we have exactly two such matches, not more than two.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"I identified which rows correspond to matches lasting 3 rounds by checking the 'round' column for a value of 3.
