    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze the given table data focusing on the Cowboys' margin of victory for each game. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the greatest margin of victory by the Cowboys was 14 points in Week 7 against the New Orleans Saints.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Columns**:\n   - `week`: To locate the specific week.\n   - `opponent`: To confirm the opponent for verification.\n   - `result`: To calculate the margin of victory or defeat.\n   - `game site`: For any additional verification if needed (not strictly necessary here).\n\n3. **Calculate Margin of Victory/Defeat**:\n   The formula to find the margin is: |Cowboys' score - Opponent's score|.\n   \n4. **Analyze Each Relevant Week from Table**:\n\n   - **Week 1**: \n     - Result: L 28-36 (Pittsburgh Steelers)\n     - Margin: |-8| = 8 points (defeat)\n\n   - **Week 2**:\n     - Result: W 24-7 (St. Louis Cardinals)\n     - Margin: |24-7| = 17 points\n\n   - **Week 3**:\n     - Result: W 14-9 (Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n     - Margin: |14-9| = 5 points\n   \n   - **Week 4**:\n     - Result: W 31-14 (Cleveland Browns)\n     - Margin: |31-14| = 17 points\n\n   - **Week 5**:\n     - Result: W 24-10 (Washington Redskins)\n     - Margin: |24-10| = 14 points\n   \n   - **Week 6**:\n     - Result: W 37-7 (Houston Oilers)\n     - Margin: |37-7| = 30 points\n\n   - **Week 7**:\n     - Result: W 21-7 (New Orleans Saints)\n     - Margin: |21-7| = 14 points\n\n5. **Compare All Margins of Victory**:\n   - Week 2: 17 points\n   - Week 4: 17 points\n   - Week 6: 30 points\n   - Week 7: 14 points\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim specifies a margin of victory of 14 points in Week 7 against the New Orleans Saints. However, there were larger margins of victory (17 and 30 points) in other weeks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the greatest margin of victory was not 14 points; it was 30 points in Week 6 against the Houston Oilers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the Cowboys' greatest margin of victory was 14 points in Week 7.\",\n    \"Calculate the margin of victory for each game by subtracting the opponent's score from the Cowboys' score and taking the absolute value.\",\n    \"Week 1: Defeat, Margin = 8\",\n    \"Week 2: Victory, Margin = 17\",\n    \"Week 3: Victory, Margin = 5\",\n    \"Week 4: Victory, Margin = 17\",\n    \"Week 5: Victory, Margin = 14\",\n    \"Week 6: Victory, Margin = 30\",\n    \"Week 7: Victory, Margin = 14\",\n    \"Compare all calculated margins of victory.\",\n    \"The largest margin is 30 points in Week 6 against the Houston Oilers, not 14 points in Week 7.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
