    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant row of the table where the pick number is specified as 155.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Pick Number 155**:\n   - Locate the row in the table where the \"pick\" column equals 155.\n   \n2. **Examine Relevant Columns for This Row**:\n   - Once identified, check the columns associated with this pick number: specifically, the \"player\", \"position\", and \"college\" columns.\n\n3. **Verify the College Name**:\n   - For the row where the pick number is 155, verify if the \"college\" column lists \"arizona\".\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the table, we find that in row 6, the \"pick\" column has the value 155.\n- In this same row, the \"player\" column shows \"john nies\", the \"position\" column shows \"punter\", and most importantly for our claim, the \"college\" column lists \"arizona\".\n  \nBased on these observations:\n\n- The pick number 155 corresponds to a player from Arizona.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is true because the college associated with this pick in the table is indeed Arizona.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row where the 'pick' column is 155.
