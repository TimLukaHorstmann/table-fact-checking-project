There are two such entries:\n     - Row 1: south dragons vs. adelaide 36ers, with a crowd of 4621.\n     - Row 2: sydney spirit vs. cairns taipans, with a crowd of 920.\n\n2. **Extract the \"crowd\" values for February 4:**\n   - From row 1 (index 0), the crowd is 4621.\n   - From row 2 (index 1), the crowd is 920.\n\n3. **Compare each extracted value to 4485:**\n   - For row 1, the crowd of 4621 is greater than 4485.\n   - For row 2, the crowd of 920 is smaller than 4485.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that all scores for February 4 are smaller than 4485.\n   - Since there's at least one entry (row 1) with a crowd larger than 4485, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim \"February 4 have a score smaller than 4485\" is false because not all entries on that date have scores below 4485.
