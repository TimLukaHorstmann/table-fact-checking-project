    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the trail blazer win 6 games and lose 8 between game 35 and 48\" is true or false, we will analyze each game from game 35 to game 48 in the provided table.\n\n1. **Identify Games Played**: We are looking at games numbered 35 through 48.\n\n2. **Determine Wins and Losses**:\n   - Game 35: Win (W)\n   - Game 36: Loss (L)\n   - Game 37: Loss (L)\n   - Game 38: Win (W)\n   - Game 39: Loss (L)\n   - Game 40: Win (W)\n   - Game 41: Win (W)\n   - Game 42: Loss (L)\n   - Game 43: Win (W)\n   - Game 44: Loss (L)\n   - Game 45: Win (W)\n   - Game 46: Loss (L)\n   - Game 47: Loss (L)\n   - Game 48: Loss (L)\n\n3. **Count Wins and Losses**:\n   - Total wins from games 35 to 48: \n     - Games won are 35, 38, 40, 41, 43, and 45.\n     - This results in 6 wins.\n   - Total losses from games 35 to 48:\n     - Games lost are 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 46, 47, and 48.\n     - This results in 8 losses.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that the Trail Blazers won 6 games and lost 8 between game 35 and 48.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Brandon Roy's game on January 22 being the highest single-game point total through Game 48 is true or false, we need to examine the points scored by each player in every game listed from Game 1 to Game 48.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Data:**\n   - The column of interest for this claim is \"high points,\" which records the highest number of points scored by a single player in that game.\n   \n2. **Locate Brandon Roy's Point Total:**\n   - From the table, locate the row where January 22 (Game 44) has the date.\n   - The high points column for Game 44 shows \"andre miller (28)\" as the highest scorer with 28 points.\n\n3. **Check Brandon Roy\u2019s Highest Points:**\n   - Review all entries in the \"high points\" column to find any game where Brandon Roy scored more than or equal to 37 points.\n   - From the table, we identify Game 35 on January 2 with the entry \"brandon roy (37)\" as having the highest points by Brandon Roy.\n\n4. **Compare Against Other Games:**\n   - Review all entries in the \"high points\" column for every game up to Game 48:\n     - Check if any other player scored more than 37 points.\n     - From the table, no single player scored more than 37 points in any game from Game 1 to Game 48.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Brandon Roy's 37-point performance on January 2 (Game 35) is indeed the highest single-game point total up through Game 48.\n   - The claim incorrectly associates this high score with January 22, where his points were not mentioned as a high scorer.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row Index 34:** \"brandon roy (37)\" for Game 35 on January 2\n- **Row Index 43:** \"andre miller (28)\" for Game 44 on January 22\n\nThe claim is false because the highest point total by Brandon Roy of 37 points occurred in Game 35, not Game 44.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Brandon Roy's highest scoring game was on January 2 with 37 points.
