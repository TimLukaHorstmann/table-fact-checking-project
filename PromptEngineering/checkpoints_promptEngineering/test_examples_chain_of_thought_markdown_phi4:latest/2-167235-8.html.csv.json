    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ilir Meta being elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"Ilir Meta was the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.\"\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We need to check the political party affiliation for each prime minister from the table.\n   - Specifically, we are interested in Ilir Meta and any prime ministers between him and Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi.\n\n3. **Locate Political Parties in the Table**:\n   - The column \"political party\" will provide information about which party each prime minister was affiliated with during their term.\n\n4. **Check Ilir Meta's Party Affiliation**:\n   - According to the table, Ilir Meta served from 29 October 1999 to 22 February 2002 and was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.\n\n5. **Check Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi's Party Affiliation**:\n   - Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi served from 13 April 1992 to 11 March 1997 and was a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.\n\n6. **Examine Prime Ministers Between Meksi and Meta**:\n   - We need to check if any prime ministers between Meksi (ending in 1997) and Meta (starting in 1999) were members of the Democratic Party of Albania.\n   - From the table:\n     - Bashkim Fino: Socialist Party of Albania\n     - Fatos Nano (2nd time): Socialist Party of Albania\n     - Pandeli Majko (1st time): Socialist Party of Albania\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - None of the prime ministers between Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi and Ilir Meta were affiliated with the Democratic Party of Albania.\n   - Therefore, Ilir Meta was not elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania at any point.\n\n8. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim is false because Ilir Meta was never elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania; he was always affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania during his term.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Ilir Meta was the first person since Aleksand\u00ebr Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania. Checking the table, Ilir Meta was affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania during his term from 1999-2002. No prime ministers between Meksi (Democratic Party) and Meta were members of the Democratic Party either.
