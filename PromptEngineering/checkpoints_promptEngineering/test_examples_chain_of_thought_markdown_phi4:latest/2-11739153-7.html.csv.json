    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"during the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota play at home more time than they play away\" is true or false based on the given table, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Structure of the Table:**\n   - The table lists game details for the Minnesota Wild during February 2007-08.\n   - Each row represents a game with columns such as `date`, `visitor`, `score`, `home`, `decision`, `attendance`, and `record`.\n   \n2. **Identify Home Games:**\n   - A home game is identified by the `visitor` column being \"minnesota\". This indicates that Minnesota is playing at their home venue.\n  \n3. **Count the Number of Home Games:**\n   - Look through each row and count how many times \"minnesota\" appears in the `visitor` column.\n\n4. **Identify Away Games:**\n   - An away game is identified by the `home` column being \"minnesota\". This indicates that Minnesota is playing at an opponent's venue.\n   \n5. **Count the Number of Away Games:**\n   - Look through each row and count how many times \"minnesota\" appears in the `home` column.\n\n6. **Compare Home and Away Game Counts:**\n   - Compare the number of home games to the number of away games to determine which is greater.\n\n### Counting:\n\n- **Home Games (`visitor` = \"minnesota\"):**\n  - February 10\n  - February 12\n  - February 20\n  - February 26\n  - February 27\n  - February 29\n\n  Total Home Games: 6\n\n- **Away Games (`home` = \"minnesota\"):**\n  - February 2\n  - February 5\n  - February 7\n  - February 9\n  - February 14\n  - February 17\n  - February 19\n  - February 24\n  \n  Total Away Games: 8\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Minnesota played 6 home games and 8 away games during this period.\n- Therefore, the claim that \"Minnesota play at home more time than they play away\" is **FALSE**.\n\nNow, let's format the answer in JSON as required:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified home games by checking where 'minnesota' appears in the visitor column.
