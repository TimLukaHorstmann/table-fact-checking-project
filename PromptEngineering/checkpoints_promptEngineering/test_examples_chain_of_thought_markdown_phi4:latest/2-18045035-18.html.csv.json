In reality, they have zero losses.\n- Therefore, the statement that there are two players with losses (Tony Fiammetta and Rob Long) is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For loss values: \n  - Andrew Robinson: `{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n  - Cam Dantley: `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n  - Tony Fiammetta: `{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n  - Rob Long: `{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}`\n- For average per game:\n  - Tony Fiammetta: `{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"avg / g\"}`\n  - Rob Long: `{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"avg / g\"}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Tony Fiammetta and Rob Long have losses.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true, we need to verify each part of the statement against the data provided:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Highest Gain:**\n   - The claim states that the highest gain is 232.\n   - From the table:\n     - Curtis Brinkley has a gain of 1193\n     - Doug Hogue has a gain of 232\n     - Antwon Bailey has a gain of 227\n     - Delone Carter has a gain of 141\n     - Tony Fiammetta has a gain of 66\n     - Rob Long has a gain of 24\n     - Andrew Robinson has a gain of 35\n     - Cam Dantley has a gain of 98\n   - The highest gain is indeed 1193 (Curtis Brinkley), not 232. Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n2. **Identify the Lowest Gain:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest gain is 35.\n   - From the table:\n     - Rob Long has a gain of 24\n     - Andrew Robinson has a gain of 35\n   - The lowest gain is actually 24 (Rob Long), not 35. Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n3. **Identify the Highest Long:**\n   - The claim states that the highest long is 58 by Doug Hogue.\n   - From the table:\n     - Curtis Brinkley has a long of 45\n     - Doug Hogue has a long of 82\n     - Antwon Bailey has a long of 39\n     - Delone Carter has a long of 32\n     - Tony Fiammetta has a long of 58\n     - Rob Long has a long of 24\n     - Andrew Robinson has a long of 9\n     - Cam Dantley has a long of 20\n   - The highest long is actually 82 (Doug Hogue), so this part of the claim is true.\n\n4. **Identify the Lowest Long:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest long is 20 by Andrew Robinson.\n   - From the table:\n     - Rob Long has a long of 24\n     - Andrew Robinson has a long of 9\n   - The lowest long is actually 9 (Andrew Robinson), not 20. Thus, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim contains multiple inaccuracies regarding both gain and long values.
