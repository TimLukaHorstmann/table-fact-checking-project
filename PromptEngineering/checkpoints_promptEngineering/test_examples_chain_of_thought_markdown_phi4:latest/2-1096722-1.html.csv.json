The run time for \"episode part four.\"\n\nLet's break down the process step-by-step using the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Row for \"Episode Part Four\"\n- We are interested in the row corresponding to \"part four\" as listed under the \"episode\" column.\n- From the table, \"part four\" is listed in the fourth row of the markdown format.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Viewership for \"Part Four\"\n- Locate the cell that corresponds to the number of viewers for \"part four.\"\n- In the table, the viewership data is found under the column titled \"viewers (in millions).\"\n- For the fourth row (\"part four\"), this cell contains the value 10.6.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Run Time for \"Part Four\"\n- Locate the cell that corresponds to the run time for \"part four.\"\n- In the table, the run time data is found under the column titled \"run time.\"\n- For the fourth row (\"part four\"), this cell contains the value 24:57.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the table:\n- The viewership for \"episode part four\" is indeed 10.6 million.\n- The run time for \"episode part four\" is 24:57.\n\nBoth conditions in the claim are met, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells from the table include:\n- Viewership cell: Row index 4, Column name \"viewers (in millions)\"\n- Run time cell: Row index 4, Column name \"run time\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we first locate 'episode part four' in the fourth row of the table.
