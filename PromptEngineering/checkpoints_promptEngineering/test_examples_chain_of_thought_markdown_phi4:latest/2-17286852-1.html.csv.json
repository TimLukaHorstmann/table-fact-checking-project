    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to verify each component related to the Westgaard Bridge:\n\n1. **Bridge Name**: The claim mentions \"Westgaard bridge,\" so we should locate this bridge within the table.\n\n2. **Type**: The claim states that it is a \"pratt pony through truss\" bridge. We will verify if the type matches in the table entry for Westgaard Bridge.\n\n3. **County**: The claim asserts that the bridge is located in Traill County. We need to confirm this detail in the table as well.\n\nNow, let's go step-by-step through these components:\n\n- **Step 1: Locate \"Westgaard Bridge\"**  \n  From the table:\n  - In row 23, we find an entry for \"westgaard bridge,\" which matches the name given in the claim (ignoring case sensitivity).\n\n- **Step 2: Verify Type**  \n  According to the table's column 'type' for Westgaard Bridge:\n  - The type is listed as \"pratt pony through truss.\" This exactly matches the claim.\n\n- **Step 3: Confirm County**  \n  From the table, in row 23 under the 'county' column:\n  - It shows \"mchenry,\" not \"traill\" as claimed.\n\nSince the county does not match (it is Mchenry, not Traill), the claim is false. \n\nThus, the chain of thought concludes with a FALSE determination due to incorrect county information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate 'Westgaard Bridge' in the table.\",\n    \"Verify that its type is 'pratt pony through truss'.\",\n    \"Confirm that it is located in Traill County.\",\n    \"The bridge's actual location is Mchenry, not Traill.\",\n    \"Hence, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
