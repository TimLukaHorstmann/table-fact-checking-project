However, in this context, we're evaluating if his best time is indeed recorded as 59.2.\n   - Since the table shows his best time as 59.2, the statement aligns with the data.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that Marcus Marshall's best time \"be 59.2\" is consistent with the information in the table.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cell for this verification is found at row index 16 (considering 0-based indexing) under the 'best' column.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Marcus Marshall's entry in the table.
