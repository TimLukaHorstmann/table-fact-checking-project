Sum the values in the silver column across all rows to get a total of 2 silver medals. Similarly, sum the values in the bronze column to get a total of 3 bronze medals. Compare these totals: 2 silver vs. 3 bronze. Since 2 is not greater than 3, the claim that there are more silver medals than bronze medals is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
