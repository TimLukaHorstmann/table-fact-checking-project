    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods\" is true or false, we need to examine their rankings in the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - We are interested in two players: Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods.\n\n2. **Locate Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's Details:**\n   - In the table, Thomas Bj\u00f8rn is listed with a rank of \"t6\" (tie for 6th place) under the \"place\" column.\n   - His score details are provided in the same row:\n     - Score: 68 + 71 + 76 = 215\n     - To par: +5\n\n3. **Locate Tiger Woods' Details:**\n   - Similarly, Tiger Woods is also listed with a rank of \"t6\" (tie for 6th place) under the \"place\" column.\n   - His score details are:\n     - Score: 65 + 73 + 77 = 215\n     - To par: +5\n\n4. **Compare Their Rankings:**\n   - Both Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods share the same rank of \"t6\". This means they are tied for 6th place, not that one ranks lower than the other.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn ranks lower than Tiger Woods. Since both players are ranked equally (tied for 6th), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Thomas Bj\u00f8rn: \n  - Row index: 7\n  - Columns: \"place\", \"player\", \"score\", \"to par\"\n- Tiger Woods:\n  - Row index: 9\n  - Columns: \"place\", \"player\", \"score\", \"to par\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Thomas Bj\u00f8rn and Tiger Woods both have a rank of 't6', indicating they are tied for 6th place.
