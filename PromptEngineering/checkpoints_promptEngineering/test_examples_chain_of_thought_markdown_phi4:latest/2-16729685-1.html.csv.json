    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we will evaluate each part of the statement against the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **Artist Name: \"maggie toal\"**\n   - We need to check if there is an artist named \"maggie toal\" in the table.\n\n2. **Draw Number: 7**\n   - The claim states that this artist has draw number 7.\n\n3. **Song Title: \"fee him with love\"**\n   - We must verify whether the song title associated with this artist and draw is \"feed him with love.\"\n\n4. **Spelling Consistency:**\n   - Note any discrepancies in spelling between the claim (\"fee him with love\") and what might be found in the table.\n\n### Table Evaluation:\n- Look for a row where the artist matches \"maggie toal.\"\n- Verify if this row corresponds to draw number 7.\n- Confirm that the song title is correctly matched, considering any potential typographical errors.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Artist:**\n   - In the table, check each row for an artist named \"maggie toal.\"\n   - The relevant row is:\n     |   draw | artist      | song                        |\n     |-------:|-------------|-----------------------------|\n     |      7 | maggie toal | feed him with love          |\n\n2. **Verify Draw Number:**\n   - Confirm that the row where \"maggie toal\" appears has a draw number of 7.\n   - This is true as the artist \"maggie toal\" is listed in row with draw 7.\n\n3. **Check Song Title:**\n   - The song associated with \"maggie toal\" is \"feed him with love.\"\n   - The claim mentions \"fee him with love,\" which seems to be a typographical error (missing 'd').\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Despite the spelling mistake, the intended meaning of the claim matches the table data.\n   - Therefore, if we correct for the typo in the song title, the claim is consistent with the information in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 7 with columns \"draw,\" \"artist,\" and \"song.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The artist 'maggie toal' is listed in the table with draw number 7. The song associated with this artist is 'feed him with love,' which matches the intended meaning of 'fee him with love' from the claim, despite a typo.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"draw\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
