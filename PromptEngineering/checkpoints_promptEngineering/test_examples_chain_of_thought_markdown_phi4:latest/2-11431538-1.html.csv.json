    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"weapon system officer capt r ritchie belongs to f - 4d 66 - 7463\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: We are looking for instances where the weapon systems officer (WSO) column contains \"capt rs ritchie\" and see if this corresponds with any specific aircraft in the table.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Date: May 10\n     - Pilot: capt richard s ritchie\n     - Weapon Systems Officer: capt charles b debellevue\n     - Aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 7463\n     - This row does not involve \"capt rs ritchie\" as the WSO.\n   - **Row 2**:\n     - Date: July 8\n     - Pilot: capt rs ritchie\n     - Weapon Systems Officer: capt cb debellevue\n     - Aircraft: f - 4e 67 - 0362\n     - This row does not involve \"capt rs ritchie\" as the WSO.\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - Date: August 28\n     - Pilot: capt rs ritchie\n     - Weapon Systems Officer: capt cb debellevue\n     - Aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 7463\n     - This row does not involve \"capt rs ritchie\" as the WSO.\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - Date: September 9\n     - Pilot: capt john a madden , jr\n     - Weapon Systems Officer: capt cb debellevue\n     - Aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 0267\n     - This row does not involve \"capt rs ritchie\" as the WSO.\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - Date: September 9\n     - Pilot: capt ja madden , jr\n     - Weapon Systems Officer: capt cb debellevue\n     - Aircraft: f - 4d 66 - 0267\n     - This row does not involve \"capt rs ritchie\" as the WSO.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: After examining all rows, there is no instance where \"capt rs ritchie\" appears in the Weapon Systems Officer column. Therefore, the claim that \"weapon system officer capt r ritchie belongs to f - 4d 66 - 7463\" cannot be true based on the provided data.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**: Since none of the rows satisfy the condition where \"capt rs ritchie\" is the WSO, no specific cells are relevant for confirming the claim.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked each row to see if 'capt rs ritchie' was listed as the Weapon Systems Officer and whether this corresponded with the aircraft 'f - 4d 66 - 7463'. No such instance exists in the table.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
