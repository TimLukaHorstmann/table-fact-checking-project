    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mark Cavendish consecutively wins 5 stages\" is true or false, we need to examine the 'stage' column for consecutive occurrences of Mark Cavendish as a winner.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column to check for winners is the \"winner\" column in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Occurrences of Mark Cavendish:**\n   - We will scan through each row to find instances where \"mark cavendish\" appears as a winner.\n   \n3. **Check Consecutive Wins:**\n   - Identify if there are any sequences where Mark Cavendish wins 5 stages consecutively.\n\n4. **Review the Table Data:**\n\n   - Stage 1: Winner is \"mark cavendish\"\n   - Stage 2: Winner is \"yauheni hutarovich\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 3: Winner is \"philippe gilbert\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 4: Winner is \"igor ant\u00f3n\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 5: Winner is \"tyler farrar\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 6: Winner is \"thor hushovd\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 7: Winner is \"alessandro petacchi\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 8: Winner is \"david moncouti\u00e9\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 9: Winner is \"david l\u00f3pez\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 10: Winner is \"imanol erviti\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 11: Winner is \"igor ant\u00f3n\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 12: Winner is \"mark cavendish\"\n   - Stage 13: Winner is \"mark cavendish\"\n   - Stage 14: Winner is \"joaquim rodr\u00edguez\" (breaks the sequence)\n   - Stage 15: Winner is \"carlos barredo\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 16: Winner is \"mikel nieve\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 17: Winner is \"peter velits\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 18: Winner is \"mark cavendish\"\n   - Stage 19: Winner is \"philippe gilbert\" (breaks the sequence)\n   - Stage 20: Winner is \"ezequiel mosquera 2\" (not consecutive)\n   - Stage 21: Winner is \"tyler farrar\" (not consecutive)\n\n5. **Conclusion from Data:**\n   - Mark Cavendish wins stages 1, 12, 13, and 18.\n   - The longest consecutive sequence of wins by Mark Cavendish is 2 stages (stages 12 and 13).\n\n6. **Determine Truthfulness of the Claim:**\n   - Since there are no instances where Mark Cavendish wins 5 consecutive stages, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined to identify any consecutive stage wins by Mark Cavendish. The longest sequence found was two consecutive wins (stages 12 and 13). Therefore, the claim of five consecutive wins is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
