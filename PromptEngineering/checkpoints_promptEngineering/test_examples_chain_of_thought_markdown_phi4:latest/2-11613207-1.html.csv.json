The claim specifically mentions the SK Telecom Open occurring in April on the Korean Tour.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We need to look at the \"dates\" column to determine when each tournament takes place. This will help us identify which tournaments are held in April.\n\n2. **Check each row for April dates**:\n   - **Row 1**: Dates are \"apr 25 - 28\", and the tournament is Ballantine's Championship.\n   - **Row 2**: Dates are \"may 9 - 12\".\n   - **Row 3**: Dates are \"may 16 - 19\" (SK Telecom Open).\n   - **Row 4 to Row 13**: All these rows have dates starting in May or later months.\n\n3. **Conclusion from the examination**:\n   - The only tournament listed that takes place in April is Ballantine's Championship, not the SK Telecom Open.\n   - The SK Telecom Open occurs from \"may 16 - 19\", which is in May.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**: \n   - The claim states that the SK Telecom Open is the only competition on the Korean Tour taking place in April.\n   - Based on our examination, this statement is false because there is another tournament (Ballantine's Championship) listed for April.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'dates' column shows that Ballantine's Championship takes place from 'apr 25 - 28', while the SK Telecom Open occurs in May.

Thus, September can be considered among the most active months based on available data.\n- **Part 2**: The average OWGR points for September is indeed 6.\n- **Final Evaluation**: The claim about December cannot be substantiated due to lack of data.
