Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the Date in the Table**:\n   - The claim refers to the score on 21/07/2007.\n\n2. **Locate the Match for the Specific Date**:\n   - Scan the \"date\" column in the table for the entry \"21 / 07 / 07\".\n   - Find that this date corresponds to row 23 of the table.\n\n3. **Verify the Competition**:\n   - Check if the competition listed for this date is \"super league xii\".\n   - The competition in row 23 is indeed \"super league xii\".\n\n4. **Check the Score**:\n   - Look at the score column for this particular match.\n   - The score listed in row 23 is \"10 - 4\".\n\n5. **Compare with the Claimed Score**:\n   - The claim states that the score should be \"14 - 10\".\n   - Compare this to what's actually listed: \"10 - 4\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the actual score of \"10 - 4\" does not match the claimed score of \"14 - 10\", the claim is false.\n\n7. **List Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Date (row 23, column \"date\"): \"21 / 07 / 07\"\n   - Competition (row 23, column \"competition\"): \"super league xii\"\n   - Score (row 23, column \"score\"): \"10 - 4\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.
