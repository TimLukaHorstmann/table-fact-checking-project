They have lost 5 matches, which is not greater than 5.\n\n3. **Verify the number of draws for the team with 51 points**:\n   - The claim also specifies that the team must have \"drawn with 1\" match. For Clitheroe (row 3), they have drawn 7 matches, which satisfies this condition.\n\n4. **Conclude based on all conditions**:\n   - We found a team (Clitheroe) with 51 points and more than 1 draw.\n   - However, their number of losses is not greater than 5; it is exactly 5.\n\nSince no team in the table meets all the criteria specified in the claim (\"51 point\", \"a number of loss larger than 5\", and \"drawn with 1\"), the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams with exactly 51 points.\",\n    \"Check if any team with 51 points has more than 5 losses.\",\n    \"Verify that the team also meets the condition of having drawn at least one match.\",\n    \"Conclude based on whether all conditions are met.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
