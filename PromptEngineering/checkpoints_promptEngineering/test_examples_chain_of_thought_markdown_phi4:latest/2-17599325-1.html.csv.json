    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine if Lex Davison is indeed the only driver who won both races held on the same circuit.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:** The claim states that Lex Davison is the only driver who has won two different races held at the same circuit location.\n\n2. **Identify Duplicate Circuits in the Table:**\n   - Examine each race's \"circuit\" column to find any circuits where more than one race was held.\n   - Here are the unique circuits with their respective races:\n     - **Gnoo Blas Circuit:** 1 race (27 January, South Pacific Championship for Racing Cars)\n     - **Fisherman\u2019s Bend:** 1 race (23 February, Victorian Trophy Race)\n     - **Longford Circuit:** 1 race (3 March, Longford Trophy)\n     - **Port Wakefield Circuit:** 1 race (5 April, South Australian Trophy Race)\n     - **Lowood Circuit:** 2 races (15 June, Queensland Road Racing Championship; 31 August, Lowood Trophy)\n     - **Mount Panorama Circuit:** 1 race (23 October, Australian Grand Prix)\n     - **Albert Park:** 1 race (30 November, Melbourne Grand Prix)\n     - **Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit:** 1 race (26 December, Phillip Island Trophy Race)\n\n3. **Check Wins at Circuits with Multiple Races:**\n   - The only circuit with more than one race is the Lowood Circuit.\n   - Check the winners of both races:\n     - 15 June: Alec Mildren\n     - 31 August: Alec Mildren\n\n4. **Evaluate Lex Davison's Performance:**\n   - Lex Davison won on Mount Panorama Circuit (23 October, Australian Grand Prix), which hosted only one race listed in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the Lowood Circuit is the only circuit with multiple races and both were won by Alec Mildren, not Lex Davison.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"the only driver to win both races on the same circuit be Lex Davison\" is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n\n- **Row 5:** Lowood Circuit (15 June) Winner: Alec Mildren\n- **Row 6:** Lowood Circuit (31 August) Winner: Alec Mildren\n- **Row 8:** Mount Panorama Circuit (23 October) Winner: Lex Davison\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the circuit with multiple races (Lowood Circuit).
