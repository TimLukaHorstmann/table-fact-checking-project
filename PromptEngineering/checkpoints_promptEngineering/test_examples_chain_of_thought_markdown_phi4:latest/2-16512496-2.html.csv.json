Not a win for Dick Johnson.\n- **Row 2 (launceston):** Winner is \"dick johnson\", Team is \"dick johnson racing\". Count as 1 win.\n- **Row 3 (lakeside):** Winner is \"dick johnson\", Team is \"dick johnson racing\". Count as 2 wins.\n- **Row 4 (perth):** Winner is \"john bowe\", Team is \"dick johnson racing\". Not a win for Dick Johnson.\n- **Row 5 (mallala):** Winner is \"dick johnson\", Team is \"dick johnson racing\". Count as 3 wins.\n- **Row 6 (sandown):** Winner is \"dick johnson\", Team is \"dick johnson racing\". Count as 4 wins.\n- **Row 7 (winton):** Winner is \"george fury\", Team is \"nissan motorsport australia\". Not a win for Dick Johnson.\n- **Row 8 (oran park):** Winner is \"peter brock\", Team is \"mobil 1 racing\".
