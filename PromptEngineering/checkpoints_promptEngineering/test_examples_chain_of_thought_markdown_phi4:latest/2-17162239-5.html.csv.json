This column shows the position each player finished in the tournament.\n\n2. **Locate Tied Positions**: Look for positions where multiple players share the same rank, indicated by a \"t\" followed by the number (e.g., t4, t6).\n\n3. **Examine Sixth Place**:\n   - Check the `place` column to see how many players are listed as tied for sixth place.\n   - The table shows \"t6\" followed by multiple player names.\n\n4. **Count Players at Tied Position**:\n   - Count the number of players listed under \"t6\".\n   - According to the table, the following players are tied for sixth place: John Adams, Fred Funk, Wayne Levi, Craig Parry, Mike Standly, and Tom Watson.\n   - This results in a total of 6 players.\n\n5. **Verify with Scores**:\n   - Each player has a score listed under the `score` column, and all have the same total score of 209.\n   - The `to par` column confirms they are tied at -1 relative to par.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that there are 6 players tied for sixth place.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Fred Funk's score being 6 strokes higher than John Adams' score is true or false, let's analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Locate Scores for Each Player:**\n   - Find Fred Funk's total score in the \"score\" column.\n     - From the table, Fred Funk's score is listed as 70 + 72 + 67 = 209.\n   - Find John Adams' total score in the \"score\" column.\n     - From the table, John Adams' score is listed as 70 + 70 + 69 = 209.\n\n2. **Calculate Stroke Difference:**\n   - Calculate the difference between Fred Funk's and John Adams' scores:\n     - Fred Funk's score: 209\n     - John Adams' score: 209\n     - Difference: 209 (Fred Funk) - 209 (John Adams) = 0 strokes\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Fred Funk's score is 6 strokes higher than John Adams' score.\n   - Based on our calculation, the difference is actually 0 strokes.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the calculated difference (0 strokes) does not match the claimed difference (6 strokes), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - Fred Funk's score cell: Row index 7, Column name \"score\"\n   - John Adams' score cell: Row index 8, Column name \"score\"\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
