We will focus on this column.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in the table\n- **Himachal Pradesh** is located in the row with the state name \"himachal pradesh\".\n- **Madhya Pradesh** is located in the row with the state name \"madhya pradesh\".\n\n### Step 3: Extract data for Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for the period \"2006 - 10\"\n- For **Himachal Pradesh**: Check the cell under the column \"2006 - 10\". The value is `0.35`.\n- For **Madhya Pradesh**: Check the cell under the column \"2006 - 10\". The value is `0.29`.\n\n### Step 4: Compare extracted values with the claim\nThe claim states:\n- Himachal Pradesh has a value of `0.65` in \"2006 - 10\".\n- Madhya Pradesh has a value of `0.39` in \"2006 - 10\".\n\nComparing these with the actual table data:\n- The actual value for Himachal Pradesh is `0.35`, not `0.65`.\n- The actual value for Madhya Pradesh is `0.29`, not `0.39`.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe values provided in the claim do not match the values from the table for either state.
