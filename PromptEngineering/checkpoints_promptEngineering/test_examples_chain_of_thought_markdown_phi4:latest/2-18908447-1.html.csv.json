Row index 4, column \"round\" - Value: 7\n2. Row index 4, column \"pick\" - Value: 158\n3. Row index 4, column \"position\" - Value: tight end\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify Jim Obradovich's pick details from the table: round 7, pick number 158, position 'tight end'. Then evaluate the claim conditions: he was picked after round 2 (round 7) and before pick 183 (pick 158), satisfying both parts of the condition. His position as a tight end matches the claim.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the statement into its components and verify each part against the table:\n\n1. **Claim Component 1: \"Jim Obradovich pick before round 2\"**\n   - According to the claim, Jim Obradovich was picked in a round that occurs before Round 2.\n   - Looking at the table:\n     - The rows for rounds are as follows: \n       - Row 1: Round 2\n       - Row 2: Round 3\n       - Row 3: Round 4\n       - Row 4: Round 7\n       - Row 5: Round 8\n   - Jim Obradovich is listed in row 4, with a round value of 7. Therefore, he was picked in Round 7.\n   - This component of the claim is FALSE because Round 7 is after Round 2.\n\n2. **Claim Component 2: \"pick 183\"**\n   - The claim states that Jim Obradovich's pick number is 183.\n   - According to the table, Jim Obradovich's pick number (column \"pick\") in row 4 is 158.\n   - This component of the claim is FALSE because his actual pick number is 158, not 183.\n\n3. **Claim Component 3: \"play tight end position\"**\n   - The claim states that Jim Obradovich plays as a tight end.\n   - According to the table, in row 4, Jim Obradovich's position (column \"position\") is indeed listed as \"tight end.\"\n   - This component of the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let\u2019s summarize the findings:\n- The claim that Jim Obradovich was picked before Round 2 and had a pick number of 183 is FALSE. He was actually picked in Round 7 with pick number 158.\n- The part of the claim stating his position as \"tight end\" is TRUE.\n\nSince two components of the claim are false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Jim Obradovich's round: Row 4, Column \"round\"\n- Jim Obradovich's pick number: Row 4, Column \"pick\"\n- Jim Obradovich's position: Row 4, Column \"position\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is divided into three parts. 'Jim Obradovich pick before round 2' is false because he was picked in Round 7. 'Pick 183' is false as his actual pick number is 158. 'Play tight end position' is true based on the table.
