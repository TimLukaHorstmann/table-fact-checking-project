This indicates they did not lose a semifinal game; instead, they won the championship.\n   - **2009 - 2010**: \n     - Here, under \"playoffs\", it states \"lost semifinal\". This directly supports the claim that in this season, the team lost the semifinal game.\n   - **2010 - 2011**:\n     - The \"playoffs\" column reads \"did not qualify\", indicating they did not reach the playoffs, let alone lose a semifinal.\n\n3. **Determine Validity of the Claim:**\n   - The claim is about losing a semifinal game in the PASL Pro league.\n   - From our analysis, only during the 2009-2010 season did the team in question lose the semifinal game while playing in the PASL Pro league.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is true based on the data from the 2009-2010 season.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For the year 2009-2010:\n  - Row index: 5\n  - Column \"league\": \"pasl - pro\"\n  - Column \"playoffs\": \"lost semifinal\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim is true based on the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where the league is 'pasl - pro'.
