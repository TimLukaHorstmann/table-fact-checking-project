    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"none of the player change be complete during the summer transfer window\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that no player changes will be completed during the summer transfer window. This means that all transfers should not have a status indicating they are finalized.\n\n2. **Review the Table Structure**:\n   - The table contains several columns: `name`, `country`, `status`, `moving to`, `transfer window`, and `transfer fee`.\n   - We need to focus on the `status` and `transfer window` columns to verify if any player's transfer is marked as completed during the summer.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - The `status` column indicates whether a player is transferring, has a contract termination, or is on loan.\n   - The `transfer window` column specifies when the transfer can occur (in this case, \"summer\" for all entries).\n\n4. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - For each row in the table, check if the `status` indicates a completed action (such as \"transfer\") and if the `transfer window` is \"summer\".\n   - If any player has a status of \"transfer\" during the summer, it implies that their transfer is intended to be completed.\n\n5. **Examine Each Player**:\n   - van bommel: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - larsson: Status = \"contract termination\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - maxi: Status = \"loan\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - damia: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - f navarro: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - oscar lopez: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - gabri: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - r\u00fcst\u00fc: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n   - rodri: Status = \"transfer\", Transfer Window = \"summer\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Multiple players have a status of \"transfer\" during the summer transfer window, indicating that these transfers are intended to be completed.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are player changes (transfers) that will be completed during the summer.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates several players with a 'transfer' status in the summer transfer window.
