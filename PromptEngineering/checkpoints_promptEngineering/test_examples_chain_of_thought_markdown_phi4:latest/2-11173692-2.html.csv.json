    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate the number of songs scoring fewer than 100 points compared to those scoring 100 or more.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Total Number of Songs**: \n   - The table contains 19 rows (excluding the header), which corresponds to 19 different song entries.\n\n2. **Count Songs Scoring Fewer Than 100 Points**:\n   - We will examine each row in the \"points\" column and count how many scores are below 100.\n   - Entries with points less than 100: \n     - Row 1: 23\n     - Row 3: 8\n     - Row 4: 36\n     - Row 5: 5\n     - Row 6: 16\n     - Row 10: 42\n     - Row 11: 22\n     - Row 12: 22\n     - Row 13: 72\n     - Row 15: 27\n     - Row 17: 94\n   - Total count of entries with points < 100 = 11\n\n3. **Count Songs Scoring 100 Points or More**:\n   - Entries with points \u2265 100:\n     - Row 2: 104\n     - Row 7: 96 (though not >= 100, it's close; double-check)\n     - Row 9: 106\n     - Row 14: 139\n     - Row 18: 135\n     - Row 19: 156\n   - Total count of entries with points \u2265 100 = 6\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Half of the total songs (19) is 9.5.\n   - We have 11 songs scoring fewer than 100 points, which is more than half.\n   - Therefore, less than half of the songs score 100 or more.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that \"less than half of the song score fewer than 100 point, the rest score more.\" This implies that more than half should score 100 or more, which is false based on our count.\n   \n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Points < 100: Rows 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17\n- Points \u2265 100: Rows 2, 9, 14, 18, 19\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table has 19 songs.
