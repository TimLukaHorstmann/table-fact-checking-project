    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the record for June 13 be under 29 - 32\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim pertains to the \"record\" column for the date \"June 13\".\n\n2. **Locate the Date**: Find the row where the date is \"June 13\". According to the table, this corresponds to:\n   - Row index: 11\n   - Column name: \"date\" and \"record\"\n\n3. **Check the Record on June 13**:\n   - The record listed for June 13 is \"29 - 32\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that the record should be \"under 29 - 32\". In this context, \"under\" implies a previous record before reaching \"29 - 32\".\n   - We need to check if any preceding date has a record less than \"29 - 32\".\n\n5. **Examine Preceding Records**:\n   - June 2: Record is \"26 - 27\"\n   - June 3: Record is \"26 - 28\"\n   - June 5: Record is \"26 - 29\"\n   - June 6: Record is \"27 - 29\"\n   - June 7: Record is \"28 - 29\"\n   - June 8: Record is \"28 - 30\"\n   - June 10: Record is \"29 - 30\"\n   - June 11: Record is \"29 - 31\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - All records before June 13 are indeed less than \"29 - 32\".
