    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the data from the table for players whose active years include any time between 1950 and 1965. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players**: We need to find players in the table who played at least part of their career during the years 1950 through 1965.\n\n2. **Examine Each Player**:\n   - **Titus Ozon (Row 10)**: Active from 1947 to 1964.\n     - This includes the period from 1950 to 1965.\n     - Goals scored: 157\n   - **Mihai Adam (Row 9)**: Active from 1962 to 1976.\n     - Includes part of the period from 1962 to 1965.\n     - Goals scored: 160\n   - **Ion Oblemenco (Row 5)**: Active from 1964 to 1976.\n     - Includes part of the period from 1964 to 1965.\n     - Goals scored: 170\n   - **Florea Dumitrache (Row 6)**: Active from 1966 to 1983.\n     - Does not include any years from 1950 to 1965.\n   - **Victor Piturca, Marin Radu, Rodion Camataru, Mircea Sandu, Ionel Danciulescu, and Dudu Georgescu**: All active after 1965.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Goal Scores**:\n   - Titus Ozon scored 157 goals, which is less than 160.\n   - Mihai Adam scored exactly 160 goals, not less than 160.\n   - Ion Oblemenco scored 170 goals, more than 160.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that during the years 1950 through 1965, the goal score should be less than 160. However, we found that Mihai Adam scored exactly 160 goals and Ion Oblemenco scored 170 goals during this period, both of which do not satisfy the condition of being less than 160.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players active between 1950-1965: Titus Ozon (157 goals), Mihai Adam (160 goals), Ion Oblemenco (170 goals).
