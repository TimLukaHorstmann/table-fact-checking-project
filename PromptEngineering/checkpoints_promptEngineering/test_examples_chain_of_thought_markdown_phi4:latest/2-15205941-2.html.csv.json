This indicates they share an equal position in this ranking system.\n   \n2. **Runner-Up Status**:\n   - According to the table, both managers have been runners-up once (`runner - up = 1`). This aspect does not differentiate them as it is identical for both.\n\n3. **Years Won**:\n   - Helenio Herrera won in 1964 and 1965.\n   - Ernst Happel won in 1970 and 1983.\n   - The total number of years they have won the title (2 years each) is equal, so this does not provide a differentiation.\n\n4. **Clubs Won**:\n   - Helenio Herrera achieved his wins with Internazionale.\n   - Ernst Happel managed Feyenoord and Hamburg to win titles.\n   - While the clubs differ, there's no inherent ranking or superiority of one club over another in terms of winning European competitions as per the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Given Data**:\n   - Since both managers have identical ranks, the same number of runner-up appearances, the same number of winning years, and represent different but equally prestigious clubs, there is no evidence in the provided data to objectively claim one manager is \"better\" than the other based solely on this table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"helenio herrera be better than ernst happel\" cannot be substantiated as true or false with the information given.
