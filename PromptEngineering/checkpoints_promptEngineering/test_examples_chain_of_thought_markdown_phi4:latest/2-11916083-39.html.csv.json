Note the spelling discrepancy: the table uses \"john mardon\", while the claim uses \"john mordon\".\n\n4. **Price Verification**:\n   - The claim specifies a price of \"59.95\".\n   - Ensure that the rows meeting all previous criteria have an \"issue price\" of \"59.95\".\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Year: 2000\n  - Theme: steam buggy\n  - Artist: john mardon (note the spelling difference)\n  - Issue Price: 59.95\n\nThis row meets all criteria except for the artist's name due to a typo in the claim (\"mordon\" instead of \"mardon\").\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim is FALSE because there is a typographical error in the artist's name.
