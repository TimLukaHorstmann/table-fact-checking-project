Therefore, he did not singularly score the highest points this game.\n   - **April 11**: Kevin Martin had the highest score of 28, no one else matched or exceeded this.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim**:\n   - The claim states that Kevin Martin scored the highest amount of points singularly for all games except April 9.
