    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes\" is true or false, we will analyze each episode's writer(s) from the table to see how many episodes Jon Sherman contributed to. Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify Episodes with Jon Sherman as a Writer:**\n   - For each row in the \"written by\" column, check if \"Jon Sherman\" is mentioned.\n\n2. **Count the Number of Episodes Jon Sherman Contributed To:**\n   - We will count how many times his name appears in the \"written by\" column across all episodes listed.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Writers:**\n   - Similarly, identify and count contributions for other writers to see if any other writer has more credited episodes than Jon Sherman.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Counts:**\n   - Determine whether Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes based on our counts from steps 2 and 3.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Episode 49:** \"A Guesthouse Divided\" is written by Constance M Burge & Jack Bernstein. (No Jon Sherman)\n- **Episode 50:** \"Dawn of the Med\" is written by Carol Flint & Jon Sherman. (Jon Sherman: 1)\n- **Episode 51:** \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" is written by Michael Rauch & Jessica Ball. (No Jon Sherman)\n- **Episode 52:** \"About Face\" is written by Constance M Burge. (No Jon Sherman)\n- **Episode 53:** \"Fools Russian\" is written by Carol Flint. (No Jon Sherman)\n- **Episode 54:** \"Manimal\" is written by Jon Sherman. (Jon Sherman: 2)\n- **Episode 55:** \"Business and Pleasure\" is written by Andrew Lenchewski & Jeff Drayer. (No Jon Sherman)\n- **Episode 56:** \"Who 's Your Daddy?\" is written by Michael Rauch & Jon Sherman. (Jon Sherman: 3)\n- **Episode 58:** \"Hurts Like a Mother\" is written by Jessica Ball & Aubrey Karr. (No Jon Sherman)\n\nFrom the analysis, Jon Sherman wrote or co-wrote episodes 50, 54, and 56, totaling 3 credited episodes.\n\nNow let's check other writers:\n\n- **Constance M Burge:** Episodes 49 and 52 (2 credits)\n- **Carol Flint:** Episodes 50 and 53 (2 credits)\n- **Michael Rauch:** Episodes 48, 51, and 56 (3 credits)\n- **Jessica Ball:** Episodes 51 and 58 (2 credits)\n\nComparing the counts, both Jon Sherman and Michael Rauch have written or co-written 3 episodes each.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"Jon Sherman wrote the highest number of episodes\" is FALSE because he shares this count with another writer, Michael Rauch.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified episodes where Jon Sherman was credited as a writer (Episodes 50, 54, and 56).
