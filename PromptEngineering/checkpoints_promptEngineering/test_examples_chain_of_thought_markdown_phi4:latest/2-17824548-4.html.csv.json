    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim about the table, let's analyze it step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states: \"the lyric music for draw 5 be hanne s\u00f8rvaag harry sommerdahl.\" This implies that for draw number 5, both the lyrics and music are attributed to Hanne S\u00f8rvaag and Harry Sommerdahl.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Draw 5 in the Table\nThe table is structured with rows corresponding to different draws. We need to find the row where \"draw\" equals 5.\n\n- **Draw 5**:\n  - Artist: foxy\n  - Song: do it again\n  - Lyrics (l) / Music (m): hanne s\u00f8rvaag (m & l), harry sommerdahl (m & l)\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Relevant Cell for Draw 5\nIn draw 5, the \"lyrics (l) / music (m)\" column specifies:\n- Hanne S\u00f8rvaag is credited with both lyrics and music (m & l).\n- Harry Sommerdahl is also credited with both lyrics and music (m & l).\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Claim\nThe claim states that the lyric and music for draw 5 are by \"hanne s\u00f8rvaag harry sommerdahl.\" This matches exactly with what is provided in the table, where both Hanne S\u00f8rvaag and Harry Sommerdahl are credited with lyrics and music.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe information from the table confirms that the claim is accurate for draw 5.
