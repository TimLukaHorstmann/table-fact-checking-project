Identify the row corresponding to the 32nd title: 'meiji' was the winner and 'waseda' was the runner-up. 2. Verify if 'meiji' is listed as the runner-up in any row; it is not for the 32nd title. 3. Check other rows for instances where 'hosei' is the runner-up against 'meiji', which occurs in the 31st title, not the 32nd. Therefore, the claim about the 32nd title with 'hosei' as runner-up is incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
