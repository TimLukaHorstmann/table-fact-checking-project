    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Buccaneers ending their 1985 season with a 2-14 record is true or false, let's follow these reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement claims that at the end of the 1985 NFL season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a final record of 2 wins and 14 losses.\n\n2. **Locate the Final Record in the Table**:\n   - Examine the table to find the team's record after the last game (Week 16). The relevant column for this information is \"record.\"\n\n3. **Identify the Last Game Entry**:\n   - In the markdown table, each row corresponds to a week and the games played by the Buccaneers.\n   - The final entry in the table (Row 16) shows Week 16's game details.\n\n4. **Check the Record for the Last Game**:\n   - For Row 16, examine the \"record\" column to see if it reflects the team's cumulative record after that game. According to the table, this cell indicates a record of 2-14.\n\n5. **Conclude Based on Evidence**:\n   - Since the final row in the table lists the Buccaneers' record as 2-14, it confirms that they ended their season with this exact record.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is verified by the data presented in Row 16 of the table where \"record\" is listed as 2-14.\n\nNow, let's compile our findings into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the Buccaneers ended their 1985 season with a 2-14 record.
