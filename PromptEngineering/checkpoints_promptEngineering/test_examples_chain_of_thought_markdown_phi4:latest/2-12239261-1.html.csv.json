    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the specific components of the claim step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Series 14:**\n   - The claim refers to \"season 1991,\" which corresponds to series number 14 in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Host for Series 14:**\n   - According to the table, the host for series 14 is \"england.\" This matches the claim's statement about the host being England.\n\n3. **Verify Tests Played in Series 14:**\n   - The number of tests played in series 14 is 5. The claim states that there were 5 tests, which aligns with the table data.\n\n4. **Examine the Series Result for Series 14:**\n   - According to the table, the result of the series is \"series drawn.\" This matches the claim's statement about the series result.\n\n5. **Determine the Holder at the End of the Series 14:**\n   - The holder at the end of series 14 is \"west indies,\" as shown in the table. The claim correctly states that West Indies were the holders at the end of the series.\n\nBy verifying each part of the claim against the data from series 14, we find that all components are accurate based on the information provided in the table.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table for this analysis:\n- \"Host\" column for row index 13 (corresponding to series 14) with value \"england\"\n- \"Tests\" column for row index 13 with value 5\n- \"Series result\" column for row index 13 with value \"series drawn\"\n- \"Holder at the end of the series\" column for row index 13 with value \"west indies\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified series 14 as corresponding to season 1991. Verified host, number of tests, series result, and holder at the end of the series from the table data, confirming all parts of the claim are accurate.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"host\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"tests\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"series result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"holder at the end of the series\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
