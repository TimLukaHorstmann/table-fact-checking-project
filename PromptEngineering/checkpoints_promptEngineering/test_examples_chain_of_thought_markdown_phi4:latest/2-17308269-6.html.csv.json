    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ann Strother (G) be from Connecticut\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table provided:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Player**: The player of interest is Ann Strother.\n\n2. **Locate Player in Table**: According to the table, Ann Strother is listed with a \"pick\" number of 5.\n\n3. **Check Nationality**: Under the column labeled \"nationality,\" for pick number 5 (Ann Strother), it states \"united states.\" This tells us her nationality but not her place of origin or college association directly related to Connecticut.\n\n4. **Examine College Information**: The claim seems to refer to where Ann Strother went to college, as this is the only context in which a player might be associated with a state like Connecticut in this table. For pick number 5 (Ann Strother), the \"college / country / team\" column states \"connecticut.\"\n\n5. **Interpret the Information**: Since the claim refers to her being from Connecticut, and the relevant cell under the \"college / country / team\" is indeed listed as \"connecticut,\" it suggests that Ann Strother attended college in Connecticut.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the table's information, it can be concluded that Ann Strother attended a college in Connecticut, making the claim TRUE in the context of her educational background.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- For pick number 5 (Ann Strother), the relevant cell for the \"college / country / team\" column is \"connecticut.\"\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Ann Strother's row by her name and 'pick' number.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ann Strother is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Player:**\n   - We are interested in the player \"Ann Strother (g)\" as mentioned in the claim.\n   \n2. **Locate Ann Strother in the Table:**\n   - From the table, we find that Ann Strother is listed in row 5.\n\n3. **Verify Nationality:**\n   - Check the \"nationality\" column for Ann Strother (row 5). It states her nationality as \"united states\".\n   - The claim mentions \"be from connecticut\", which implies Connecticut as a location of origin or affiliation. However, it is not about her college or country but rather suggests a geographic connection.\n\n4. **Verify College/Team:**\n   - Check the \"college / country / team\" column for Ann Strother (row 5). It states she is from \"connecticut\".\n   - This supports part of the claim that she is associated with Connecticut, though in terms of college affiliation rather than nationality.\n\n5. **Verify Former WNBA Team:**\n   - Check the \"former wnba team\" column for Ann Strother (row 5). It states her former team was \"indiana fever\".\n   - The claim asserts she \"be never play on indiana fever\", which contradicts this information from the table.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The first part of the claim, regarding Connecticut, is partially true in terms of college affiliation but not in terms of nationality.\n- The second part of the claim is false because Ann Strother did indeed play for Indiana Fever as her former WNBA team.\n\nBased on these observations, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Ann Strother's nationality is United States, and she is associated with Connecticut through college. However, the claim that she 'be never play on indiana fever' is false because her former WNBA team was indeed Indiana Fever.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"college / country / team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"former wnba team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
