Whether Carlton was also an opponent 3 times.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n#### Step 1: Identify instances where \"Melbourne\" is listed as the opponent.\n- Check each row in the table to see when \"opponent\" is \"melbourne\".\n  \n  - **Row 3**: The opponent is \"melbourne\".\n  - **Row 4**: The opponent is again \"melbourne\".\n\nFrom this, we identify that Melbourne appears twice as an opponent.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify instances where \"Carlton\" is listed as the opponent.\n- Check each row in the table to see when \"opponent\" is \"carlton\".\n  \n  - **Row 5**: The opponent is \"carlton\".\n  - **Row 6**: The opponent is again \"carlton\".\n\nFrom this, we identify that Carlton appears twice as an opponent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Melbourne is listed as the opponent 2 times.\n- Carlton is also listed as the opponent 2 times.\n\nThe claim states both should be opponents 3 times each. Since neither Melbourne nor Carlton appear as an opponent 3 times, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- For Melbourne:\n  - Row 3: \"opponent\" column\n  - Row 4: \"opponent\" column\n\n- For Carlton:\n  - Row 5: \"opponent\" column\n  - Row 6: \"opponent\" column\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, check how many times 'Melbourne' appears as an opponent in the table.
