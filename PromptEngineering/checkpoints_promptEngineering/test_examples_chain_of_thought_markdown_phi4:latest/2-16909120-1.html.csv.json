    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim \"217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville,\" let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Row with LBS Name 'granville':**\n   - We need to find all rows where the \"lbsc name\" column contains \"granville.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information:**\n   - Check each row for the condition mentioned above and note down the corresponding \"1st lbsc no.\"\n\n3. **Compare 1st LBS Numbers:**\n   - Once we identify the rows with \"granville,\" compare their \"1st lbsc no\" values to find the lowest one.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Row Examination:**\n  - Row 216 has the \"lbsc name\" as \"granville.\"\n    - The corresponding \"1st lbsc no\" is 216.\n  \n- **Comparison:**\n  - We only found one row with \"granville,\" which is row 216 with a \"1st lbsc no\" of 216.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that 217 should be the lowest \"1st lbsc no\" for \"granville.\"\n   - However, we identified that the only occurrence of \"granville\" has an \"1st lbsc no\" of 216, not 217.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Since there is no row with a \"1st lbsc no\" of 217 and an \"lbsc name\" of \"granville,\" the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'lbsc name' is 'granville'.\",\n    \"Row 216 has 'lbsc name' as 'granville' with '1st lbsc no' of 216.\",\n    \"Compare '1st lbsc no' values for 'granville', only one found: 216.\",\n    \"The claim states 217 should be the lowest, but 216 is lower.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"lbsc name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"1st lbsc no\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
