This indicates there is a pick in the third round.\n   - Row 4: The \"round\" is 4, which does not correspond to the third round.\n   - Row 5: The \"round\" is 7, which does not correspond to the third round.\n   - Row 6: The \"round\" is 7, which does not correspond to the third round.\n\nFrom this examination, we find that row 3 has a value of 3 in the \"round\" column. This means there indeed is a player pick in the third round (Tim Anderson).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**  \n   Since there is at least one entry in the third round, the claim \"there be no player pick in the third round\" is false.\n\n5. **Identify relevant cells:**\n   - Row 3 has a value of 3 in the \"round\" column and contains information about the player pick (Tim Anderson) in that round.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for entries in the 'round' column with a value of 3. Row 3 has such an entry, indicating a player pick in the third round, thereby making the claim false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tim Euhus be the last pick\" is true, we need to analyze the table and identify which player was selected last based on the round and pick number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**:\n   - The table lists players drafted in different rounds and picks.\n   - Each row contains a `round`, `pick` number, `player`, `position`, and `college`.\n\n2. **Identify the Last Pick**:\n   - The last pick is determined by the highest round and within that round, the highest pick number.\n\n3. **Examine the Rounds and Picks**:\n   - Round 1: \n     - Pick 13: Lee Evans\n     - Pick 22: JP Losman\n   - Round 3:\n     - Pick 74: Tim Anderson\n   - Round 4:\n     - Pick 109: Tim Euhus\n   - Round 7:\n     - Pick 207: Dylan McFarland\n     - Pick 214: Jonathan Smith\n\n4. **Determine the Last Pick**:\n   - The highest round is Round 7.\n   - Within Round 7, the picks are 207 and 214.\n   - Pick 214 (Jonathan Smith) is higher than Pick 207.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Jonathan Smith was selected with pick number 214 in Round 7, which is later than Tim Euhus's selection at pick number 109 in Round 4.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"Tim Euhus be the last pick\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 6 (Jonathan Smith): \n  - `row_index`: 6\n  - `column_name`: `round` = 7, `pick` = 214\n\n- Row 4 (Tim Euhus):\n  - `row_index`: 4\n  - `column_name`: `round` = 4, `pick` = 109\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'Tim Euhus be the last pick' is evaluated by identifying the highest round and pick number.
