    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"greg monroe be the most recent player to be drafted\" is true or false, we need to compare the NBA draft years of all players listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The column that contains information about when each player was drafted is the \"nba draft\" column.\n\n2. **Extract draft information**:\n   - **Scotty Hopson**: Drafted undrafted in 2011.\n   - **Greg Monroe**: Drafted in the 1st round, 7th pick of the 2009 draft (Pistons).\n   - **Willie Warren**: Drafted in the 2nd round, 54th pick of the 2010 draft (Clippers).\n   - **Michael Dunigan**: Drafted undrafted in 2011.\n   - **Tyler Zeller**: Drafted in the 1st round, 17th pick of the 2012 draft (Mavericks).\n\n3. **Determine the most recent draft**:\n   - Greg Monroe was drafted in 2009.\n   - Willie Warren was drafted in 2010.\n   - Both Scotty Hopson and Michael Dunigan were undrafted in 2011, which means they did not participate in a draft that year.\n   - Tyler Zeller was drafted in 2012.\n\n4. **Compare the years**: The most recent draft among these players is 2012, with Tyler Zeller being drafted then.\n\n5. **Evaluate the claim**: Greg Monroe was drafted in 2009, which is not the most recent draft compared to Tyler Zeller's 2012 draft.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"greg monroe be the most recent player to be drafted\" is FALSE because Tyler Zeller was drafted more recently in 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
