Therefore, we need to focus on the \"driver\" and \"grid\" columns in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Silvio Moser's Row**:\n   - Scan through the \"driver\" column to find the row where the driver is listed as \"silvio moser\".\n\n3. **Check the Grid Position for Silvio Moser**:\n   - Once we locate the correct row, check the value in the \"grid\" column for that specific row.\n\n4. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - Compare the grid position found with the claim (which states it should be 13).\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Find Silvio Moser**: \n  - The table lists \"silvio moser\" as a driver in one of its rows.\n  \n- **Check Grid Position**:\n  - In the row where \"driver\" is \"silvio moser\", check the \"grid\" column. \n\n- **Grid Value for Silvio Moser**:\n  - According to the table, Silvio Moser's grid position is indeed listed as 13.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"Silvio Moser be the driver with a grid of 13\" is true based on the information in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the relevant columns: 'driver' and 'grid'.
