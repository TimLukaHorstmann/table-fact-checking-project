Whether Fortaleza earned the fewest points.\n\nLet's analyze these steps using the table:\n\n### Step 1: Check if Fortaleza Lost the Greatest Number of Games\n\n- Look at the \"lost\" column for each team.\n- Fortaleza is listed in row 23 with 21 losses.\n- Compare this number to other teams:\n  - Atl\u00e9tico PR and Guarani both have 19 losses (rows 12 and 13).\n  - Coritiba, Internacional, Atl\u00e9tico MG, Fluminense, and Ponte Preta each have 20 losses (rows 5, 6, 7, 19, and 21).\n\nFortaleza has the highest number of losses at 21.\n\n### Step 2: Check if Fortaleza Earned the Fewest Points\n\n- Look at the \"points\" column for each team.\n- Fortaleza is listed in row 23 with 49 points.\n- Compare this to other teams:\n  - Bahia has 46 points (row 24), which is fewer than Fortaleza's 49 points.\n\nFortaleza does not have the fewest points; Bahia has fewer points.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n1.
