However, looking at the table, there are only 5 goals listed (indices 1 through 5). Therefore, there are no goals with an index larger than 4.\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since there are no rows with a goal index larger than 4 in the table, we cannot find any result for such a goal.\n   - The claim specifies that \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1.\" However, as there is no data available for goals with an index greater than 4, this condition is not met or applicable.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Because the table does not contain any rows where the goal index is larger than 4, we cannot verify that such a result exists and equals \"3 - 1\".\n   - Therefore, the claim cannot be true based on the available data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Since there are no relevant cells with a goal index greater than 4, this part of the JSON will list no specific cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains goals only up to an index of 5.
