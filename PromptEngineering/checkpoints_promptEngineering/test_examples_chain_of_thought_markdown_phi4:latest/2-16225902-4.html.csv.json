    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states: \"Mark Hensby be the only player to score 5 over par in the 2005 Open Championship.\"\n\n- **Key Points of the Claim**:\n  - The player's name is Mark Hensby.\n  - His score should be such that it results in a score of \"5 over par.\"\n  - He should be the only one with this specific score.\n\n### Step 2: Examine Relevant Data in the Table\n\n- **Locate Mark Hensby**:\n  - We need to find Mark Hensby's row in the table. According to the table, he is in row 2.\n  \n- **Check His Score and To Par**:\n  - Column \"score\" for Mark Hensby: 67\n  - Column \"to par\" for Mark Hensby: 5\n\n### Step 3: Verify Uniqueness of the \"5 Over Par\" Score\n\n- We need to check if any other player has a \"to par\" score of 5.\n  \n- **Examine Each Row**:\n  - For all rows, we look at the column \"to par.\"\n  - Row 1 (Tiger Woods): to par = 6\n  - Row 2 (Mark Hensby): to par = 5\n  - Rows t3: \n    - Fred Couples: to par = 4\n    - Luke Donald: to par = 4\n    - Retief Goosen: to par = 4\n    - Trevor Immselman: to par = 4\n    - Peter Lonard: to par = 4\n    - Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal: to par = 4\n    - Eric Ramsay (a): to par = 4\n    - Chris Riley: to par = 4\n    - Tino Schuster: to par = 4\n    - Scott Verplank: to par = 4\n\n- **Conclusion from the Data**:\n  - Only Mark Hensby has a \"to par\" score of 5.\n\n### Step 4: Assess the Validity of the Claim\n\n- Since Mark Hensby is indeed the only player with a \"to par\" score of 5, the claim that he was the only player to score 5 over par in the event described by this table (2005 Open Championship) holds true according to the data provided.\n\n### Final Answer and Relevant Cells\nThe final answer is TRUE.
