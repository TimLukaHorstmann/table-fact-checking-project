    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the specific entries related to the call signs `w282ae` and `w290ag`. The claim makes two assertions:\n\n1. \"The city of license for w282ae be albany, georgia\"\n2. \"The city of license for w290ag be gadsden, alabama\"\n\nLet's evaluate these one by one against the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Row for `w282ae`:**\n   - Locate the row where the call sign is `w282ae`. According to the table, this is in row 4.\n   - Check the \"city of license\" column for this row:\n     - It lists \"macon, georgia\".\n\n2. **Evaluate the First Assertion:**\n   - The claim states that the city of license for `w282ae` should be \"albany, georgia\".\n   - However, from the table, we see it is actually \"macon, georgia\".\n   - Therefore, the first part of the claim is FALSE.\n\n3. **Identify the Row for `w290ag`:**\n   - Locate the row where the call sign is `w290ag`. According to the table, this is in row 5.\n   - Check the \"city of license\" column for this row:\n     - It lists \"griffin, georgia\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the Second Assertion:**\n   - The claim states that the city of license for `w290ag` should be \"gadsden, alabama\".\n   - However, from the table, we see it is actually \"griffin, georgia\".\n   - Therefore, the second part of the claim is also FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are false based on the data provided in the table. The city of license for `w282ae` is not Albany, Georgia, and the city of license for `w290ag` is not Gadsden, Alabama.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
