    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game has a sum of points bigger than 80\" is true, we need to examine each row of the table and calculate the total points scored in each game. The relevant column for calculating the total score is the \"result\" column, which provides the scores for both teams.\n\nHere's how we can proceed step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the \"Result\" Format**: \n   - Each entry in the \"result\" column shows two sets of scores separated by a dash (e.g., \"l 23 - 7\").\n   - The first score is the opponent\u2019s points, and the second score is our team's points.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Points for Each Game**:\n   - For each game, split the \"result\" string to extract both teams' scores.\n   - Convert these scores from strings to integers.\n   - Sum the two scores to get the total number of points scored in that game.\n\n3. **Compare Against 80**:\n   - Check if any of these sums exceed 80.\n\n4. **Identify Relevant Games**:\n   - Note down each game's row index and calculate its sum to verify against the claim.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- **Week 1**: Result = \"l 23 - 7\", Total = 23 + 7 = 30\n- **Week 2**: Result = \"w 34 - 10\", Total = 34 + 10 = 44\n- **Week 3**: Result = \"l 9 - 7\", Total = 9 + 7 = 16\n- **Week 4**: Result = \"l 31 - 3\", Total = 31 + 3 = 34\n- **Week 5**: Result = \"w 9 - 7\", Total = 9 + 7 = 16\n- **Week 6**: Result = \"l 26 - 14\", Total = 26 + 14 = 40\n- **Week 7**: Result = \"l 40 - 28\", Total = 40 + 28 = 68\n- **Week 8**: Result = \"l 24 - 14\", Total = 24 + 14 = 38\n- **Week 9**: Result = \"w 33 - 13\", Total = 33 + 13 = 46\n- **Week 10**: Result = \"l 20 - 14\", Total = 20 + 14 = 34\n- **Week 11**: Result = \"l 28 - 20\", Total = 28 + 20 = 48\n- **Week 12**: Result = \"w 20 - 17\", Total = 20 + 17 = 37\n- **Week 13**: Result = \"l 24 - 23\", Total = 24 + 23 = 47\n- **Week 14**: Result = \"l 34 - 14\", Total = 34 + 14 = 48\n\nAfter calculating the total points for each game, we see that none of these totals exceed 80.
