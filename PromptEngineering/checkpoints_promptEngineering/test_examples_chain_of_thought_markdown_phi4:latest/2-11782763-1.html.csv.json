    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table data to see if Robert Curthose was indeed heir during the years 1082 and 1094.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries for Robert Curthose:**\n   - Look at each row in the table where \"heir\" is \"robert curthose\".\n\n2. **First Entry (1066-1077):**\n   - Status: Heir presumptive\n   - Relationship to monarch: Son\n   - Became heir: 1066\n   - Ceased to be heir: 1077\n   - Monarch: William I\n\n3. **Second Entry (1087-1088):**\n   - Status: Heir presumptive\n   - Relationship to monarch: Elder brother\n   - Became heir: 1087\n   - Ceased to be heir: 1088\n   - Monarch: William II\n\n4. **Check for Any Other Entries:**\n   - Look at the rows between these two entries (1077-1087) and any other potential entries.\n   - The row from 1077 to 1087 states \"succession unclear,\" meaning there is no specific information about Robert Curthose being an heir during this period.\n\n5. **Determine Heir Status for Specific Years:**\n   - For the year 1082, check if Robert Curthose was explicitly mentioned as an heir:\n     - The period from 1077 to 1087 is marked as \"succession unclear,\" so there's no specific data confirming he was an heir in 1082.\n   - For the year 1094, review all entries:\n     - After 1088, Robert Curthose is not mentioned again until other successors are noted. The next clear entry for another heir starts from 1100.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is no evidence in the table that Robert Curthose was an heir in 1082 or 1094.\n   - His periods as heir are clearly defined as 1066-1077 and 1087-1088, with unclear succession from 1077 to 1087.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant entries for Robert Curthose in the table.\",\n    \"First entry: Heir presumptive from 1066 to 1077 under William I.\",\n    \"Second entry: Heir presumptive from 1087 to 1088 under William II.\",\n    \"Check the period 1077-1087, marked as 'succession unclear'.\",\n    \"No specific data confirming Robert Curthose as heir in 1082 or 1094.\",\n    \"His periods as heir are clearly defined with no mention of being an heir in 1082 or 1094.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ceased to be heir\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"succession unclear\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
