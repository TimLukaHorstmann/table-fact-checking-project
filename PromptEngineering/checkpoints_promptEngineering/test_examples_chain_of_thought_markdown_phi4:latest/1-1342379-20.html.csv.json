    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about James A. Gallivan being re-elected and running unopposed in 1914 is true, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row that pertains to James A. Gallivan.\n   - According to the table, this information can be found in the row where \"incumbent\" is \"james a gallivan.\"\n\n2. **Verify Year of First Election:**\n   - The claim mentions 1914 as the year James A. Gallivan was first elected or re-elected.\n   - In the identified row for James A. Gallivan, we check the \"first elected\" column to confirm if it is indeed 1914.\n\n3. **Check Result and Candidates:**\n   - The claim states that he was re-elected and ran unopposed in 1914.\n   - We verify this by checking both the \"result\" and \"candidates\" columns for the same row:\n     - The \"result\" column should indicate \"re-elected.\"\n     - The \"candidates\" column should show that James A. Gallivan ran \"unopposed.\"\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - Row with \"incumbent\": \"james a gallivan\"\n\n- **Column Values for James A. Gallivan:**\n  - **First Elected:** 1914\n  - **Result:** re-elected\n  - **Candidates:** james a gallivan (d) unopposed\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that in 1914, James A.
