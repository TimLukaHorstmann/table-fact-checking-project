Winning games is considered good form, while losing indicates poor form.\n   - From May 7 to May 10, Chelsea had one win (against Bolton Wanderers) and one loss (against Manchester United).\n\n4. **Assess the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Chelsea's \"go form\" was from May 7 to May 10, 2005. However, during this period, they won one game and lost another.\n   - Therefore, it is not accurate to describe their performance over these two games as a consistent \"go form,\" which implies consecutive good results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim that Chelsea FC's form was good (\"go form\") from May 7, 2005, to May 10, 2005, does not hold true because they had mixed results in this period.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to two matches between May 7 and May 10, 2005.

We need to verify if there is any instance where Chelsea scored a total of fewer than 2 goals in any two-game sequence.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game's Result**:\n   - For each game, identify the number of goals Chelsea scored.\n   - Check every possible pair of consecutive games to sum their goals.\n\n3. **Calculate Consecutive Games' Goals**:\n   - Start from the first game and add the goals scored in that game with the goals scored in the next game. Move sequentially through all pairs of consecutive games.\n\n4. **Identify Minimum Sum**:\n   - Find the minimum total number of goals scored over any two-game sequence.\n   \n5. **Compare Against Claim**:\n   - If there exists a pair where the total is less than 2, then the claim is false.\n   - Otherwise, if all pairs have totals of 2 or more, the claim is true.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- Game 1 (15 Aug 2004): Chelsea scored 1 goal\n- Game 2 (21 Aug 2004): Chelsea scored 1 goal  \n  Total for Games 1 and 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 goals\n\n- Game 3 (24 Aug 2004): Chelsea scored 2 goals  \n  Total for Games 2 and 3 = 1 + 2 = 3 goals\n\n- Game 4 (28 Aug 2004): Chelsea scored 2 goals  \n  Total for Games 3 and 4 = 2 + 2 = 4 goals\n\nContinue this process for each pair of consecutive games:\n\n- Game 5 (11 Sep 2004): 0 goals  \n  Total for Games 4 and 5 = 2 + 0 = 2 goals\n\n- Game 6 (19 Sep 2004): 0 goals  \n  Total for Games 5 and 6 = 0 + 0 = 0 goals\n\nAt this point, we find a pair of consecutive games (Games 5 and 6) where Chelsea scored a total of only 0 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there is at least one sequence of two consecutive games where Chelsea FC scored fewer than 2 goals (specifically, 0 goals), the claim that the lowest number of goals in any two-game period was 2 is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The task was to determine if there was a pair of consecutive games during which Chelsea FC scored fewer than 2 total goals.
