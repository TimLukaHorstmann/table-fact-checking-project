    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the first place tie be between Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the table for information about the players' rankings and scores.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify First Place Players:**\n   - Look at the \"place\" column in the table to identify which rows correspond to first place.\n   - The rows with \"t1\" under the \"place\" column indicate a tie for first place.\n\n2. **Check Players in Tied for First Place:**\n   - The players tied for first place are:\n     - Ernie Els\n     - Colin Montgomerie\n     - Loren Roberts\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Players:**\n   - The claim states that Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo are tied for first place.\n   - Check the table to see if these players are listed under \"t1\" in the \"place\" column.\n\n4. **Verify Positions of Claimed Players:**\n   - Duffy Waldorf is listed at \"t9\".\n   - Jeff Sluman is listed at \"t9\".\n   - Frank Nobilo is listed at \"t9\".\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The players claimed to be tied for first place (Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo) are actually tied for ninth place, not first.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- First place players:\n  - Ernie Els: Row 1, Column \"player\"\n  - Colin Montgomerie: Row 2, Column \"player\"\n  - Loren Roberts: Row 3, Column \"player\"\n\n- Claimed first place players (actual position):\n  - Duffy Waldorf: Row 11, Columns \"place\" and \"player\"\n  - Jeff Sluman: Row 10, Columns \"place\" and \"player\"\n  - Frank Nobilo: Row 9, Columns \"place\" and \"player\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the players tied for first place by checking rows with 't1' in the 'place' column.
