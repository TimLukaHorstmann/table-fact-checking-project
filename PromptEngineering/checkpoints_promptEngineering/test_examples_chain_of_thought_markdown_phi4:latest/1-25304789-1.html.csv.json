    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the information provided in the table related to the claim.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \"August 10, 2010 be the US air date for the episode 'a modest proposal' and no string attach.\"\n\nLet's break this down into two parts:\n\n1. **Check if \"a modest proposal\" aired on August 10, 2010**:\n   - From the table, locate the row with the episode titled \"a modest proposal\".\n   - Row 1 indicates that \"a modest proposal\" has a US air date of \"August 3, 2010\".\n\n2. **Check if \"no strings attached\" aired on August 10, 2010**:\n   - From the table, locate the row with the episode titled \"no strings attached\".\n   - Row 2 indicates that \"no strings attached\" has a US air date of \"August 3, 2010\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states both episodes aired on August 10, 2010.\n- However, from the table:\n  - \"a modest proposal\" aired on August 3, 2010 (not August 10, 2010).\n  - \"no strings attached\" also aired on August 3, 2010 (not August 10, 2010).\n\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect based on the information provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE.
