We'll look for players in that column.\n\n2. **Filter Players by Date of Birth**: Within the list of \"cb\" players, we need to find the one whose date of birth is \"1975 - 07 - 14\".\n\n3. **Check Height Consistency**: Once we identify this player, verify if their height matches \"m (ft 4in)\" as stated in the claim.\n\nNow let's go through these steps with the table:\n\n- **Step 1: Identify all players with position \"cb\"**:\n  - tam\u00e1s varga\n  - attila v\u00e1ri\n  - barnab\u00e1s steinmetz\n\n- **Step 2: Check the date of birth for each \"cb\" player**:\n  - tam\u00e1s varga: Date of birth is \"1975 - 07 - 14\"\n  - attila v\u00e1ri: Date of birth is \"1976 - 02 - 26\"\n  - barnab\u00e1s steinmetz: Date of birth is \"1975 - 10 - 06\"\n\n- **Step 3: Confirm the height for tam\u00e1s varga**:\n  - The table shows that tam\u00e1s varga's height is \"m (ft 4in)\".\n\nAfter examining the data, we find that:\n\n- The player with position \"cb\" and date of birth \"1975 - 07 - 14\" is indeed tam\u00e1s varga.\n- This player has a height of \"m (ft 4in)\", matching the claim.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output based on our findings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified cb players and checked their dates of birth.
