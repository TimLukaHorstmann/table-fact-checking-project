    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"shrek be nominate for a tony award in 2009\" is true or false, we need to examine the table data for any relevant entries.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Year**: The claim refers to the year 2009. We will look at all rows where the \"year\" column is 2009.\n\n2. **Find Entries for \"shrek\"**:\n   - Look for any row in the table where the \"nominated work\" column contains \"shrek\".\n\n3. **Check the Award Type**: The claim specifically mentions a Tony award, so we need to ensure that one of the entries for \"shrek\" in 2009 is related to a Tony award.\n\n4. **Verify the Result**:\n   - Even though the claim states \"nominate,\" we should check the \"result\" column to confirm if it says \"nominated\".\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row Identification**: We locate rows where both conditions are met: year is 2009, and nominated work is \"shrek\".\n  \n- **Relevant Rows**:\n  - Row with index 15 (based on markdown table format):\n    - Year: 2009\n    - Award: Tony award\n    - Category: Best performance by a leading actress in a musical\n    - Nominated Work: shrek\n    - Result: nominated\n\n- **Conclusion**: The entry for \"shrek\" in the year 2009 does indeed show that it was nominated for a Tony award.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows an entry for 'shrek' in 2009, which includes a nomination for a Tony award.

From the table:\n   - The row with \"nominated work\" as \"shrek\" corresponds to the year 2009.\n  \n2. **Examine the Results for \"Shrek\" in 2009**:\n   - Check each award category for which \"shrek\" was nominated and verify if it was won or not in 2009.\n   - According to the table:\n     - **Tony Award (best performance by a leading actress in a musical)**: Result is \"nominated\".\n     - **Drama Desk Award (outstanding actress in a musical)**: Result is \"nominated\".\n     - **Drama League Award (distinguished performance)**: Result is \"nominated\".\n     - **Outer Critics Circle Award (outstanding actress in a musical)**: Result is \"won\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that Shrek's nominated work won a drama award in 2009.\n   - From our examination, only the Outer Critics Circle Award was won by \"shrek\" in 2009.\n   - However, the claim specifies winning a \"drama award\". None of the awards listed under categories for Shrek are explicitly named as \"drama award\", but they fall under musical and performance categories.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the term \"drama award\" is not specifically used in the table but rather terms related to musicals, we rely on context.\n   - The Outer Critics Circle Award is indeed won by Shrek and it's a recognized dramatic performance category (outstanding actress in a musical).\n   - Thus, based on the context provided by the categories, the claim can be considered true since an award for a dramatic performance was won.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where 'nominated work' is 'shrek', which points to the year 2009.
