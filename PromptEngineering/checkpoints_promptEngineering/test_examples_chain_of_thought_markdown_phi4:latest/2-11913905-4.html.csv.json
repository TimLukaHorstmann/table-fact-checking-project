    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the specific parts of the table related to the claim.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"the date list for the item that be undergo overhaul , restoration or repair be 1956.\"\n   - We need to identify any row where the description is \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" and check if its associated date is 1956.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Row**:\n   - Look through the table for rows with the description \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs.\"\n\n3. **Check the Date in Identified Rows**:\n   - Once identified, verify the date column of those rows to see if it matches 1956.\n\n### Analyzing the Table:\n\n- **Row Analysis**:\n  - Row 7: \n    - Description: \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\"\n    - Date: \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\"\n\n  This row has the description matching our criteria. However, its date is also listed as \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs,\" not a specific year like 1956.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- There is no row with the description \"undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs\" that has a date of 1956.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined to find any rows with the description 'undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs'. Row 7 matches this description but does not have a date of 1956. Instead, it lists 'undergoing overhaul, restoration or repairs' as its date.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"description\", \"value\": \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\", \"value\": \"undergoing overhaul , restoration or repairs\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
