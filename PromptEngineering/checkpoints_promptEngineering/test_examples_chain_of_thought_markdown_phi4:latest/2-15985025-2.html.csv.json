    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden against Diego Gonzalez is true or false, let's follow a systematic approach:\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Wins**: First, we need to identify all matches where David Bielkhedens had a win (\"res\" column = \"win\").\n\n2. **Filter by Location**: From the identified wins, filter those that took place in Stockholm, Sweden (from the \"location\" column).\n\n3. **Check Record Before and After Each Win**:\n   - For each win, check the record before the match (the \"record\" column value) and after the match.\n   - The highest record will be where the post-match record is numerically higher than any other win in Stockholm.\n\n4. **Identify Specific Match**: Check if one of these wins matches against Diego Gonzalez.\n\n5. **Determine Highest Record Win**:\n   - Compare all filtered records to determine which has the highest numerical value for a win in Stockholm.\n   - Confirm that this match is indeed against Diego Gonzalez.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1. **Find Wins**: \n   - From the table, identify rows with \"res\" = \"win\":\n     - Row 1: Diego Gonzalez (Record changes from 0-1 to 1-1)\n     - Row 9: Patrick Vallee (Record changes from 6-2 to 7-2)\n     - Row 17: Tom Haddock (Record changes from 4-1 to 5-1)\n\n2. **Filter by Location**:\n   - Only include wins in Stockholm, Sweden:\n     - Row 1: Diego Gonzalez\n     - Row 9: Patrick Vallee\n\n3. **Compare Records**:\n   - Row 1: Record before = 0-1; after = 1-1\n   - Row 9: Record before = 6-2; after = 7-2\n   - The highest record win in Stockholm is against Patrick Vallee with a post-match record of 7-2.\n\n4. **Verify Specific Match**:\n   - The match against Diego Gonzalez (Row 1) resulted in a record of 1-1, which is not the highest compared to 7-2 from Row 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that David Bielkhedens' highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Diego Gonzalez is false.

Specifically, we are interested in whether they were achieved through a unanimous decision.\n\nHere's how I will approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Winning Records**: Extract all rows from the table where David Bielkheden won his matches (both \"win\" and \"y win\").\n2. **Determine Method of Victory**: For each winning record, examine the \"method\" column to see if it states \"decision (unanimous)\".\n3. **Calculate Majority**: Count how many wins were by unanimous decision compared to all wins.\n4. **Evaluate Claim**: Determine if more than half of the victories were achieved via a unanimous decision.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Winning Records**:\n   - The following rows represent matches that David Bielkheden won:\n     - Row 3: \"win\" against Diego Gonzalez (decision (unanimous))\n     - Row 4: \"y win\" against Musa Khamanaev (tko)\n     - Row 5: \"y win\" against Josenildo Ramarho (submission)\n     - Row 6: \"x win\" against Patrick Vallee (submission)\n     - Row 7: \"x win\" against Tom Haddock (ko)\n     - Row 8: \"x win\" against Valdas Pocevi\u010dius\n     - Row 9: \"x win\" against Sigitas Antanavicius (tko)\n     - Row 10: \"x win\" against Charles McCarthy (submission)\n     - Row 11: \"x win\" against Kimmo Nurkse (submission)\n     - Row 12: \"x win\" against Joni Kyllonen\n     - Row 13: \"x win\" against Kai Rintakorpi\n\n2. **Determine Method of Victory**:\n   - Review the \"method\" column for each winning record:\n     - Only one method recorded as \"decision (unanimous)\" is in row 3.\n\n3. **Calculate Majority**:\n   - David Bielkheden has a total of 11 wins.\n   - Only 1 of these wins was by unanimous decision.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**:\n   - Since only 1 out of 11 victories were achieved by unanimous decision, this does not constitute a majority (which would require more than half).\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Total wins: 11\n- Wins by unanimous decision: 1\n- Majority condition unmet since \\( \\frac{1}{11} < 0.5 \\)\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify all winning records for David Bielkheden and determine the method of victory for each.

This involves checking the \"method\" column for entries that include \"ko\".\n\n4. **Determine Majority**: Compare the number of KO wins to half of the total wins.
