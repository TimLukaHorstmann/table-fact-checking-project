Since 3 is indeed greater than 1, this part of the claim is also true.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both parts of the claim are verified: Italy has 0 gold medals and more than 1 silver medal.\n\nGiven these steps, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Italy's row in the table (rank 6).
