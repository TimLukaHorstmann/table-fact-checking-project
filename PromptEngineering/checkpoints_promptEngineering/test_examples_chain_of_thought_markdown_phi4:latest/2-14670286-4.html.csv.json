The scores are cumulative, indicating this was indeed played at Saitama Stadium.\n   \n   - **Row 11 (Date: 8 June 2012):**\n     - Venue: \"saitama stadium 2002, saitama\"\n     - Another score entry for the same match as Row 10.\n\n   - **Row 12 (Date: 8 June 2012):**\n     - Venue: \"saitama stadium 2002, saitama\"\n     - Final score entry for the same match as Rows 10 and 11.\n   \n   - **Row 14 (Date: 4 June 2013):**\n     - Venue: \"saitama stadium 2002, saitama\"\n     - Part of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - Matches were indeed played at Saitama Stadium in both 2012 and 2013.\n   - The claim is therefore FALSE because there are multiple matches listed as being played at Saitama Stadium during these years.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that matches were played at Saitama Stadium on 3 June 2012, 8 June 2012 (multiple score entries for one match), and 4 June 2013.
