    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify bok\u0161i\u0107's League Goals**: \n   - Locate bok\u0161i\u0107's entry in the table and check the 'league' column for his number of goals.\n   - From the table: `bok\u0161i\u0107` has `8` league goals.\n\n2. **Check Other Players with 8 League Goals**:\n   - Examine all rows in the 'league' column to find other players who have scored exactly 8 goals in the league.\n   - Go through each row and compare the value under the 'league' column with `8`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of Players with 8 League Goals**:\n   - Count how many players, including bok\u0161i\u0107, have scored 8 goals in the league.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who have scored 8 league goals.\n   - Check if the total count from step 3 equals `3`.\n\nLet's go through the table:\n\n- Row for `bok\u0161i\u0107`: 'league' = 8\n- Check other rows:\n  - `whelan`: 'league' = 4\n  - `n\u00e9meth`: 'league' = 3\n  - `ince`: 'league' = 2\n  - `cooper`: 'league' = 2\n  - `queudrue`: 'league' = 2\n  - `marinelli`: 'league' = 2\n  - `mustoe`: 'league' = 2\n  - `deane`: 'league' = 1\n  - `johnston`: 'league' = 1\n  - `greening`: 'league' = 1\n  - `stockdale`: 'league' = 1\n  - `festa`: 'league' = 1\n  - `windass`: 'league' = 1\n  - `southgate`: 'league' = 1\n  - `carbone`: 'league' = 1\n  - `ehiogu`: 'league' = 1\n  - `own goals`: 'league' = 1\n  - `murphy`: 'league' = 0\n  - `wilson`: 'league' = 0\n  - `cambell`: 'league' = 0\n\nOnly `bok\u0161i\u0107` has scored 8 league goals. No other player in the table has this number.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since only one player (bok\u0161i\u0107) scored 8 league goals, bok\u0161i\u0107 cannot be one of three players who have scored 8 league goals.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify bok\u0161i\u0107's league goals from the table which are 8.
