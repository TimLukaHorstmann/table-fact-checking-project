Let's go through the relevant steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Dates**: The claim involves two specific dates: June 18 and June 28.\n\n2. **Search for June 18**:\n   - Review each row in the table to find an entry with the date \"1998 - 06 - 18\".\n   - No such entry exists in the provided table. Therefore, there is no game recorded on June 18.\n\n3. **Search for June 28**:\n   - Look through the rows again to identify an entry with the date \"1998 - 06 - 28\".\n   - The row at index 14 corresponds to this date: `| 1998 - 06 - 28 | stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens , lens , france                  | 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet ) | world cup | report   |`\n   - The score for this game is recorded as \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claimed Score**:\n   - The claim states that both games on June 18 and June 28 have a score of \"2 - 0\".\n   - Since there is no entry for June 18, we cannot verify a score of \"2 - 0\" for this date.\n   - For June 28, the recorded score is \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\", which does not match \"2 - 0\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim about both games having a score of \"2 - 0\" is false because there is no game on June 18, and the game on June 28 has a different recorded score.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was checked for entries on June 18 and June 28.
