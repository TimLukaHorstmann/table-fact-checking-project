    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tyreke Evans scored the most points on November 6 when he scored 30 points\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the data provided in the table for the game played on November 6 and compare Tyreke Evans' score with other players' scores.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim refers to the game on November 6 against Memphis.\n   - Locate the row where \"date\" is \"november 6\".

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to examine the table for details about the game on November 5 against the LA Lakers.\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Game**: The claim refers to a game played on \"November 5\". According to the table, row 5 corresponds to this date:\n   - `|      5 | november 3  | la lakers   | ... |`\n\n2. **Check Tyreke Evans' Score**: We need to check how many points Tyreke Evans scored in this game.\n   - The relevant column for the score is \"high points\". According to row 5:\n     - `| tyreke evans (21) |`\n   - This indicates that Tyreke Evans scored 21 points.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**: The claim states that Tyreke Evans scored more than 30 points on November 5.\n   - Since he actually scored only 21 points, this part of the claim is false.\n\n4. **Game Outcome Context**: Additionally, the claim describes the game as an \"epic\" one, but it doesn't specify what makes a game epic in terms of score or other factors (though overtime suggests some level of competitiveness).\n   - The game was lost by 100-112 (OT), and there is no specific indication from the table that this particular game stands out as epic beyond its overtime status.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, Tyreke Evans did not score more than 30 points in the November 5 game against the LA Lakers. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- Row 5, \"date\": November 3 (close to November 5)\n- Row 5, \"high points\": Tyreke Evans (21)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to a game on November 5.
