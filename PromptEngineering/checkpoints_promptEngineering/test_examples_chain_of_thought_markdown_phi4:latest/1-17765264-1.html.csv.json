This indicates a tied game.\n\n4. **Verify Date Mismatch**:\n   - The claim specifies the year 1980, but all dates in the table are from the year 1960.\n   - Therefore, this entire dataset is irrelevant to any event occurring in 1980.\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Claim**:\n   - Since the table pertains exclusively to games from 1960 and not 1980, it cannot be used to verify or falsify events occurring in 1980.\n   - The claim does not match the data timeframe; hence, we cannot assert anything about tied games in 1980 based on this table.\n\n6. **Final Judgment**:\n   - The claim is unrelated to the provided dataset and therefore cannot be validated as true using the information given.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table contains data for the year 1960, not 1980.
