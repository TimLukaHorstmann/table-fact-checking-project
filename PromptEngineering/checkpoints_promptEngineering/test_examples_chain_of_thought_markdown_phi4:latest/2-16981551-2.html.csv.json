    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"laurent rochette be the only opponent to be in the final more than 1 time\" is true or false, we will analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify All Opponents**:\n   - We need to list all unique opponents who appeared in finals as mentioned in the \"opponent in the final\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences for Each Opponent**:\n   - For each opponent, we will count how many times they appear in the \"opponent in the final\" column.\n\n3. **Check for Multiple Appearances**:\n   - We specifically look for opponents who appeared more than once in finals.\n\n4. **Verify Laurent Rochette's Appearance**:\n   - Confirm that Laurent Rochette appears more than once and check if he is the only one to do so.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Extract Opponents from Table**:\n  - Sasa Tuksar, Sebastian Fitz, Pavel \u0160nobel, Tres Davis, Luk\u00e1\u0161 Lacko, Talal Ouahabi, Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek, Slimane Saoudi, Frederico Gil, Younes El Aynaoui, Marc Gicquel, Reda El Amrani, Jan Mertl, Jonathan Dasni\u00e8res de Veigy, \u00c9ric Prodon, Laurent Rochette, Yannik Reuter, Mehdi Ziadi.\n\n- **Count Appearances**:\n  - Sasa Tuksar: 1\n  - Sebastian Fitz: 1\n  - Pavel \u0160nobel: 1\n  - Tres Davis: 1\n  - Luk\u00e1\u0161 Lacko: 1\n  - Talal Ouahabi: 1\n  - Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek: 1\n  - Slimane Saoudi: 1\n  - Frederico Gil: 1\n  - Younes El Aynaoui: 1\n  - Marc Gicquel: 1\n  - Reda El Amrani: 1\n  - Jan Mertl: 1\n  - Jonathan Dasni\u00e8res de Veigy: 1\n  - \u00c9ric Prodon: 2 (appearances on 31 January 2009 and 7 February 2009)\n  - Laurent Rochette: 1\n  - Yannik Reuter: 1\n  - Mehdi Ziadi: 1\n\n- **Check for Multiple Appearances**:\n  - \u00c9ric Prodon appears twice.\n  - Laurent Rochette appears once.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLaurent Rochette does not appear more than once. \u00c9ric Prodon is the opponent who appeared in finals more than once.
