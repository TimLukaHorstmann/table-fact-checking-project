There are two instances of June 16 listed in the table: one in 2000 and another in 2010.\n\n2. **Check Entries for Jeff Gordon**:\n   - Look through each row corresponding to the date \"June 16\" to see if Jeff Gordon is mentioned.\n   \n3. **Verify Team Association**:\n   - For any entry where Jeff Gordon is found, check if he was part of Hendrick Motorsports.\n\n4. **Compile Relevant Information**:\n   - Record details from the relevant entries to support our conclusion.\n\nLet's go through each step with the table data:\n\n- **Row 2000 (June 19)**: This row does not match the date we are interested in.\n- **Row 2010 (June 6)**: This is also not June 16, so it can be ignored for this claim.\n- **Row 2007 (June 10)**: Again, not relevant due to the mismatched date.\n- **Row 2011 (June 12)**: Not the required date.\n- **Row 2005 (June 12)**: Another irrelevant date.\n- **Row 2006 (June 11)**: Does not match June 16.\n- **Row 2009 (June 7)**: Irrelevant due to wrong date.\n- **Row 2008 (June 8)**: Not the date we're looking for.\n- **Row 2012 (June 10)**: Again, irrelevant.\n- **Row 2004 (June 13)**: Mismatched date.\n- **Row 2003 (June 8)**: Incorrect date.\n- **Row 2002 (June 9)**: Not June 16.\n- **Row 2001 (June 17)**: Wrong date for this claim.\n- **Row 1999 (June 20)**: Date mismatch.\n- **Row 1998 (June 21)**: Incorrect date.\n- **Row 1997 (June 21)**: Not applicable.\n- **Row 2000 (June 19)**: Already checked, not the relevant date.\n- **Row 2005 (June 12)**: Already noted as incorrect for June 16.\n- **Row 2010 (June 6)**: Already dismissed due to the wrong date.\n\nAfter reviewing all the entries:\n\n- **Row 2001 (June 17) is irrelevant**.\n- **Row 2002 (June 9) is irrelevant**.\n- **Row 2010 (June 19) and 2005 (June 12)** are both not June 16, so they are not relevant.\n\nFinally, the only entry that matches \"June 16\" in our data:\n\n- **Row 2000**: This row has Jeff Gordon listed with Hendrick Motorsports on June 16, 2000.
