    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"player in the 1937 master tournament have to play 4 rounds\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure:**\n   - The table contains columns for `place`, `player`, `country`, `score`, `to par`, and `money`.\n   - Each row represents a player's performance in a tournament, presumably the 1937 Master's Tournament based on the context.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to check if each player played four rounds as indicated by their scores.\n   - The `score` column provides individual round scores for each player summed up into a total score.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Score Column:**\n   - Each entry in the `score` column shows four numbers separated by plus signs, representing the scores from four different rounds (e.g., \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70\").\n   - The sum of these four round scores is also provided after an equals sign.\n\n4. **Verifying Consistency Across All Players:**\n   - For Byron Nelson: Score = \"66 + 72 + 75 + 70 = 283\"\n     - Four rounds are evident from the score breakdown.\n   - Repeat this verification for each player in the table:\n     - Ralph Guldahl: \"69 + 72 + 68 + 76 = 285\"\n     - Ed Dudley: \"70 + 71 + 71 + 74 = 286\"\n     - Harry Cooper: \"73 + 69 + 71 + 74 = 287\"\n     - Ky Laffoon: \"73 + 70 + 74 + 73 = 290\"\n     - Jimmy Thomson: \"71 + 73 + 74 + 73 = 291\"\n     - Al Watrous: \"74 + 72 + 71 + 75 = 292\"\n     - Tommy Armour: \"73 + 75 + 73 + 72 = 293\"\n     - Vic Ghezzi: \"72 + 72 + 72 + 77 = 293\"\n     - Leonard Dodson: \"71 + 75 + 71 + 77 = 294\"\n     - Jimmy Hines: \"77 + 72 + 68 + 77 = 294\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Every player listed in the table has scores from four rounds.\n   - Therefore, it is consistent with the claim that players had to play four rounds.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each row in the 'score' column shows scores for four rounds.
