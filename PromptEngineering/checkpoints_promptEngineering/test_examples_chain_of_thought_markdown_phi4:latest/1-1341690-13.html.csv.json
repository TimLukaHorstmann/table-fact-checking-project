Young, who belongs to the Republican party.\n   \n4. **Check Election Year and Status**:\n   - Sidney R. Yates is listed under \"illinois 9\", not \"illinois 10\". \n   - For \"Illinois 9\":\n     - `district`: \"illinois 9\"\n     - `incumbent`: \"sidney r yates\"\n     - `party`: \"democratic\"\n     - `first elected`: \"1964\"\n     - `result`: \"re-elected\"\n     - `candidates`: \"sidney r yates (d) unopposed\"\n\n5. **Verify Party Affiliation**:\n   - Sidney R. Yates is affiliated with the Democratic party, not the Republican party.\n\n6. **Cross-verify Election Year**:\n   - The year 1964 matches with the first election of Sidney R. Yates for \"illinois 9\", but this does not match \"illinois 10\".\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Sidney R. Yates was elected as an incumbent in 1964, but he was from the Democratic party and represented Illinois 9, not Illinois 10.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Sidney R. Yates was a Democrat representing Illinois 9 in 1964, not a Republican for Illinois 10.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows: 'illinois 10' and 'illinois 9'.
