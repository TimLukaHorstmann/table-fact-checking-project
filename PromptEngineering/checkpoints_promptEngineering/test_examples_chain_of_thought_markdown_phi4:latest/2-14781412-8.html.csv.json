    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify if the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different every year except 1994 and 1998.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the \"gold\" column of the table because it lists the gold medalists.\n   \n2. **List Gold Medalists by Year:**\n   - 1982: nadia al - moutawaa\n   - 1986: takashi tomura\n   - 1994: konoshin kuwahara\n   - 1998: jin kanno\n   - 2002: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski\n   - 2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi\n   - 2010: ramzy al duhami\n\n3. **Check for Repeated Gold Medalists:**\n   - Compare the names in the \"gold\" column to see if any name repeats.\n   - The gold medalists are all distinct from each other except for the years mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Exception Years (1994 and 1998):**\n   - Check if there is a repeat between 1994 and 1998.\n   - 1994: konoshin kuwahara\n   - 1998: jin kanno\n   - These are different, so the claim about these years having the same gold medalist does not apply.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since all gold medalists are distinct every year and there is no repetition in 1994 and 1998, the claim that they were the same in those two years is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The gold medalists for each year from 1982 to 2010 are all different.
