All rows in this table have this date, so we need to check each row individually.\n\n3. **Check Each Row for Home and Away Teams**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home Team: St Kilda\n     - Away Team: South Melbourne\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Home Team: Essendon\n     - Away Team: Fitzroy\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Home Team: Collingwood\n     - Away Team: North Melbourne\n\n4. **Identify the Relevant Row**: From step 3, we see that in row 3, the home team is Collingwood and the away team is North Melbourne.\n\n5. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim matches exactly with the information in row 3.\n   - Home Team: Collingwood\n   - Away Team: North Melbourne\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the data from row 3 matches the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Row 3 has the relevant cells for this verification:\n     - \"home team\" column with value \"collingwood\"\n     - \"away team\" column with value \"north melbourne\"\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that on August 13th, 1966, North Melbourne was the away team while Collingwood was the home team.
