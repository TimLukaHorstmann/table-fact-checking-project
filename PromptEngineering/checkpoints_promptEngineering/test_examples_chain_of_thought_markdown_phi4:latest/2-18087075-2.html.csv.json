According to the table, these are the entries with \"winner\" under the \"outcome\" column:\n   - Row 5: Date is 26 July 2010, Tournament in Granby, Canada.\n   - Row 6: Date is 11 October 2010, Tournament in Tiburon, US.\n   - Row 7: Date is 13 November 2011, Tournament in Loughborough, UK.\n   - Row 8: Date is 16 September 2012, Tournament in P\u00e9tange, Luxembourg.\n\n2. **Check the First Win**: The claim specifically mentions his first win and its location. We need to identify when his first win occurred and where it took place.\n   - His first recorded win in this table is on 26 July 2010 in Granby, Canada (Row 5).\n\n3. **Verify Claim**: The claim states that Kamke didn't win until he played in Canada. Since his first win according to the table was indeed in Canada, the claim aligns with the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the table, Tobias Kamke's first recorded win occurred during a match in Canada, which supports the truth of the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5 (First Win): \n  - \"outcome\": \"winner\"\n  - \"date\": \"26 july 2010\"\n  - \"tournament\": \"granby , canada\"\n  - \"surface\": \"hard\"\n  - \"opponent\": \"milos raonic\"\n  - \"score\": \"6 - 3 , 7 - 6 (7 - 4)\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows Tobias Kamke's match outcomes.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the table for information regarding Kamke's performances related to Germany.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Germany have proved good for Kamke's winning record.\" This implies that in tournaments held in Germany, Kamke has a positive or winning record (i.e., more wins than losses).\n\n2. **Identifying German Tournaments in the Table:**\n   - We need to identify all entries where the tournament is located in Germany.\n   - From the table:\n     - 26 May 2008: Tournament in Karlsruhe, Germany\n     - 31 May 2010: Tournament in F\u00fcrth, Germany\n\n3. **Analyzing Outcomes for German Tournaments:**\n   - For each identified German tournament, check Kamke's performance outcome.\n   - **26 May 2008 (Karlsruhe, Germany):** Outcome is \"runner-up\" against Teymuraz Gabashvili with a score of 1-6, 4-6. This indicates a loss.\n   - **31 May 2010 (F\u00fcrth, Germany):** Outcome is \"runner-up\" against Robin Haase with a score of 4-6, 2-6. This also indicates a loss.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Winning Record in Germany:**\n   - Kamke participated in two tournaments in Germany and lost both times.\n   - Therefore, his winning record in Germany is 0 wins out of 2 attempts (a win-loss ratio of 0).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Kamke did not have any victories in the German tournaments listed in the table, it cannot be said that \"Germany have proved good for Kamke's winning record.\"\n   - The claim is false based on the available data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified two German tournaments where Kamke participated.
