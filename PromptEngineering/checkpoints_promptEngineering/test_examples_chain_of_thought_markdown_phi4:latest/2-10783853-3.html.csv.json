We'll look for this match in the table.\n\n2. **Find Essendon's Game**:\n   - Locate the row where the home team is Essendon.\n   - Row index: 1\n   - Home team score: 9.14 (68)\n   - Away team: Melbourne\n   - Away team score: 9.9 (63)\n\n3. **Match Scores with Claim**:\n   - The table shows Essendon scored 9.14 (68) and Melbourne scored 9.9 (63).\n   - The claim states the scores were \"9.9 (63) to 9.13 (67)\".\n\n4. **Check for Score Accuracy**:\n   - The actual score from the table is 9.14 (68) to 9.9 (63), not 9.13 (67).\n\n5. **Determine Point Difference**:\n   - The point difference in the table is 5 points (68 - 63).\n   - The claim states a 4-point loss.\n\n6. **Verify Game Order**:\n   - The claim refers to this as the \"second close game of the season.\"\n   - We need to check if there was another close game before this one.\n   - First row: Fitzroy vs. St Kilda, scores are 9.13 (67) to 11.11 (77), a difference of 10 points.\n   - Second row: Essendon vs. Melbourne, scores are 9.14 (68) to 9.9 (63), a difference of 5 points.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The game between Essendon and Melbourne is indeed the second close game (5-point difference).\n   - However, the claim about the score being \"9.13 (67) to 9.9 (63)\" and the point difference being 4 is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the Essendon vs. Melbourne game in the table.
