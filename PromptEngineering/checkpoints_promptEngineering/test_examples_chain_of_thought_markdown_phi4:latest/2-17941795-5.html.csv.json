    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about locomotives of class \"r 4 / 4\" is true, we need to examine the table entries for this specific class and evaluate two conditions: the type must be \"c n2t\" and the numbers must all be greater than 4000.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Rows for Class \"r 4 / 4\":**\n   - We search the table for rows where the \"class\" column is labeled \"r 4 / 4\". There are two such entries in the table.\n\n2. **Examine the First Row for Class \"r 4 / 4\":**\n   - The first row with class \"r 4 / 4\" has:\n     - Numbers: 4151 - 4183\n     - Type: d n2t\n\n3. **Check Conditions for the First Row:**\n   - Check if the type is \"c n2t\". In this case, it is \"d n2t\", which does not satisfy the condition.\n   - Check if all numbers are greater than 4000. The range 4151 - 4183 meets this requirement, but since the type condition fails, this row does not fulfill both criteria.\n\n4. **Examine the Second Row for Class \"r 4 / 4\":**\n   - The second row with class \"r 4 / 4\" has:\n     - Numbers: 4184 - 4192\n     - Type: d n2t\n\n5. **Check Conditions for the Second Row:**\n   - Check if the type is \"c n2t\". Again, it is \"d n2t\", which does not satisfy the condition.\n   - Check if all numbers are greater than 4000. The range 4184 - 4192 meets this requirement, but since the type condition fails, this row also does not fulfill both criteria.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Neither of the two rows for class \"r 4 / 4\" have a type of \"c n2t\". Therefore, the claim is false because the type condition is not met in either case.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified both entries for class 'r 4 / 4'.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Class `d iv`:**\n   - Locate the row in the table where the \"class\" column indicates `d iv`.\n   - For this row, note down the value in the \"quantity\" column.\n\n2. **Identify Class `d v`:**\n   - Similarly, locate the row where the \"class\" column is `d v`.\n   - Note down the corresponding \"quantity\" value for this class.\n\n3. **Compare Quantities:**\n   - Compare the quantities from both classes to see if they are equal.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- For class `d iv`:\n  - The row with \"class\" as `d iv` shows a \"quantity\" of 132.\n  \n- For class `d v`:\n  - The row with \"class\" as `d v` shows a \"quantity\" of 10.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The quantity for class `d iv` is 132, while for class `d v`, it is 10.
