Observing the last five games in the table, we see:\n     - Wins: Games 29, 30, 31, and 33\n     - Loss: Game 32\n\n5. **Verify Claim Against Recent Outcomes:**\n   - The claim states \"4 wins and only 1 loss,\" which matches exactly with the outcomes of games 29 to 33.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the team has indeed had 4 wins and 1 loss in the sequence of these recent games.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Rows containing game results (rows 29 to 33) and their respective record columns provide relevant information for this assessment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states 'the owl have 4 win and only 1 loss'.
