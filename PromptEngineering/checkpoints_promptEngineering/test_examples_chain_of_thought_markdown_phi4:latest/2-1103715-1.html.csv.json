    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about game 4 having the shortest time of just under 3 hours on October 23 is true, let's examine the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"time\" column for all games listed in the table.\n   \n2. **Extract Time Data:**\n   - Game 1 (October 19): Time = 3:44\n   - Game 2 (October 20): Time = 3:57\n   - Game 3 (October 22): Time = 3:37\n   - Game 4 (October 23): Time = 3:02\n   - Game 5 (October 24): Time = 3:53\n   - Game 6 (October 26): Time = 3:48\n   - Game 7 (October 27): Time = 3:16\n\n3. **Convert Times to Minutes for Comparison:**\n   - Game 1: 3 hours and 44 minutes = 224 minutes\n   - Game 2: 3 hours and 57 minutes = 237 minutes\n   - Game 3: 3 hours and 37 minutes = 217 minutes\n   - Game 4: 3 hours and 2 minutes = 182 minutes\n   - Game 5: 3 hours and 53 minutes = 233 minutes\n   - Game 6: 3 hours and 48 minutes = 228 minutes\n   - Game 7: 3 hours and 16 minutes = 196 minutes\n\n4. **Determine the Shortest Time:**\n   - Comparing all times, Game 4 has the shortest duration at 182 minutes.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that game 4 had the \"shortest time of just under 3 hours\" on October 23.\n   - 182 minutes is indeed less than 3 hours (which would be 180 minutes), so it is accurate to describe this as \"just under 3 hours.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim accurately describes game 4's duration and date.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
