    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Lambayeque's change in percentage of the country's population since 1993 is true, we need to closely examine the data provided in the table for the relevant row.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim concerns the \"lambayeque\" region. We locate this entry in the table by finding the corresponding row with \"lambayeque\" in the first column.\n   \n2. **Locate the Column of Interest:**\n   - The specific data point we are interested in is the \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\". This column provides information about how much the percentage of the country's total population attributable to each region has changed since 1993.\n\n3. **Extract the Relevant Data:**\n   - For the \"lambayeque\" row, we need to look at the value in the \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\" column.\n   - The table shows that for Lambayeque, this value is listed as `0.0`.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states: \"Lambayeque region has a 0.0 change in % of the country's population since 1993.\"\n   - This matches exactly with what we have extracted from the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the value in the relevant column for Lambayeque is indeed `0.0`, the claim is consistent with the data provided.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- We identify the relevant cells that were considered to determine the truth of this claim:\n  - Row for \"lambayeque\" (row index: 15)\n  - Column: \"change in % of countrys population since 1993\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row corresponding to 'lambayeque' and check the column 'change in % of countrys population since 1993'.
