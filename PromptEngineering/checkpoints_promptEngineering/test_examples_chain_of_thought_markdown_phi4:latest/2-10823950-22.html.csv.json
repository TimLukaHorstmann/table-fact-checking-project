    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to verify if there's a match between the home team score specified (15.20 or 110) and the venue listed as \"lake oval\". Here\u2019s how I approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: \n   - The columns involved in verifying this claim are: \"home team\", \"home team score\", and \"venue\".\n\n2. **Review Each Row**:\n   - We will examine each row to see if the home team scored 15.20 (110) and whether the venue for that game was \"lake oval\".\n\n3. **Check Each Entry**:\n   - **Row 1**: Home Team: hawthorn, Home Team Score: 15.20 (110), Venue: princes park\n     - The score matches but the venue does not.\n   - **Row 2**: Home Team: collingwood, Home Team Score: 4.9 (33), Venue: victoria park\n     - Neither the score nor the venue matches.\n   - **Row 3**: Home Team: south melbourne, Home Team Score: 10.14 (74), Venue: lake oval\n     - The venue is \"lake oval\" but the score does not match.\n   - **Row 4**: Home Team: st kilda, Home Team Score: 12.15 (87), Venue: moorabbin oval\n     - Neither the score nor the venue matches.\n   - **Row 5**: Home Team: richmond, Home Team Score: 5.10 (40), Venue: mcg\n     - Neither the score nor the venue matches.\n   - **Row 6**: Home Team: geelong, Home Team Score: 7.13 (55), Venue: vfl park\n     - Neither the score nor the venue matches.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - No row has both a home team score of 15.20 (110) and \"lake oval\" as the venue.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is false. The relevant cells related to the scoring and venues are those checked during each step but none satisfy both conditions simultaneously.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was reviewed row by row checking if there's a match between the home team score of 15.20 (110) and the venue 'lake oval'.
