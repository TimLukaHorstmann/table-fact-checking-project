    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in 3 races in 1982\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for entries related to the year 1982 and check if Marc Surer participated in those races, along with ensuring that he scored the same number of points in all three.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Entries for the Year 1982:**\n   - From the table, we identify two entries for the year 1982:\n     - Row 6: `arrows racing team` with `chassis arrows a4`, `engine cosworth v8`, and `points 3`.\n     - Row 7: `arrows racing team` with `chassis arrows a5`, `engine cosworth v8`, and `points 3`.\n\n2. **Check for Marc Surer's Participation:**\n   - The table does not provide explicit information about the drivers associated with each entry, such as Marc Surer.\n   - Without additional data linking Marc Surer to these entries, we cannot definitively say he participated in these races.\n\n3. **Evaluate Points Consistency:**\n   - Both identified rows for 1982 have `points` equal to `3`.\n   - If Marc Surer did participate in both races, he would indeed score the same amount of points (3) in each race.\n\n4. **Count the Number of Races:**\n   - There are only two entries for 1982, not three.\n   - The claim specifies \"3 races,\" but we only have data for two races in 1982.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Available Data:**\n   - Since there is no explicit information about Marc Surer's participation and only two races with the same points are listed for 1982, the claim cannot be verified as true based solely on the table.\n   - The absence of a third race in 1982 further invalidates the claim.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is false due to insufficient data linking Marc Surer to the races and the lack of three races with consistent points in 1982.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify entries for the year 1982: Two rows (6 and 7) have points = 3.\",\n    \"Check for Marc Surer's participation: No explicit driver information is provided in the table.\",\n    \"Evaluate points consistency: Both races have the same points, but only two races exist.\",\n    \"Count the number of races: Only two races are listed for 1982, not three as claimed.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim cannot be verified as true due to lack of driver data and insufficient number of races.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points in his 4 races in 1982\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - We are interested in the year 1982 since the claim pertains to this specific year.\n   - We need to locate all entries from the table that correspond to the year 1982.\n\n2. **Extract Data for 1982:**\n   - From the table, the following rows pertain to the year 1982:\n     - Row 6: arrows racing team | arrows a4 | cosworth v8 | 3 points\n     - Row 7: arrows racing team | arrows a5 | cosworth v8 | 3 points\n\n3. **Determine Entrant's Association with Marc Surer:**\n   - The claim involves Marc Surer, so we need to verify if he was associated with the entries in 1982.\n   - Historical data (not provided in the table) indicates that Marc Surer did indeed race for Arrows Racing Team in 1982.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Points for Marc Surer:**\n   - Since both races in 1982 were conducted by Arrows Racing Team, and assuming Marc Surer participated in both:\n     - Add the points from both rows: 3 (from Row 6) + 3 (from Row 7) = 6 points.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Points:**\n   - The claim states that Marc Surer scored a total of 9 points.\n   - Our calculation shows he scored 6 points in the two races listed for Arrows Racing Team in 1982.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table and historical context, Marc Surer did not score 9 points in his 4 races in 1982; he scored only 6 points from the entries listed.\n   - The claim is therefore false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified all entries for the year 1982.
