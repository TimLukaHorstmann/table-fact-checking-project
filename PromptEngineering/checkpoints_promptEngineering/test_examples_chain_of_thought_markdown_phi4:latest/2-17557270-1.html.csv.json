This information is directly related to when these companies (or their respective classes) were active or formed for these specific locomotives.\n\n2. **Examine each row in the table:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Owner: sct logistics\n     - Built: 2007 - 2008\n     - Since this range ends in 2008, it does not violate the claim.\n   \n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Owner: downer rail\n     - Built: 2009\n     - This indicates that a class was built in 2009, which is after 2008.
