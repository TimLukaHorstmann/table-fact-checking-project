However, based on the episode numbers (196-214), it's reasonable to assume these represent a continuous span of episodes, likely within one or two seasons.\n   - Production codes starting with \"3x\" suggest this is Season 10.\n\n2. **Count Episodes for Each Writer(s)**:\n   - Look through each row in the table and count how many times each writer(s) appears in the \"written by\" column.\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson have the most written credits with 2 episodes, specifically mentioning \"Shield.\"\n   - Verify if any other pair or individual has more credits than them.\n\n4. **Tally Credits for Each Writer(s)**:\n   - Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson: \n     - Episode 196 (\"Lazarus\")\n     - Episode 202 (\"Ambush\")\n     - Episode 213 (\"Beacon\")\n   - Total: 3 episodes\n\n5. **Verify Other Writers**:\n   - Anne Coffell Saunders:\n     - Episodes 198 (\"Supergirl\") and 210 (\"Fortune\")\n     - Total: 2 episodes\n   - Brian Peterson & Kelly Souders:\n     - Episodes 199 (\"Homecoming\") and 217 (\"Kent\")\n     - Total: 2 episodes\n   - Genevieve Sparling:\n     - Episodes 200 (\"Isis\") and 211 (\"Icarus\")\n     - Total: 2 episodes\n   - Al Septien & Turi Meyer:\n     - Episodes 201 (\"Harvest\") and 216 (\"Scion\")\n     - Total: 2 episodes\n   - Jordan Hawley:\n     - Episodes 197 (\"Shield\") and 212 (\"Collateral\")\n     - Total: 2 episodes\n   - Drew Landis & Julia Swift:\n     - Episode 208 (\"Abandoned\")\n     - Total: 1 episode\n   - Bryan Q.
