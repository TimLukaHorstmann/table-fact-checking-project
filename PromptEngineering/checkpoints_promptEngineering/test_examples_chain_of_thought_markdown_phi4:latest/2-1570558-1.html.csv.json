    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Sherdrick's completions in 2004 compared to 2007 is true or false, we need to examine the specific data points for those years from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data for each year:**\n   - For the year 2004:\n     - Look at the \"comp\" (completions) column to find Sherdrick's completions.\n     - According to the table, in 2004, Sherdrick has 348 completions.\n\n2. **Identify the relevant data for each year:**\n   - For the year 2007:\n     - Again, look at the \"comp\" (completions) column.\n     - According to the table, in 2007, Sherdrick has 315 completions.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in completions between 2004 and 2007:**\n   - Subtract the number of completions in 2007 from the number in 2004:\n     \\[\n     348 \\, (\\text{completions in 2004}) - 315 \\, (\\text{completions in 2007}) = 33\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare the calculated difference to the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Sherdrick had 37 more completions in 2004 than in 2007.\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of 33 completions.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual difference (33) is not equal to the claimed difference (37), the statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For 2004, the relevant cell is at row index 11 in the \"comp\" column.\n- For 2007, the relevant cell is at row index 14 in the \"comp\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Sherdrick's completions for 2004 and 2007 from the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truth of the claim, we need to compare Sherdrick's completion percentage in 2003 with his career total completion percentage.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Completion Percentage for 2003**:\n   - From the table, find the row corresponding to the year 2003.\n   - The \"comp%\" column shows that in 2003, Sherdrick had a completion percentage of 67.1%.\n\n2. **Identify Career Total Completion Percentage**:\n   - Look at the last row labeled \"career statistics\".\n   - In this row, the \"comp%\" column indicates his career total completion percentage is 61.8%.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Completion Percentages**:\n   - Subtract the career total completion percentage from the 2003 completion percentage: \n     \\[\n     67.1\\% - 61.8\\% = 5.3\\%\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Difference**:\n   - The claim states that in 2003, Sherdrick had a completion percentage that was 3.1% higher than his career total.\n   - We calculated the difference to be 5.3%, which is indeed greater than 3.1%.\n\n5. **Determine if the Claim is True**:\n   - Since the actual difference (5.3%) is greater than the claimed difference (3.1%), the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Year 2003, \"comp%\" column: 67.1%\n- Career statistics row, \"comp%\" column: 61.8%\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"In 2003, Sherdrick had a completion percentage of 67.1%.
