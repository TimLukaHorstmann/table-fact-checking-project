    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check each part for the seasons 1977, 1978, and 1989 against the conditions specified: less than 26 points, more than 18 games, and exactly 13 losses.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Season 1977:**\n   - Points: According to the table, the coquitlam adanacs have 22 points in 1977.\n     - Check: Less than 26? Yes (22 < 26).\n   - Games: They played 24 games.\n     - Check: More than 18? Yes (24 > 18).\n   - Losses: They had 13 losses.\n     - Check: Exactly 13? Yes.\n\n2. **Season 1978:**\n   - Points: According to the table, the coquitlam adanacs have 21 points in 1978.\n     - Check: Less than 26? Yes (21 < 26).\n   - Games: They played 24 games.\n     - Check: More than 18? Yes (24 > 18).\n   - Losses: They had 13 losses.\n     - Check: Exactly 13? Yes.\n\n3. **Season 1989:**\n   - Points: According to the table, the coquitlam adanacs have 22 points in 1989.\n     - Check: Less than 26? Yes (22 < 26).\n   - Games: They played 24 games.\n     - Check: More than 18? Yes (24 > 18).\n   - Losses: They had 13 losses.\n     - Check: Exactly 13?
