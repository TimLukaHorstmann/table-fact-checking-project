    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for information about David Frost's country of origin.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate David Frost in the Table:**\n   - In the table, identify the row where David Frost is listed as a player.\n   - By examining the \"player\" column, find that David Frost appears on the third row with `t2` next to it.\n\n2. **Check the Country Column for David Frost:**\n   - In the same row (third row), look at the \"country\" column to see which country is associated with David Frost.\n   - The table shows that David Frost's country is listed as \"south africa.\"\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that David Frost is from the United States.\n   - According to the table, David Frost is from South Africa, not the United States.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the information in the table contradicts the claim, we conclude that the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 3, \"player\" column: Contains \"David Frost.\"\n- Row 3, \"country\" column: Contains \"south africa.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
