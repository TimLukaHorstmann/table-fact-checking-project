    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Northern Ireland having as many individual winners as the United States is true, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"individual winners\" column for both Northern Ireland and the United States.\n\n2. **Locate Values in Table**:\n   - For Northern Ireland, find the row corresponding to this nation and look at the value under \"individual winners\".\n   - For the United States, do the same by finding its row and looking at the value under \"individual winners\".\n\n3. **Compare the Values**: Check if the number of individual winners for Northern Ireland is equal to that of the United States.\n\n4. **Determine Truth Value**: If both values are the same, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Locate Values**:\n   - From the table, the row for Northern Ireland shows an \"individual winners\" count of 1.\n   - The row for the United States shows an \"individual winners\" count of 12.\n\n2. **Comparison**:\n   - Northern Ireland: 1 individual winner\n   - United States: 12 individual winners\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 1 is not equal to 12, the claim that \"Northern Ireland have as many individual winners as the United States do\" is FALSE.\n\n4. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - Northern Ireland's \"individual winners\": Row index corresponding to Northern Ireland, column \"individual winners\".\n   - United States' \"individual winners\": Row index corresponding to United States, column \"individual winners\".\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
