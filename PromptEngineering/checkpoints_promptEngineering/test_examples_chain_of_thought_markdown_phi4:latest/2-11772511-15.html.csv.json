From the table, we see:\n     - Row 1 has \"player\" as \"brandon sutter\".\n\n3. **Verify Position Information:**\n   - Check the \"position\" column for row 1.\n   - The cell in row 1 under \"position\" is \"c / w\".\n   - This matches part of the claim, confirming that his position can be either \"c\" or \"w\".\n\n4. **Verify Round Information:**\n   - Check the \"round\" column for row 1.\n   - The cell in row 1 under \"round\" is \"1\".\n   - This confirms that Brandon Sutter was drafted in round 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both components of the claim (position and round) are verified as true based on the table data.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1, Column \"player\": \"brandon sutter\"\n- Row 1, Column \"position\": \"c / w\"\n- Row 1, Column \"round\": \"1\"\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Brandon Sutter has a position as either 'c' or 'w' and was drafted in round 1.

We must locate his row in the table.\n   - From the table, Brett Bellemore is mentioned in row 6.\n\n2. **Locate the Nationality Column**:\n   - For each player, the nationality is provided in the \"nationality\" column.\n\n3. **Check Brett Bellemore's Nationality**:\n   - In row 6, under the \"nationality\" column, the entry is \"canada.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Brett Bellemore is from Canada.\n   - Since the table confirms that his nationality is indeed \"canada,\" the claim aligns with the information provided.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the data, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 6, Column \"nationality\": This cell contains the value \"canada,\" which directly supports the claim.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Brett Bellemore in row 6.

From the table, locate the row where the \"round\" column has the value of 3.\n   - Row 3 corresponds to \"drayson bowman\" in round 3.\n\n2. **Check the position for round 3**: Examine the \"position\" column for the identified row (row 3) to see if it matches \"lw\".\n   - In row 3, under the \"position\" column, the value is \"c / rw\".\n\n3. **Compare with the claim**: The claim states that the position should be \"lw\".
