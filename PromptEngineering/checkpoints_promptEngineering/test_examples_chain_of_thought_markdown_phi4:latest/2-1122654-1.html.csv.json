    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"March - Ford be 1 of 2 constructor to feature 3 driver\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table and identify how many drivers used each constructor combination.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Constructors:**\n   - We are interested in the column labeled \"constructor\" which lists combinations like \"March - Ford\", \"Shadow - Ford\", etc.\n  \n2. **Count Drivers per Constructor:**\n   - We need to count how many different drivers (rows) each constructor appears with.\n\n3. **Focus on March - Ford:**\n   - First, locate all entries where the constructor is \"March - Ford\".\n   - Count the number of unique driver entries for this constructor.\n   \n4. **Check Other Constructors:**\n   - Repeat the counting process for other constructors to see if any have exactly 3 drivers.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"March - Ford\" should be one of two constructors with exactly three drivers. Verify if there are indeed exactly two such constructors.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **March - Ford Entries:**\n  - Hans-Joachim Stuck (Row 4)\n  - Lella Lombardi (Row 13)\n  - Vittorio Brambilla (Row 15)\n\n  Total unique drivers for \"March - Ford\" = 3\n\n- **Check Other Constructors:**\n\n  - **Shadow - Ford Entries:**\n    - Tom Pryce (Row 3)\n    - Jean-Pierre Jarier (Row 14)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **Tyrrell - Ford Entries:**\n    - Patrick Depailler (Row 2)\n    - Jody Scheckter (Row 5)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **Ferrari Entries:**\n    - Niki Lauda (Row 1)\n    - Clay Regazzoni (Row 6)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **McLaren - Ford Entries:**\n    - Jochen Mass (Row 6)\n    - James Hunt (Row 14)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **Wolf - Williams - Ford Entries:**\n    - Jacky Ickx (Row 8)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 1\n\n  - **Williams - Ford Entries:**\n    - Renzo Zorzi (Row 9)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 1\n\n  - **Brabham - Alfa Romeo Entries:**\n    - Carlos Pace (Row 10)\n    - Carlos Reutemann (Row 12)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **Fittipaldi - Ford Entries:**\n    - Ingo Hoffmann (Row 11)\n    - Emerson Fittipaldi (Row 13)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **Ligier - Matra Entries:**\n    - Jacques Laffite (Row 16)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 1\n\n  - **Lotus - Ford Entries:**\n    - Ronnie Peterson (Row 17)\n    - Mario Andretti (Row 18)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 2\n\n  - **Penske - Ford Entries:**\n    - John Watson (Row 20)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 1\n\n  - **BRM Entries:**\n    - Ian Ashley (Row 21)\n\n    Total unique drivers = 1\n\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - Only \"March - Ford\" has exactly three drivers.\n  - No other constructor has exactly three drivers.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Counted the number of unique drivers for each constructor.
