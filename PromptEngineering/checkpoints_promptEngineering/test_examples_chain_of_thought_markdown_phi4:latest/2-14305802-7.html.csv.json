    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the opponent that play on March 28 be the colorado rockies\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: \n   - We are interested in the columns `march` and `opponent`, as they will help us determine which team played on March 28.\n\n2. **Locate March 28**:\n   - Look for the row where the value in the `march` column is 28. This corresponds to the game number in that row.\n\n3. **Check the Opponent on March 28**:\n   - Once we identify the row with `march` as 28, check the `opponent` column in that same row to see which team played against the subject of the table.\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim**:\n   - Compare the opponent found in step 3 with \"colorado rockies\" as stated in the claim.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **Row 14**: The game number is 74, `march` is 28, and `opponent` is \"colorado rockies\".\n\nSince the opponent listed for March 28 is indeed \"colorado rockies\", the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row where 'march' equals 28. This corresponds to game number 74. In this row, check the 'opponent' column which lists 'colorado rockies'.
