We need to infer based on the available data.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Boyan Yordanov:**\n  - From the table:\n    - Name: Boyan Yordanov\n    - 2008 Club: Olympiacos\n\n- **Krasimir Gaydarski:**\n  - From the table:\n    - Name: Krasimir Gaydarski\n    - 2008 Club: Olympiacos\n\nBoth players are listed as being with Olympiacos in 2008. The claim is about them playing for Olympiacos in 2009, but since we only have data for 2008 and both were part of Olympiacos then, it's reasonable to infer that they could still be there in 2009 unless additional information suggests otherwise.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the table, both players were with Olympiacos in 2008. Without further information contradicting their association with Olympiacos in 2009, we assume the claim is likely true based on continuity of club membership from 2008 to 2009.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that both Boyan Yordanov and Krasimir Gaydarski were with Olympiacos in 2008.
