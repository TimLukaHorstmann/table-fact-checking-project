    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all players who have won 5 legs have a 3-dart average of 95.39 or more\" is true, we need to analyze the table for each player with 5 or more legs won. Here's how I'll approach this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Players with 5 Legs Won:**\n   - We look at the \"legs won\" column and identify players who have 5 or more legs won.\n\n2. **Check Their 3-Dart Average:**\n   - For each player identified in step 1, check their value in the \"3 - dart average\" column.\n   - Verify if this value is 95.39 or higher.\n\n3. **Evaluate All Relevant Players:**\n   - We need to ensure that all players with 5 or more legs won meet the condition of having a 3-dart average of at least 95.39.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **List Players with 5 Legs Won or More:**\n   - phil taylor: 74 legs won\n   - raymond van barneveld: 35 legs won\n   - gary anderson: 17 legs won\n   - mervyn king: 45 legs won\n   - terry jenkins: 61 legs won\n   - ronnie baxter: 54 legs won\n\n2. **Check Their 3-Dart Averages:**\n   - phil taylor: 105.73 (\u2265 95.39)\n   - raymond van barneveld: 98.1 (\u2265 95.39)\n   - mervyn king: 96.3 (\u2265 95.39)\n   - terry jenkins: 94.08 (< 95.39)\n   - ronnie baxter: 93.35 (< 95.39)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the above analysis, both Terry Jenkins and Ronnie Baxter have won more than 5 legs but do not meet the condition of having a 3-dart average of at least 95.39. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells for this evaluation are:\n\n- phil taylor: \n  - `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"legs won\"}` -> 74\n  - `{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"3 - dart average\"}` -> 105.73\n- raymond van barneveld:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"legs won\"}` -> 35\n  - `{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"3 - dart average\"}` -> 98.1\n- mervyn king:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"legs won\"}` -> 45\n  - `{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"3 - dart average\"}` -> 96.3\n- terry jenkins:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"legs won\"}` -> 61\n  - `{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"3 - dart average\"}` -> 94.08\n- ronnie baxter:\n  - `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"legs won\"}` -> 54\n  - `{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"3 - dart average\"}` -> 93.35\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified players with 5 or more legs won and checked their 3-dart averages.
