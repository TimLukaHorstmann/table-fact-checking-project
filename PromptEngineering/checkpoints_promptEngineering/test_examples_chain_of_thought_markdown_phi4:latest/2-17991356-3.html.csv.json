    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states, \"5 of the 7 2003 PGA Championship players have to par +11.\" We need to check how many players from the year 2003 are listed and whether their \"to par\" values are \"+11.\"\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Information**:\n   - Look at the column labeled \"year won\" to find entries for the year 2003.\n   - Check if any player in this year has a \"to par\" value of \"+11\".\n\n3. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - The table lists players with their respective years, totals, and \"to par\" values.\n   - We need to identify the row(s) where the \"year won\" is 2003.\n\n4. **Checking Each Row**:\n   - Go through each row in the \"year won\" column to see if any entry matches 2003.\n   - If a match is found, check the corresponding \"to par\" value for \"+11\".\n\n5. **Finding Relevant Rows**:\n   - Paul Azinger: 1993\n   - Davis Love III: 1997\n   - Mark Brooks: 1996\n   - John Daly: 1991\n   - Bob Tway: 1986\n   - Jeff Sluman: 1988\n   - Rich Beem: 2002\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no entries for the year 2003 in the table.\n   - Therefore, it is impossible to have 5 players with \"to par +11\" from 2003 because there are no 2003 entries at all.\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is false because there are zero players listed for the year 2003, let alone five with a \"to par\" of \"+11\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves checking if 5 out of 7 players from the 2003 PGA Championship have 'to par +11'.\",\n    \"First, identify any rows where 'year won' is 2003.\",\n    \"Upon inspection, no player has 'year won' as 2003 in the table.\",\n    \"Since there are zero entries for 2003, it's impossible to have 5 players with 'to par +11'.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
