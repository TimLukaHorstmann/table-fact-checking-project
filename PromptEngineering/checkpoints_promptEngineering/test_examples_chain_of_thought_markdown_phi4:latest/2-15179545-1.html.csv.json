    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states, \"the 2nd grand pix de nation be in the category formula 2 fia , non - championship\". There are a few points to clarify:\n   - \"grand pix\" seems to be a typographical error for \"grand prix\".\n   - \"nation\" is likely meant to be \"nations\", matching the race titles in the table.\n   - We need to verify if the 2nd Grand Prix des Nations falls under the category \"Formula 2 FIA, non-championship\".\n\n2. **Locate the Relevant Row**: \n   - Identify the row corresponding to the 2nd Grand Prix des Nations by looking at the 'race' column.\n\n3. **Verify the Category**:\n   - Check the 'category' column in the identified row to see if it matches \"Formula 2 FIA, non-championship\".\n\n4. **Check for Any Errors or Misinterpretations**: \n   - Ensure that there are no typographical errors in the claim that could mislead the verification process.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Step 1**: The claim refers to \"2nd grand pix de nation\", which we interpret as \"2nd Grand Prix des Nations\".\n  \n- **Step 2**: Locate the row with \"2nd grand prix des nations\" in the 'race' column. This is found at:\n  - Date: May 2, 1948\n  - Race: 2nd grand prix des nations\n  - Race Track: circuit des nations\n\n- **Step 3**: Check the 'category' for this row:\n  - The category listed is \"Formula 1 FIA, non-championship\".\n\n- **Conclusion**: The claim states that the race should be in the \"Formula 2 FIA, non-championship\" category. However, it is actually categorized under \"Formula 1 FIA, non-championship\". Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to '2nd grand pix de nation' which we interpret as '2nd Grand Prix des Nations'.
