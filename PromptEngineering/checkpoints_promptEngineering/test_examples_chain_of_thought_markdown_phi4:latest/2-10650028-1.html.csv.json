The primary focus here is on identifying the position of each player drafted in relation to Shawn Wiggins and verifying his status as a wide receiver.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Player's Position**: \n   - Look at the row corresponding to \"shawn wiggins\" to verify his position.\n   - According to the table, Shawn Wiggins is listed as a \"wide receiver\".\n\n2. **Check Round of Draft**:\n   - The column for \"round\" indicates in which round each player was drafted.\n   - Shawn Wiggins was drafted in \"round 9\".\n\n3. **Compare with Other Wide Receivers**:\n   - We need to check if there are any other wide receivers listed before round 9.\n   - Scan the table row by row, comparing positions up to and including row 8.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Player Prior to Shawn Wiggins**:\n   - Eric Turner: Defensive back (Round 1)\n   - Ed King: Guard (Round 2)\n   - James Jones: Defensive tackle (Round 3)\n   - Pio Sagapolutele: Defensive tackle (Round 4)\n   - Michael Jackson: Wide receiver (Round 6)\n\n5. **Identify Any Prior Wide Receivers**:\n   - Michael Jackson is listed as a wide receiver drafted in \"round 6\", which precedes Shawn Wiggins' draft round of 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Shawn Wiggins was the first wide receiver to get drafted, but according to the table, Michael Jackson was drafted earlier (Round 6) and also plays as a wide receiver.\n- Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's structure this reasoning in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Shawn Wiggins' position: 'wide receiver'.\",\n    \"Check his draft round: Round 9.\",\n    \"Look for any wide receivers drafted before Round 9.\",\n    \"Find Michael Jackson, a wide receiver, drafted in Round 6, which is earlier than Round 9.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim that Shawn Wiggins was the first wide receiver to be drafted is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\", \"value\": \"shawn wiggins\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\", \"value\": \"wide receiver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\", \"value\": 9},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\", \"value\": \"michael jackson\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\", \"value\": \"wide receiver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\", \"value\": 6}\n  ]\n}\n```",
