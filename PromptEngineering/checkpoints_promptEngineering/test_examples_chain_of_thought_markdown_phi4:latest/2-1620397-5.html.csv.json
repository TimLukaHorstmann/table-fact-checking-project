For example:\n     - Episodes \"6y / ai\", \"6y / aj\", \"6y / ak\" feature Peri, Victoria, Sontarans, Rutans (4 unique).\n     - Episodes \"h / c\", \"xx / a\", any other will include Susan, Ian, Barbara, Jamie, Zoe, etc. (more than 3).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only combination that meets the criteria is \"6eb / a\", \"6eb / b\", and \"6eb / c\".\n\n7. **Verify the Claim**: \n   - Since there exists at least one set of three episodes featuring exactly three unique characters, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1: Featuring Tegan, Nyssa, Dalek\n- Row 2: Featuring Tegan, Nyssa\n- Row 3: Featuring Tegan, Nyssa\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that there are 3 episodes featuring a total of 3 unique characters.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the release date average 1 every 2 month\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Release Dates**: First, we list all the release dates from the table:\n   - October 2011\n   - November 2011\n   - December 2011\n   - May 2012\n   - June 2012\n   - July 2012\n   - August 2012\n   - September 2012\n\n2. **Count Total Releases**: Count the total number of releases:\n   - There are 8 series listed.\n\n3. **Calculate Time Span**: Determine the time span from the first to the last release:\n   - The first release is in October 2011.\n   - The last release is in September 2012.\n   - From October 2011 to September 2012 is a period of 11 months.\n\n4. **Calculate Average Release Frequency**:\n   - To find the average frequency, divide the total time span by the number of intervals between releases.\n   - There are 7 intervals between 8 releases (e.g., October to November, November to December, etc.).\n\n5. **Average Interval Calculation**:\n   - The average interval is \\( \\frac{11 \\text{ months}}{7 \\text{ intervals}} \\approx 1.57 \\text{ months per release} \\).\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that releases occur \"every 2 months on average.\"\n   - Our calculation shows approximately 1.57 months per release, which is less than 2 months.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the calculated average interval (approximately 1.57 months) is less than 2 months, the claim is true.\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified release dates from October 2011 to September 2012, counted 8 releases over an 11-month span, calculated 7 intervals between releases, and found an average interval of approximately 1.57 months per release, which is less than 2 months as claimed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"released\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
