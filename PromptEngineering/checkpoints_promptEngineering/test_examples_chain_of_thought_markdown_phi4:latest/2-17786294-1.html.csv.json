The second round between RC Lens vs Olympique Lyonnais was scoreless.\n2.

There is no match-up between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais in the table.\n\n- **Conclusion for Step 1:**  \n  Since there is no game between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais, it's impossible for their second round to be scoreless or anything else. This part of the claim is false.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the First Round of FC Nantes vs RC Strasbourg\n\n- **Check if FC Nantes played against RC Strasbourg:**  \n  From the table:\n  - FC Nantes played against Olympique Lyonnais.\n  - RC Strasbourg played against RC Lens.\n\n- **Conclusion for Step 2:**  \n  Since FC Nantes did not play against RC Strasbourg, there is no first round score to verify. This part of the claim is also false.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data:\n1. There is no match between RC Lens and Olympique Lyonnais.\n2.

Only one away team scored in the first leg, not two.\n\n5. **Verify Specific Mentioned Match:**\n   - The match mentioned specifically (girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse) did have the away team (fc mulhouse) scoring 1 goal.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only one away team scored in the first leg, not two as stated.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to evaluate two conditions: \n\n1. The highest scoring leg.\n2. The highest aggregate score for a match.\n\nWe will compare these metrics across all matches listed in the table to see if \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc\" holds the record for either or both.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n**Identify the Highest Scoring Leg:**\n- Look through each row and consider both rounds separately:\n  - **rc lens (d1) vs rc strasbourg (d1):** Legs are 1-0, 0-0.\n  - **fc rouen (d1) vs stade lavallois (d1):** Legs are 1-0, 1-3.\n  - **as monaco (d1) vs as nancy (d1):** Legs are 2-0, 4-1.\n  - **girondins de bordeaux (d1) vs fc mulhouse (d2):** Legs are 0-1, 2-2.\n  - **fc nantes (d1) vs olympique lyonnais (d2):** Legs are 0-0, 4-4.\n  - **as cannes (d2) vs fc sochaux-montb\u00e9liard (d1):** Legs are 3-0, 1-1.\n  - **sporting toulon var (d1) vs en avant guingamp (d2):** Legs are 2-0, 0-1.\n  - **fc metz (d1) vs besan\u00e7on rc (d2):** Legs are 4-0, 1-1.\n\nThe highest scoring leg is \"fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc\" with a score of 4-0 in the first round. Other legs do not exceed 4 goals scored by one team in a single match.\n\n**Identify the Highest Aggregate Score for a Match:**\n- Calculate the aggregate scores from both rounds:\n  - **rc lens (d1) vs rc strasbourg (d1):** Aggregate score is 1-0.\n  - **fc rouen (d1) vs stade lavallois (d1):** Aggregate score is 2-3.\n  - **as monaco (d1) vs as nancy (d1):** Aggregate score is 6-1.\n  - **girondins de bordeaux (d1) vs fc mulhouse (d2):** Aggregate score is 2-3.\n  - **fc nantes (d1) vs olympique lyonnais (d2):** Aggregate score is 4-4.\n  - **as cannes (d2) vs fc sochaux-montb\u00e9liard (d1):** Aggregate score is 4-1.\n  - **sporting toulon var (d1) vs en avant guingamp (d2):** Aggregate score is 2-1.\n  - **fc metz (d1) vs besan\u00e7on rc (d2):** Aggregate score is 5-1.\n\nThe highest aggregate score is \"as monaco vs as nancy\" with a total of 7 goals (6-1). The match between \"fc nantes and olympique lyonnais\" has an aggregate score of 8 goals, but it's a tie, not exceeding any single team scoring more than half.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim that the highest scoring leg and highest aggregate score total 8 goals for \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc\" is incorrect. The highest scoring leg was from \"fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc\" (4-0), but their aggregate score (5-1) does not reach 8. The highest aggregate score of 8 occurred in the match between \"fc nantes and olympique lyonnais.\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The highest scoring leg is 'fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc' with a score of 4-0, not 'fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc'.
