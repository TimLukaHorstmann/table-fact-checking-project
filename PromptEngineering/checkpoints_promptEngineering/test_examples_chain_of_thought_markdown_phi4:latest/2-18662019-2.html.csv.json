    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Oleksandr Vorobiov's total score is true or false, we'll follow a step-by-step reasoning process by examining the table provided.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to locate the row corresponding to \"oleksandr vorobiov ( ukr )\" in the table.\n   - The position of Oleksandr Vorobiov is listed as 3, so we will focus on the third row.\n\n2. **Examine the 'total' Column:**\n   - In the third row, look at the 'total' column to find the total score for Oleksandr Vorobiov.\n   - According to the table, in the third row and under the 'total' column, the value is 16.25.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"oleksandr vorobiov ( ukr ) have a total score of 16.25.\"\n   - From our examination of the relevant cell, the total score indeed matches the claimed value of 16.25.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the total score in the table for Oleksandr Vorobiov is exactly as stated in the claim (16.25), the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell from which we derived this information is located at row index 3 and column name 'total'.\n\nHere is the final answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Locate the row for Oleksandr Vorobiov, identified by position 3. 2. Check the 'total' score in that row, which is 16.25. 3. Compare this value to the claim's stated total of 16.25. 4. Since they match, the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
