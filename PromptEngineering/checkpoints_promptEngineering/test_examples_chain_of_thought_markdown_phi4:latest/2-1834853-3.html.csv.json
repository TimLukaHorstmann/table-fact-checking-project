We will focus on rows with dates in 2002.\n\n2. **Locate Rows from 2002**:\n   - Date: 9 May 2002, Venue: dreisamstadion, Freiburg, Score: 7 - 0, Result: 7 - 0, Competition: friendly\n   - Date: 1 June 2002, Venue: sapporo dome, Sapporo, Score: 4 - 0, Result: 8 - 0, Competition: 2002 world cup\n   - Date: 21 August 2002, Venue: vasil levski national stadium, Sofia, Score: 2 - 2, Result: 2 - 2, Competition: friendly\n   - Date: 11 October 2002, Venue: asim ferhatovi\u0107 hase stadium, Sarajevo, Score: 1 - 1, Result: 1 - 1, Competition: friendly\n\n3. **Analyze the 'Score' Column**:\n   - The 'score' column represents the scoreline at a particular point in time during the match (often halftime or just after a goal).\n   - We need to determine if Carsten Jancker was involved in scoring for any of these matches.\n\n4. **Check Known Goal Contributions**:\n   - 9 May 2002: The score is 7 - 0, but there's no specific information about who scored.\n   - 1 June 2002: The score is 4 - 0 at a certain point, contributing to an eventual 8 - 0 result. Carsten Jancker is known to have scored in this match during the 2002 World Cup.\n   - 21 August 2002: Score 2 - 2, no specific mention of Carsten Jancker scoring.\n   - 11 October 2002: Score 1 - 1, again no specific mention of Carsten Jancker scoring.\n\n5. **Known Historical Context**:\n   - From historical records, Carsten Jancker scored a hat-trick in the match on 1 June 2002 against Japan during the World Cup.\n   - No other matches listed have confirmed information about him scoring.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the table and known historical data, Carsten Jancker is confirmed to have scored at least three goals on 1 June 2002.\n   - There is no evidence in the table of him scoring additional goals in any other match in 2002.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states Carsten Jancker scored 4 international goals in 2002.

The score column shows 6 - 2, so 2 additional goals were scored after halftime.\n   - Row 3: The result matches the score as 8 - 2. This suggests all goals were accounted for in the score column.\n   - Row 7: The result is 7 - 0 and matches the score.\n\n3. **Determine Carsten Jancker's Goals:**\n   - The claim states that Carsten Jancker scored 3 international goals at this venue.

Therefore, any conclusion about individual player contributions must rely on external knowledge.\n\n3. **Review Known Information About Carsten Jancker**:\n   - Based on historical data (outside of this table), we know that Carsten Jancker was a German footballer known for scoring international goals in friendly matches.\n   - However, without explicit information from the table about which player scored the goals, we cannot directly verify his contributions to each game solely from the table.\n\n4. **Count Games with Goals**:\n   - We count the number of friendly games where Germany scored at least one goal.\n   - From the identified friendly matches: \n     - 3 June 2000 (Row 1) \u2013 Germany won 3-2\n     - 7 June 2000 (Rows 2 and 3) \u2013 Germany won 8-2 (noted twice, possibly a data entry error)\n     - 15 August 2001 (Row 5) \u2013 Germany won 5-2\n     - 9 May 2002 (Row 8) \u2013 Germany won 7-0\n     - 21 August 2002 (Row 9) \u2013 Germany drew 2-2\n\n   - These are five different friendly matches where Germany scored.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table does not provide enough information to confirm Carsten Jancker's specific goal contributions in these games.\n   - We know from external sources that he did score in some of these matches, but the claim requires verification directly from this table, which is not possible without additional data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis of the table alone and without external information about individual player goals, we cannot confirm Carsten Jancker scored in seven friendly games.
