    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about John Isner playing on a grass surface three times from 2009 to 2013 is true or false, we need to examine the table for any entries related to John Isner and check if they involve grass surfaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:**\n   - We need to look at each row in the table to find mentions of \"John Isner\" under the \"player\" column.\n   \n2. **Check Surface Type:**\n   - For any entries involving John Isner, we need to check the \"surface\" column to see if it is listed as \"grass\".\n\n3. **Count Grass Surface Matches:**\n   - Count how many times John Isner played on a grass surface according to the table.\n\n### Examination of the Table:\n\n- **Row 1:** The year entry does not mention any player.\n- **Row 2:** Player is \"ga\u00ebl monfils\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 3:** Player is \"jo - wilfried tsonga\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 4:** Player is \"andy roddick\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 5:** Year entry, no player mentioned.\n- **Row 6:** Player is \"nikolay davydenko\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 7:** Year entry, no player mentioned.\n- **Row 8:** Player is \"david ferrer\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 9:** Year entry, no player mentioned.\n- **Row 10:** Player is \"roger federer\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 11:** Player is \"novak djokovic\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 12:** Player is \"jo - wilfried tsonga\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 13:** Player is \"janko tipsarevi\u0107\", no match for John Isner. Surface is grass, but not relevant as it's not John Isner.\n- **Row 14:** Player is \"jo - wilfried tsonga\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 15:** Player is \"tom\u00e1\u0161 berdych\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 16:** Year entry, no player mentioned.\n- **Row 17:** Player is \"milos raonic\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 18:** Player is \"novak djokovic\", no match for John Isner.\n- **Row 19:** Player is \"juan mart\u00edn del potro\", no match for John Isner.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter examining all rows, there are no entries for John Isner in the table. Therefore, he did not play on a grass surface according to this data from 2009 to 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined row by row to identify any mentions of John Isner.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a minority of the events have been played in the United States\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify All Events**: Review the table to list all the unique events mentioned.\n2. **Determine Locations**: Identify which of these events are held in the United States.\n3. **Count Total and US Events**: Count the total number of unique events and the number of those held in the United States.\n4. **Compare Counts**: Determine if the number of US events is less than half of the total number of events.\n\nLet's apply this step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify All Events**:\n   - Indian Wells, United States\n   - Washington, United States\n   - US Open, New York, United States\n   - Beijing, China\n   - Paris, France\n   - Davis Cup, Fribourg, Switzerland\n   - Davis Cup, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France\n   - Olympics, London, England\n   - Winston-Salem, United States\n   - Cincinnati, United States\n\n2. **Determine Locations**:\n   - Indian Wells (United States)\n   - Washington (United States)\n   - US Open (New York, United States)\n   - Beijing (China)\n   - Paris (France)\n   - Davis Cup (Fribourg, Switzerland)\n   - Davis Cup (Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France)\n   - Olympics (London, England)\n   - Winston-Salem (United States)\n   - Cincinnati (United States)\n\n3. **Count Total and US Events**:\n   - Total unique events: 10\n   - Events in the United States: Indian Wells, Washington, US Open, Winston-Salem, Cincinnati\n\n4. **Compare Counts**:\n   - Number of US events = 5\n   - Total number of events = 10\n   - Since 5 is half of 10, not a minority.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"a minority of the events have been played in the United States\" is FALSE because exactly half of the events are held in the United States, which does not constitute a minority.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis include those under the \"event\" and \"surface\" columns where the location can be determined:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified all unique events from the table.
