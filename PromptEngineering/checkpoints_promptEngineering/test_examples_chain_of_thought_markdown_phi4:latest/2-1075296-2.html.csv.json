    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Michael Schumacher's race result is true, we need to evaluate each part of the statement and refer to the relevant parts of the table.\n\n1. **Identify Michael Schumacher's Row:**\n   - The row corresponding to Michael Schumacher shows:\n     - `driver`: michael schumacher\n     - `constructor`: ferrari\n     - `laps`: 60\n     - `time / retired`: 1:32:35.101\n     - `grid`: 1\n\n2. **Evaluate the Claim Statement:**\n   - The claim states that \"michael schumacher be the driver whose constructor be ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retire of 1:32:35.101.\"\n   - We need to check:\n     - If Michael Schumacher's constructor is Ferrari.\n     - If his grid position was 1.\n     - If he finished with a time of 1:32:35.101.\n\n3. **Check Constructor and Grid Position:**\n   - From the table, Michael Schumacher's `constructor` is indeed \"ferrari.\"\n   - His `grid` number is 1.\n\n4. **Check Time/Retired:**\n   - The `time / retired` for Michael Schumacher is exactly 1:32:35.101.\n\n5. **Verify Average Grid Number:**\n   - The claim mentions an \"average grid number of 1.\" Since only one driver from Ferrari (Michael Schumacher) is listed, his grid position alone represents the average.\n   - Therefore, the average grid number for Ferrari drivers in this race is indeed 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - All parts of the claim are verified to be true based on the table data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row corresponding to Michael Schumacher shows he drove for Ferrari, started from grid position 1, and retired with a time of 1:32:35.101. Since he is the only Ferrari driver listed, his grid position is also the average grid number for Ferrari drivers in this race.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
