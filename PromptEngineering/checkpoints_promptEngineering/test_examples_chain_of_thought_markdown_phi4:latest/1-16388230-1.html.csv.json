    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Waverley Park being used most often for games in February 1997 is true or false, we need to analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: First, identify all the rows corresponding to matches played in February 1997.\n   - Rows: \n     - Row 2: Date \"saturday , 22 february 1997\"\n     - Row 3: Date \"sunday , 23 february 1997\"\n     - Row 4: Date \"monday , 24 february 1997\"\n     - Row 5: Date \"wednesday , 26 february 1997\"\n\n2. **Check Ground for Each Relevant Row**: For each of these rows, check the \"ground\" column to see where the game was played.\n   - Row 2: \"waverley park\"\n   - Row 3: \"waverley park\"\n   - Row 4: \"waverley park\"\n   - Row 5: \"waverley park\"\n\n3. **Count Occurrences at Waverley Park**: Count how many times \"waverley park\" appears in the \"ground\" column for these February matches.\n   - Waverley Park is listed as the ground for all four games.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Grounds**: Check if any other grounds have more occurrences than Waverley Park within February 1997.\n   - Row 1: Ground \"football park\"\n   - Row 6: Ground \"football park\"\n   - Row 7: Ground \"bruce stadium\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Waverley Park appears 4 times and no other ground appears more than once in February 1997, it is indeed the most frequently used ground during that month.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- The claim states Waverley Park was used 5 out of 7 times, which is incorrect based on our count (it was used 4 out of 4 relevant matches).\n- Therefore, the statement \"waverly park be the ground use most often (5 time out of 7) for the game in feb 1997\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all rows corresponding to February 1997 games. Checked the 'ground' column for each row and counted occurrences of 'waverley park'. Found it was used 4 times, which is more than any other ground in February 1997.
