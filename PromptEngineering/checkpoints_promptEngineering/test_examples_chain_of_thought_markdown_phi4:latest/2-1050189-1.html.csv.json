    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Greenville Braves' losses in 1999 being higher than any other year is true, we need to examine each row of the table for the 'losses' column and compare them:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The claim states that the number of losses in 1999 is greater than in any other year.\n\n2. **Locate Losses Column:** The relevant data can be found under the \"losses\" column in the table.\n\n3. **Examine Each Year's Losses:**\n   - 1963: 65 losses\n   - 1964: 63 losses\n   - 1984: 67 losses\n   - 1985: 74 losses\n   - 1986: 71 losses\n   - 1987: 74 losses\n   - 1988: 57 losses\n   - 1989: 69 losses\n   - 1990: 87 losses\n   - 1991: 56 losses\n   - 1992: 43 losses\n   - 1993: 67 losses\n   - 1994: 63 losses\n   - 1995: 83 losses\n   - 1996: 82 losses\n   - 1997: 66 losses\n   - 1998: 72 losses\n   - **1999: 80 losses**\n   - 2000: 71 losses\n   - 2001: 79 losses\n   - 2002: 63 losses\n   - 2003: 70 losses\n   - 2004: 76 losses\n\n4. **Compare Losses in Each Year:** \n   - We need to find the maximum number of losses and check if it corresponds to the year 1999.\n   - From our comparison, the highest loss count is 87, which occurred in 1990.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim that 1999 had the most losses is false because 1990 had more losses (87) than any other year including 1999 (80).\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - The cells relevant to verifying this conclusion are those under the \"losses\" column, specifically for 1990 and 1999.\n\nHere's the final structured answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is about whether 1999 had more losses than any other year. By examining each row's 'losses' data, we find that 1990 has 87 losses, which is greater than 80 losses in 1999. Hence, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"losses\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
