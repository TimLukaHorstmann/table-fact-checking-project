This row provides us with translations for Friday across different languages.\n\n3. **Find the Polish Translation**:\n   - Within this specific row, locate the cell under the \"polish\" column.\n   - According to the table, the entry for Friday in the Polish language is \"pi\u0105tek\".\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the word for Friday in Polish is \"pi\u0105tek\".\n   - The information from the table confirms this translation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the table indicates that the Polish word for Friday is indeed \"pi\u0105tek\", the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell to verify this claim is located at row index 5 (corresponding to \"friday fifth day\") and under the column \"polish\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'polish' column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"subota be the Mongolian word for Sunday\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's examine the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Mongolian Names of Days:**\n   - The table provides two sets of entries for Mongolian days:\n     - Numerical (e.g., \u043d\u044d\u0433 \u0434\u044d\u0445 \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 for Monday).\n     - Tibetan script (e.g., \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0430 for Monday).\n\n2. **Locate the Entry for Sunday in Both Mongolian Sets:**\n   - For the numerical set, the entry for Sunday is \u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440.\n   - For the Tibetan script set, the entry for Sunday is \u043d\u044f\u043c.\n\n3. **Identify the Column for Subota:**\n   - \"Subota\" appears in multiple language columns:\n     - Russian: \u0441\u0443\u0431\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\n     - Ukrainian: \u0441\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\n     - Bulgarian: \u0441\u044a\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\n     - Serbian (Cyrillic): \u0441\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\n     - Macedonian: \u0441\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\n\n4. **Determine the Day Corresponding to Subota:**\n   - In all these languages, \"Subota\" corresponds to Saturday.\n\n5. **Compare Mongolian Entry for Sunday with Subota:**\n   - From step 2, we know that neither \u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 nor \u043d\u044f\u043c translates to subota.\n   - Since subota is associated with Saturday in the table, it cannot be the Mongolian word for Sunday.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"subota be the mongolian word for sunday\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the structured output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that 'subota' corresponds to Saturday in several languages.
