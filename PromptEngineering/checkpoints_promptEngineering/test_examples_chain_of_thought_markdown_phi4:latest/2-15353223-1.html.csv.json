    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Chris Walsh be include in an earlier round than Barry Rose\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare their respective rounds of selection based on the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Chris Walsh's Round:**\n   - Look for the row where the player name is \"chris walsh.\"\n   - In the table, Chris Walsh is listed in round 9 (row index 8).\n\n2. **Identify Barry Rose's Round:**\n   - Look for the row where the player name is \"barry rose.\"\n   - In the table, Barry Rose is listed in round 10 (row index 9).\n\n3. **Compare Rounds:**\n   - Chris Walsh was selected in round 9.\n   - Barry Rose was selected in round 10.\n\n4. **Determine Order:**\n   - Since round 9 comes before round 10, Chris Walsh was indeed included in an earlier round than Barry Rose.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is TRUE because Chris Walsh was selected in a round that precedes the round in which Barry Rose was selected.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Chris Walsh was selected in round 9, and Barry Rose was selected in round 10.
