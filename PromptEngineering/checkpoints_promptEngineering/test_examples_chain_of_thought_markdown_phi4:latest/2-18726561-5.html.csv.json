The score should be 4 - 0 when:\n   - Home team: Stoke City\n   - Away team: Sunderland\n\n2. The score should be 2 - 3 when:\n   - Home team: Sunderland\n   - Away team: Stoke City\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Part 1: Checking the first part of the claim (Home team: Stoke City, Away team: Sunderland)\n- We need to find a row in the table where the home team is Stoke City and the away team is Sunderland.\n- The relevant rows for this condition are:\n  - Row with \"tie no\": 8\n    - Home team: Stoke City\n    - Score: 0 - 0\n    - Away team: Sunderland\n    - Date: 14 February 1976\n\n- There is also a replay match in the table where:\n  - Row with \"replay\" (second):\n    - Home team: Sunderland\n    - Score: 2 - 1\n    - Away team: Stoke City\n    - Date: 17 February 1976\n\nFrom this information, we see that the score was not 4 - 0 in any match where Stoke City was the home team and Sunderland was the away team. Instead, it was 0 - 0 initially, and then 2 - 1 for Sunderland when they played at home.\n\n#### Part 2: Checking the second part of the claim (Home team: Sunderland, Away team: Stoke City)\n- We need to find a row in the table where the home team is Sunderland and the away team is Stoke City.\n- As previously noted:\n  - Row with \"replay\" (second):\n    - Home team: Sunderland\n    - Score: 2 - 1\n    - Away team: Stoke City\n    - Date: 17 February 1976\n\nThe score of 2 - 3 does not match the actual result from the table. The correct score was 2 - 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The claim is false because neither condition of the claim is met based on the data in the table.\n- For Stoke City vs Sunderland, there was no game with a score of 4 - 0.\n- For Sunderland vs Stoke City, the actual score was 2 - 1, not 2 - 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states two conditions about match scores.
