This confirms that he does play at this position.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Player's Position**:\n   - Row 1: Glen Seabrooke, position = center\n   - Row 2: Bruce Rendall, position = left wing\n   - Row 3: Darryl Gilmour, position = goaltender\n   - Row 4: Shane Whelan, position = center\n   - Row 5: Paul Marshall, position = defense\n   - Row 5: Daril Holmes, position = right wing\n   - Row 6: Ken Alexander, position = defense\n   - Row 7: Tony Horacek, position = left wing\n   - Row 8: Mike Cusack, position = forward\n   - Row 9: Gord Murphy, position = defense\n   - Row 11: Rod Williams, position = right wing\n   - Row 12: Paul Maurice, position = defense\n\n3. **Verify Other Players in the Center Position**:\n   - From step 2, we see that Shane Whelan (Row 4) is also listed as a center.\n\nSince Shane Whelan plays at the center position alongside Glen Seabrooke, the claim \"Glen Seabrooke be the only player list who play the center position\" is false.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Glen Seabrooke's position: Glen Seabrooke is listed as playing center.\",\n    \"Check each row to see if any other players are listed with the position 'center'.\",\n    \"Shane Whelan (Row 4) is also listed as a center, indicating that he plays this position alongside Glen Seabrooke.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
