    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's go through a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Claim\n\nThe claim states:\n- Only one game was postponed.\n- The postponed game was on April 23 against the Royals.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Postponed Games in the Table\n\nWe need to look for any entries in the table that indicate a postponement. Specifically, we should check each row for mentions of \"postponed\" or similar terms related to rescheduling:\n\n- **April 23**: The entry states \"postponed (rain) rescheduled for April 24\". This indicates a game was postponed on this date.\n\n### Step 3: Checking for Additional Postponements\n\nWe need to verify if there are any other entries in the table that mention postponements or rescheduling:\n\n- Scanning through all rows, we find no additional mentions of \"postponed\" or \"rescheduled\" apart from April 23.\n\n### Step 4: Confirming the Rescheduled Game\n\nThe table shows:\n- **April 24**: Two games are listed against the Royals on this date. This confirms that the postponed game from April 23 was indeed rescheduled for April 24.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, only one game was postponed, and it matches the claim of being against the Royals on April 23.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that only one game was postponed, specifically on April 23 against the Royals.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on April 29 against the Yankees having the highest attendance at 41872 is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Attendance for Each Game Against the Yankees:**\n   - From the table, identify the games played against the Yankees and their corresponding attendances.\n   - Games against the Yankees:\n     - April 25: Attendance = 31467\n     - April 26: Attendance = 35765\n     - April 27: Attendance = 31598\n     - April 28: Attendance = 20689\n\n2. **Identify the Game on April 29 and Its Attendance:**\n   - Locate the game played on April 29 against the Mariners.\n   - April 29 attendance is listed as 13827.\n\n3. **Compare the Attendance Figures:**\n   - The claim specifies an attendance of 41872 for a Yankees game on April 29, which does not exist.\n   - Compare the highest recorded attendance from the Yankees games (35765) to the claimed figure (41872).\n   - Also, compare the attendance on April 29 against the Mariners (13827).\n\n4. **Verify Against Other Games:**\n   - Check if any other game in the table has an attendance of 41872.\n   - The highest recorded attendance overall is for the game on March 31 with 41872.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim about a Yankees game on April 29 having an attendance of 41872 is false because there was no game against the Yankees on that date, and the highest attendance figure (41872) belongs to a different game entirely (March 31 vs. White Sox).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim about a Yankees game on April 29 having an attendance of 41872 is false because there was no game against the Yankees on that date, and the highest recorded attendance in the table is 41872 for the March 31 game.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
