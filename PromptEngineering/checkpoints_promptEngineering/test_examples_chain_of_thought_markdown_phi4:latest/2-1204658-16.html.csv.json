    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no team scored more than 110 points in a game\" is true or false, we need to analyze the scores listed in the table for each game.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Format**:\n   - The table lists football games with columns indicating home and away teams, their respective scores, venues, and dates.\n   - Scores are presented in a format where the numbers before and after the period represent different scoring units (e.g., goals and behinds), and the final number in parentheses is the total points.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - We need to focus on the columns \"home team score\" and \"away team score,\" as these contain the point totals we need to evaluate.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row for Scores**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Home Team (fitzroy) Score: 94 points\n     - Away Team (university) Score: 73 points\n   - **Row 2**: \n     - Home Team (essendon) Score: 119 points\n     - Away Team (melbourne) Score: 59 points\n   - **Row 3**: \n     - Home Team (collingwood) Score: 70 points\n     - Away Team (st kilda) Score: 51 points\n   - **Row 4**: \n     - Home Team (south melbourne) Score: 120 points\n     - Away Team (richmond) Score: 28 points\n   - **Row 5**: \n     - Home Team (geelong) Score: 39 points\n     - Away Team (carlton) Score: 49 points\n\n4. **Identify Scores Greater Than 110**:\n   - From the above examination, we find two scores that exceed 110 points:\n     - Essendon scored 119 points.\n     - South Melbourne scored 120 points.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there are teams that scored more than 110 points (essendon and south melbourne), the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant columns: 'home team score' and 'away team score'.\",\n    \"Examine each row for scores.\",\n    \"Row 1: fitzroy 94, university 73.\",\n    \"Row 2: essendon 119, melbourne 59.
