Each row represents a game, and the value in the \"week\" column specifies the week number for that game.\n   \n3. **Count Unique Week Numbers**:\n   - Start from the first row and move through each subsequent row, noting down the week numbers:\n     - Row 1: Week 1\n     - Row 2: Week 2\n     - Row 3: Week 3\n     - Row 4: Week 4\n     - Row 5: Week 5\n     - Row 6: Week 6\n     - Row 7: Week 7\n     - Row 8: Week 8\n     - Row 9: Week 9\n     - Row 10: Week 10\n     - Row 11: Week 11\n     - Row 12: Week 12\n     - Row 13: Week 13\n     - Row 14: Week 14\n     - Row 15: Week 15\n     - Row 16: Week 16\n\n4. **Total Count**:\n   - There are 16 unique week numbers listed in the table, ranging from Week 1 to Week 16.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states that there is a total of 16 weeks in the list.
