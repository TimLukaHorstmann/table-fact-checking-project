There is no entry with the date \"April 21\" in the table.\n\n- **Step 3**: Verify if \"stab\u00e6k\" is listed as a host in the 'host' column. \"Stab\u00e6k\" appears as a host only once:\n  - October 19: stab\u00e6k (host) vs sk brann, but this is for the \"tippeligaen\" tournament.\n\nBased on these checks:\n\n- There is no entry for April 21.\n- The \"champion league (q)\" does not occur on April 21.\n- \"Stab\u00e6k\" is never listed as a host in the \"champion league (q)\" tournament.\n\nThus, the claim is false.
