    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze it step-by-step using the table provided.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\nThe claim states: \n1. \"2 of the championships have a hard surface.\"\n2. \"The 1998 Rome championship has a clay surface.\"\n\nLet's evaluate each part:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Championships with Hard Surfaces\n- From the table, check the \"surface\" column for entries marked as \"hard\":\n  - Row 1 (Championship in Toronto, 1998) has a hard surface.\n  - Row 2 (Championship in Cincinnati, 1998) has a hard surface.\n  - Row 5 (Championship in Montreal, 2001) has a hard surface.\n\nThus, there are three championships with a hard surface: Toronto 1998, Cincinnati 1998, and Montreal 2001. Therefore, the claim that \"2 of the championships have a hard surface\" is FALSE because three have a hard surface.\n\n#### Step 2: Verify Surface of the 1998 Rome Championship\n- Check if there is an entry for a championship in Rome in 1998:\n  - The table shows only one entry for Rome, which is in 1999 (Row 3) with a clay surface.\n  - There is no row corresponding to a Rome championship in 1998.\n\nSince there is no 1998 Rome championship listed in the table, this part of the claim is also FALSE. Moreover, even if it were present, its surface would not be hard as no such entry exists.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth parts of the claim are false. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- Row 1: \"surface\" (hard), \"year\" (1998), \"championship\" (Canada - Toronto)\n- Row 2: \"surface\" (hard), \"year\" (1998), \"championship\" (Cincinnati)\n- Row 3: \"year\" (1999), \"championship\" (Rome), \"surface\" (clay)\n- There is no row for the 1998 Rome championship.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
