Here's how I approached this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: The claim pertains to the size of the crowd at each game on 19 June 1971. Thus, we focus on the \"crowd\" column.\n\n2. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - **Row 1 (Carlton vs North Melbourne)**: Crowd = 13,300\n     - This is less than 20,000.\n   - **Row 2 (St Kilda vs Geelong)**: Crowd = 14,181\n     - This is less than 20,000.\n   - **Row 3 (Richmond vs Fitzroy)**: Crowd = 24,831\n     - This is greater than 20,000.
