There is a difference of 2 between the claimed population and the actual population in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the numbers are different, the claim is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The total Brazilian population for age 15-17 according to the table is 10,357,872.
