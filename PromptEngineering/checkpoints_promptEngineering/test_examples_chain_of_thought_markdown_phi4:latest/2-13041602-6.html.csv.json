Not 50-50.\n   - On August 3: The record is \"53 - 55\". Not 50-50.\n   - On August 4: The record is \"54 - 55\". Not 50-50.\n   - On August 5: The record is \"55 - 55\". This is a 50-50 record.\n   - On August 6: The record changes to \"55 - 56\". Not 50-50.\n   - Continue checking each row in the same manner.\n\n5. **Identify All Dates with a 50-50 Record**:\n   - On August 13, the record is \"52 - 52\", which simplifies to a 50-50 record when considering that both numbers are two units more than 50.\n   - On August 14, the record becomes \"53 - 52\". Not 50-50.\n\n6. **Verify the Number of Days**:\n   - We found only two dates with a 50-50 win-loss record: August 5 and August 13.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The claim states there are only 2 days in August 2005 when the Brewers had a 50/50 win/loss record, which matches our findings.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each entry in the 'record' column for dates in August 2005 to find where the win-loss record was exactly 50-50.
