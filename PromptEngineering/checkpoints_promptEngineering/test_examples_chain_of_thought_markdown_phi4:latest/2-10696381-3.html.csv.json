Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: The column related to our claim is the \"attendance\" column.\n\n2. **Examine Each Attendance Figure**:\n   - Row 1: Attendance = 60292\n   - Row 2: Attendance = 77687\n   - Row 3: Attendance = 59835\n   - Row 4: Attendance = 73344\n   - Row 5: Attendance = 75684\n   - Row 6: Attendance = 60292\n   - Row 7: Attendance = 60292\n   - Row 8: Attendance = 56828\n   - Row 10: Attendance = 60292\n   - Row 11: Attendance = 72618\n   - Row 12: Attendance = 60292\n   - Row 13: Attendance = 77923\n   - Row 14: Attendance = 50328\n   - Row 15: Attendance = 66944\n   - Row 16: Attendance = 47230 (This is a candidate for the lowest attendance)\n   - Row 17: Attendance = 60292\n\n3. **Determine the Lowest Figure**:\n   - Compare all attendance figures and identify the minimum value.\n   - The smallest figure observed in the table is indeed 47230, which occurs at row 16.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since 47230 is present as an attendance figure in the table and no other attendance figure is lower than this, the claim \"the lowest attendance figure for a single game be 47230\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cell for this claim is:\n- Row index: 16\n- Column name: \"attendance\"\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'attendance' column as relevant.
