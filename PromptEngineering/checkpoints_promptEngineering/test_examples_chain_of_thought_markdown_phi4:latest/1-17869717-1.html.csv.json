This is found in the first column of the table.\n\n2. **Check the Date for Week 3:**\n   - Look at the \"date\" column corresponding to Week 3. The date should match September 30 if the claim is true.\n\n3. **Verify the Information:**\n   - In the row where \"week\" is 3, the \"date\" value is \"september 30.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the game for Week 3 was indeed played on September 30, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row index 2 (since it corresponds to week 3 in a zero-indexed system):\n  - Column \"week\": value is 3\n  - Column \"date\": value is \"september 30\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for Week 3, checked the 'date' column in that row, and found it to be September 30.
