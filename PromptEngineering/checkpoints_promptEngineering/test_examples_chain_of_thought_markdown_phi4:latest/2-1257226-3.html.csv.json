    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to evaluate the number of goals Guillermo Franco scored in friendly competitions versus those he scored in 2010 FIFA World Cup competitions.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Goals in Friendly Competitions:**\n   - Look for entries where the \"competition\" column specifies \"friendly.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 2: Date is 1 March 2006, competition is \"friendly,\" and goal count is 1.\n     - Row 7: Date is 24 May 2010, competition is \"friendly,\" and goal count is 1.\n   - Total goals in friendly competitions = 1 (Row 2) + 1 (Row 7) = 2.\n\n2. **Identify Goals in 2010 FIFA World Cup Competitions:**\n   - Look for entries where the \"competition\" column specifies \"2010 fifa world cup.\"\n   - From the table:\n     - There are no entries explicitly listed as \"2010 fifa world cup\" competition.\n   - Total goals in 2010 FIFA World Cup competitions = 0.\n\n3. **Compare Goals:**\n   - Goals scored in friendly competitions = 2.\n   - Goals scored in 2010 FIFA World Cup competitions = 0.\n   - The claim states that the number of goals scored at friendly competitions is the same as those at 2010 FIFA World Cup competitions.\n   - Since 2 (friendly) \u2260 0 (World Cup), the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Guillermo Franco scored 1 goal in each of two friendly matches, totaling 2 goals. There are no entries for goals scored specifically in the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition, so his total is 0. Therefore, the number of goals scored at friendly competitions is not equal to those scored at 2010 FIFA World Cup competitions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
