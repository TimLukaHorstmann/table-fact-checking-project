Unfortunately, the table does not specify home/away status directly.\n   - Assuming standard NFL practices where teams typically alternate between home and away, let's analyze possible scenarios based on alternating weeks.\n     - If Week 1 is an away game (common opening game scenario), then:\n       - Weeks 1, 3, 5 would be away; Weeks 2, 4, 6 would be home.\n     - Under this assumption:\n       - Wins occurred in Weeks 3 (away), 4 (home), and 6 (home).\n       - Only Weeks 4 and 6 are consecutive wins that could potentially both be home games.\n\nGiven these steps, under a reasonable assumption of alternating home/away games starting with an away game, we have two consecutive home game wins in Weeks 4 and 6.

This aligns with historical records where the Falcons were considered an away team for Miami in that season.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The table shows three wins, two of which are consecutive (Weeks 3 and 4).\n   - Based on historical knowledge, one of these wins (Week 4) was a home game.\n   - Thus, the claim is consistent with both the table data and external historical information.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists three wins for the Dolphins in Weeks 3, 4, and 6.
