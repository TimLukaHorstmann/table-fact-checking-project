Check if Alvin Williams recorded the high assists (9) for the same game.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n- **Identify the row corresponding to March 10:**\n  - From the table, locate \"march 10\" under the `date` column. This corresponds to `game` number 65.\n\n- **Examine the high points for game 65 (March 10):**\n  - Under the `high points` column for row 65, it lists \"vince carter (16).\" \n  - The claim states that Vince Carter scored 43 points on March 10.
