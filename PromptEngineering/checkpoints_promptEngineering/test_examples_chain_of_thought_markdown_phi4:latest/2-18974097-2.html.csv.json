    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim states that \"mitchell be 1 of the 2 school list with an aaa ihsaa class.\" This means we are looking for schools listed in the table that have an IHSAA classification of 'aaa'.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Column:** We need to examine the \"ihsaa class\" column because it contains information about each school's IHSAA classification.\n\n3. **Locate Schools with 'aaa' Classification:**\n   - Go through each row in the table and check the value under the \"ihsaa class\" column.\n   - Identify schools that have 'aaa' as their classification.\n\n4. **Count Schools with 'aaa' Classification:**\n   - Count how many schools have an IHSAA classification of 'aaa'.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:** \n   - The claim specifies there should be 2 schools with this classification.\n   - Verify if exactly two schools meet this criterion.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Row 1:** Crawford County has a class of 'aa'.\n- **Row 2:** Mitchell has a class of 'aaa'. (This is one school)\n- **Row 3:** Orleans has a class of 'a'.\n- **Row 4:** Paoli has a class of 'aa'.\n- **Row 5:** Perry Central has a class of 'aa'.\n- **Row 6:** Springs Valley has a class of 'a'.\n- **Row 7:** West Washington has a class of 'a'.\n\nUpon reviewing the table, we find that only Mitchell is listed with an IHSAA classification of 'aaa'. There are no other schools in the table with this classification.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states there should be two schools with 'aaa' classification. However, only one school (Mitchell) meets this criterion.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand the claim that there are supposed to be 2 schools with an 'aaa' IHSAA class.\",\n    \"Identify the 'ihsaa class' column for relevant data.\",\n    \"Check each row for a school with 'aaa' classification.\",\n    \"Count the number of schools with 'aaa' classification: Mitchell is the only one.\",\n    \"Verify against the claim that there should be 2 such schools. Only 1 is found.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell\" is true or false, we need to analyze the sizes of both schools mentioned:\n\n1. **Identify the Size of Orleans:**\n   - From the table, locate the row for \"orleans\".\n   - The column \"size\" for \"orleans\" has a value of 258.\n\n2. **Identify the Size of Mitchell:**\n   - Locate the row for \"mitchell\".\n   - The column \"size\" for \"mitchell\" has a value of 620.\n\n3. **Calculate Half the Size of Mitchell:**\n   - Compute half of Mitchell's size: \\( \\frac{620}{2} = 310 \\).\n\n4. **Compare Orleans' Size to Half of Mitchell's Size:**\n   - Check if Orleans' size (258) is less than half of Mitchell's size (310).\n   - Since 258 is indeed less than 310, the claim that \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell\" holds true.\n\n5. **Verify Exactness:**\n   - The phrase \"exactly less than\" implies Orleans' size must not equal or exceed half of Mitchell's size.\n   - Since 258 is strictly less than 310, it satisfies the condition of being \"exactly less than\".\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the size of 'orleans' from the table: 258.\",\n    \"Identify the size of 'mitchell' from the table: 620.\",\n    \"Calculate half of Mitchell's size: 310.\",\n    \"Compare Orleans' size (258) to half of Mitchell's size (310).\",\n    \"'Orleans' size is less than 310, satisfying the condition of being 'exactly less than'.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
