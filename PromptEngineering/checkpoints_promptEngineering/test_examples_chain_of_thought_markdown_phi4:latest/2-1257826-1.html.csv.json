This implies we are looking for a row where the `goal` column has the value 4 and checking if its corresponding `date` is March 15, 2001.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Column\nThe relevant columns to check are:\n- `goal`: We need to find the row with the goal number equal to 4.\n- `date`: Once we identify the correct row, we verify the date for that row.\n\n### Step 3: Locate Goal Number 4 in the Table\nWe look through each row of the table to locate where the `goal` column has a value of 4:\n\n|   goal | date             | score   | result   | competition       |\n|-------:|:-----------------|:--------|:---------|:------------------|\n|      1 | 17 january 2001  | 2 - 0   | 2 - 0    | friendly          |\n|      2 | 20 january 2001  | 1 - 0   | 2 - 0    | friendly          |\n|      3 | 20 january 2001  | 2 - 0   | 2 - 0    | friendly          |\n| **4**     | **15 march 2001**    | 3 - 1   | 3 - 1    | friendly          |\n|      5 | 14 july 2004     | 0 - 1   | 1 - 1    | 2004 copa am\u00e9rica |\n|      6 | 17 november 2004 | 2 - 1   | 2 - 1    | friendly          |\n\nThe row with `goal` number 4 is the fourth row.\n\n### Step 4: Check the Date for Goal Number 4\nNow, verify the `date` in the same row where `goal` is 4:\n\n- The date in this row is March 15, 2001.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe claim \"the date of the game that have a goal of 4 be march 15 , 2001\" matches the information found in the table.
