Since they have 9, this part of the claim is false.\n\n#### Part 2: Ranking\n\n- **Check the ranking for the United States:** In the table, the \"rank\" for \"united states (usa)\" is `1`.\n- **Verify if the rank corresponds to the swimming events of the 1952 Summer Olympics:** The table does not specify which Olympic Games or events these rankings and medal counts are from. It only lists ranks and medals without specifying the event.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The United States did not receive more than 10 medals; they received 9.\n- Although the United States ranked first, there is no information confirming that this ranking pertains specifically to swimming events at the 1952 Summer Olympics.\n\nBased on these evaluations:\n\n- **The claim \"united state of america get more than 10 medal and rank first during the swimming of 1952 summer olympics\"** is false because the condition of having more than 10 medals is not met, and there's no specific mention of the event or year in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index `1`, Column \"nation\": United States (USA)\n- Row index `1`, Column \"total\": 9\n- Row index `1`, Column \"rank\": 1\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated in two parts.
