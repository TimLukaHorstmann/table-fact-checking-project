    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to compare the term start date for Kostaq Kota's second term with the term end date of Pandeli Evangjeli.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We look at the row corresponding to \"kostaq kota (2nd time)\" for his term start date.\n   - We also need to check the row corresponding to \"pandeli evangjeli (2nd time)\" for his term end date.\n\n2. **Extract Term Dates:**\n   - For Kostaq Kota's second term:\n     - Term Start: 9 November 1936\n   - For Pandeli Evangjeli's second term:\n     - Term End: 16 October 1935\n\n3. **Compare the Dates:**\n   - We need to determine if \"9 November 1936\" (Kostaq Kota's start) is after \"16 October 1935\" (Pandeli Evangjeli's end).\n\n4. **Date Comparison:**\n   - 9 November 1936 is indeed after 16 October 1935.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that Kostaq Kota's term started on 9 November 1936, which is after Pandeli Evangjeli's term ended on 16 October 1935, is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the relevant rows for both individuals.
