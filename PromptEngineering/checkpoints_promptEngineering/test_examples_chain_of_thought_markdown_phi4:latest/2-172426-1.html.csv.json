    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Princess Mary of Charles I died before she turned 25\" is true or false, we need to analyze specific information from the table regarding Princess Mary's birth year, death year, and relationship with Charles I.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Princess Mary's Birth Year:**\n   - From the table, in row 1 under the \"name dates\" column, it lists \"mary, princess royal 1631 - 1660\". This indicates that Princess Mary was born in 1631.\n\n2. **Identify Princess Mary's Death Year:**\n   - Continuing from the same cell for name dates in row 1, \"Mary, princess royal 1631 - 1660\" also shows she died in 1660.\n\n3. **Calculate Her Age at Death:**\n   - To find her age at death, subtract her birth year (1631) from her death year (1660):  \n     \\( 1660 - 1631 = 29 \\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim is that she died before turning 25 years old.\n   - Since she was actually 29 at the time of her death, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Verify Relationship to Charles I:**\n   - From row 1 in the \"parent\" column, it lists \"Charles I 1600 - 1649\", confirming that Charles I was indeed Mary's father.\n   - Therefore, the statement contextually refers correctly to Princess Mary of Charles I.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is false because Princess Mary died at age 29, not before turning 25. The relevant cells for this determination are from row 1, specifically in the \"name dates\" and \"parent\" columns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Princess Mary was born in 1631 and died in 1660 as per the 'name dates' column in row 1. Calculating her age at death gives 29 years (1660 - 1631). The claim that she died before turning 25 is false because she lived to be 29. Additionally, Charles I is confirmed as her parent from the same row.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"parent\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
