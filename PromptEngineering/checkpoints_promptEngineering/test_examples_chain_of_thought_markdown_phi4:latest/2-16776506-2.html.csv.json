We need to find this date in the \"date\" column of the table.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Row**:\n   - Look through the rows for the entry with the date \"2 may 1999\". This corresponds to row index 1 in the table (considering the header as row 0).\n\n3. **Check the Surface Type**:\n   - In the identified row, locate the \"surface\" column to verify what type of surface was played on that day.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - According to the claim, the surface should be \"hard\". Compare this expected value with the actual value found in the table for confirmation.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- From the table, for the row where `date = 2 may 1999` (row index 1), we find that the `surface` column contains \"hard\".\n  \nThis confirms that on 2 May 1999, the surface was indeed hard, making the claim true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are located in row index 1 with column names \"date\" and \"surface\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate the date '2 may 1999' in the table.
