Therefore, we cannot directly determine which game was longest without additional information about start times or total play duration.\n\n4. **Evaluating Game 1:**\n   - Game 1 ended at 3:24 PM according to the `time` column.\n   - Without knowing the start time of each game, we cannot conclude that Game 1 had the longest duration.\n\n5. **Comparing with Other Games:**\n   - The end times for other games are:\n     - Game 2: 2:27 PM\n     - Game 3: 2:31 PM\n     - Game 4: 2:07 PM\n     - Game 5: 2:29 PM\n     - Game 6: 2:18 PM\n   - Based solely on end times, Game 1 ended the latest at 3:24 PM. However, this does not necessarily mean it was the longest game.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The table only provides end times and not start times or durations.\n   - Therefore, we cannot verify if the first game (Game 1) was indeed the longest without additional information about start times.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim that \"the first game of the 1977 World Series be the longest\" is based on incomplete data from the table.
