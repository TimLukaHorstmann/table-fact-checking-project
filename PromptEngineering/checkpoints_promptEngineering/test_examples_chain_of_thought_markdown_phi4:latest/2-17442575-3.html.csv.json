This corresponds to the fifth row in the table.\n\n2. **Identify the Home Team on April 17**:  \n   - In this row, check the \"home\" column. The entry here is \"chicago black hawks\".\n   - According to the claim, the home team should be \"the chicago black hawk\". This matches with our finding from the table.\n\n3. **Check the Record on April 17**:  \n   - Next, we look at the \"record\" column in the same row for April 17. The entry is \"2 - 3\".\n   - According to the claim, the record should be \"2 - 3\". This also matches with what is listed in the table.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both parts of the claim are verified against the table: the home team was indeed the Chicago Black Hawks, and the record was 2 - 3 on April 17.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index for April 17 is 5 (considering the header as row 0).\n- Columns relevant are \"home\" and \"record\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
