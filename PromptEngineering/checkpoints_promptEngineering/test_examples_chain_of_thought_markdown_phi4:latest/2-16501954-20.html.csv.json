Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - We are interested in verifying the team that occupies the \"first position.\" The column indicating the position in the ranking is named \"position.\"\n\n2. **Locate the First Position**:\n   - According to the table, we need to look at the row where the \"position\" column has a value of 1, as this represents the first position.\n\n3. **Examine the Row with Position 1**:\n   - In the table, the row corresponding to `position = 1` is:\n     ```\n     |   position | name               |   played |   drawn |   lost |   points |\n     |-----------:|:-------------------|---------:|--------:|-------:|---------:|\n     |          1 | ec amberg          |       12 |       1 |      0 |       23 |\n     ```\n\n4. **Check the Name in First Position**:\n   - The team listed under this row is \"ec amberg.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - Since \"ec amberg\" is indeed the name associated with the first position, the claim that \"ec amberg have the first position\" is correct.\n\n6. **List Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - The relevant cells to verify this information are located in the row where `position = 1`. Specifically, the cells of interest are those under columns: \"position\" and \"name.\"\n\nNow, let's put all of this into a JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the column 'position' to find out which team is in first place.
