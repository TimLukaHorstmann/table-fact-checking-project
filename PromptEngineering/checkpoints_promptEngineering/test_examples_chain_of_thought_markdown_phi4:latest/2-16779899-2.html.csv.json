We need to find the row corresponding to \"week 15\".\n\n2. **Check the Date and Opponent:**\n   - For week 15, verify that the date is indeed December 14, 1986.\n   - Confirm that the opponent listed matches any known details (though not necessary for verifying score/result).\n\n3. **Verify the Result:**\n   - The claim states that the result was a loss with a score of 34 - 3. We need to check the \"result\" column for week 15 to see if it indicates a loss (\"l\") and matches the score provided.\n\n4. **Compare the Score:**\n   - Ensure that the score mentioned in the claim (34 - 3) matches exactly with what is listed in the table for that game.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If all these details match, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply this reasoning to the table:\n\n- **Row for Week 15:**\n  - Date: December 14, 1986\n  - Opponent: Cleveland Browns\n  - Result: l 34 - 3 (indicating a loss with a score of 34 - 3)\n  - Attendance: 58062\n\nThe result \"l 34 - 3\" matches the claim exactly.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 15, Column \"week\": week 15\n- Row 15, Column \"date\": December 14, 1986\n- Row 15, Column \"opponent\": Cleveland Browns\n- Row 15, Column \"result\": l 34 - 3\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for week 15 shows a date of December 14, 1986, against the Cleveland Browns with a result of 'l 34 - 3', which matches the claim of a loss with that score.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
