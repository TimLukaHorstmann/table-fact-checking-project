We need to locate row corresponding to \"week 15\".\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data in Week 15**:\n   - Look at the row where \"week\" is 15.\n   - Check the \"attendance\" column for this specific row.\n\n3. **Verify Attendance Value**:\n   - The attendance value listed in the table for week 15 should be compared with the claim's value of 60,038.\n\n4. **Game Site Verification (Optional)**: \n   - Although not necessary to verify the attendance number, it is useful to confirm that the game took place at the Kingdome as stated in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- **Locate Week 15**: In row with \"week\" equal to 15:\n  - The table shows: \n    - Date: December 8\n    - Opponent: Seattle Seahawks\n    - Result: L 23 - 28\n    - Game Site: Kingdome\n    - Record: 10 - 5\n    - Attendance: 60,038\n\n- **Attendance Check**: The attendance value given for week 15 is 60,038.\n\n- **Game Site Confirmation**: The game site listed for week 15 is the Kingdome, matching the claim's location.\n\nThe claim states that in week 15, the attendance at the Kingdome was 60,038.
