    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"corinthian didn't tie any game in the 1924 season\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's analyze the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Team:**\n   - The team mentioned in the claim is \"corinthians.\"\n   - Locate \"corinthians\" in the table to find their row.\n   - In the table, \"corinthians\" is at position 1.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to check how many games \"corinthians\" drew (tied).\n   - Look for the column labeled \"drawn\" as it indicates the number of tied games.\n\n3. **Check the Value in the 'Drawn' Column:**\n   - For \"corinthians,\" row 1, column \"drawn\" shows a value.\n   - The value is `1`, indicating that \"corinthians\" drew one game.\n\n4. **Interpretation:**\n   - Since \"corinthians\" has drawn 1 game (as indicated by the number in the \"drawn\" column), they did tie at least one game during the season.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"corinthian didn't tie any game in the 1924 season\" is FALSE.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe analysis of the table shows that \"corinthians\" tied one game. Thus, the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate 'corinthians' in the table to find their row.
