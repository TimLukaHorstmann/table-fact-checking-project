Sewda: 130,161\n     2. Godah (Gohad): 166,893\n     3. Bhander: 139,600\n     4. Datia: 143,593\n     5. Ater: 177,334\n     6. Bhind: 197,183\n     7. Lahar: 205,839\n     8. Mehgaon: 210,649\n\n3. **Determine Ranks:**\n   - From the sorted list:\n     - The lowest number is Sewda with 130,161 electorates.\n     - The second lowest number is Bhander with 139,600 electorates.\n\n4. **Compare Claim Against Results:**\n   - According to our sorting and ranking, Sewda has the lowest number of electorates, not the second lowest.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"sewda have the second lowest number of electorate in 2009\" is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted the 'number of electorates (2009)' column and sorted the values to find ranks.
