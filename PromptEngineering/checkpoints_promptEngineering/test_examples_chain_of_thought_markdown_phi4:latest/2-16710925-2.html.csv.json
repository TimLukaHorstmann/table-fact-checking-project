According to the table, this is in the second row (week 2).\n\n2. **Check the opponent**: Verify that the game on September 26, 1971, was against the \"Los Angeles Rams\", which matches the entry in the table.\n\n3. **Verify the attendance figure**: Look at the attendance column for week 2 to see if it lists 57,895 as the attendance.\n\n4. **Compare with the claim**: The claim states that the attendance on September 26, 1971, was 57,895. We need to ensure this matches what is in the table.\n\nUpon reviewing the table:\n\n- For week 2 (September 26, 1971), the opponent is \"Los Angeles Rams\".\n- The result of the game is a tie (\"t 20 - 20\").\n- The attendance listed for this date is indeed 57,895.\n\nSince all these details align with the claim, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells from the table:\n- Row index: 2\n  - Date column: \"september 26 , 1971\"\n  - Opponent column: \"los angeles rams\"\n  - Attendance column: 57,895\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row for September 26, 1971 (week 2).
