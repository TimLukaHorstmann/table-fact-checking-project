Therefore, this part of the statement is inherently false.\n\n### Part 2: \"Russia wins more gold\"\n\n- According to the table:\n  - Netherlands won 10 gold medals.\n  - Russia won 8 gold medals.\n- Since 10 (Netherlands) is greater than 8 (Russia), Russia does not win more gold medals than the Netherlands. This part of the statement is also false.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth parts of the claim are false: \n1. The comparison in Part 1 is illogical as it compares the same entity against itself.\n2.
