This matches the count needed for \"half\" when considering a total of 22 episodes as per the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is consistent with the table information because Michael McDonald directed 11 episodes out of the 21 shown in the list, and this aligns with directing half of a total implied count of 22 episodes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, verified there are 21 episodes listed.
