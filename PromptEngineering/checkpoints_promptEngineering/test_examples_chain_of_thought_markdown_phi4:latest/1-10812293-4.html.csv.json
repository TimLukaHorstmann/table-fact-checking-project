    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"on December 23, TJ Ford was the highest scorer with 24 points\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the game played on December 23. According to the table, this is row 28.\n\n2. **Check the Date Column:**\n   - In row 28, the date column confirms that the game was played on \"December 23\".\n\n3. **Check the High Points Column for December 23 Game:**\n   - In row 28, under the \"high points\" column, it lists \"T J Ford (24)\".\n\n4. **Verify if TJ Ford Was Indeed the Highest Scorer:**\n   - Since the \"high points\" column explicitly mentions \"T J Ford (24)\", this indicates that he was indeed the highest scorer with 24 points in that game.\n\n5. **Cross-Check Other Players' Scores for December 23 Game:**\n   - The table does not list any other player's score for that specific game, confirming that TJ Ford had the most points.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information from row 28, TJ Ford was indeed the highest scorer with 24 points on December 23.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that TJ Ford scored the highest with 24 points on December 23.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on December 20th is true or false, we need to analyze the data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Game**:\n   - The claim pertains to \"game on december 20.\" From the table, this corresponds to row 26.\n\n2. **Locate the 'High Points' Data for December 20**:\n   - In the table, the column labeled \"high points\" shows the player(s) who scored the most points in a game and their respective scores.\n   - For row 26 (game on December 20), this cell contains \"fred jones (23)\".\n\n3. **Analyze the Claim**:\n   - The claim states: \"for game on december 20 , the high point get more than 25.\"\n   - This means we need to check if the highest points scored by a player in that game exceeded 25.\n\n4. **Compare Against the Claim**:\n   - Fred Jones, who had the highest points for this game, scored 23 points.\n   - Since 23 is not greater than 25, the claim that \"the high point get more than 25\" is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is FALSE.
