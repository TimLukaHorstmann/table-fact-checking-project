    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"in 1996 - 1999 there be a diesel engine with single-point fuel injection\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant sections of the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Diesel Engines:**\n   - The table is divided into two main categories: \"petrol engines\" and \"diesel engines.\" We are interested in the \"diesel engines\" section because the claim pertains to a diesel engine.\n\n2. **Examine Fuel System Type for Each Diesel Engine:**\n   - The \"fuel system\" column lists the type of fuel injection system used by each diesel model.\n   - Review the rows under \"diesel engines\" to determine the type of fuel system:\n     - 1.9 d (psa xud9): indirect injection\n     - 1.9 d (psa dw8): indirect injection\n     - 1.9 td (psa xud9): indirect injection\n     - 2.0 jtd (psa dw10): common rail direct injection\n     - 2.0 jtd 1 (psa dw10): common rail direct injection\n\n3. **Check the Years of Operation for Each Diesel Engine:**\n   - We need to find diesel engines that were in production between \"1996 - 1999.\"\n   - Identify models within this timeframe:\n     - 1.9 d (psa xud9) was available from 1996 to 1999.\n     - 1.9 td (psa xud9) was also available from 1996 to 1999.\n\n4. **Determine if Any Diesel Engine in the Specified Years Used Single-Point Fuel Injection:**\n   - From the fuel system column, none of the diesel engines listed use \"single-point fuel injection.\" They all use either \"indirect injection\" or \"common rail direct injection.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no diesel engine model from 1996 to 1999 uses single-point fuel injection, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Diesel Engines with Years and Fuel System:\n  - Row 4: { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"model\", \"value\": \"1.9 d\" }, { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years\", \"value\": \"1996 - 1999\" }, { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\", \"value\": \"indirect injection\" }\n  - Row 5: { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"model\", \"value\": \"1.9 d\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years\", \"value\": \"1999 - 2006\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\", \"value\": \"indirect injection\" }\n  - Row 6: { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"model\", \"value\": \"1.9 td\" }, { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years\", \"value\": \"1996 - 1999\" }, { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\", \"value\": \"indirect injection\" }\n  - Row 7: { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"model\", \"value\": \"2.0 jtd\" }, { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years\", \"value\": \"1999 - 2006\" }, { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\", \"value\": \"common rail direct injection\" }\n  - Row 8: { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"model\", \"value\": \"2.0 jtd 1\" }, { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years\", \"value\": \"2000 - 2006\" }, { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"fuel system\", \"value\": \"common rail direct injection\" }\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists diesel engines from 1996 to 1999 with their respective fuel systems.
