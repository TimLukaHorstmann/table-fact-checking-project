    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Scotland having stolen ends less than 9 and Craig Brown being the skip for the United States is true, we need to verify two parts of the statement using the provided table:\n\n1. **Part 1:** Check if Scotland has stolen ends less than 9.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to Scotland.\n   - In this row, look at the \"stolen ends\" column.\n\n2. **Part 2:** Verify that Craig Brown is indeed listed as the skip for the United States.\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the United States.\n   - Check the \"skip\" column for the name Craig Brown.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Part 1: Scotland's Stolen Ends\n- From the table, find the row where \"country\" is \"scotland\".\n- In this row, under the \"stolen ends\" column, the value is `10`.\n- The claim states that Scotland has stolen ends less than 9. Since 10 is not less than 9, this part of the claim is false.\n\n### Part 2: Craig Brown as Skip for United States\n- Locate the row where \"country\" is \"united states\".\n- In this row, under the \"skip\" column, the name listed is \"craig brown\".\n- This matches the claim that Craig Brown is the skip for the United States. Therefore, this part of the claim is true.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe overall claim requires both parts to be true:\n- Part 1 is false (Scotland does not have stolen ends less than 9).\n- Part 2 is true (Craig Brown is indeed the skip for the United States).\n\nSince one part of the claim is false, the entire claim is false.\n\nNow, let's identify the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- For Scotland's stolen ends: \n  - Row index corresponding to \"scotland\": 1\n  - Column name: \"stolen ends\"\n\n- For Craig Brown as skip for United States:\n  - Row index corresponding to \"united states\": 6\n  - Column name: \"skip\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked two parts: whether Scotland has stolen ends less than 9 and if Craig Brown is the skip for the United States.
