The game against LC Davis lasted 5 minutes.\n2. The game against LC Davis took place in the United States.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n#### Part 1: Duration Check\n- **Identify all matches with a duration of 5 minutes.**\n  - From the table, check the \"time\" column for entries that are exactly \"5:00\".\n  - Relevant rows:\n    - Row 2 (LC Davis): Time is \"5:00\"\n    - Row 3 (Jonatas Novaes): Time is \"5:00\"\n\n- **Conclusion:** There are indeed two matches with a duration of 5 minutes.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table for information related to the specific details mentioned in the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Record:**\n   - The claim mentions a game against \"kori trussel\" (note the typo; it should be \"trussell\"). We need to find this record in the table.\n   - In the table, the opponent \"kori trussell\" is listed in row 5.\n\n2. **Check the Method of Victory:**\n   - The claim states that the game ended by a \"rear naked choke submission.\"\n   - In row 5, under the \"method\" column, it shows \"submission (rear naked choke),\" which matches the claim.\n\n3. **Verify the Round Number:**\n   - The claim specifies that the game was in \"3 round.\"\n   - In row 5, under the \"round\" column, it is listed as 1, not 3. This does not match the claim.\n\n4. **Determine if It Was One of Two Such Games:**\n   - We need to check if there are any other games that ended with a \"rear naked choke submission.\"\n   - Row 4 lists the opponent \"mark sinclair\" with the method as \"submission (rear naked choke).\"\n   - Therefore, there are two games ending by rear naked choke submission.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - While there were indeed two games ending in a rear naked choke submission, the specific game against \"kori trussell\" did not occur in round 3, but rather in round 1.\n   - Hence, the claim is false because the round number does not match.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows a fight against 'kori trussell' that ended by submission (rear naked choke) in round 1.
