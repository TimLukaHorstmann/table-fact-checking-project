    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We are looking for two specific rows in the table where the \"attendance\" column matches 30,931 and 50,068.\n\n2. **Find Attendance Values:**\n   - Scan through the table row by row and locate the attendance values:\n     - The attendance of 30,931 is found in row 15 (week 15).\n     - The attendance of 50,068 is found in row 14 (week 14).\n\n3. **Determine Order of Occurrence:**\n   - Check the order of these rows based on the \"week\" column:\n     - Row 15 corresponds to week 15 with an attendance of 30,931.\n     - Row 14 corresponds to week 14 with an attendance of 50,068.\n\n4. **Analyze Temporal Sequence:**\n   - Since row 15 (week 15) comes after row 14 (week 14), the game with an attendance of 30,931 occurred after the game with an attendance of 50,068.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the game with an attendance of 30931 takes place before the game with an attendance of 50068.\"\n   - Based on our analysis, this is incorrect because the game with an attendance of 30,931 took place after the game with an attendance of 50,068.\n\n6. **Conclude:**\n   - The claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified the rows where the attendance matches 30931 and 50068. Row 15 has an attendance of 30931 (week 15), and row 14 has an attendance of 50068 (week 14). Since week 15 comes after week 14, the game with 30931 attendees occurred later than the game with 50068 attendees. Thus, the claim that the game with 30931 attendees took place before the game with 50068 attendees is FALSE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
