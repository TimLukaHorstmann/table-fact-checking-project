Therefore, this part of the claim is false.\n\n#### Women's 40 Event\n- We need to check each year from 1998 to 2008 for a match between Sydney Scorpions and Hunter Hornets in the \"Women's 40\" category.\n- **Year 2003**: The data shows \"Northern Eagles def Hunter Western Hornets,\" not Sydney Scorpions.\n- **Year 2004**: The data shows \"Sydney Scorpions def Northern Eagles,\" not Hunter Hornets.\n- **Year 2008**: The data shows \"Sydney Scorpions defeated Hunter Hornets.\"\n\nThe event where Sydney Scorpions defeated Hunter Hornets occurred in the Women's 40 category in 2008.
