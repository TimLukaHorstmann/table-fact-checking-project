A conclusion about the absence of a \"Constitutional ticket\".\n   - We need to focus on both the \"Republican ticket\" and the \"Constitutional ticket\" columns.\n\n2. **Locate Charles B. Sears in the Republican Ticket Column:**\n   - Scan the \"republican ticket\" column for the name \"Charles B. Sears.\"\n   - According to the table, Charles B. Sears is listed under the row labeled \"judge of the court of appeals.\"\n\n3. **Check the Constitutional Ticket for the Same Row:**\n   - In the same row where \"Charles B. Sears\" appears in the \"Republican ticket,\" check the \"Constitutional ticket\" column.\n   - The entry in the \"constitutional ticket\" column is \"(none).\"\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there wasn't a constitutional ticket when Charles B. Sears was on the Republican ticket.\n   - Since the \"Constitutional ticket\" entry for this row is \"(none),\" it confirms that no candidate from a Constitutional ticket was present.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the data, the claim is true because there indeed wasn't a constitutional ticket when Charles B.
