This will give us the point difference for that particular fight.\n\n4. **Compare Differences**:\n   - Compare these differences across all fights listed in the table to identify which fight had the largest difference.\n\n5. **Specific Fight Analysis**:\n   - Focus on the fight with Ricky Hatton: \n     - Result: `ko 2 / 12`\n     - Difference: Since it was a knockout (KO) at round 2, the scoring is not applicable as the fight did not go the distance. Therefore, there is no score difference to calculate.\n\n6. **Evaluate Other Fights**:\n   - Calculate differences for other fights:\n     - Chatchai Sasakul: `ko 8 / 12` \u2192 Difference = |8 - 12| = 4\n     - Lehlohonolo Ledwaba: `tko 6 / 12` \u2192 Difference = |6 - 12| = 6\n     - Marco Antonio Barrera: `tko 11 / 12` \u2192 Difference = |11 - 12| = 1\n     - Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez (first bout): `sd 12 / 12` \u2192 Split decision, difference is not straightforward but consider the highest score: |12 - 11| = 1 (assuming one judge scored it 11-10 for Pacquiao)\n     - David D\u00edaz: `tko 9 / 12` \u2192 Difference = |9 - 12| = 3\n\n7. **Determine Maximum Difference**:\n   - The largest difference calculated is 6, which occurred in the fight against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the fight with Ricky Hatton ended in a knockout and does not have a final scoring point difference, it cannot be considered to have the \"biggest difference\" in scoring points.\n   - The claim is false because the largest scoring point difference was against Lehlohonolo Ledwaba.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Row 3**: Result `tko 6 / 12` (Difference = 6)\n- **Row 8**: Result `ko 2 / 12` (No applicable difference)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine the biggest scoring point difference, we extracted and calculated differences from the 'result' column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate the score point differences for each bout listed in the table and compare them.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Score Differences**: \n   - The score difference in a fight can be determined by examining the result column. For knockouts (KO) or technical knockouts (TKO), the round number indicates when one fighter won, implying a significant score difference.\n   - For decisions such as \"sd\" (split decision), we need to infer that there was some scoring variation since it's not unanimous.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information**:\n   - We focus on each bout's result and try to deduce the score differences where possible.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Bout**:\n   - **Bout 1 & 2**: Manny Pacquiao vs. Chatchai Sasakul (KO 8/12)\n     - KO in round 8 suggests a significant score difference leading up to that point.\n   \n   - **Bout 3**: Manny Pacquiao vs. Lehlohonolo Ledwaba (TKO 6/12)\n     - TKO in round 6 also indicates a substantial lead on the judges' scores before this occurred.\n\n   - **Bout 4**: Manny Pacquiao vs. Marco Antonio Barrera (TKO 11/12)\n     - TKO in round 11 suggests that Pacquiao had built up a significant score advantage by the end of round 10, allowing him to win via TKO in the final round.\n\n   - **Bout 5 & 6**: Manny Pacquiao vs. Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez (SD 12/12)\n     - A split decision indicates that there was some difference in scores among judges, but it's not as decisive as a knockout or early TKO.\n\n   - **Bout 7**: Manny Pacquiao vs. David D\u00edaz (TKO 9/12)\n     - TKO in round 9 suggests a strong lead on the scorecards before this point.\n\n   - **Bout 8**: Manny Pacquiao vs. Ricky Hatton (KO 2/12)\n     - KO in round 2 implies an immediate and significant score difference as soon as the fight began.\n\n4. **Determine the Largest Score Difference**:\n   - The largest score differences typically occur with early knockouts or late TKOs.\n   - Knockout in round 2 (vs. Ricky Hatton) likely represents the biggest immediate score difference, but it doesn't accumulate over rounds like a late TKO.\n   - TKO in round 11 (vs. Marco Antonio Barrera) suggests a significant accumulation of points leading up to that point.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the knockout against Ricky Hatton was decisive and occurred early, the TKO against Marco Antonio Barrera at round 11 indicates a sustained lead over most of the fight.\n   - Therefore, the claim about having the biggest difference in score points during his bout with Marco Antonio Barrera is plausible due to the late-round TKO.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if the claim is true, we analyzed each bout's result to infer score differences.
