    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Baltimore Colt scored more on Nov 11 against the Miami Dolphins than on Nov 25\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant parts of the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - We need to look at two specific games:\n     - Game 11, played on November 11 against the Baltimore Colts.\n     - Game 13, played on November 25 against the Baltimore Colts.\n\n2. **Extract Opponents' Scores:**\n   - For Game 11 (Nov 11):\n     - The opponents' score is given in the \"opponents\" column for that game.\n     - According to the table, the opponents' score for Game 11 is `0`.\n   \n   - For Game 13 (Nov 25):\n     - Similarly, we look at the \"opponents\" column for Game 13.\n     - The opponents' score for Game 13 is `24`.\n\n3. **Compare the Scores:**\n   - On November 11, the Baltimore Colts scored `0` points against the Miami Dolphins.\n   - On November 25, the Baltimore Colts scored `24` points against the Miami Dolphins.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the Baltimore Colts scored more on November 11 than on November 25.\n   - Since `0` (Nov 11 score) is less than `24` (Nov 25 score), the claim is false.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - For Game 11, the relevant cell for opponents' score is at row index 10, column \"opponents\".\n   - For Game 13, the relevant cell for opponents' score is at row index 12, column \"opponents\".\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the game between the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets on September 30 having the highest attendance of the season is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Game**: The table mentions a game between the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets on September 30. This corresponds to row 5 in the table.\n\n2. **Check Attendance for This Game**: Look at the \"attendance\" column for this specific game (row 5). The attendance is recorded as 51,496.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Games' Attendances**: We need to check the attendance figures for all other games listed in the table to determine if any have a higher attendance than 51,496.\n\n4. **List of Attendance Figures**:\n   - Game 1: 69,441\n   - Game 2: 56,233\n   - Game 3: 46,187\n   - Game 4: 66,011\n   - Game 5: 51,496 (September 30 game)\n   - Game 6: 52,419\n   - Game 7: 45,597\n   - Game 8: 61,096\n   - Game 9: 47,741\n   - Game 10: 70,273\n   - Game 11: 50,193\n   - Game 12: 80,374\n   - Game 13: 38,016\n   - Game 14: 69,174\n   - Game 15: 78,087\n   - Game 16: 49,915\n\n5. **Determine the Highest Attendance**: From the list above, the highest attendance is for game 12 (Cleveland Browns) with 80,374.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claim that the September 30 game between the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets had the highest attendance of the season is false because there are other games with higher attendances, specifically game 12 with an attendance of 80,374.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - Attendance for September 30 game: Row 5, Column \"attendance\"\n   - Highest attendance: Row 12, Column \"attendance\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is about the game on September 30 between the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets having the highest attendance.
