    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the colt draft 3 player from oklahoma\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Round 3:**\n   - The claim specifies \"draft 3,\" which refers to the third round of the draft.\n   - Locate the row where `round` equals 3.\n\n2. **Check Player's College:**\n   - Once we identify the player from round 3, check their college affiliation.\n   - We are looking for a player whose college is \"oklahoma.\"\n\n3. **Verify Position and Name:**\n   - Confirm the name and position of the player to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row Identification:**\n  - The row where `round` equals 3 is:\n    ```\n    |   round |   pick |   overall | name          | position   | college       |\n    |--------:|-------:|----------:|:--------------|:-----------|:--------------|\n    |       3 |      1 |        26 | buck mcphail  | fullback   | oklahoma      |\n    ```\n\n- **College Verification:**\n  - The player in round 3 is \"buck mcphail.\"\n  - The college listed for this player is \"oklahoma.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the Colt's third-round draft pick was from Oklahoma.
