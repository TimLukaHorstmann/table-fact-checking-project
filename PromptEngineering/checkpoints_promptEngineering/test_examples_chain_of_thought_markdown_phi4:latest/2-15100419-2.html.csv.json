    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be no defensive end pick and an overall smaller than 2\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for any instances of a player with the position \"defensive end\" who has an \"overall\" pick number less than 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The claim involves two columns: `position` and `overall`.\n   - We are specifically interested in entries where `position` is \"defensive end\".\n\n2. **Check Each Row for Conditions:**\n   - Examine each row to see if the position is \"defensive end\".\n   - For rows that match this condition, check if the `overall` pick number is less than 2.\n\n3. **Analyze Table Rows:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - `position`: linebacker\n     - `overall`: 2\n     - Not a defensive end.\n   \n   - **Row 2:** \n     - `position`: defensive end\n     - `overall`: 33\n     - Matches the position condition but has an overall pick greater than 2.\n\n   - **Row 3:**\n     - `position`: center\n     - `overall`: 60\n     - Not a defensive end.\n   \n   - **Row 4:**\n     - `position`: cornerback\n     - `overall`: 63\n     - Not a defensive end.\n   \n   - **Row 5:**\n     - `position`: wide receiver\n     - `overall`: 110\n     - Not a defensive end.\n\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - `position`: guard\n     - `overall`: 146\n     - Not a defensive end.\n\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - `position`: defensive back\n     - `overall`: 170\n     - Not a defensive end.\n   \n   - **Row 8:**\n     - `position`: wide receiver\n     - `overall`: 185\n     - Not a defensive end.\n\n   - **Row 9:**\n     - `position`: wide receiver\n     - `overall`: 227\n     - Not a defensive end.\n\n   - **Row 10:**\n     - `position`: wide receiver\n     - `overall`: 228\n     - Not a defensive end.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only row with a \"defensive end\" is Row 2, where the overall pick number is 33.\n   - There are no rows where the position is \"defensive end\" and the overall pick number is less than 2.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was analyzed to find any row with a 'defensive end' in the position column and an 'overall' pick number smaller than 2. The only defensive end listed (Row 2) has an overall pick of 33, which is greater than 2. Therefore, there are no entries meeting both conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
