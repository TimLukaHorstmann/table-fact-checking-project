Whether Jacques Laffite drove a Ferrari.\n\nLet's go through the table systematically:\n\n- **Row 1 (Clay Regazzoni)**: The constructor is \"ferrari\". This indicates that this driver did not use a Ford vehicle.\n  \n- **Rows 2 to 14**: For each driver, check the \"constructor\" column:\n  - Patrick Depailler: \"tyrrell - ford\"\n  - Jochen Mass: \"mclaren - ford\"\n  - Ronnie Peterson: \"lotus - ford\"\n  - John Watson: \"surtees - ford\"\n  - Carlos Pace: \"brabham - ford\"\n  - Tom Pryce: \"shadow - ford\"\n  - James Hunt: \"hesketh - ford\"\n  - Chris Amon: \"ensign - ford\"\n  - Jacques Laffite: \"williams - ford\" (This contradicts the claim that he drove a Ferrari)\n  - Vittorio Brambilla: \"march - ford\"\n  - Rolf Stommelen: \"hill - ford\"\n  - Tony Trimmer: \"maki - ford\"\n  - Jo Vonlanthen: \"williams - ford\"\n\n- **Row 15 (Jean-Pierre Jarier)**: The constructor is \"shadow - ford\". This indicates a Ford vehicle.\n  \n- **Row 16 (Emerson Fittipaldi)**: The constructor is \"mclaren - ford\". This also indicates a Ford vehicle.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can conclude:\n- Clay Regazzoni did not drive a Ford vehicle; he drove a Ferrari.\n- Jacques Laffite actually drove a Williams-Ford, contradicting the claim that he drove a Ferrari.\n\nThus, the claim \"a ford vehicle be use by every driver except for 1 , jacques laffite , and he drive a ferrari\" is FALSE.
