This means we are looking for the qualifying score (qual) for the year 1961 in the table.\n\n2. **Identify the Year Column:**\n   - First, locate the column labeled \"year\" to identify where the years are listed. The relevant data is in the first column of the table.\n\n3. **Locate the Row for 1961:**\n   - Search through the \"year\" column to find the row corresponding to the year 1961. \n   - In the table, the first row contains the year 1961.\n\n4. **Check the Qualifying Score Column:**\n   - Identify the column labeled \"qual\" which represents the qualifying scores.\n   - The relevant data is in the third column of the table.\n\n5. **Compare the Qualifying Score for 1961:**\n   - Look at the value in the \"qual\" column for the row where the year is 1961.\n   - According to the table, the qualifying score for 1961 is indeed 145.144.\n\n6. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the qualifying score for 1961 should be 145.144.\n   - Since our examination of the table confirms this value, the claim is accurate.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those in the row where the year is 1961 and the column for qualifying scores.\n   - Specifically, these are:\n     - Row index 0 (first row), Column \"year\" with value 1961\n     - Row index 0, Column \"qual\" with value 145.144\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is true as the table confirms that the qualifying score for 1961 is indeed 145.144.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that the qualifying score for 1961 is 145.144.
