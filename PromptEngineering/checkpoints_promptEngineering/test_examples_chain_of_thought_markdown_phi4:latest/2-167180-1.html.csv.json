We need to locate his name in the 'director(s)' column of the table.\n\n2. **Locate M Night Shyamalan**: By examining the 'director(s)' column, we find that M Night Shyamalan is associated with the row where the title is \"Signs\".\n\n3. **Check the Rank for M Night Shyamalan's Film**: In the row corresponding to the movie \"Signs\", we need to check the value in the 'rank' column.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states that when M Night Shyamalan is the director, the rank should be 7. We will compare this with the actual rank found in step 3.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the rank for \"Signs\" is indeed 7, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- In row 7, under 'title', we have \"Signs\".\n- The corresponding 'director(s)' is M Night Shyamalan.\n- The 'rank' for this movie is 7.\n\nSince all conditions of the claim are satisfied (M Night Shyamalan directed a film with rank 7), the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
