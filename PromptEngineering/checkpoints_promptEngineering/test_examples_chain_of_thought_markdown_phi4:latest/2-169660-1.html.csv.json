Since the table shows exactly 4.4 million and not more, the condition of being \"over\" 4.4 million is not met.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the data provided in the table, the claim is false because the number of viewers is exactly 4.4 million, not over it.\n\nNow, let's structure this reasoning into a JSON format as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the event date 'December 8, 2012' in the table. Locate the row with this date which corresponds to the event 'henderson vs diaz.' Check the viewers column for this row and find that it lists exactly 4.4 million viewers. The claim states the number should be over 4.4 million, but since it is precisely 4.4 million, the condition of being 'over' is not satisfied.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\", \"value\": \"december 8 , 2012\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\", \"value\": \"henderson vs diaz\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"viewers\", \"value\": \"4.4 million\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
