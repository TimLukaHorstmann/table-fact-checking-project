The \"date of vacancy\" for this record matches 28 February 2011.\n\nLet's go through the relevant steps to assess the claim based on the given table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Position in Table as 10th:**\n   - We need to locate any row where the \"position in table\" column has the value \"10th\".\n\n2. **Check Manner of Departure for Resignation:**\n   - For the identified rows, check if the \"manner of departure\" is \"resigned\".\n\n3. **Verify Date of Vacancy:**\n   - Confirm if the \"date of vacancy\" in these cases is 28 February 2011.\n\n### Table Analysis:\n\n- **Row by Row Check:**\n\n  - **Row 1 (Uni\u00e3o de Leiria):** \n    - Position: Off-season\n    - Manner: Sacked\n\n  - **Row 2 (Mar\u00edtimo):**\n    - Position: 15th\n    - Manner: Sacked\n\n  - **Row 3 (Naval 1 de Maio):**\n    - Position: 14th\n    - Manner: Sacked\n\n  - **Row 4 (Acad\u00e9mica):**\n    - Position: 9th\n    - Manner: Resigned\n\n  - **Row 5 (Naval 1 de Maio):**\n    - Position: 16th\n    - Manner: Sacked\n\n  - **Row 6 (Portimonense):**\n    - Position: 16th\n    - Manner: Sacked\n\n  - **Row 7 (Acad\u00e9mica):**\n    - Position: 13th\n    - Manner: Resigned\n\n  - **Row 8 (Sporting):**\n    - Position: 3rd\n    - Manner: Resigned\n\n  - **Row 9 (Beira-Mar):** \n    - **Position:** 10th\n    - **Manner:** Resigned\n    - **Date of Vacancy:** 28 February 2011\n    - This row meets all three conditions.\n\n  - **Row 10 (Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal):**\n    - Position: 14th\n    - Manner: Sacked\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is verified by Row 9, where the position in the table was \"10th\", the manner of departure was \"resigned\", and the date of vacancy was indeed 28 February 2011.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified row 9 (Beira-Mar) where 'position in table' is 10th, 'manner of departure' is resigned, and 'date of vacancy' is 28 February 2011.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position in table\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
