Count these occurrences.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Week 1**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 2**: Game site is \"georgia dome\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 3**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 4**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 5**: Game site is \"lincoln financial field\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 6**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 7**: Game site is \"ralph wilson stadium\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 8**: No data provided (bye week)\n- **Week 9**: Game site is \"texas stadium\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 10**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 11**: Game site is \"ericsson stadium\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 12**: Game site is \"pro player stadium\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 13**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 14**: Game site is \"giants stadium\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 15**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n- **Week 16**: Game site is \"soldier field\" \u2192 Away game\n- **Week 17**: Game site is \"fedex field\" \u2192 Home game\n\n### Counting the Home Games:\nBy counting all instances where the game site was \"fedex field,\" we find:\n\n- Weeks with home games: 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 17\n\nThis totals **8 home games**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the redskin play 10 home game in 2003\" is FALSE because they played only 8 home games according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked each row to see if the 'game site' was 'fedex field'.
