    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"when New York be the opponent, the score be 111 - 106\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for New York as Opponent:**\n   - We need to look through the \"opponent\" column to find an entry where the opponent is \"new york.\"\n\n2. **Verify the Score in That Row:**\n   - Once we identify the row with \"new york\" as the opponent, check the \"score\" column to see if it matches \"111 - 106.\"\n\n3. **Check for Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that the score and opponent match exactly as stated in the claim.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1. Locate New York in the \"opponent\" column:\n   - The entry with \"new york\" as the opponent is found on row 12 of the table.\n\n2.

This does not match our target score of \"114 - 106\".\n\n4. **Continue Checking Other Rows**:\n   - Proceed to row 13: The score is \"108 - 123\".\n   - Row 14: The score is \"142 - 113\".\n   - Row 15: The score is \"115 - 116\".\n   - Row 16: The score is \"125 - 130\".\n   - Row 17: The score is \"89 - 119\".\n   - Row 18: The score is \"111 - 106\".\n   - Row 19: The score is \"129 - 121\".\n   - Row 20: The score is \"114 - 96\".\n\n5. **Identify the Correct Score**:\n   - In row 21, the score is \"111 - 118\".\n   - In row 22, the score is \"99 - 102\".\n   - In row 23, the score is \"94 - 91\".\n   - Finally, in row 12 (rechecked), the score is \"113 - 106\".
