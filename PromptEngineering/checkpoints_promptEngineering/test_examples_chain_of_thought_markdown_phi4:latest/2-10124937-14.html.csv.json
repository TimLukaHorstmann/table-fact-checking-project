    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Marseille's first leg score is true, we need to examine the table for the row corresponding to \"marseille.\" Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: The table lists several teams in the column labeled \"team 1.\" We need to find the row where \"marseille\" appears as team 1.\n\n2. **Locate \"marseille\" in \"team 1\" column**:\n   - By scanning through the \"team 1\" column, we identify that \"marseille\" is listed in one of the rows.\n\n3. **Find Marseille's row index**:\n   - The row where \"marseille\" appears as team 1 is the last row of the table (7th row if counting from 0).\n\n4. **Check the first leg score for this row**:\n   - In the identified row, look at the column labeled \"1st leg.\" \n   - According to the table, the first leg score for Marseille against Zenit St Petersburg is listed as \"3 - 1.\"\n\n5. **Verify the claim**: \n   - The claim states: \"when marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3 - 1.\"\n   - From our examination of the table, when Marseille was the first team in their match-up, the first leg score indeed was \"3 - 1.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - The claim is consistent with the data presented in the table.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate 'marseille' in the 'team 1' column.
