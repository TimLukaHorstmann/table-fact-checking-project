Based on the pattern, \"lq\" represents a loss in qualifying rounds, and other abbreviations like \"a\", \"1r\", \"2r\", etc., indicate different stages of performance.\n\n3. **Extract Liu Song's Performance:**\n   - **2007/08 Column:**\n     - In this column, we find the following relevant entries for Liu Song:\n       - 4th row: \"lq\"\n       - 6th row: \"1r\" (indicating reaching the first round)\n       - 7th row: \"qf\" (quarterfinals)\n\n   - **2009/10 Column:**\n     - In this column, we find:\n       - 4th row: \"lq\"\n       - 5th row: \"1r\" (first round)\n       - 8th row: \"3r\" (third round)\n\n4. **Compare Performances:**\n   - For the season 2007/08, Liu Song reached at least as far as the quarterfinals (\"qf\") in one of his entries.\n   - For the season 2009/10, the highest achievement noted is reaching the third round (\"3r\").\n   - Comparing \"qf\" (quarterfinals) to \"3r\" (third round), Liu Song performed better in the 2007/08 season.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Liu Song was \"not rank higher in 2007 / 08 than in 2009 / 10.\" Since we determined he did achieve a higher ranking in 2007/08 (\"qf\" vs. \"3r\"), the statement is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Liu Song's performance in 2007/08 includes reaching the quarterfinals ('qf'), while in 2009/10, his best result was reaching the third round ('3r').

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Liu Song's ranking change between 2010/11 and 2011/12 is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We are interested in the rankings for Liu Song (assumed as a specific player) for the seasons 2010/11 and 2011/12.\n   - The first column represents the year, while subsequent columns represent different tournament types or ranking statuses.\n\n2. **Locate Liu Song's Ranking:**\n   - We need to find the row where Liu Song's rankings are recorded. Since specific names aren't given in this table, we will assume that each row represents a player and look for consistent patterns.\n   \n3. **Examine Rankings for 2010/11:**\n   - For the 2010/11 season, identify the ranking status from the data under \"ranking tournaments\" or similar categories.\n\n4. **Examine Rankings for 2011/12:**\n   - Similarly, locate Liu Song's ranking in the 2011/12 column.\n\n5. **Compare Rankings:**\n   - Check if there is a decrease of five places between these two seasons.\n\n6. **Identify Patterns and Consistent Entries:**\n   - We need to determine which row consistently contains Liu Song\u2019s data across multiple years for accurate comparison.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Looking at the table, each row appears to represent a different player's performance over various tournaments.\n- Let's focus on the \"ranking tournaments\" or similar columns as they are likely to contain ranking information:\n  - For 2010/11, look at all relevant columns and find consistent entries for Liu Song (assumed).\n  - Repeat for 2011/12.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Row Analysis:**\n  - We will assume a pattern where one row consistently has ranking changes across years. Let's analyze potential rows:\n  \n- **Row-by-row Check for Ranking Change:**\n  - Identify the row with consistent data across seasons.\n  - Assume Liu Song is represented by a specific row (e.g., Row 7 based on common patterns in such tables).\n\n- **Row 7 Analysis:**\n  - For 2010/11:\n    - \"a\" under ranking tournaments.\n  - For 2011/12:\n    - \"lq\" under ranking tournaments.\n\n- **Ranking Interpretation:**\n  - Typically, \"a\" might stand for a higher rank or qualification status (e.g., advanced stage).\n  - \"lq\" could mean \"lost in qualifying,\" indicating a lower position.\n  \n- **Conclusion on Ranking Change:**\n  - If \"a\" corresponds to a better ranking than \"lq\", then Liu Song did fall in rank.\n  - The exact numerical change isn't provided, but the qualitative change suggests a drop.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n- Based on the typical interpretation of these abbreviations and assuming consistent data representation:\n  - Liu Song's rank fell between 2010/11 and 2011/12.\n  - However, without explicit numerical rankings, we cannot confirm a \"5 place\" drop specifically.\n\nThus, the claim that Liu Song fell exactly five places is not verifiable with the given data. The evidence only supports a qualitative drop in ranking.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant columns for ranking tournaments and assumed consistent row representation across years.
