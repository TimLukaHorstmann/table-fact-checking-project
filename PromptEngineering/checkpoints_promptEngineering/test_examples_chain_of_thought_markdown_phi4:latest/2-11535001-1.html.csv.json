    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, let's break down the steps required to evaluate it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that more points were scored by the winning team in a 2011 World Cup qualification match in Bolivia than in a 2013 match.\n   \n2. **Identify Relevant Matches**:\n   - We need to find matches from the table related to the 2011 and 2013 FIFA World Cup qualifications.\n\n3. **Check for Matches in Bolivia**:\n   - The claim specifies that the 2011 match should be in Bolivia, but our task is to evaluate based on available data.\n   - From the table, there are two matches dated June 15, 2008, at Estadio Hernando Siles in La Paz, Bolivia, both for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. There are no matches listed for 2011 or 2013 in Bolivia.\n\n4. **Extract Information from Relevant Matches**:\n   - For the 2011 match: \n     - Date: 11 October 2011\n     - Venue: Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\n     - Score: 3 - 0\n     - Result: 4 - 2 (This means the home team scored a total of 4 goals and the away team scored 2 goals.)\n   - For the 2013 match:\n     - Date: 15 October 2013\n     - Venue: Estadio Monumental, Santiago, Chile\n     - Score: 2 - 0\n     - Result: 2 - 1 (This means the home team scored a total of 2 goals and the away team scored 1 goal.)\n\n5. **Determine Winning Teams**:\n   - For the 2011 match, the final result was 4 - 2. The home team won by scoring 4 goals.\n   - For the 2013 match, the final result was 2 - 1. The home team won by scoring 2 goals.\n\n6. **Compare Goals Scored by Winning Teams**:\n   - In the 2011 match, the winning team (home team) scored 4 goals.\n   - In the 2013 match, the winning team (home team) scored 2 goals.\n   \n7. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim refers to a non-existent 2011 qualification match in Bolivia but does compare the scores of the matches listed for 2011 and 2013 in Chile.\n   - Based on available data: More points were indeed scored by the winning team (4 goals) in the 2011 match than in the 2013 match (2 goals).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is evaluated based on the matches listed, despite the mismatch about Bolivia. The statement holds true when comparing the scores of the specified matches.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we identified that no 2011 World Cup qualification match was held in Bolivia according to the table.
