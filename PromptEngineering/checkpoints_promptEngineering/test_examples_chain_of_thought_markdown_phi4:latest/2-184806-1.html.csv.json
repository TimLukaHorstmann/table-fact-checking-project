From the table, this is the \"language\" column.\n\n2. **Extract Unique Languages**: List all the entries in the \"language\" column and identify the unique ones:\n   - Dutch\n   - English\n   - Spanish\n   - German\n   - Norwegian\n   - French\n   - Portuguese\n   - Italian\n   - Danish\n   - Finnish\n   - Croatian\n\n3. **Count Unique Languages**: Count the number of unique languages identified in the previous step.\n   - There are 11 unique languages.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states there were \"10 different language[s] of song perform[ed].\" We have found 11 unique languages, which is more than 10.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the number of unique languages (11) does not match the claim of 10, the statement is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells are all those in the \"language\" column:\n\n- Row 1: Dutch\n- Row 2: English\n- Row 3: Spanish\n- Row 4: English\n- Row 5: German\n- Row 6: German\n- Row 7: Norwegian\n- Row 8: Dutch\n- Row 9: French\n- Row 10: English\n- Row 11: French\n- Row 12: Portuguese\n- Row 13: Italian\n- Row 14: Danish\n- Row 15: French\n- Row 16: Finnish\n- Row 17: Croatian\n- Row 18: French\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'language' column in the table.\",\n    \"List all entries under the 'language' column and identify unique languages.\",\n    \"Count the number of unique languages, which is 11.\",\n    \"Compare this count with the claim that states there were 10 different languages.\",\n    \"Since 11 does not equal 10, the statement is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"language\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"language\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
