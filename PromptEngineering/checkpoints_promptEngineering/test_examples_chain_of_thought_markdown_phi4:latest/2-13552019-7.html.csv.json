If it's not specified who played against whom directly but indicates a result for them, it counts.\n\n3. **Count Games:**\n   - Count each entry that represents a game involving the Cubs. This includes all entries in the \"date\" column where a game is recorded (ignoring empty rows).\n\n4. **Verify Total:**\n   - Compare the count of games to 28 to determine if they played exactly 28 games.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Row Examination:**\n  - September 1: Game against Braves\n  - September 2: Game against Braves\n  - September 3: Game against Braves\n  - September 4: Game against Mets\n  - September 5: Game against Mets\n  - September 6: Game against Phillies\n  - September 7: Game against Phillies\n  - September 8: Game against Cardinals\n  - September 9: Game against Cardinals\n  - September 10: Game against Cardinals\n  - September 11: Game against Expos\n  - September 12: Game against Expos\n  - September 13: Game against Expos\n  - September 15: Game against Pirates\n  - September 16: Game against Pirates\n  - September 17: Game against Pirates\n  - September 18: Game against Mets\n  - September 19: Game against Mets\n  - September 20: Game against Phillies\n  - September 21: Game against Phillies\n  - September 22: Game against Pirates\n  - September 23: Game against Pirates\n  - September 24: Game against Pirates\n  - September 25: Game against Expos\n  - September 26: Game against Expos\n  - September 27: Game against Expos\n  - September 29: Game against Cardinals\n  - September 30: Game against Cardinals\n\n- **Count the Games:**\n  - There are 28 entries in the table for games played by the Cubs in September.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The total number of games listed is 28, matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we examined each row in the table to count how many games are recorded for the Cubs in September.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the Cubs lost all games in September of 1989\" is true or false, we need to evaluate the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - We need to focus on the 'loss' column because it indicates which team's pitcher recorded a loss for each game.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Game Played by the Cubs:**\n   - The table lists games played in September, so we will look at each row and check if the 'loss' column mentions a pitcher from the Cubs (often indicated by their name).\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Row:**\n   - **September 1:** Loss was recorded by Wilson (5-3). Since Wilson is typically associated with the Atlanta Braves in this context, it's not a Cubs loss.\n   - **September 2:** Loss was recorded by Clary (4-3). Again, not associated with the Cubs.\n   - **September 3:** Loss was recorded by Bielecki (14-6), not a Cubs player.\n   - **September 4 to September 7:** Opponents were Mets and Phillies. The losses were recorded by Cone, Williams, Maddux, and Howell, respectively; none are Cubs players.\n   - **September 8 to September 10:** Opponent was Cardinals. Losses were recorded by Williams (twice) and Hill (7-12). No indication that these are Cubs pitchers.\n   - **September 11 to September 13:** Opponents were Expos. The losses were by Langston, B Smith, and Gross; none indicate Cubs players.\n   - **September 15 to September 17:** Opponent was Pirates. Losses recorded by Belinda, Maddux, and Bielecki; none are from the Cubs.\n   - **September 18 to September 19:** Opponents were Mets again. Losses were recorded by Viola and Wilson; neither is a Cubs player in this context.\n   - **September 20 to September 21:** Opponent was Phillies. The losses were by Lancaster and Mulholland, not Cubs players.\n   - **September 22 to September 24:** Opponent was Pirates again. Losses recorded by Drabek, Bair, and Robinson; none indicate Cubs pitchers.\n   - **September 25 to September 27:** Opponents were Expos. The losses were by Sanderson, Den Martinez, and Thompson; none suggest Cubs players.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - In no instance within the table is a loss recorded for the Cubs in any game they played against an opponent in September of 1989. The pitcher names associated with losses are not linked to the Cubs based on this data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the evaluation, there is no evidence from the provided table that supports the claim that \"the Cubs lost all games in September of 1989.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'loss' column was examined for each game played by the Cubs.
