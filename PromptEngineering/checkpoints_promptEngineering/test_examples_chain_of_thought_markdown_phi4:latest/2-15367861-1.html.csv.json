    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians receiving less than 11 losses when they amassed 22 points is true or false, let's examine the relevant information from the table:\n\n1. **Locate Corinthians' Data**:\n   - According to the table, Corinthians are listed in row 6.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Information for Corinthians**:\n   - Points: In column \"points,\" Corinthians have amassed 22 points.\n   - Losses: In column \"lost,\" Corinthians have lost 10 matches.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Corinthians received less than 11 losses when they amass 22 points.\n   - From our extracted data, Corinthians indeed have 10 losses and 22 points.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Corinthians' losses (10) are less than 11, the claim is true.\n\nRelevant cells from the table for this evaluation are:\n\n- Row index 6, column \"points\" with value 22.\n- Row index 6, column \"lost\" with value 10.\n\nThus, the chain of thought leads us to conclude that the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Corinthians is true, we need to analyze the provided table data:\n\n### Claim:\n\"There be zero loss that Corinthians received when they scored over 25 points.\"\n\n### Steps for Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Corinthians' Data:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"corinthians\" in the table.\n   - Extract relevant information such as `points`, `played`, `drawn`, `lost`, and `against`.\n\n2. **Understand Key Metrics:**\n   - The total points are calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Points} = 3 \\times (\\text{won}) + 1 \\times (\\text{drawn})\n     \\]\n   - From the table, Corinthians have:\n     - Points: 22\n     - Played: 22\n     - Drawn: 2\n     - Lost: 10\n\n3. **Calculate Wins for Corinthians:**\n   - Using the formula for total points:\n     \\[\n     22 = 3 \\times (\\text{won}) + 1 \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - Solving for wins:\n     \\[\n     22 = 3 \\times (\\text{won}) + 2 \\\\\n     20 = 3 \\times (\\text{won}) \\\\\n     \\text{won} = \\frac{20}{3} = 6.67\n     \\]\n   - Since the number of wins must be an integer, Corinthians won 6 matches.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Goals Scored:**\n   - To find out if they scored over 25 points in any match where they did not lose:\n     - Use the `difference` and `against` columns.\n     - The `difference` is calculated as:\n       \\[\n       \\text{difference} = (\\text{scored}) - (\\text{against})\n       \\]\n   - For Corinthians, difference is -20 and against is 51.\n   - Calculate scored goals:\n     \\[\n     \\text{scored} = \\text{difference} + \\text{against} = -20 + 51 = 31\n     \\]\n\n5. **Analyze Matches Won or Drawn:**\n   - Corinthians won 6 matches and drew 2.\n   - In these 8 non-loss games, they scored a total of 31 goals.\n\n6. **Average Goals per Non-Loss Game:**\n   - Average goals in non-loss games:\n     \\[\n     \\text{average} = \\frac{\\text{total scored}}{\\text{non-loss games}} = \\frac{31}{8} \\approx 3.875\n     \\]\n   - This average suggests that it is possible for Corinthians to have scored over 25 points in at least one non-loss game.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states there were zero losses when they scored over 25 points.\n   - Since the total goals scored in non-loss games is 31, and considering the distribution of scores across these games, it's plausible that Corinthians scored more than 25 points in at least one game without losing.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Corinthians have a total of 22 points from 6 wins and 2 draws over 22 matches.
