However, there are exceptions:\n\n- Mika Kallio completed only 19 laps (row 18).\n- Imre Toth completed only 9 laps (row 21).\n- Karel Abraham completed only 7 laps (row 22).\n- Aleix Espargaro completed only 2 laps (row 23).\n\nThus, not all riders completed exactly 23 laps.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Grid Positions\n\nNow, let's check the grid positions to see if they are greater than 20:\n\n- The highest grid position in the table is 24 for Doni Tata Pradita (row 21).\n- All other grid positions range from 1 to 22.\n\nTherefore, not all riders have a grid position greater than 20. In fact, most grid positions are less than or equal to 20.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because:\n1. Not all riders completed exactly 23 laps.\n2. Not all riders started with a grid position greater than 20.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo support this conclusion, the relevant cells from the table include:\n\n- Laps column for Mika Kallio (row 18), Imre Toth (row 21), Karel Abraham (row 22), and Aleix Espargaro (row 23).\n- Grid column for any row where the grid position is greater than 20, which only applies to Doni Tata Pradita (row 21).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires all riders to have completed exactly 23 laps and have a starting grid position greater than 20.
