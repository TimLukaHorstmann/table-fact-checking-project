    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Peter Oosterhuis is true, we need to verify two aspects from the table: his place and the money he earned.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Peter Oosterhuis in the Table**:\n   - We scan through the \"player\" column to find an entry for \"peter oosterhuis\".\n   - In row 7, we find that the player is indeed Peter Oosterhuis.\n\n2. **Verify Peter Oosterhuis's Place**:\n   - According to the table, in row 7, under the \"place\" column, it states \"t7\", which confirms his place as t7.\n\n3. **Check Peter Oosterhuis's Earnings**:\n   - In the same row (row 7), we look at the \"money\" column.\n   - The value listed is 7500, not 10875 as claimed.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The claim states that Peter Oosterhuis has a place of t7 and earns 10875. While his place of t7 is correct, the amount he earned (7500) does not match the claimed 10875.\n- Therefore, the claim is FALSE because only one part of it is accurate.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this claim are:\n- Row 7, \"place\": \"t7\"\n- Row 7, \"money\": \"7500\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
