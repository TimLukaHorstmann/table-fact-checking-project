This corresponds to the last row of the provided data.\n\n2. **Check the Record Column**:\n   - In this row, check the value in the \"record\" column. The table shows that for May 30th, the record is \"28 - 24\".\n\n3. **Verify Against Claim**:\n   - Compare the extracted record \"28 - 24\" with the claim \"28 - 24\".
