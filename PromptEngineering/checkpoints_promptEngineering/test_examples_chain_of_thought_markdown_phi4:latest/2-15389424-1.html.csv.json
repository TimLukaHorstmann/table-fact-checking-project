    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Minas Gerais lost the most games in total\" is true, we need to analyze the table and focus on the 'lost' column for each team.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - We are interested in the number of games lost by each team, which is represented by the \"lost\" column in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Values from the \"Lost\" Column:**\n   - Corinthians: 2\n   - Palestra Italia - SP: 3\n   - S\u00edrio: 3\n   - Paulistano: 6\n   - AA das Palmeiras: 7\n   - Ypiranga - SP: 8\n   - Minas Gerais: 10\n   - AA S\u00e3o Bento: 11\n\n3. **Compare the Values in the \"Lost\" Column:**\n   - We need to find which team has the highest number of losses.\n   - By comparing the numbers, we see:\n     - The smallest value is 2 (Corinthians).\n     - The largest value is 11 (AA S\u00e3o Bento).\n\n4. **Determine if Minas Gerais Has the Most Losses:**\n   - Minas Gerais has lost 10 games.\n   - AA S\u00e3o Bento has lost more games, with a total of 11 losses.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"Minas Gerais lost the most games in total\" is false because AA S\u00e3o Bento has more losses (11) than Minas Gerais (10).\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Minas Gerais: Row index 7, Column name \"lost\", Value 10\n- AA S\u00e3o Bento: Row index 8, Column name \"lost\", Value 11\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if the claim is true, we checked the 'lost' column for each team.
