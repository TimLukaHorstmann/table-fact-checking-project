    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's evaluate it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that any team with 3 losses has 0 ties.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to check the \"losses\" column for teams with exactly 3 losses.\n   - For each of these teams, we will verify the corresponding value in the \"ties\" column to see if it is indeed 0.\n\n3. **Extract Data from Table**:\n   - The table provides information on five teams: Montreal Hockey Club, Ottawa Hockey Club, Montreal Victorias, Quebec Hockey Club, and Montreal Crystals.\n   - We need to examine each team's losses and ties.\n\n4. **Check Each Team with 3 Losses**:\n   - **Montreal Hockey Club**: \n     - Losses = 3\n     - Ties = 0\n   - **Ottawa Hockey Club**: \n     - Losses = 3\n     - Ties = 0\n   - **Montreal Victorias**: \n     - Losses = 3\n     - Ties = 0\n   - **Quebec Hockey Club**: \n     - Losses = 3\n     - Ties = 0\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - All teams with exactly 3 losses have 0 ties.\n   - There are no other teams in the table with 3 losses that have a different number of ties.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The claim is TRUE because all teams with 3 losses indeed have 0 ties.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that any team with 3 losses has 0 ties.\",\n    \"Identify teams with exactly 3 losses from the 'losses' column.\",\n    \"Check the corresponding 'ties' value for these teams.\",\n    \"Montreal Hockey Club, Ottawa Hockey Club, Montreal Victorias, and Quebec Hockey Club all have 3 losses and 0 ties.\",\n    \"All identified teams satisfy the condition of having 0 ties when they have 3 losses.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
