We need to identify entries where the number of \"wins\" is greater than zero because only those rows are relevant to evaluate the average points per win.\n\n2. **Search for Team Entries Involving Alberto Pagani**: The claim mentions Alberto Pagani, so we must determine which team or teams he was associated with in this context.
