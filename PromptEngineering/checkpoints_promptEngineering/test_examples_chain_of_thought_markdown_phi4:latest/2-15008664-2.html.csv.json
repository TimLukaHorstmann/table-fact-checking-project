The relevant matches and records from those matches clearly show that the combined record between these two teams does not match the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify games against New York Giants: Week 10 (L), Week 14 (W).\",\n    \"Calculate Eagles' record in these games: 1-1-0.\",\n    \"The claim of '12 - 10 - 1' for the Giants is incorrect based on these results.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
