    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech be the only worship leaders who be feature on multiple songs\" is true or false, we need to examine each row of the table for instances where these individuals are listed as \"worship leader.\" We also need to ensure that no other worship leader appears more than once. Here\u2019s how we can approach this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Instances of Worship Leaders:**\n   - Look at each row in the \"worship leader\" column and note down every occurrence for Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, Darlene Zschech, and any other worship leaders.\n\n2. **Count Appearances:**\n   - Count how many times Reuben Morgan appears as a worship leader.\n   - Count how many times Jad Gillies appears as a worship leader.\n   - Count how many times Darlene Zschech appears as a worship leader.\n   - Check if any other worship leaders appear more than once.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - If Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech are the only ones appearing more than once, then the claim is true.\n   - If another worship leader appears more than once or if one of these three does not appear multiple times, then the claim is false.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Reuben Morgan**:\n  - Appears as a worship leader in rows: 6, 8, 12, and 13. (4 appearances)\n\n- **Jad Gillies**:\n  - Appears as a worship leader in row: 4 and 10. (2 appearances)\n\n- **Darlene Zschech**:\n  - Appears as a worship leader in rows: 3, 6, 8, and 12. (4 appearances)\n\n- **Other Worship Leaders**:\n  - Joel Houston appears in row 1.\n  - Toni Romero appears in row 2.\n  - Brooke Fraser appears in row 11.\n  - Dave Ware appears in row 7.\n  - Matt Crocker appears in row 9.\n\nEach of the other worship leaders appears only once, confirming that no one else besides Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech is featured as a worship leader on multiple songs.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is true because Reuben Morgan, Jad Gillies, and Darlene Zschech are indeed the only worship leaders who appear more than once in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Reuben Morgan appears in rows 6, 8, 12, and 13.
