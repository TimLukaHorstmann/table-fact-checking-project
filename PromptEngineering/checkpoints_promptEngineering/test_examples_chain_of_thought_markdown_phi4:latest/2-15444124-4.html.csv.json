    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the statement and check it against the table data.\n\n### Claim Analysis:\n\"The gp / g in 2003, when the number of total point be mark as did not play always have 1 goal\"\n\nThis implies two conditions for the year 2003:\n1. The \"gp / gs\" should indicate games played or started.\n2. There should be exactly 1 goal scored.\n\n### Steps to Verify:\n\n1. **Identify the row for 2003:**\n   - Locate the row where `year` is `2003`.\n\n2. **Check \"total points\":**\n   - According to the claim, in years when \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play,\" there should always be exactly 1 goal.\n\n3. **Verify conditions for 2003:**\n   - Check if \"total points\" for 2003 is \"did not play.\"\n   - Check the number of goals scored in 2003.\n   - Check the \"gp / gs\" for 2003 to see if it indicates any games played or started.\n\n### Table Data Verification:\n\n- **Row for 2003:**\n  - `year`: 2003\n  - `gp / gs`: did not play\n  - `goals`: did not play\n  - `total points`: did not play\n\nFrom the table:\n- The \"total points\" for 2003 are marked as \"did not play.\"\n- The number of goals is also marked as \"did not play,\" which means it is not equal to 1.\n- The \"gp / gs\" is marked as \"did not play,\" indicating no games played or started.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that when \"total points\" are \"did not play,\" there should always be exactly 1 goal. However, in 2003, both \"goals\" and \"total points\" are marked as \"did not play,\" which contradicts the requirement of having exactly 1 goal.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Year: 2003\n  - `gp / gs`: did not play\n  - `goals`: did not play\n  - `total points`: did not play\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that in years where 'total points' are marked as 'did not play,' there should always be exactly 1 goal.
