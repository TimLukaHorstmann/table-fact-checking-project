Not Israel.\n   - **Row 2 (25 March 1998)**: Venue is \"bala\u00eddos, vigo, spain\". Not Israel.\n   - **Row 3 (14 October 1998)**: Venue is \"ramat gan, tel aviv, israel\". This match is in Israel.\n   - **Row 4 (31 March 1999)**: Venue is \"olimpico, serravalle, san marino\". Not Israel.\n   - **Rows 5 & 6 (5 June 1999)**: Both venues are \"el madrigal, vila-real, spain\". Not Israel.\n   - **Row 7 (18 June 2000)**: Venue is \"amsterdam arena, amsterdam, netherlands\". Not Israel.\n   - **Row 8 (2 September 2000)**: Venue is \"ko\u0161evo, sarajevo, bosnia and herzegovina\". Not Israel.\n   - **Row 9 (29 March 2003)**: Venue is \"olimpiyskiy, kiev, ukraine\".
