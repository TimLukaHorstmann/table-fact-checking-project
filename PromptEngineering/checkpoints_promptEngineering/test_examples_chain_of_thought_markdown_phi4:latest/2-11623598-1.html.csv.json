    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Bob Carmichael won every tournament he played with Brian Teacher\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for any instances where Bob Carmichael partnered with Brian Teacher and check their outcomes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Partnerships**: We need to identify all rows in the table where Bob Carmichael's partner was Brian Teacher.\n   \n2. **Check Outcomes**: For each identified partnership, we will verify the outcome of the tournament (whether it was a win or a loss).\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**: If there are any instances where they were \"runner-up,\" then the claim is false.\n\n### Examination:\n\n- **Row 24**: \n  - Partner: Brian Teacher\n  - Outcome: Runner-up in Miami, US (1978)\n  \n- **Row 32**:\n  - Partner: Brian Teacher\n  - Outcome: Runner-up in Washington Indoor, US (1979)\n\n- **Row 33**:\n  - Partner: Brian Teacher\n  - Outcome: Runner-up in Stuttgart Indoor, Germany (1979)\n\nIn all the instances where Bob Carmichael played with Brian Teacher, they were \"runner-up,\" meaning they did not win any of these tournaments.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are no records of wins when Bob Carmichael partnered with Brian Teacher, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify all rows where Bob Carmichael's partner was Brian Teacher.
