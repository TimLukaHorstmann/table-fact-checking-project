    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify two parts of it:\n\n1. Brendan Melnyk is listed as the lead.\n2. Ted Appelman is listed as the third/vice skip.\n\nWe will examine the relevant rows in the table for these conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Brendan Melnyk's Role**:\n   - Look through each row to find where Brendan Melnyk appears.\n   - Find him in the \"lead\" column, which corresponds to Ted Appelman (row 10).\n   \n2. **Verify Brendan Melnyk as Lead**:\n   - In row 10, Brendan Melnyk is indeed listed under the \"lead\" column.\n\n3. **Identify Ted Appelman's Role**:\n   - Look through each row for where Ted Appelman appears.\n   - Find him in the \"skip\" column (row 10).\n\n4. **Verify Ted Appelman as Third/Vice Skip**:\n   - In row 10, Ted Appelman is listed under the \"third / vice skip\" column.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are satisfied based on these observations:\n\n- Brendan Melnyk is correctly identified as the lead in row 10.\n- Ted Appelman is correctly identified as the third/vice skip in row 10.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe claim is TRUE.
