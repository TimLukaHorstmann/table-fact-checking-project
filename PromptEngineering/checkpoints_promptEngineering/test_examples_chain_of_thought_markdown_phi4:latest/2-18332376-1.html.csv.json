The years listed are consecutive from 1975 to 2013, but skip 2000 entirely.\n\n4. **Conclusion on Claim:**\n   - Since Antonio Pompa-Baldi was first in 1999 but there is no competition recorded for 2000, he could not have been first in 2000.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"antonio pompa - baldi italy be first in 1999 and 2000\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Cell for 1999:**\n  - Row index corresponding to year 1999, column name \"first.\"\n  \n- **Absence of Cell for 2000:**\n  - No row exists for the year 2000, hence no cell is relevant here.\n\nHere's the JSON representation of the reasoning and conclusion:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table confirms Antonio Pompa-Baldi was first in 1999.
