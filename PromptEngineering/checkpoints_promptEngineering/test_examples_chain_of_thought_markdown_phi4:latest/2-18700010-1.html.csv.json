Here's how I approached the task step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Tommy Smith's League Goals**: \n   - Locate Tommy Smith in the table and find his \"league goals.\"\n   - From the table, Tommy Smith is in the last row with 0 league goals.\n\n2. **Compare Tommy Smith's League Goals to Other Players**:\n   - Look at each player\u2019s number of league goals from the column \"league goals\" for all players.\n   - Record these values: \n     - Jim Branagan: 0\n     - Malcolm Brown: 2\n     - David Cowling: 10\n     - Peter Fletcher: 17\n     - Keith Hanvey: 2\n     - Peter Hart: 4\n     - Ian Holmes: 3\n     - Steve Kindon: 14\n     - Mick Laverick: 4\n     - Bernard Purdie: 0\n     - Andy Rankin: 0\n     - Ian Robins: 25\n     - Fred Robinson: 1\n     - Tommy Smith: 0 (already identified)\n     - Brian Stanton: 9\n     - Alan Starling: 0\n     - Dave Sutton: 6\n     - Chris Topping: 0\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Number of League Goals**:\n   - Identify which player has the highest number of league goals.\n   - Ian Robins has the most with 25 league goals.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Tommy Smith scored 0 league goals and another player, Ian Robins, scored more (25), the claim that \"Tommy Smith has the highest number of league goals\" is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification**:\n   - Locate cells containing league goal data:\n     - Tommy Smith: Row 15, Column \"league goals\"\n     - Other players with relevant high scores for comparison (e.g., Ian Robins): Row 13, Column \"league goals\"\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate Tommy Smith and note his league goals are 0.\",\n    \"Review all other players' league goals to find the highest.\",\n    \"Ian Robins has the most with 25 league goals, higher than Tommy Smith's 0.\",\n    \"Thus, the claim is false because another player scored more league goals.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"league goals\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
