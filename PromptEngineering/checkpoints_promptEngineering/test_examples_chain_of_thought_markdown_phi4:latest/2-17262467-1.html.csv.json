    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Carlos Kirmayr did not win a championship between 1976 and 1980\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Time Frame**: The claim specifies the years 1976 to 1980. We should focus on the rows in the table that fall within this period.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for These Years**:\n   - **Row 1 (Year 1976)**: \n     - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n     - This indicates Carlos Kirmayr did not win the championship in 1976.\n   - **Row 2 (Year 1979)**:\n     - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n     - This indicates Carlos Kirmayr did not win the championship in 1979.\n   - **Row 3 (Year 1980)**:\n     - Outcome: \"runner-up\"\n     - This indicates Carlos Kirmayr did not win the championship in 1980.\n\n3. **Conclude Based on Outcomes**:\n   - In each of the relevant years (1976, 1979, and 1980), the outcome is \"runner-up\". This means that during these years, Carlos Kirmayr reached the finals but did not win.\n   \n4. **Determine the Truth Value of the Claim**:\n   - Since Carlos Kirmayr was a runner-up in each year from 1976 to 1980 and did not win any championships during this period, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists outcomes for Carlos Kirmayr as 'runner-up' for the years 1976, 1979, and 1980.
