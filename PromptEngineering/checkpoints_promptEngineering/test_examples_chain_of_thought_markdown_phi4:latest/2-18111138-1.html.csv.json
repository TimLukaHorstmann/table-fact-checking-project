From the table, locate Rashid Budaj to find which club he was coaching.\n   - Look for \"rashid budaj\" in the \"coach\" column.\n\n2. **Determine Season Performance**: Once we identify Rashid Budaj's team, check their performance in the 2007-2008 season from the corresponding row under the \"2007 - 2008 season\" column.\n   - Check if the description indicates an undefeated season (like \"champions\") or provides specific standings that would imply any losses.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data**: \n   - Rashid Budaj is listed as the coach of \"al tadamon\".\n   - The performance for al tadamon in the 2007-2008 season is noted as \"6th\".\n\n4. **Evaluate Undefeated Claim**:\n   - An undefeated season typically means a team did not lose any matches, often resulting in being champions or having no losses.\n   - A position of \"6th\" indicates that al tadamon had some losses, as they were not at the top and hence cannot be considered undefeated.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information in the table, Rashid Budaj's team finished 6th, which means they did lose matches during the season.
