    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"more than 3 drivers have to retire because of a gearbox issue\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for entries where the cause of retirement is specifically due to a gearbox problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Retirement Reasons:**\n   - We need to find rows in the table where the \"time / retired\" column specifies a gearbox issue.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - Check each row for entries under the \"time / retired\" column that mention \"gearbox.\"\n\n3. **Count Gearbox Retirements:**\n   - Tally the number of drivers whose retirement reason is explicitly due to a gearbox issue.\n\n4. **Compare Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states \"more than 3 drivers.\" We need at least 4 drivers with a gearbox issue for the claim to be true.\n\n5. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - List the specific cells (row and column) where a gearbox issue is noted.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Row 21:** Bertrand Gachot, \"gearbox\"\n- **Row 28:** Andrea Montermini, \"gearbox\"\n- **Row 32:** Jos Verstappen, \"gearbox\"\n\nFrom the analysis, we find that there are exactly 3 drivers who retired due to a gearbox issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states \"more than 3 drivers,\" but only 3 drivers have retired because of a gearbox issue. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where 'time / retired' mentions 'gearbox'.
