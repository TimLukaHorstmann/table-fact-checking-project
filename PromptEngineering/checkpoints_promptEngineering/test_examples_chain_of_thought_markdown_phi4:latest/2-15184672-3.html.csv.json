In the table, these correspond to columns \"8:30\" and \"9:00\".\n\n2. **Locate the entry for \"black - out\" at 8:30**:\n   - At the time slot of 8:30 (column \"8:30\"), in the row that corresponds to the programs listed vertically starting with \"venture\", we find \"black - out\". This can be identified as follows:\n     - Row index starts from the second group of rows containing program names, which are the third main block of text.\n     - The entry for \"black - out\" is located in the row labeled under the title heading at 8:30.\n\n3. **Locate the entry for \"black - out\" at 9:00**:\n   - At the time slot of 9:00 (column \"9:00\"), again, we find \"black - out\" listed directly below its counterpart at 8:30.\n     - This is in the same row as identified previously, simply one column over.\n\n4. **Check for consistency across these columns**:\n   - Both time slots 8:30 and 9:00 have \"black - out\" in the same row (the third main block of text), indicating they are listed on the same channel at both times.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on the analysis**:\n   - Since \"black - out\" appears consecutively from 8:30 to 9:00 on the same row, it confirms that it is indeed broadcasted on the same channel for both time slots mentioned in the claim.\n\nBy identifying and comparing these entries, we can conclude that the claim is true.
