    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Simona de Silvestro's qualifying times is true or false, let's evaluate the statement step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - The claim states that \"Simona de Silvestro have the best time of 1:31:327 in qual 1.\"\n   - We need to verify two things:\n     - Simona de Silvestro's Qualifying 1 (qual 1) time.\n     - Whether this time is indeed 1:31.327.\n\n2. **Locate Simona de Silvestro in the Table:**\n   - By examining the table, we find Simona de Silvestro listed under the \"name\" column with:\n     - `team`: walker racing\n     - `qual 1`: 1:33.298\n     - `qual 2`: 1:31.327\n     - `best`: 1:31.327\n\n3. **Evaluate Qualifying Times:**\n   - Simona de Silvestro's qualifying times are:\n     - **Qualifying 1 (qual 1):** 1:33.298\n     - **Qualifying 2 (qual 2):** 1:31.327\n     - **Best time:** 1:31.327\n\n4. **Assess the Claim:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions that Simona de Silvestro has a best qualifying time of \"1:31:327 in qual 1.\"\n   - Her recorded Qualifying 1 time is 1:33.298, not 1:31.327.\n   - Therefore, the statement claiming her best time was achieved in Qualifying 1 is incorrect.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that Simona de Silvestro's best qualifying time of 1:31.327 came from Qualifying 1 is false because her best time indeed corresponds to Qualifying 2, not Qualifying 1.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row corresponding to Simona de Silvestro:\n     - `row_index`: 8\n     - Column names: \"qual 1\", \"best\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that Simona de Silvestro's best qualifying time of 1:31.327 came from Qualifying 1.\",\n    \"Identify her qualifying times from the table.\",\n    \"Simona de Silvestro has a Qualifying 1 time of 1:33.298 and a Qualifying 2 time of 1:31.327, which is also her best time.\",\n    \"Since her best time is from Qualifying 2, not Qualifying 1, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"qual 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"best\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
