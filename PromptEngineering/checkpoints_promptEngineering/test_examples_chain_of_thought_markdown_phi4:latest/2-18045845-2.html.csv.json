We need to find this row in the table.\n   \n2. **Locate the Row**:\n   - Upon examining the table, we locate the row with the date \"23 January 2010\".\n\n3. **Check the Result Column**: \n   - For the date \"23 January 2010\", check the \"result\" column to see if it matches \"d\" (which stands for draw).\n\n4. **Verify the Competition Type**:\n   - The claim specifies that this match was a \"friendly competition\". We need to verify the type of competition in the corresponding row.\n\n5. **Cross-Verification**:\n   - From the table, we observe that on \"23 January 2010\", the result is indeed \"d\" and the competition type is \"friendly\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the examination of the table, both conditions specified in the claim are satisfied: the result is a draw (\"d\") and the competition type is \"friendly\". Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- The relevant cell for the date is at row index 2 (third row).\n- Columns involved are \"result\" with value \"d\" and \"competition\" with value \"friendly\".\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a match on '23 January 2010' that was a draw ('d') in a friendly competition.
