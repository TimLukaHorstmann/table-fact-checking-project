We must locate this date within the table.\n   - Looking at the `date` column, April 16 is indeed present and corresponds to row index 3.\n\n2. **Verify Series Status**:\n   - According to the claim, the series should be at \"2 - 0\" on April 16.\n   - In row 3 (April 16), the `series` column shows \"2 - 2\". This indicates that the series is tied, not leading with a score of 2 - 0 for either team.\n\n3. **Check Attendance**:\n   - The claim mentions an attendance figure of 17,113.\n   - In row 3 (April 16), the `attendance` column shows \"17113\", which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Determine Home and Visitor Teams**:\n   - According to the claim, Detroit should be the visiting team on April 16.\n   - The `visitor` column in row 3 indicates \"detroit\", confirming that Detroit is indeed the visitor on this date.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- While two components of the claim (attendance and the visiting team) match the details from the table for April 16, the series score does not.
