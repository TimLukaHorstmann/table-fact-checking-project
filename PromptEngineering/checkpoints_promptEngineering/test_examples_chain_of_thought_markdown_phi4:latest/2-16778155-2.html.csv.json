Identify all rows where the attendance is 62170.\n2. Check if any of these rows have the opponent listed as \"dallas cowboys\".\n3. Verify whether this match happens during week 10.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Look for the row with an attendance of 62170 in the table:\n\n  - By examining the attendance column, we find that one entry shows an attendance of 62170.\n  \n- **Relevant Data from Step 1:**\n  - Week: 11\n  - Date: November 12, 2000\n  - Opponent: dallas cowboys\n  - Result: l 23 - 6\n\n- **Step 2:** Check the opponent in the row with attendance of 62170:\n  \n  - In this row, the opponent is \"dallas cowboys\", which matches part of our claim.\n\n- **Relevant Data from Step 2:**\n  - The data confirms that the opponent for the given attendance is indeed \"dallas cowboys\".\n\n- **Step 3:** Verify if this information corresponds to week 10:\n\n  - From the identified row, we see that it occurs during Week 11, not Week 10.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim states that when the attendance was 62170, the opponent was the Dallas Cowboys for week 10.
