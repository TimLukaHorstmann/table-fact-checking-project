    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Essendon having the highest score as a home team in the 1977 season is true or false, we need to analyze the data presented in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Table Context:**\n   - The table lists various matches with their respective scores, venues, and dates.\n   - All the games listed are from a single date: 24 April 1965.\n\n2. **Locate Essendon's Entry:**\n   - Find the row where \"essendon\" is mentioned as the home team.\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row 2 shows Essendon with a score of 20.18 (138).\n\n3. **Compare Scores for Home Teams in the Table:**\n   - We need to compare all home team scores from this specific date to determine if Essendon's score is the highest among them.\n   - Scores as per the table:\n     - Melbourne: 11.14 (80)\n     - Essendon: 20.18 (138)\n     - Collingwood: 11.13 (79)\n     - Carlton: 8.11 (59)\n     - South Melbourne: 7.9 (51)\n     - Footscray: 8.6 (54)\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Score in This Context:**\n   - From the scores listed, Essendon's score of 20.18 (138) is indeed the highest among all home team scores on this date.\n\n5. **Analyze Claim about 1977 Season:**\n   - The claim pertains to the \"1977 season,\" but all data in the table is from 24 April 1965.\n   - There is no information provided for the 1977 season, so we cannot verify if Essendon had the highest score as a home team in that year.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the lack of data regarding the 1977 season and focusing solely on the date mentioned (24 April 1965), the claim about the 1977 season cannot be validated with this table.\n   - Therefore, based on available information, the claim is false as it pertains to a different year than provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table only provides data from 24 April 1965.
