We need to look at the row where \"red cliffs\" is listed.\n\n2. **Check the 'Byes' Column**: According to the claim, \"red cliff have no bye\". In the table:\n   - For \"red cliffs\", the value under the \"byes\" column is 0.\n   - This matches the condition of having no byes (i.e., 0).\n\n3. **Check the 'Losses' Column**: The claim states that \"red cliffs\" have less than 4 losses.\n   - For \"red cliffs\", the value under the \"losses\" column is 18.\n   - 18 is not less than 4, so this condition is NOT satisfied.\n\n4. **Check the 'Against' Column**: The claim mentions that \"red cliffs\" have more than 2494 points against them.\n   - For \"red cliffs\", the value under the \"against\" column is 2422.\n   - 2422 is not greater than 2494, so this condition is NOT satisfied.\n\nSince two out of three conditions specified in the claim are not met (\"less than 4 losses\" and \"more than 2494 against\"), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells for verification:\n- Row corresponding to \"red cliffs\":\n  - \"byes\": 0 (matches the condition)\n  - \"losses\": 18 (does NOT match the condition of less than 4)\n  - \"against\": 2422 (does NOT match the condition of more than 2494)\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team 'red cliffs' from the table.\",\n    \"Check the 'byes' column for 'red cliffs': The value is 0, matching the condition of having no byes.\",\n    \"Check the 'losses' column for 'red cliffs': The value is 18, which does not satisfy the condition of less than 4 losses.\",\n    \"Check the 'against' column for 'red cliffs': The value is 2422, which does not satisfy the condition of more than 2494 against.\",\n    \"Since two conditions are not satisfied, the claim is FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"byes\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
