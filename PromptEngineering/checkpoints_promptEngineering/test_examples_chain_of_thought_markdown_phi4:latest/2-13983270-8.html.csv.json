    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"79 - 50 be record on august 24\" is true or false, we need to examine the records for each game played on August 24. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Date**: Locate the row where the date is August 24.\n2. **Locate the Record Column**: Find the \"record\" column in that row to see what it states.\n3. **Verify Against the Claim**: Compare the record found with the claimed record of \"79 - 50\".\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Date**:\n   - Look for the row where the date is August 24.\n\n2. **Locate the Record Column**:\n   - In the identified row, check the value in the \"record\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the record should be \"79 - 50\" on August 24.\n   - From the table, on August 24, the record is listed as \"79 - 50\".\n\nSince the record on August 24 matches the claimed record of \"79 - 50\", the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's specify the relevant cell:\n\n- The relevant cell for this verification is in row index 23 (considering zero-based indexing) and the column named \"record\".\n\nHere is the final answer formatted as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
