Otherwise, it is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Team with Nickname 'Blue Hose':**\n   - Looking through the table, we find that Presbyterian College has the nickname \"blue hose.\"\n\n2. **Check the Year of Joining for Presbyterian College:**\n   - For Presbyterian College, the \"joined\" column shows the year 1965.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim:**\n   - Since both conditions are satisfied (Presbyterian College's nickname is \"blue hose,\" and they joined in 1965), the claim is true.\n\nFinally, let's list the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- Presbyterian College:\n  - Row index: 19\n  - Column name: \"nickname\" with value \"blue hose\"\n  - Column name: \"joined\" with value \"1965\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the team with the nickname 'blue hose' by checking each row's 'nickname' column.
