    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all the Canadian player[s] play the same position\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for entries involving players with Canadian nationality and check their positions.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Canadian Players**: \n   - We look at the column \"nationality\" to find rows where the value is \"canada\".\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - Row 1: curtis lazar, position \"centre / right wing\"\n   - Row 4: ben harpur, position \"defense\"\n   - Row 5: vincent dunn, position \"centre\"\n\n3. **Compare Positions**:\n   - Curtis Lazar plays as a \"centre / right wing\".\n   - Ben Harpur plays in \"defense\".\n   - Vincent Dunn plays as a \"centre\".\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that all Canadian players play the same position.\n   - Since Curtis Lazar, Ben Harpur, and Vincent Dunn have different positions (\"centre / right wing\", \"defense\", and \"centre\" respectively), they do not all play the same position.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the Canadian players listed in the table occupy different positions. The relevant cells that support this conclusion are those that provide information about the nationality and position of each player identified as Canadian.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Canadian players by checking the 'nationality' column. Extracted rows for these players to compare their 'position'. Found different positions among Curtis Lazar ('centre / right wing'), Ben Harpur ('defense'), and Vincent Dunn ('centre').
