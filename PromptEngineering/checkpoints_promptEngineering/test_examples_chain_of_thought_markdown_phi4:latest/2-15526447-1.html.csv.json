    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Austria winning three championships from 1990 to 1998 is true or false, let's analyze the table data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Championship Winners:**\n   - The \"champion\" column in the table lists the country and drivers who won each season.\n\n2. **Check Each Year for Austrian Wins:**\n   - For 1990: Champion is Portugal.\n   - For 1991: Champion is Portugal.\n   - For 1992: Champion is Netherlands.\n   - For 1993: Champion is Austria (Martin Albrecht, Hubert Stromberger).\n   - For 1994: Champion is Netherlands.\n   - For 1995: Champion is Portugal.\n   - For 1996: Champion is Germany.\n   - For 1997: Champion is Italy.\n   - For 1998: Champion is Great Britain.\n\n3. **Count Austrian Wins:**\n   - Austria won only once, in the year 1993.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that Austria won three championships from 1990 to 1998. However, according to the table data, Austria only won one championship during this period.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - Row index 3 (Year 1993) under the \"champion\" column shows Austria as the winner.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyzed each year from 1990 to 1998 in the 'champion' column of the table.
