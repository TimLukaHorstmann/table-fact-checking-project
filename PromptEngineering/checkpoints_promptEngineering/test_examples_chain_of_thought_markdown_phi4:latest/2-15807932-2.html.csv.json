Therefore, no country with a rank smaller than 2 should have exactly 1 gold medal.\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Look at the \"rank\" column to identify countries with ranks smaller than 2.\n   - Check their corresponding \"gold\" medal counts.\n\n3. **Evaluate Row by Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - Rank: 1\n     - Gold: 5\n     - Since the gold count is not 1, this row does not violate the claim.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no countries with a rank smaller than 2 and exactly 1 gold medal in the table.\n\nThus, the claim is true because there is no country that has 1 gold medal and a rank smaller than 2.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1, \"rank\": 1\n- Row 1, \"gold\": 5\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, check if any country with a rank smaller than 2 has exactly 1 gold medal.

Therefore, we will focus on the \"bronze\" column in the table.\n\n2. **Examine each row under the \"bronze\" column**:\n   - Row 1 (Japan): The value is 4 bronze medals.\n   - Row 2 (Netherlands): The value is 1 bronze medal.\n   - Row 3 (Germany): The value is 2 bronze medals.\n   - Row 4 (South Korea): The value is 2 bronze medals.\n   - Row 5 (Soviet Union): The value is 2 bronze medals.\n   - Row 6 (Great Britain): The value is 1 bronze medal.\n\n3. **Check for a count of 4**: We observe that only Japan has a count of 4 bronze medals, as indicated in row 1.\n\n4. **Interpret the claim**: The claim states \"there be no country that have 4 bronze medal,\" which implies there should not exist any country with exactly 4 bronze medals.
