    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"w 109 - 101 (ot) be the score on April 8\" is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**: The claim pertains to a game played on April 8. We need to find the row in the table where the \"date\" column matches \"april 8\".\n\n2. **Locate the date**: \n   - In the table, the row with `row_index` 75 has the date \"april 8\". \n\n3. **Check the score for this game**:\n   - For `row_index` 75, the \"score\" column shows \"w 109 - 101 (ot)\". This matches the score mentioned in the claim.\n\n4. **Verify other details to ensure accuracy**:\n   - The result (\"w\") indicates a win, which is consistent with the claim.\n   - The game was played against \"atlanta\", as shown in the same row.\n   - All other columns for this row do not affect the verification of the score.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim matches exactly with the data provided in the table for April 8.
