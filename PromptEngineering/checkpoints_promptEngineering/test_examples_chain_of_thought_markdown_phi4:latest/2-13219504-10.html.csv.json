The highest total of runs scored by any team across both innings usually determines the winner.\n   - Each row in the table represents a partnership during an innings. We need to sum up the runs for each innings.\n\n3. **Grouping Data by Date and Venue:**\n   - By observing the dates, we can see that matches are played on specific days:\n     - 2007-09-11\n     - 2007-09-12\n     - 2007-09-13\n     - 2007-09-14\n     - 2007-09-16\n     - 2007-09-17\n     - 2007-09-18\n\n4. **Calculating Runs for Each Innings:**\n   - Group the rows by date and venue to calculate total runs for each innings:\n   \n   **Innings on 2007-09-11 at Johannesburg:**\n   - Partnership 1: 145 runs\n   - Partnership 3: 120 runs\n   - Total: 145 + 120 = 265 runs\n\n   **Innings on 2007-09-12:**\n   - At Durban:\n     - Partnership 9: 27 runs\n     - Partnership 10: 18 runs\n     - Total: 27 + 18 = 45 runs\n   \n   **Innings on 2007-09-13 at Johannesburg:**\n   - Partnership 2: 95 runs\n\n   **Innings on 2007-09-14 at Johannesburg:**\n   - Partnership 7: 45 runs\n\n   **Innings on 2007-09-16 at Johannesburg:**\n   - Partnership 6: 73 runs\n   \n   **Innings on 2007-09-17:**\n   - At Johannesburg:\n     - Partnership 4: 101 runs\n   - At Newlands, Cape Town:\n     - Partnership 8: 40 runs\n\n   **Innings on 2007-09-18 at Johannesburg:**\n   - Partnership 5: 119 runs\n\n5. **Comparing Runs to Determine Winner and Runner-Up:**\n   - The highest total run in a single innings is 265 (from 2007-09-11).\n   - Next, we find the second-highest total:\n     - 2007-09-18: 119 runs\n     - 2007-09-17 at Johannesburg: 101 runs\n     - 2007-09-16: 73 runs\n     - 2007-09-13: 95 runs\n\n   - The second-highest total is 119 runs (from 2007-09-18).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the \"second place winner\" has the highest run.\n   - However, the partnership with the highest runs (265) occurred during the first innings on 2007-09-11.\n   - The second-highest total (119 runs) is from the last innings on 2007-09-18.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the second place winner have the highest run\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists partnerships with their respective runs during different innings.
