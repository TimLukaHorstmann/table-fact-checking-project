    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify if all athletes listed have the same wind speed measurement except for Eric Walder and Bob Beamon. Let's examine each entry in the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Mike Powell**: Wind = 0.3 m/s\n2. **Bob Beamon**: Wind = 2.0 m/s (Note: This is an exception as per the claim)\n3. **Carl Lewis**: Wind = 0.2 m/s\n4. **Robert Emmiyan**: Wind = 1.9 m/s\n5. **Larry Myricks**: Wind = 1.4 m/s\n6. **Eric Walder**: Wind = 2.0 m/s (Note: This is an exception as per the claim)\n7. **Dwight Phillips**: Wind = 1.2 m/s\n8. **Irving Saladino**: Wind = 1.2 m/s\n9. **Iv\u00e1n Pedroso**: Wind = 1.9 m/s\n10. **Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas**: Wind = 1.6 m/s\n\nNow, let's analyze the wind speeds:\n\n- Bob Beamon and Eric Walder have a wind speed of 2.0 m/s.\n- The other athletes have varying wind speeds: 0.3, 0.2, 1.9, 1.4, 1.2, 1.2, 1.9, and 1.6.\n\nThe claim states that all athletes except Bob Beamon and Eric Walder should have the same wind speed. However, as we can see from the analysis:\n\n- Carl Lewis has a wind speed of 0.2 m/s.\n- Mike Powell has a wind speed of 0.3 m/s.\n- Robert Emmiyan and Iv\u00e1n Pedroso both have a wind speed of 1.9 m/s.\n- Larry Myricks has a wind speed of 1.4 m/s.\n- Dwight Phillips and Irving Saladino both have a wind speed of 1.2 m/s.\n- Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas has a wind speed of 1.6 m/s.\n\nClearly, the wind speeds are not all the same for athletes other than Bob Beamon and Eric Walder. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells to support this conclusion include those with different wind speeds (excluding Bob Beamon and Eric Walder):\n\n- Carl Lewis: Wind = 0.2 m/s\n- Mike Powell: Wind = 0.3 m/s\n- Robert Emmiyan: Wind = 1.9 m/s\n- Larry Myricks: Wind = 1.4 m/s\n- Dwight Phillips: Wind = 1.2 m/s\n- Irving Saladino: Wind = 1.2 m/s\n- Iv\u00e1n Pedroso: Wind = 1.9 m/s\n- Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas: Wind = 1.6 m/s\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Examine each athlete's wind speed.\",\n    \"Identify exceptions as per the claim: Bob Beamon and Eric Walder with wind = 2.0 m/s.\",\n    \"Check other athletes' wind speeds: Carl Lewis (0.2), Mike Powell (0.3), Robert Emmiyan (1.9), Larry Myricks (1.4), Dwight Phillips (1.2), Irving Saladino (1.2), Iv\u00e1n Pedroso (1.9), Lou\u00eds Ts\u00e1toumas (1.6).\",\n    \"Conclude that not all athletes have the same wind speed except for Bob Beamon and Eric Walder.\",\n    \"The claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"wind\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"wind\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
