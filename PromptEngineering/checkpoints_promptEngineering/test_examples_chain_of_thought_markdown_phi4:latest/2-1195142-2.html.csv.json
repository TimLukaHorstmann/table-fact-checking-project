    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Awards:**\n   - We are specifically looking at Tony Award results since the claim pertains to a Tony Award.\n\n2. **Examine Gary Beach's Nomination and Result:**\n   - Locate the row where \"gary beach\" is listed as a nominee for the Tony Award.\n   - From the table:\n     - In 2005, Gary Beach was nominated in the category of \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical.\"\n     - The result column indicates he was \"nominated,\" not \"won.\"\n\n3. **Count Total Tony Award Winners:**\n   - Determine how many total winners there are for the Tony Awards listed in the table.\n   - From the table:\n     - In 2005, the following results are recorded under Tony Awards:\n       - Best revival of a musical: \"won\"\n       - Best performance by a leading actor in a musical (Gary Beach): \"nominated\"\n       - Best choreography: \"won\"\n       - Best costume design: \"nominated\"\n   - This gives us two winners for the Tony Awards.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Gary Beach was one of 4 Tony Award winners.\n   - Since Gary Beach did not win (he was only nominated), he cannot be counted as a winner.\n   - Additionally, there are only 2 winners in total for the Tony Awards listed, not 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, Gary Beach is not one of the winners of a Tony Award, and the total number of winners does not match the claim.
