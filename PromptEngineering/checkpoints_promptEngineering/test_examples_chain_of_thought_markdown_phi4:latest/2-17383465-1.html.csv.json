    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"james campbell be 2 pick ahead of rodney mccray in round 1\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Players:**\n   - The claim involves two players: James Campbell and Rodney McCray.\n   \n2. **Locate Their Round and Pick Information:**\n   - Find the row in the table where \"player\" is \"rodney mccray.\"\n     - **Row 3:** Rodney McCray is picked at pick number 3 in round 1.\n   - Find the row in the table where \"player\" is \"james campbell.\"\n     - **Row 10:** James Campbell is picked at pick number 185 in round 9.\n\n3. **Check Round Information:**\n   - Rodney McCray is picked in round 1 (as per Row 3).\n   - James Campbell is picked in round 9 (as per Row 10).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim's Conditions:**\n   - The claim states that \"james campbell be 2 pick ahead of rodney mccray in round 1.\"\n   - For this to be true, both players must be selected in round 1.\n   - Additionally, James Campbell would need to be picked at a number that is two less than Rodney McCray's pick number (i.e., pick number 1 if Rodney is pick number 3).\n\n5. **Compare Rounds:**\n   - Since Rodney McCray is picked in round 1 and James Campbell is picked in round 9, they are not both selected in the same round.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The condition of being \"2 picks ahead\" can only be evaluated within the same round.\n   - Since James Campbell is not picked in round 1, the claim cannot be true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires both players to be selected in round 1.
