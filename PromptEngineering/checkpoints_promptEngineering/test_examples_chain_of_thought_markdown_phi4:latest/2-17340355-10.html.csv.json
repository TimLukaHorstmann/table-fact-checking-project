    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game against New Orleans having the highest attendance is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to focus on the \"location attendance\" column of the table to find the attendance numbers for each game.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Numbers**:\n   - Game 75 (Houston): 18422\n   - Game 76 (Sacramento): 18422\n   - Game 77 (Dallas): 20301\n   - Game 78 (New Orleans): 17781\n   - Game 79 (Memphis): 15908\n   - Game 80 (Minnesota): 18478\n   - Game 81 (Memphis): 18422\n   - Game 82 (Golden State): Attendance not provided\n\n3. **Compare Attendance Figures**:\n   - The highest attendance figure from the available data is for Game 77 against Dallas, which is 20301.\n   - The attendance for Game 78 against New Orleans is 17781.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that the game against New Orleans has the highest attendance. However, based on our comparison, the game with the highest attendance is actually the one against Dallas (20301), not New Orleans (17781).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because the game against New Orleans does not have the highest attendance.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For verifying the attendance of the game against New Orleans, we refer to row 4, column \"location attendance\".\n   - To confirm that another game has higher attendance, we refer to row 3, column \"location attendance\".\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant data by focusing on the 'location attendance' column.\",\n    \"Extract attendance numbers for each game from the table.\",\n    \"Compare all attendance figures to find the highest one.\",\n    \"Game 77 against Dallas has the highest attendance at 20301.\",\n    \"The attendance for Game 78 against New Orleans is 17781, which is not the highest.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is FALSE because another game has higher attendance.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
