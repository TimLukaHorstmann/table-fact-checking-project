The total points can be calculated as follows:\n     - Goals \u00d7 6 + Behinds = Total points\n     - Row 1: \\(9 \\times 6 + 11 = 65\\)\n     - Row 2: \\(9 \\times 6 + 12 = 66\\)\n     - Row 3: \\(17 \\times 6 + 9 = 111\\)\n     - Row 4: \\(8 \\times 6 + 15 = 63\\)\n     - Row 5: \\(15 \\times 6 + 8 = 98\\)\n     - Row 6: \\(8 \\times 6 + 10 = 58\\)\n\n4. **Determine Scores Greater Than 10 Goals:**\n   - A score of 10 goals is equivalent to 60 points (since \\(10 \\times 6 = 60\\)).\n   - Check each total score:\n     - Row 1: 65 > 60\n     - Row 2: 66 > 60\n     - Row 3: 111 > 60\n     - Row 4: 63 > 60\n     - Row 5: 98 > 60\n     - Row 6: 58 < 60\n\n5. **Count the Number of Scores Greater Than 10 Goals:**\n   - Rows with scores greater than 60 points are rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n   - This results in 5 out of 6 away team scores being greater than 10 goals.\n\n6. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - More than half of the games (i.e., more than 3 out of 6) have an away team score greater than 10 goals.\n   - Since 5 is indeed more than half of 6, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table has six games.
