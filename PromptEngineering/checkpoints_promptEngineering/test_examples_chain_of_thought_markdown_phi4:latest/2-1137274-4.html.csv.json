It's generally recognized as a location name.\n   \n   - **Row 7 (Coos Bay):**\n     - \"Coos Bay\" is a city in Oregon.\n\n   - **Row 8 (South Beach):** \n     - \"South Beach\" typically refers to an area of Miami, Florida known for its vibrant nightlife and Art Deco architecture. \n\n   - **Row 9 (FT Lauderdale):**\n     - A common shorthand for Fort Lauderdale, a city in Florida. The title seems to misspell the name but is intended to refer to this location.\n\n   - **Row 10 (San Juan):** \n     - \"San Juan\" refers to several places, most notably San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n   - **Row 11 (Antigua):**\n     - \"Antigua\" can refer to Antigua in the Caribbean or Antigua in Guatemala. It's a recognized location name.\n   \n   - **Row 12 (New York City):** \n     - \"New York City\" is a well-known city in New York, USA.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Every title corresponds to a known geographical location, either as an exact match or through common usage referring to that place.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each episode title was evaluated against known locations, and all titles corresponded to recognized places.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
