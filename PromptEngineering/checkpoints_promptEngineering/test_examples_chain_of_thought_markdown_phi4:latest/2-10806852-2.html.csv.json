    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the table data and compare it against the statement provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Date:**\n   - The claim specifies \"april 1939.\" We must confirm that all games in the table occurred on this date.\n   - All entries in the table have the date \"29 april 1939,\" which matches the claim's timeframe.\n\n2. **Locate Hawthorn vs North Melbourne Match:**\n   - The claim involves a match between \"hawthorn\" and \"north melbourne.\"\n   - In the first row of the table, we see:\n     - Home Team: hawthorn\n     - Away Team: north melbourne\n   - This confirms that there was indeed a match between Hawthorn and North Melbourne.\n\n3. **Verify Scores:**\n   - The claim states \"hawthorn destroyed north melborne, 17 to 11.\"\n   - From the first row of the table:\n     - Home team score (Hawthorn): 17.13 (115)\n     - Away team score (North Melbourne): 11.11 (77)\n   - The claim mentions scores as \"17 to 11.\" In Australian Rules Football, these scores are often expressed in terms of goals and behinds:\n     - \"17.13\" translates to 17 goals and 13 behinds.\n     - \"11.11\" translates to 11 goals and 11 behinds.\n\n4. **Check if the Scores Match:**\n   - The claim simplifies the scores to \"17 to 11,\" which corresponds exactly to:\n     - Hawthorn: 17 goals\n     - North Melbourne: 11 goals\n   - This matches the simplified score format in the claim, confirming that Hawthorn indeed scored more goals than North Melbourne.\n\n5. **Assess the Verdict of \"Destroyed\":**\n   - The term \"destroyed\" is subjective but implies a significant win.\n   - The final scores are:\n     - Hawthorn: 115\n     - North Melbourne: 77\n   - A difference of 38 points (115-77) can reasonably be considered a decisive victory, supporting the claim's use of \"destroyed.\"\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis above, all aspects of the claim align with the data from the table.

Confirm if the game with the lowest attendance was between Essendon and North Melbourne.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Attendance for Each Game:**\n   - Hawthorn vs. North Melbourne: 11,000\n   - Fitzroy vs. St Kilda: 15,000\n   - Essendon vs. Melbourne: 20,000\n   - Richmond vs. Footscray: 26,000\n   - South Melbourne vs. Collingwood: 17,000\n   - Geelong vs. Carlton: 15,000\n\n2. **Find the Lowest Attendance:**\n   - The lowest attendance number from the list is 11,000 for the game between Hawthorn and North Melbourne.\n\n3. **Verify the Teams in the Lowest Attended Game:**\n   - The game with the lowest attendance (11,000) was between Hawthorn and North Melbourne, not Essendon and North Melbourne.\n\n4. **Check Attendance for Essendon vs. North Melbourne:**\n   - There is no match listed in the table for Essendon versus North Melbourne on 29 April 1939.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that the lowest attended game was between Essendon and North Melbourne with 15,000 in attendance.
