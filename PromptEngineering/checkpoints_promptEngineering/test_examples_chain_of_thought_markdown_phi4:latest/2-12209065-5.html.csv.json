    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to evaluate each component of the statement:\n\n1. **Identify the Teams:**\n   - The claim mentions a game between \"the Baltimore Orioles\" and \"the Tiger.\"\n   - From the table, there are no entries for a team named \"Baltimore Orioles.\" This suggests that if there was a match involving them, it is not reflected in this data.\n   - There are games listed against \"tigers,\" but note the lowercase \"tigers.\" It's common in sports tables to use specific abbreviations or naming conventions. Here, \"Tigers\" likely refers to the Detroit Tigers.\n\n2. **Date Verification:**\n   - The claim specifies a date of July 4, 1997.\n   - According to the table, there are indeed two games against the \"tigers\" on July 4:\n     - First game: Score 4-3, with Keagle (0-1) as the losing pitcher.\n     - Second game: Score 11-8, with Mills (1-1) as the losing pitcher.\n\n3. **Double Header Confirmation:**\n   - A double header in baseball is when two games are played between the same teams on the same day.\n   - The table confirms that there are two games against \"tigers\" on July 4.\n\n4. **Conclusion about the Claim:**\n   - While there is a double-header against \"tigers\" on July 4, and it could be inferred this means the Detroit Tigers based on common naming conventions, the claim specifically mentions \"the Baltimore Orioles.\"\n   - There are no entries for any games involving \"Baltimore Orioles\" in the table.
