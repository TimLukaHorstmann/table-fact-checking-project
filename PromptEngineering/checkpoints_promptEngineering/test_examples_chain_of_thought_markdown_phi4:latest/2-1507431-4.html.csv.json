    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Lee Janzen's top-25 finishes at The Open Championship versus The Masters Tournament is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The claim pertains to \"top - 25\" finishes, so this column is relevant.\n\n2. **Locate Data for Each Tournament**:\n   - Find the number of top-25 finishes at The Open Championship.\n   - Find the number of top-25 finishes at The Masters Tournament.\n\n3. **Extract Values from the Table**:\n   - From the table, identify the row corresponding to \"the open championship\" and locate the value under \"top - 25\". This is 4.\n   - Similarly, identify the row for \"masters tournament\" and locate the value under \"top - 25\". This is 3.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract the number of top-25 finishes at The Masters Tournament from those at The Open Championship: \\(4 - 3 = 1\\).\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Lee Janzen has \"3 more top 25 finish at the open championship than the master tournament\".\n   - Our calculation shows a difference of only 1, not 3.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the calculated difference (1) does not match the claimed difference (3), the statement is false.\n\n7. **Identify Relevant Cells for Documentation**:\n   - \"the open championship\" row, \"top - 25\" column: value 4.\n   - \"masters tournament\" row, \"top - 25\" column: value 3.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim involves comparing 'top - 25' finishes at two tournaments.\",\n    \"Locate the 'top - 25' values for both The Open Championship and The Masters Tournament from the table.\",\n    \"For The Open Championship, the 'top - 25' value is 4.\",\n    \"For The Masters Tournament, the 'top - 25' value is 3.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference: 4 (Open) - 3 (Masters) = 1.\",\n    \"The claim states a difference of 3, but our calculation shows a difference of 1.\",\n    \"Therefore, the statement is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"top - 25\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
