This can be done by checking both the 'opponent' column and the 'game site' column for matches involving \"Sullivan Stadium\", since all home games are played there.\n\n2. **Extract Scores for Each Game**:\n   - For each game where the Patriots are involved, extract the score from the 'result' column.\n   - The format of the 'result' column is 'w X - Y' or 'l X - Y', where X represents the points scored by the Patriots and Y represents the points scored by their opponent.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Points Scored**:\n   - Compare all extracted scores to find the maximum number of points the Patriots scored in a single game.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Maximum Points**:\n   - Check if the maximum score found is 38, as claimed.\n\n### Detailed Examination:\n\n- **Week 1**: Game site \"Sullivan Stadium\", result \"w 26 - 20\". Patriots scored 26 points.\n- **Week 2**: Opponent, result \"l 20 - 7\". Patriots scored 20 points.\n- **Week 3**: Opponent, result \"w 17 - 14\".

A loss is indicated by an \"l\" in the 'result' column.\n   \n2. **List All Losses:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Week 2: Result is \"l 20 - 7\"\n     - Week 4: Result is \"l 35 - 20\"\n     - Week 5: Result is \"l 24 - 20\"\n     - Week 12: Result is \"l 16 - 13\"\n     - Week 15: Result is \"l 30 - 27\"\n\n3. **Check for Consecutive Losses:**\n   - We need to check if there are any sequences of six consecutive losses.\n   - The identified losses occur in weeks 2, 4, 5, 12, and 15.\n\n4. **Analyze Gaps Between Losses:**\n   - Week 2 to Week 4: Consecutive loss (Weeks 2 and 4)\n   - Week 4 to Week 5: Consecutive loss (Weeks 4 and 5)\n   - There is a gap between Week 5 and Week 12, with wins in Weeks 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n   - Week 12 to Week 15: There is a gap due to no games played in Week 13 and Week 14 (both are wins).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are no sequences of six consecutive losses.
