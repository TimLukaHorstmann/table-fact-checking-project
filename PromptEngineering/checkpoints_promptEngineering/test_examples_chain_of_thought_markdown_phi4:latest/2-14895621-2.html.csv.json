    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for specific details regarding the performance of Hwang Sun with her partner Kang Haeng from 1982 to 1985. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: Look for rows where the \"partner\" column indicates \"kang haeng - suk\". This is necessary because we need to verify events involving this specific partner.\n\n2. **Check Outcome and Year**:\n   - We are interested in outcomes that indicate a first-place finish, which would be represented by a numerical value other than \"wd\".\n   - Additionally, the event must have occurred between 1982 and 1985 inclusive.\n\n3. **Count Distinct Venues**: For each relevant entry, we need to identify the venue where the event took place and ensure it is distinct across different events.\n\nLet's examine the table:\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - \"outcome\": 3\n  - \"year\": 1985\n  - \"venue\": calgary , canada\n  - \"partner\": kang haeng - suk\n  - This row indicates a first-place finish (\"3\") at Calgary, Canada in 1985 with Kang Haeng Suk. It is relevant.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - \"outcome\": wd\n  - \"year\": 1982\n  - \"venue\": new delhi , india\n  - \"partner\": kang haeng - suk\n  - This row indicates a withdrawal (\"wd\"), not a first-place finish, so it is irrelevant.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - \"outcome\": 1\n  - \"year\": 1985\n  - \"venue\": india open\n  - \"partner\": kang haeng - suk\n  - This row indicates a first-place finish (\"1\") at the India Open in 1985 with Kang Haeng Suk. It is relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, we have identified two distinct venues where Hwang Sun finished first with Kang Haeng Suk: Calgary, Canada and India Open (venue listed as \"india open\"). Both events occurred within the specified years (1982-1985).\n\nThe claim states that Hwang Sun finished first at 3 different venues.
