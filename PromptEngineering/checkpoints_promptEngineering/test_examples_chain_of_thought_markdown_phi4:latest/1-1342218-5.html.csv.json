This corresponds to `row_index` 2.\n\n2. **Incumbent Candidate Verification:**\n   - According to the claim, the candidate for Arkansas 2 was \"Wilbur Mills (D)\".\n   - Check the \"incumbent\" column in row 2 of the table. It shows \"wilbur mills\", which matches the name given in the claim.\n\n3. **Party Affiliation Verification:**\n   - The claim states that Wilbur Mills is a Democrat, abbreviated as \"(D)\".\n   - Check the \"party\" column in row 2 of the table.
