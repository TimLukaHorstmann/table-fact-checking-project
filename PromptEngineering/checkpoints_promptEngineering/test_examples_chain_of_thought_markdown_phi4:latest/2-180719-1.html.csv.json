    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to analyze the point distribution between the first place winner and the runner-up from the provided table.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the First Place Winner:**\n   - According to the table, the song with a \"place\" value of 1 is ranked first.\n   - From row 14, we see that Jean-Claude Pascal's entry in French, titled \"Nous les amoureux,\" secured 31 points and finished in 1st place.\n\n2. **Identify the Runner-Up:**\n   - The runner-up would be the song with a \"place\" value of 2.\n   - From row 15, we see that The Allisons' entry in English, titled \"Are You Sure,\" secured 24 points and finished in 2nd place.\n\n3. **Calculate the Point Difference:**\n   - First Place Points: 31\n   - Runner-Up Points: 24\n   - Calculate the difference: 31 - 24 = 7\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there is \"only a small point difference\" between the first place winner and the runner-up.\n   - A difference of 7 points can be considered small, particularly in the context of competitive scoring systems like Eurovision where scores can range widely.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the point difference of 7 is indeed small relative to typical point distributions in such contests.\n\n**Relevant cells for reference:**\n\n- Row 14, Column \"points\": 31 (First place)\n- Row 14, Column \"place\": 1\n- Row 15, Column \"points\": 24 (Runner-up)\n- Row 15, Column \"place\": 2\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on the analysis above.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified first place winner with 31 points and runner-up with 24 points. Calculated point difference as 7. Determined a 7-point difference is small for a competitive contest like Eurovision.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
