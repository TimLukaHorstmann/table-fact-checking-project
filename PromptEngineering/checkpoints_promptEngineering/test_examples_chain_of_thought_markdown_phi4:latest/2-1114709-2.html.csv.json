The claim states: \"the most races that happen in any year be 4, which happens on 3 occasions.\"\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: \n   - The claim suggests that there are some years where a team participated in 4 races.\n   - It also claims that this situation (participating in 4 races) occurred in exactly 3 different years.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Table**:\n   - Each row represents a team's participation in a specific year with details about their chassis, engine, and points scored.\n   - To verify the claim, we need to check how many rows (teams/participations) there are for each year.\n\n3. **Counting Participations per Year**:\n   - 1983: 1 row\n   - 1984: 2 rows\n   - 1985: 1 row\n   - 1986: 2 rows\n   - 1987: 1 row\n   - 1988: 1 row\n   - 1989: 2 rows\n   - 1990: 1 row\n   - 1991: 2 rows\n   - 1992: 1 row\n   - 1993: 1 row\n\n4. **Checking for Years with 4 Participations**:\n   - From the counts above, no year has 4 participations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since no year has 4 participations, it is impossible for this situation to occur on any occasion, let alone three occasions.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that there are years with exactly 4 race participations, occurring in 3 different years.\",\n    \"By counting the number of rows (representing teams/participations) for each year, we determine how many races were participated in per year.\",\n    \"None of the years have 4 participations; the maximum is 2 participations in several years.\",\n    \"Since no year has 4 participations, the claim that this occurs on 3 occasions is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
