This is essential to extract the necessary details about his cardinalatial order, title, and elevation date.\n\n2. **Check Cardinalatial Order and Title:**\n   - From the identified row for Bosone:\n     - The \"cardinalatial order and title\" column states: \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\".\n   - Compare this information with the claim, which states that his title should be \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\". They match.\n\n3. **Check Elevation Date:**\n   - From the identified row for Bosone:\n     - The \"elevated\" column lists: \"circa 1116\".\n   - Compare this information with the claim, which states that his elevation date should be \"circa 1116\". These also match.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both parts of the claim (\"cardinalatial order and title\" and \"elevated circa 1116\") are consistent with the data in the table for Bosone.\n   - Therefore, the claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells from the table for verifying this claim include:\n  - Row index corresponding to Bosone: row 5\n  - Column \"cardinalatial order and title\": value \"cardinal - priest of s anastasia\"\n  - Column \"elevated\": value \"circa 1116\"\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the row for Bosone in the table.\",\n    \"Check if 'cardinalatial order and title' matches 'cardinal - priest of s anastasia'.\",\n    \"Verify that 'elevated' is listed as 'circa 1116'.\",\n    \"Both parts match, so the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cardinalatial order and title\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"elevated\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
