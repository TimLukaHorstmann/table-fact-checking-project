Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Against England**: \n   - We are looking for matches labeled as \"test match\" involving England.\n   - In the context of rugby, test matches between two countries often involve their national teams, so we assume that matches labeled as \"first test\", \"second test\", and \"test match\" against Australia likely involve England.\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Rows**:\n   - The table shows three entries for Australia:\n     - Row 6: First Test on 29/05/1988 with a score of 22.\n     - Row 7: Second Test on 12/06/1988 with a score of 28.\n     - Row 9: Test Match on 05/11/1988 with a score of 19.\n\n3. **Determine Scores**:\n   - From the table, we extract the scores for Australia in these matches:\n     - First Test (Row 6): 22 points\n     - Second Test (Row 7): 28 points\n     - Test Match (Row 9): 19 points\n\n4. **Compare Scores**:\n   - For the claim \"Australia score the most points against England during their second test match\":\n     - The highest score in these matches is 28, which occurred during the second test.\n   - For the claim \"the second most point during their first test match\":\n     - The scores are 22 (first test), 28 (second test), and 19 (test match).\n     - The second-highest score is 22, which occurred during the first test.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both parts of the claim are correct based on the data extracted from the table.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify matches labeled as 'test match' involving Australia.\",\n    \"Extract scores for these matches: First Test (22), Second Test (28), and another Test Match (19).\",\n    \"Determine the highest score, which is 28 during the second test.\",\n    \"Determine the second-highest score, which is 22 during the first test.\",\n    \"Both parts of the claim are supported by the data.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"against\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"against\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
