    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"no game be play when the goal for be less than 30\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the \"goals for\" column of the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states that in no game did any team score fewer than 30 goals.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Column**: We focus on the \"goals for\" column, as it represents the total number of goals scored by each team across all games they played.\n\n3. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Ottawa Hockey Club: Goals For = 90\n   - Montreal Wanderers: Goals For = 74\n   - Montreal Victorias: Goals For = 76\n   - Quebec Hockey Club: Goals For = 57\n   - Montreal Hockey Club: Goals For = 49\n   - Montreal Shamrocks: Goals For = 30\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - We need to check if any team has a \"goals for\" value of less than 30.\n   - From the data, all teams have \"goals for\" values of 90 or more, except for Montreal Shamrocks, which has exactly 30 goals.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since no team has scored fewer than 30 goals, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that no game was played with a 'goals for' value less than 30. By examining each row in the 'goals for' column, we find that all teams have scored at least 30 goals. Therefore, the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals for\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
