    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the winner have the longest song title\" is TRUE or FALSE, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Winner\n\n- From the table, we observe that each entry has an associated \"place\" value.\n- The winner of the competition is the one with the place number `1`.\n- In row 11, the artist Krassimir Avramov performed the song \"illusion\" and achieved 55.52% in televote/sms, securing the 1st place.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Song Lengths\n\n- We need to count the number of characters in each song title.\n- The winner's song title is \"illusion\".\n\n### Step 3: Count Characters for Each Song Title\n\nLet's calculate the length of each song title:\n\n1. Row 1: \"get up\" has 6 characters (including space).\n2. Row 2: \"razstoyaniya\" has 12 characters.\n3. Row 3: \"one lifetime is not enough\" has 26 characters (including spaces).\n4. Row 4: \"nyama vreme\" has 11 characters (including space).\n5. Row 5: \"ready for love\" has 13 characters (including spaces).\n6. Row 6: \"vrag\" has 4 characters.\n7. Row 7: \"don't kiss for the money\" has 22 characters (including spaces and punctuation).\n8. Row 8: \"crazy\" has 5 characters.\n9. Row 9: \"chance to love you\" has 16 characters (including space).\n10. Row 10: \"everlasting\" has 11 characters.\n11. Row 11: \"illusion\" has 8 characters.\n12. Row 12: \"it 's not right\" has 14 characters (including spaces and punctuation).\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Length of the Winner's Song Title\n\n- The longest song title is \"one lifetime is not enough\" with 26 characters from row 3.\n- The winner's song title, \"illusion\", has only 8 characters.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim that \"the winner have the longest song title\" is FALSE because the winning song does not have the longest title.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the winner from the table by finding the entry with place number 1.\",\n    \"Determine the song title of the winner, which is 'illusion'.\",\n    \"Count the characters in each song title to find their lengths.\",\n    \"Compare the length of all song titles to identify the longest one.\",\n    \"Verify if the winner's song title is indeed the longest.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 song titles be in English\" is true, we need to analyze the table focusing on the \"song\" column. We will count how many song titles are written in English.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest**:\n   - The relevant column for this task is \"song\", which contains the names of the songs performed by each artist.\n\n2. **Examine Each Song Title**:\n   - We will go through each song title in the table and identify whether it is written in English.\n\n3. **List and Analyze Each Song Title**:\n\n   - **Row 1**: \"get up\" \u2013 This is an English phrase.\n   - **Row 2**: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 This appears to be in a language other than English (likely Russian or Bulgarian).\n   - **Row 3**: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 This is written in English.\n   - **Row 4**: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 This appears to be in a language other than English (likely Bulgarian).\n   - **Row 5**: \"ready for love\" \u2013 This is an English phrase.\n   - **Row 6**: \"vrag\" \u2013 This appears to be in a language other than English (likely Russian or Bulgarian).\n   - **Row 7**: \"don't kiss for the money\" \u2013 This is written in English.\n   - **Row 8**: \"crazy\" \u2013 Although it's an English word, in this context, it's considered as a song title and is thus treated as an English phrase.\n   - **Row 9**: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 This is written in English.\n   - **Row 10**: \"everlasting\" \u2013 This is an English word, but similar to row 8, it is treated as an English phrase.\n   - **Row 11**: \"illusion\" \u2013 This is an English word and treated as a song title, thus considered an English phrase.\n   - **Row 12**: \"it 's not right\" \u2013 This is written in English.\n\n4. **Count the Number of English Song Titles**:\n   - From our analysis, the following song titles are in English: \n     - Row 1: \"get up\"\n     - Row 3: \"one lifetime is not enough\"\n     - Row 5: \"ready for love\"\n     - Row 7: \"don't kiss for the money\"\n     - Row 8: \"crazy\"\n     - Row 9: \"chance to love you\"\n     - Row 10: \"everlasting\"\n     - Row 11: \"illusion\"\n     - Row 12: \"it 's not right\"\n\n   - There are 9 song titles in English.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that there should be exactly 2 song titles in English.\n   - We found 9 English song titles, which is more than 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim \"2 song title be in english\" is FALSE based on our analysis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We analyzed each song title to determine if it was in English.
