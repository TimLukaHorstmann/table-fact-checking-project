    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the model with 90% after 1 year have 80% after 3 years\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Models with 90% Capacity After 1 Year:**\n   - From the table, find rows where the \"after 1 year\" column has a value of 90%.\n\n2. **Verify Capacity After 3 Years for These Models:**\n   - For each model identified in step 1, check the corresponding value in the \"after 3 years\" column to see if it is 80%.\n\n3. **Check Each Model:**\n\n   - **Row 5:** `hr - 3utgb`\n     - After 1 year: 90%\n     - After 3 years: 80% (matches the condition)\n\n   - **Row 6:** `bk - 3 mcc`\n     - After 1 year: 90%\n     - After 3 years: 80% (matches the condition)\n\n   - **Row 11:** `bk - 3lcc`\n     - After 1 year: 90%\n     - After 3 years: 80% (matches the condition)\n\n   - **Row 19:** `bk - 4 mcc`\n     - After 1 year: 90%\n     - After 3 years: 80% (matches the condition)\n\n   - **Row 23:** `bk - 4lcc`\n     - After 1 year: 90%\n     - After 3 years: 80% (matches the condition)\n\n   - **Row 27:** `bk - 4hcc`\n     - After 1 year: 90%\n     - After 3 years: 80% (matches the condition)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - All models with 90% capacity after 1 year have 80% capacity after 3 years.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, every model that has a 90% capacity after one year also maintains an 80% capacity after three years.
