    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, let's break down the steps needed to verify it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played at Boston Garden**:  \n   The claim involves a game with a large loss margin (25 points) by the Boston Celtics in December. First, we need to identify which games were played at \"boston garden\" since that is where they play their home games.\n\n2. **Check for Losses and Calculate Margins**:\n   For each game identified as being played at \"boston garden\", check if it was a loss (i.e., the opponent's score is higher than the Boston Celtics' score). If so, calculate the margin of loss by subtracting the Boston score from the opponent's score.\n\n3. **Find the Largest Loss Margin**:\n   Among all games identified as losses at \"boston garden\", determine which one had the largest loss margin and whether it was 25 points.\n\n4. **Verify the Date of This Game**:\n   Check if this game with the largest loss margin occurred on December 30th, as claimed.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Table:\n\n- **Games at Boston Garden** (Column: location):\n  - Game 15: cleveland cavaliers | Score: 110 - 104\n  - Game 16: cleveland cavaliers | Score: 122 - 99\n  - Game 18: denver nuggets | Score: 123 - 107\n  - Game 20: atlanta hawks | Score: 128 - 127\n  - Game 23: utah jazz | Score: 117 - 106\n  - Game 26: milwaukee bucks | Score: 92 - 107\n  - Game 27: indiana pacers | Score: 117 - 107\n\n- **Identify Losses at Boston Garden**:\n  - Game 26 (row index 25): Score is 92 - 107, which means a loss of 15 points.\n  \n- **Calculate the Largest Loss Margin**:\n  - The only game played at \"boston garden\" where there was a loss had a margin of 15 points (Game 26).\n\n- **Verify if This Happened on December 30th**:\n  - Game 26 took place on December 19th, not December 30th.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that the largest losing margin in December for Boston Celtics at home was 25 points and occurred on December 30. From our analysis, there was no loss of 25 points at \"boston garden\", and the only loss recorded (15 points) did not occur on December 30th.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Game 26: location \"boston garden\", score \"92 - 107\", date \"dec 19\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim involves identifying games played at 'boston garden' and checking for losses with a margin of 25 points.
