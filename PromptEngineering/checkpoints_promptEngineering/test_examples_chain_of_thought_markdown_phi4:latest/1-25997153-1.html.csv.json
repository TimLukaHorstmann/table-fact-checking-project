    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if episodes 1 and 2 together have more US viewers than any other combination of two consecutive episodes in the season.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify viewers for episodes 1 and 2:**\n   - Episode 24 (\"Redemption\"): 15.07 million\n   - Episode 25 (\"The Scarlet Letter\"): 15.75 million\n   - Combined viewership for episodes 1 and 2: \\(15.07 + 15.75 = 30.82\\) million\n\n2. **Calculate combined US viewers for each pair of consecutive episodes in the season:**\n   - Episodes 1 & 2: 30.82 million (already calculated)\n   - Episodes 2 & 3:\n     - Episode 26 (\"Red Badge\"): 14.7 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.75 + 14.7 = 30.45\\) million\n   - Episodes 3 & 4:\n     - Episode 27 (\"Red Menace\"): 15.08 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(14.7 + 15.08 = 29.78\\) million\n   - Episodes 4 & 5:\n     - Episode 28 (\"Red Scare\"): 15.53 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.08 + 15.53 = 30.61\\) million\n   - Episodes 5 & 6:\n     - Episode 29 (\"Black Gold and Red Blood\"): 16.21 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.53 + 16.21 = 31.74\\) million\n   - Episodes 6 & 7:\n     - Episode 30 (\"Red Bulls\"): 16.17 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(16.21 + 16.17 = 32.38\\) million\n   - Episodes 7 & 8:\n     - Episode 31 (\"His Red Right Hand\"): 15.85 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(16.17 + 15.85 = 32.02\\) million\n   - Episodes 8 & 9:\n     - Episode 32 (\"A Price Above Rubies\"): 16.37 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.85 + 16.37 = 32.22\\) million\n   - Episodes 9 & 10:\n     - Episode 33 (\"Throwing Fire\"): 15.77 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(16.37 + 15.77 = 32.14\\) million\n   - Episodes 10 & 11:\n     - Episode 34 (\"Rose-Colored Glasses\"): 15.38 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.77 + 15.38 = 31.15\\) million\n   - Episodes 11 & 12:\n     - Episode 35 (\"Bleeding Heart\"): 14.56 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.38 + 14.56 = 29.94\\) million\n   - Episodes 12 & 13:\n     - Episode 36 (\"Redline\"): 14.68 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(14.56 + 14.68 = 29.24\\) million\n   - Episodes 13 & 14:\n     - Episode 37 (\"18-5-4\"): 15.85 million (as episode 44)\n     - Combined viewership: \\(14.68 + 15.85 = 30.53\\) million\n   - Episodes 14 & 15:\n     - Episode 38 (\"Red Letter\"): 14.84 million\n     - Combined viewership: \\(15.85 + 14.84 = 30.69\\) million\n\n3. **Determine the maximum combined viewership for any two consecutive episodes:**\n   - The highest combined viewership is from Episodes 6 & 7, with 32.38 million.\n\n4. **Compare Episode 1 & 2 to all other pairs:**\n   - Episodes 1 & 2 have a combined viewership of 30.82 million.\n   - This is less than the maximum of 32.38 million from Episodes 6 & 7.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe claim that episodes 1 and 2 together have more US viewers than any other two consecutive episodes combined is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Calculate the combined viewership for episodes 1 and 2: 30.82 million.\",\n    \"Calculate the combined viewership for each pair of consecutive episodes in the season.\",\n    \"Identify that episodes 6 & 7 have the highest combined viewership of 32.38 million.\",\n    \"Compare the viewership of episodes 1 & 2 (30.82 million) with other pairs, finding it less than 32.38 million.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 33, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"US Viewers\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
