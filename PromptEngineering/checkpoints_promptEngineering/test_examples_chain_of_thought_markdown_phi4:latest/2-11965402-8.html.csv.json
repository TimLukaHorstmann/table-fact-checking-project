The row corresponding to this date is:\n  - Row index: 3\n  - Columns involved are \"date\", \"visitor\", \"score\".\n\n- **Teams Involved**: According to the table, on April 6, 2008, the visitors were the Rockets and the home team was the Clippers.\n  - Relevant cells:\n    - `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}`: Value is \"rockets\"\n    - `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home\"}`: Value is \"clippers\"\n\n- **Score**: The score for the game was recorded as 105 - 79 in favor of the Rockets.\n  - Relevant cell:\n    - `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}`: Value is \"105 - 79\"\n\n### Part 2: Verifying the Clippers' Record\n- **Record**: We need to check the record for the Clippers after their game on April 6, 2008.\n  - The relevant row remains the same as above (Row index: 3) since this is where the game occurred.\n  \n- **Record After Game**: According to the table, after losing to the Rockets, the Clippers' record was updated to 23 - 54.\n  - Relevant cell:\n    - `{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}`: Value is \"23 - 54\"\n\n### Conclusion\n- Both parts of the claim are verified by examining the relevant cells in row index 3 for April 6, 2008.
