The scores were 2 - 2 and 3 - 1.\n\n6. **Verify Against Other Ties:**\n   - Check other ties to ensure no other tie has a higher combined goal score in a single match.\n   - None of the other matches have a combined score exceeding 8 goals for both teams in one match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The claim is FALSE because while West Bromwich Albion and Burnley did achieve a total of 8 goals across their two matches, it was not in a single match as claimed.
