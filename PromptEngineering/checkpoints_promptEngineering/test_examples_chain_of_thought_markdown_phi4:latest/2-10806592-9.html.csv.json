    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to assess each team's score from the table to see if only Hawthorn and South Melbourne scored less than 10 goals. In Australian rules football scoring, a goal is worth 6 points.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding Scoring**: \n   - Convert the scores given in 'home team score' and 'away team score' from \"X.YY (ZZ)\" format to total points.\n   - The first number before the period represents goals, each goal being worth 6 points.\n   - The second number after the period represents behinds, each behind being worth 1 point.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Points for Each Team**:\n   - For each team's score in the format \"X.YY (ZZ)\", calculate the total score using: \\( \\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Goals} \\times 6) + \\text{Behinds} \\).\n   - Check if the total number of goals (the first number before the period) is less than 10.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Team's Goals**:\n   - Geelong: 11.23 (89) \u2192 Goals = 11\n   - Hawthorn: 6.13 (49) \u2192 Goals = 6\n   - Fitzroy: 16.12 (108) \u2192 Goals = 16\n   - South Melbourne: 8.8 (56) \u2192 Goals = 8\n   - St Kilda: 14.12 (96) \u2192 Goals = 14\n   - Melbourne: 16.16 (112) \u2192 Goals = 16\n   - Richmond: 15.14 (104) \u2192 Goals = 15\n   - Essendon: 15.9 (99) \u2192 Goals = 15\n   - Footscray: 13.9 (87) \u2192 Goals = 13\n   - Collingwood: 10.5 (65) \u2192 Goals = 10\n   - North Melbourne: 11.5 (71) \u2192 Goals = 11\n   - Carlton: 16.25 (121) \u2192 Goals = 16\n\n4. **Identify Teams with Less Than 10 Goals**:\n   - Hawthorn scored 6 goals.\n   - South Melbourne scored 8 goals.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states only two teams scored less than 10 goals: Hawthorn and South Melbourne.\n   - From the evaluation, no other team has fewer than 10 goals.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is accurate as only Hawthorn and South Melbourne have scores with less than 10 goals. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Converted each team's score from 'X.YY (ZZ)' format to total points using the formula Total Score = (Goals \u00d7 6) + Behinds.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be no home team that score more than 11\" is true or false, we need to examine the scores of the home teams listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The column \"home team score\" contains the information about each home team's score.\n\n2. **Extract Scores from Each Row:**\n   - We will look at the \"home team score\" for each row to check if any home team scored more than 11 goals.\n\n3. **Analyze Each Score:**\n   - Convert the scores into numerical values to compare them:\n     - The format given is `X.YY (ZZ)`, where X is the number of goals, Y is the number of behinds, and ZZ is the total points.\n     - We are only interested in the number of goals (the value before the period).\n\n4. **Check Each Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** Geelong scored `11.23 (89)`. The goal count is 11.\n   - **Row 2:** Fitzroy scored `16.12 (108)`. The goal count is 16.\n   - **Row 3:** St Kilda scored `14.12 (96)`. The goal count is 14.\n   - **Row 4:** Richmond scored `15.14 (104)`. The goal count is 15.\n   - **Row 5:** Footscray scored `13.9 (87)`. The goal count is 13.\n   - **Row 6:** North Melbourne scored `11.5 (71)`. The goal count is 11.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the analysis, Fitzroy, St Kilda, Richmond, and Footscray all have home team scores greater than 11 goals.\n   - Therefore, the claim \"there be no home team that score more than 11\" is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The column 'home team score' was examined for each row.

However, several games had crowds less than 20,000, and only one game had exactly 20,000 attendees.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are multiple instances where the number of attendees was neither 20,000 nor above it, but rather below it.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked each row's crowd size for games on June 18, 1938.
