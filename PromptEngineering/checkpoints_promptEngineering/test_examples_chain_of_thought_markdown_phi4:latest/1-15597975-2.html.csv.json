    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"brian rafuse 's pf be 60\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the row corresponding to Brian Rafuse**:  \n   - We look for the row in the table where the \"locale\" column matches \"nova scotia\", as this is associated with Brian Rafuse according to the data provided.\n\n2. **Locate the 'pf' (points for) value for that row**:\n   - Once we find the correct row, we need to check the value in the 'pf' column for that specific row.\n\n3. **Compare the identified 'pf' value with the claimed value of 60**:\n   - The claim states that Brian Rafuse's 'pf' is 60. We compare this with the actual value found in step 2.\n\n4. **Determine if the claim is true or false based on the comparison**:\n   - If the identified 'pf' value matches 60, then the claim is true.\n   - If it does not match, then the claim is false.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- The row for \"nova scotia\" corresponds to Brian Rafuse. From the table:\n  ```\n  | nova scotia               | brian rafuse         |   3 |   8 |   60 |   92 |         42 |          56 |            8 |             3 |         77 |\n  ```\n\n- The 'pf' value for Brian Rafuse is indeed 60.\n\n- Since the identified 'pf' value matches the claimed value of 60, the claim is true.\n\nNow, we can format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the row corresponding to Brian Rafuse under 'nova scotia'.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"when the stolen end equals 5, the amount of pa be 86\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The claim involves two specific columns: \"stolen ends\" and \"pa.\" We need to find rows where \"stolen ends\" equals 5.\n\n2. **Locate Rows with Stolen Ends Equal to 5**:\n   - Check each row in the table for a value of 5 under the \"stolen ends\" column.\n   \n3. **Extract Corresponding 'pa' Values**:\n   - For any row where \"stolen ends\" is 5, note the corresponding value in the \"pa\" (points against) column.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Against Extracted Data**:\n   - Check if all instances where \"stolen ends\" equals 5 have a \"pa\" value of 86.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- **Row 1**: \"stolen ends\" = 11, not relevant.\n- **Row 2**: \"stolen ends\" = 12, not relevant.\n- **Row 3**: \"stolen ends\" = 22, not relevant.\n- **Row 4**: \"stolen ends\" = 11, not relevant.\n- **Row 5**: \"stolen ends\" = 14, not relevant.\n- **Row 6**: \"stolen ends\" = 19, not relevant.\n- **Row 7**: \"stolen ends\" = 15, not relevant.\n- **Row 8**: \"stolen ends\" = 6, not relevant.\n- **Row 9**: \"stolen ends\" = 7, not relevant.\n- **Row 10**: \"stolen ends\" = 3, not relevant.\n- **Row 11**: \"stolen ends\" = 5, \"pa\" = 86.
