    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:**\n   - Look for a row corresponding to the driver \"tarso marques\" in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Laps Column:**\n   - Locate the \"laps\" column and check the value in the row where \"driver\" is \"tarso marques\".\n\n3. **Verify the Value:**\n   - The claim states that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps. Therefore, we need to see if the number of laps completed is zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If the number of laps is indeed zero, then the claim is true.\n   - If the number of laps is greater than zero, then the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. Locate the row for \"tarso marques\" in the table:\n   - The relevant row has \"driver\" as \"tarso marques\".\n\n2. Check the value in the \"laps\" column for this driver:\n   - In this row, the \"laps\" column shows a value of 0.\n\n3. Verify against the claim:\n   - The claim is that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps. Since the number of laps completed is indeed 0, the claim holds true.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the table data, the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is TRUE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n\n- The relevant cell for this check is in the last row of the table where:\n  - Row index: 22\n  - Column name: \"driver\"\n  - Cell value: \"tarso marques\"\n\n- Another relevant cell is also in the same row for:\n  - Row index: 22\n  - Column name: \"laps\"\n  - Cell value: 0\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row corresponding to 'tarso marques' as the driver.

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to verify two key points about Tarso Marques from the table: his starting grid position and whether he completed any laps.\n\n1. **Identify Tarso Marques' row:** We look for the driver named \"tarso marques\" in the table.\n   \n2. **Check the 'grid' column for Tarso Marques:** According to the table, Tarso Marques is listed with a grid position of 21. This confirms that he did not start from grid position 13.\n\n3. **Check the 'laps' column for Tarso Marques:** The number of laps completed by Tarso Marques is 0. This indicates that he did not complete any laps during the race.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The first part of the claim states that Tarso Marques started in grid position 13. However, from step 2, we know his starting grid was actually 21.\n   - The second part of the claim states that he did not complete any laps. From step 3, this is confirmed as true since he completed 0 laps.\n\nGiven these observations, the entire claim is false because the first part regarding the starting grid position is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
