    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006,\" we need to analyze the table systematically.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows for Tim Coleman:**\n   - Locate all entries where \"Tim Coleman\" is listed as the opponent.\n   - From the table, there is one entry:\n     - Row 3: Date = 2006-06-15, Opponent = Tim Coleman\n\n2. **Check the result of the fight against Tim Coleman:**\n   - The result for the row with Tim Coleman is \"loss.\"\n   - This indicates that the fighter lost to Tim Coleman.\n\n3. **Identify relevant rows for Ben Lock:**\n   - Locate all entries where \"Ben Lock\" is listed as the opponent.\n   - From the table, there is one entry:\n     - Row 7: Date = 2005-11-26, Opponent = Ben Lock\n\n4. **Check if there's a fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006:**\n   - There are no entries where both \"Tim Coleman\" and \"Ben Lock\" appear as opponents on the same date or in the same row.\n   - Specifically, there is no indication that they fought against each other at any point, let alone in 2006.\n\n5. **Conclusion based on available data:**\n   - Tim Coleman's only fight listed was a loss for the fighter (Row 3).\n   - Ben Lock did not compete against Tim Coleman; their fights were with different opponents.\n   - Therefore, there is no record of a fight between Tim Coleman and Ben Lock in 2006 or at any other time.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim \"tim coleman have not lose a fight against ben lock in 2006\" is TRUE because they never fought each other in that year or otherwise.
