    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"when the overall pick number be 38, the lowest pick number be 8.0\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant parts of the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are interested in finding rows where the `overall` pick number is 38.\n   \n2. **Locate Rows with Overall Pick Number 38:**\n   - Look through the column labeled `overall` to find any entries that equal 38.\n\n3. **Check the Corresponding Pick Numbers:**\n   - For each row identified in step 2, check the value in the `pick` column.\n   - Verify if the `pick` number is indeed 8.0 (or just 8 since it's an integer).\n\n4. **Analyze the Specific Row:**\n   - Locate the row where `overall` equals 38:\n     - This corresponds to row index 3 in the table.\n\n5. **Verify Pick Number:**\n   - In this specific row, check the value of the `pick` column.\n   - The `pick` number is listed as 8.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the only occurrence where `overall` is 38 has a `pick` number of 8, the claim holds true for this scenario.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row index 3 with columns `overall` and `pick`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row with an overall pick number of 38 is found at row index 3.
