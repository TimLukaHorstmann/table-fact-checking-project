According to the table, there is a match on this date.\n\n2. **Check Outcome**:\n   - In the identified row (row 1), check the \"outcome\" column. The value here is \"winner\", indicating that the player in question won the match on this date.\n\n3. **Verify Surface**:\n   - Check the \"surface\" column for this row to confirm it was played on a clay surface. The table shows \"clay\", which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Check Opponent**:\n   - Examine the \"opponent\" column in this row. It lists \"diego nargiso\" as the opponent, which aligns with the claim.\n\n5. **Assess Player Identity**:\n   - The table does not explicitly mention Olivier Rochus by name anywhere in its columns (e.g., no column for player names). However, since all other aspects of the match details (outcome, date, surface, and opponent) match the claim, it is implied that Olivier Rochus is the player being referred to as \"winner\" on this particular date.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that all specified conditions in the claim are satisfied by the data in row 1 of the table, we can conclude that the claim is true based on the available information.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1, Column: outcome (\"winner\")\n- Row 1, Column: date (\"25 September 2000\")\n- Row 1, Column: surface (\"clay\")\n- Row 1, Column: opponent (\"diego nargiso\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a match on '25 September 2000' where Olivier Rochus was the winner against Diego Nargiso on clay.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, let's break it down step-by-step according to the information provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **David Ferrer as Opponent on Hard Surface Losses:**\n   - We need to check if David Ferrer was always the opponent when Olivier Rochus lost on a hard surface.\n   \n2. **John Isner as Opponent on Carpeted Surface Matches:**\n   - The claim mentions losing to John Isner each time they played on a carpeted surface, but the table does not mention any matches on a carpeted surface.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Losses on Hard Surfaces:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 3: Opponent is Karol Ku\u010dera, Surface: hard (i)\n     - Row 4: Opponent is Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez, Surface: hard\n     - Row 6: Opponent is Richard Gasquet, Surface: hard\n     - Row 7: Opponent is Marcos Baghdatis, Surface: hard (i)\n     - Row 9: Opponent is John Isner, Surface: grass\n     - Row 10: Opponent is John Isner, Surface: grass\n     - Row 11: Opponent is David Ferrer, Surface: hard\n\n   - Only in Row 11 does Olivier Rochus lose to David Ferrer on a hard surface. In all other losses on hard surfaces (Rows 3, 4, 6, 7), the opponent was not David Ferrer.\n\n2. **Check for Matches on Carpeted Surfaces:**\n   - The table does not list any matches played on a carpeted surface. Therefore, there are no instances to verify if Olivier Rochus lost to John Isner on such surfaces.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Olivier Rochus did not lose all his matches on hard surfaces to David Ferrer.\n- There were no matches on a carpeted surface, so the condition about losing to John Isner on such surfaces cannot be verified or is irrelevant.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
