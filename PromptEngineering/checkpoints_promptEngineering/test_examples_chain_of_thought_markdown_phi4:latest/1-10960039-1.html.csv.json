From the table:\n\n|   pick | cfl team                                      | player          | position   | college      |\n|-------:|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------|:-----------|:-------------|\n|      8 | bc lions                                      | alexis bwenge   | rb         | kentucky     |\n\n### Step 3: Verify Each Component of the Claim\n\n- **Pick Number**: The \"pick\" value for this row is indeed 8.\n- **Team**: The \"cfl team\" column states \"bc lions,\" which matches the claim.\n- **Player Name**: The \"player\" column shows \"alexis bwenge,\" matching the claim.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nAll components of the claim match the information in the table.
