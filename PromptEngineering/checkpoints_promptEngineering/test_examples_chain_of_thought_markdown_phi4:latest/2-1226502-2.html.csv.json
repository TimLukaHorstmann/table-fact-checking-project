For this to be true, there would need to be evidence of a transition from Leyton House Racing to Sasol Jordan Yamaha occurring specifically in 1989.\n   - Based on the table:\n     - There is no entry for \"sasol jordan yamaha\" as an entrant in 1989.\n     - There are entries indicating that Leyton House Racing was still active in 1989.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Sasol Jordan Yamaha does not appear as an entrant until 1992, and Leyton House Racing is clearly listed for 1989, there is no evidence of a takeover by Sasol Jordan Yamaha from Leyton House Racing occurring in 1989.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"sasol jordan yamaha take over for leyton house racing in 1989\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

The claim specifically mentions \"the march 881\" as the chassis that stayed consistent throughout.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: \n   - First, we need to focus on entries related to Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin or any indication of him being associated with Leyton House Racing since it's mentioned in the context of the 1988 and 1989 entries.\n   - In motorsport contexts, drivers are often implicitly associated with teams (e.g., Gugelmin for Leyton House March Racing Team).\n\n2. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - **1988**: The entry is \"leyton house march racing team\" with the chassis \"march 881\".\n   - **1989**: There are two entries for \"leyton house racing\": \n     - First, uses \"march 881\", and\n     - Second, uses \"march cg891\".\n\n3. **Determine Continuity**:\n   - The claim states that the chassis stayed the same as \"march 881\".\n   - In 1988, Gugelmin (implicitly associated with Leyton House March Racing Team) used the \"march 881\" chassis.\n   - In the first entry of 1989 for Leyton House Racing, they still used \"march 881\", so it matches part of the claim.\n   - However, in the second entry for 1989 under \"leyton house racing,\" a different chassis \"march cg891\" was used.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The chassis did not remain \"march 881\" throughout the specified period; it changed to \"march cg891\" at least once during 1989.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false as the chassis did not consistently stay the same over the years mentioned.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant entries for Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin or Leyton House Racing.\",\n    \"Review each entry from 1988 to 1989.\",\n    \"In 1988, 'march 881' was used with Leyton House March Racing Team.\",\n    \"In 1989, two entries exist: one continues with 'march 881', and the other uses 'march cg891'.\",\n    \"Since there is a change in chassis during 1989, the claim that it stayed as 'march 881' is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
