Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: The claim concerns the most recent market expansions by Carrefour. This means we should look at the \"first store\" column, which indicates the year Carrefour opened its first store in each country.\n\n2. **Extract Year Information**:\n   - Albania: 2011\n   - Belgium: 2000\n   - Bulgaria: 2009\n   - Cyprus: 2006\n   - France: 1960\n   - Georgia: 2012\n   - Greece: 1991\n   - Italy: 1993\n   - Macedonia: 2012\n   - Monaco: No data (implying no expansion)\n   - Poland: 1997\n   - Portugal: 1991\n   - Romania: 2001\n   - Spain: 1973\n   - Slovakia: 1998\n   - Slovenia: 1998\n   - Turkey: 1993\n   - United Kingdom: 1972\n\n3. **Determine Most Recent Year**:\n   - From the extracted years, we observe that the most recent year of expansion is 2012.\n   - The countries with a \"first store\" entry in 2012 are Georgia and Macedonia.\n\n4. **Validate Against Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the most recent expansions by Carrefour were into Georgia and Macedonia.\n   - Based on our analysis, both Georgia and Macedonia indeed have their first store year listed as 2012, which is the latest among all countries in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the data confirms that the most recent market entries for Carrefour are indeed Georgia and Macedonia, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'first store' column provides the year of Carrefour's first entry into each country.
