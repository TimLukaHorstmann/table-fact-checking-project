The claim states two pieces of information about him: his position is \"center,\" and his school/club team is \"oregon state.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - We are specifically looking at George Zellick, whose name appears in the player column of one row.\n\n2. **Locate George Zellick in the Table:**\n   - By scanning through the \"player\" column of the table, we find that George Zellick is listed in row 24.\n\n3. **Check Position for George Zellick:**\n   - In row 24, under the \"position\" column, the entry is \"end.\"\n\n4. **Verify School/Club Team for George Zellick:**\n   - Still in row 24, under the \"school / club team\" column, the entry is \"oregon state.\"\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that George Zellick's position is \"center,\" but according to the table, his position is actually \"end.\"\n   - The school/club part of the claim matches the table data (both are \"oregon state\").\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since one part of the claim (\"position\" as \"center\") does not match the table data, the entire claim must be considered false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified row 24 for George Zellick in the table.
