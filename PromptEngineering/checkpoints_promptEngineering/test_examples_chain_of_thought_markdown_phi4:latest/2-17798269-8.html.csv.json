    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the second highest attended game for the Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 was against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data**: We will extract attendance data from the table and rank them in descending order to identify which games had the highest attendances.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Game**: From the ranked list, we need to find out if the game against the Chicago Blackhawks is indeed the second highest attended game.\n\n4. **Check for Correct Date and Opponent**: Ensure that the date matches March 2009 and the opponent in question is the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\n5. **Verify Result**: Confirm whether the identified game aligns with both criteria: being the second highest in attendance and involving the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. **Extract Attendance Data**:\n   - List the games along with their attendances:\n     - March 2, New York Islanders: 11,298\n     - March 4, Detroit Red Wings: 18,007\n     - March 8, Chicago Blackhawks: 22,121\n     - March 10, Atlanta Thrashers: 13,608\n     - March 12, Minnesota Wild: 14,213\n     - March 14, Edmonton Oilers: 16,839\n     - March 15, Vancouver Canucks: 18,630\n     - March 17, Minnesota Wild: 18,568\n     - March 19, Edmonton Oilers: 13,612\n     - March 22, San Jose Sharks: 17,496\n     - March 25, Anaheim Ducks: 16,279\n     - March 27, Vancouver Canucks: 16,177\n     - March 29, Anaheim Ducks: 17,182\n\n2. **Rank Attendances**:\n   - Order the attendances in descending order:\n     1. March 8, Chicago Blackhawks: 22,121\n     2. March 15, Vancouver Canucks: 18,630\n     3. March 17, Minnesota Wild: 18,568\n     4. March 4, Detroit Red Wings: 18,007\n     5. March 29, Anaheim Ducks: 17,182\n     6. March 22, San Jose Sharks: 17,496\n     7. March 14, Edmonton Oilers: 16,839\n     8. March 25, Anaheim Ducks: 16,279\n     9.

March 2, New York Islanders: 11,298\n\n3. **Identify the Second Highest Attendance**:\n   - The second highest attendance is 18,630 for the game on March 15 against the Vancouver Canucks.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The game with the second highest attendance (March 15) was not against the Chicago Blackhawks; it was against the Vancouver Canucks.\n   - Therefore, the claim that the second highest attended game in March 2009 for the Colorado Avalanche was against the Chicago Blackhawks is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those with attendances and corresponding opponents to verify rankings and dates.\n\nHere is the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted attendance data from the table, ranked them in descending order, identified the second highest attended game as March 15 against the Vancouver Canucks.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the Colorado Avalanche's highest scoring games in March 2009 being against the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers is true, we need to analyze the 'score' column from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify all scores**: Extract the scores for each game listed in the table:\n   - New York Islanders: 4 - 2\n   - Detroit Red Wings: 3 - 2\n   - Chicago Blackhawks: 5 - 1\n   - Atlanta Thrashers: 3 - 0\n   - Minnesota Wild (March 12): 2 - 1\n   - Edmonton Oilers (March 14): 3 - 2\n   - Vancouver Canucks: 4 - 2\n   - Minnesota Wild (March 17): 3 - 2\n   - **Edmonton Oilers (March 19)**: 8 - 1\n   - San Jose Sharks: 3 - 1\n   - Anaheim Ducks (March 25): 7 - 2\n   - Vancouver Canucks: 4 - 1\n   - Anaheim Ducks (March 29): 4 - 1\n\n2. **Calculate total goals for each game**: Sum the goals scored by both teams in each match:\n   - New York Islanders: 6 goals\n   - Detroit Red Wings: 5 goals\n   - Chicago Blackhawks: 6 goals\n   - Atlanta Thrashers: 3 goals\n   - Minnesota Wild (March 12): 3 goals\n   - Edmonton Oilers (March 14): 5 goals\n   - Vancouver Canucks: 6 goals\n   - Minnesota Wild (March 17): 5 goals\n   - **Edmonton Oilers (March 19)**: 9 goals\n   - San Jose Sharks: 4 goals\n   - Anaheim Ducks (March 25): 9 goals\n   - Vancouver Canucks: 5 goals\n   - Anaheim Ducks (March 29): 5 goals\n\n3. **Identify the highest and second-highest scoring games**:\n   - The highest total score is a tie between the Edmonton Oilers on March 19th (8 - 1) and the Anaheim Ducks on March 25th (7 - 2), both with 9 goals.\n   - Next, look for the second-highest score. The next highest scores are 6 goals:\n     - New York Islanders: 4 - 2\n     - Chicago Blackhawks: 5 - 1\n     - Vancouver Canucks: 4 - 2\n\n4. **Verify against the claim**: \n   - The claim states that the second-highest scoring games were against the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers.\n   - However, both highest-scoring games (9 goals) are against the Oilers and Ducks. None of these have a second-highest score.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since there is no single game with fewer than 9 goals that ranks as the second-highest when tied with others at 6 goals, the claim about \"the second highest scoring game\" specifically being against the Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- March 19: `Edmonton Oilers`, Score: `8 - 1`\n- March 25: `Anaheim Ducks`, Score: `7 - 2`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The total goals for each game were calculated.
