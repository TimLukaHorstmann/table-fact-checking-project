We should focus on rows where the \"round\" column is equal to 7.\n\n2. **Filter Rows by Round:**\n   - From the table, the following rows correspond to the 7th round:\n     - Row 7: pick = 13, overall = 213, name = anthony denman, position = linebacker, college = notre dame\n     - Row 8: pick = 33, overall = 233, name = marlon mccree, position = safety, college = kentucky\n     - Row 9: pick = 35, overall = 235, name = richmond flowers, position = wide receiver, college = tennessee - chattanooga\n     - Row 10: pick = 41, overall = 241, name = randy chevrier, position = defensive tackle, college = mcgill\n\n3. **Count the Picks in the 7th Round:**\n   - There are four picks listed for the 7th round.\n\n4. **Identify the Team for Each Pick:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention which team made each pick.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the draft picks is true or false, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant columns for assessing the claim are \"overall\" (to check the overall pick numbers) and \"round\" to understand in which round each pick occurred.\n\n2. **Find Lowest Overall Pick**:\n   - Look at the column labeled \"overall\" to identify the lowest number.\n   - Scan through the entries: 13, 43, 73, 94, 142, 170, 213, 233, 235, and 241.\n   - The smallest value in this list is **13**.\n\n3. **Find Highest Overall Pick**:\n   - Again, look at the \"overall\" column to identify the highest number.\n   - The largest value in the list of overall pick numbers is **241**.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**: \n   - According to the claim, Jacksonville's lowest overall pick should be 241 and its highest should be 13.\n   - From our analysis: the lowest pick is actually 13, and the highest is 241.\n   - Therefore, the positions of \"lowest\" and \"highest\" are reversed in the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - The statement that Jacksonville's lowest overall pick was 241 and its highest was 13 is incorrect based on the data provided.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells**:\n   - For the lowest pick (overall = 13): Row 1, \"overall\" column.\n   - For the highest pick (overall = 241): Row 10, \"overall\" column.\n\nHere is the structured reasoning and conclusion in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the 'overall' column to find pick numbers. The lowest number in this column is 13, and the highest is 241. According to the claim, Jacksonville's lowest overall pick should be 241, and its highest should be 13. However, based on the table data, the actual lowest is 13 and the highest is 241, making the claim incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
