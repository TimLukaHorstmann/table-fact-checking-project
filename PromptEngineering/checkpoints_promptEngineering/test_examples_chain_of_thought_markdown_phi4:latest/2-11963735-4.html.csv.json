This means the Nuggets scored 112 points against the Rockets on December 20, 2007.\n\n3. **Identify All Home Games and Their Scores:**\n   - We need to look at all the games where the Nuggets were listed as \"home\" and note their scores.\n   - The relevant rows are:\n     - December 6, 2007: Nuggets scored 122 points against the Mavericks.\n     - December 8, 2007: Nuggets scored 101 points against the Kings.\n     - December 12, 2007: Nuggets scored 105 points against the Hornets.\n     - December 20, 2007: Nuggets scored 112 points against the Rockets.\n     - December 23, 2007: Nuggets scored 106 points against the Kings.\n     - December 26, 2007: Nuggets scored 125 points against the Bucks.\n     - December 28, 2007: Nuggets scored 124 points against the Warriors.\n\n4. **Determine the Highest Home Score:**\n   - Compare all the home scores:\n     - 122 (Dec 6)\n     - 101 (Dec 8)\n     - 105 (Dec 12)\n     - 112 (Dec 20)\n     - 106 (Dec 23)\n     - 125 (Dec 26)\n     - 124 (Dec 28)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The highest home score was 125 points against the Bucks on December 26, 2007.\n   - Therefore, the claim that the Nuggets scored their highest home total of 112 points against the Rockets on December 20 is false.\n\nNow, let's list the relevant cells and provide the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Locate the game against the Rockets on December 20, 2007.\",\n    \"Verify the Nuggets' score in that game: 112 points.\",\n    \"Identify all home games and their scores for December 2007.\",\n    \"List of Nuggets' home scores: 122, 101, 105, 112, 106, 125, 124.\",\n    \"Determine the highest home score: 125 on December 26, 2007 against the Bucks.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim is false as their highest home score was 125 points.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
