    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is true or false, we need to analyze the matches from the table that ended with a draw. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Drawn Matches**: \n   - A drawn match in football typically means both teams have scored the same number of goals. We are looking for rows where the score indicates a tie (e.g., 1-1, 0-0).\n   \n2. **Locate and Examine Each Drawn Match**:\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 6: Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers with a score of 0 - 0.\n     - Row 7: Coventry City vs. Newcastle United with a score of 1 - 1.\n     - Row 13: Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth with a score of 1 - 1.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Goalless Condition**:\n   - A goalless draw is specifically defined as a match where neither team scores any goals, resulting in a 0-0 scoreline.\n   - Analyze each drawn match:\n     - Match at Row 6: Ipswich Town vs. Wolverhampton Wanderers ended with 0 - 0 (goalless).\n     - Match at Row 7: Coventry City vs. Newcastle United ended with 1 - 1 (not goalless).\n     - Match at Row 13: Charlton Athletic vs. Portsmouth ended with 1 - 1 (not goalless).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Only one of the three drawn matches was goalless (Row 6). The other two matches had non-zero scores for both teams.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim that \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is false because not all drawn matches were goalless.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the drawn matches from the table: Rows 6, 7, and 13.
