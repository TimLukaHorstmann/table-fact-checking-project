    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we will evaluate the attendance figures for the specified matches on 7 March 2000 and 21 March 2000 from the provided table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows in the table:**\n   - We need to find the row corresponding to the match on 7 March 2000.\n   - We also need to find the row corresponding to the match on 21 March 2000.\n\n2. **Extract attendance figures for each match:**\n   - For the match on 7 March 2000:\n     - Locate the row with the date \"7 march 2000\".\n     - Extract the value in the \"attendance\" column.\n   - For the match on 21 March 2000:\n     - Locate the row with the date \"21 march 2000\".\n     - Extract the value in the \"attendance\" column.\n\n3. **Compare the extracted attendance figures:**\n   - Compare the attendance figure for 7 March 2000 with that of 21 March 2000.\n   - The claim states that the attendance on 7 March should be greater than on 21 March.\n\n4. **Determine the truth value of the claim based on comparison:**\n   - If the attendance on 7 March is indeed greater, then the claim is TRUE.\n   - Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- From the table:\n  - The row for 7 March 2000 has an attendance of 30130.\n  - The row for 21 March 2000 has an attendance of 40419.\n\n5. **Comparison result:**\n   - 30130 (attendance on 7 March) is less than 40419 (attendance on 21 March).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"the attendance at the match on 7 march be greater than the attendance at the match on 21 march\" is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows for dates 7 March and 21 March.
