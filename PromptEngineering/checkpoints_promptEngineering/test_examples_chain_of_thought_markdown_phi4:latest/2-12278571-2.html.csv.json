    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Tiger Woods finished tied for 12th with a score of 282\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Player:**\n   - The claim refers to Tiger Woods. We need to locate his row in the table.\n   \n2. **Locate Tiger Woods' Row:**\n   - From the table, Tiger Woods is listed under the player column with \"Tiger Woods\".\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Data from His Row:**\n   - Check the columns for \"Finish\", \"total\", and any other relevant information:\n     - Finish: The claim states he finished tied for 12th (t12). From the table, Tiger Woods' finish is recorded as \"t12\".\n     - Total: The score mentioned in the claim is 282. In the table, Tiger Woods' total is listed as 282.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency:**\n   - The claim states a tie for 12th with a score of 282.\n   - Both pieces of information (finish and total) from the table match the claim perfectly.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both \"t12\" in the finish column and \"282\" in the total column align with the details provided in the claim, we can conclude that the statement is true.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells are those containing Tiger Woods' data:\n     - Row Index 3 (since rows start from index 1 for player names)\n     - Columns involved: \"finish\" and \"total\"\n\nThus, based on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to Tiger Woods.\",\n    \"Extract the 'Finish' value and check if it is 't12'.\",\n    \"Extract the 'Total' value and verify if it is '282'.\",\n    \"Both extracted values match those stated in the claim, confirming its accuracy.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
