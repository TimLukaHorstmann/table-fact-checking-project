    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court\" is true or false, we need to carefully examine each entry in the table where Galina Voskoboeva participated in a match and identify those that were played on a hard surface. Then, we will count the number of individual games she played in these matches.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Matches Played by Galina Voskoboeva**:  \n   - All entries in the table pertain to Galina Voskoboeva, as she is the player mentioned throughout.\n\n2. **Determine Surface Type for Each Match**:\n   - We need to identify which matches were played on a \"hard\" surface.\n   \n3. **Count Games Played on Hard Surfaces**:\n   - For each match played on a hard surface, we will count the total number of games Galina Voskoboeva played.\n\n4. **Analyze Each Row in the Table**:\n\n    - **Row 1**:  \n      - Date: 28 January 2003  \n      - Tournament: Tipton  \n      - Surface: Hard (i)  \n      - Opponent: Matea Mezak  \n      - Score: 6 - 4, 4 - 6, 4 - 6  \n      - Total Games Played by Galina: 4 + 6 + 6 = 16 games\n\n    - **Row 2**:  \n      - Date: 29 June 2003  \n      - Tournament: Mont-de-Marsan  \n      - Surface: Hard (i)  \n      - Opponent: Oleksandra Kravets  \n      - Score: 6 - 4, 6 - 2  \n      - Total Games Played by Galina: 4 + 2 = 6 games\n\n    - **Row 3**:  \n      - Date: 3 October 2003  \n      - Tournament: Latina  \n      - Surface: Clay  \n      - Opponent: Roberta Vinci  \n      - This match is on clay, so it is not relevant to our claim.\n\n    - **Row 4**:  \n      - Date: 8 November 2005  \n      - Tournament: Pittsburgh  \n      - Surface: Hard  \n      - Opponent: Lilia Osterloh  \n      - Score: 6 - 7, 4 - 6  \n      - Total Games Played by Galina: 7 + 6 = 13 games\n\n    - **Row 5**:  \n      - Date: 6 June 2006  \n      - Tournament: Cuneo, Italy  \n      - Surface: Clay  \n      - Opponent: Alice Canepa  \n      - This match is on clay, so it is not relevant to our claim.\n\n5. **Sum Total Games Played on Hard Surfaces**:\n   - From Row 1: 16 games\n   - From Row 2: 6 games\n   - From Row 4: 13 games\n\n   Total = 16 + 6 + 13 = 35 games\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court.

We need to focus on her \"runner-up\" results since these indicate matches she lost.\n   \n2. **Extract Relevant Matches:**\n   - From the table:\n     - On 28 January 2003, in Tipton against Matea Mezak, she lost with a score of 6-4, 4-6, 4-6.\n     - On 3 October 2003, in Latina against Roberta Vinci, she lost with a score of 3-6, 4-6.\n     - On 8 November 2005, in Pittsburgh against Lilia Osterloh, she lost with a score of 6-7, 4-6.\n\n3. **Calculate Points Lost in Each Match:**\n   - **Tipton match (28 January 2003):** \n     - Games lost: 4 + 6 + 6 = 16 points.\n   - **Latina match (3 October 2003):**\n     - Games lost: 6 + 6 = 12 points.\n   - **Pittsburgh match (8 November 2005):**\n     - Games lost: 7 + 6 = 13 points.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Points Lost:**\n   - Total points lost across all matches = 16 + 12 + 13 = 41 points.\n   - Number of losses = 3 matches.\n   - Average points lost per match = Total points lost / Number of losses = 41 / 3 \u2248 13.67.\n\n5. **Compare to the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that, on average, she loses with only 4 points.
