    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"gary unmarried come on friday at 8:00 pm\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Show Name**:\n   - The table includes episodes of a show with titles related to \"Gary\". This suggests that the claim refers to the same show, which seems to be titled \"Gary Unmarried\" based on the context.\n\n2. **Check Air Date and Timeslot Information**:\n   - All episodes listed in the table air on Wednesdays at 8:30 PM.\n   - The claim states the show airs on Fridays at 8:00 PM, which contradicts the timeslot information provided for all episodes in the table.\n\n3. **Consistency Across Episodes**:\n   - Each episode consistently shows the same air date (Wednesday) and time (8:30 PM).\n   - There is no indication of any change to a Friday airing schedule or an 8:00 PM timeslot within the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Table Data**:\n   - Since all episodes in the table air on Wednesdays at 8:30 PM, and there are no exceptions mentioned for Fridays or 8:00 PM, the claim is inconsistent with the data.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe claim \"gary unmarried come on friday at 8:00 pm\" is FALSE based on the information from the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
