According to the table, it is 31.82 sq mi.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Townships:**\n   - Review all the entries in the \"land (sq mi)\" column and compare them against the land area of James Hill.\n   - Look at each township's land area:\n     - jackson: 35.809 sq mi\n     - james hill: 31.82 sq mi\n     - james river valley: 28.597 sq mi\n     - janke: 35.995 sq mi\n     - jefferson: 35.069 sq mi\n     - jim river valley: 34.134 sq mi\n     - johnson: 35.299 sq mi\n     - johnstown: 36.199 sq mi\n     - joliette: 70.044 sq mi\n\n4. **Identify the Minimum Land Area:**\n   - From the above comparison, the smallest land area is for \"james river valley\" with 28.597 sq mi.\n\n5. **Determine if James Hill Has the Least Amount of Land:**\n   - Since \"james hill\" has 31.82 sq mi and \"james river valley\" has less (28.597 sq mi), the claim that \"james hill have the least amount of land (sq mi)\" is false.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe township with the least land area is not James Hill; it's James River Valley.
