    "resp": "To determine the validity of the claim, we need to analyze each game in the table for ties at the end of regulation play and whether those games went to penalty kicks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Tied Games:**\n   - A tied game at the end of regulation is indicated by an equal score in both halves (i.e., \"score\" column equals \"2nd round\" results added to \"1st round\" results are equal for both teams).\n\n2. **Check Each Game:**\n\n   - **Game 1:** Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice\n     - Score: 2 - 2\n     - Rounds: 1 - 1, 1 - 1\n     - The game is tied at the end of regulation.\n\n   - **Game 2:** Lille OSC vs AJ Auxerre\n     - Score: 2 - 2\n     - Rounds: 1 - 0, 1 - 2\n     - Not a tie at the end of regulation (AJ Auxerre won in aggregate).\n\n   - **Game 3:** Montpellier HSC vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard\n     - Score: 2 - 3\n     - Rounds: 2 - 2, 0 - 1\n     - Not a tie at the end of regulation (FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard won in aggregate).\n\n   - **Game 4:** Stade de Reims vs Le Havre AC\n     - Score: 2 - 1\n     - Rounds: 2 - 0, 0 - 1\n     - Not a tie at the end of regulation (Stade de Reims won in aggregate).\n\n   - **Game 5:** FC Metz vs FC Mulhouse\n     - Score: 3 - 0\n     - Rounds: 1 - 0, 2 - 0\n     - Not a tie at the end of regulation (FC Metz won in aggregate).\n\n   - **Game 6:** FC S\u00e8te vs RC Lens\n     - Score: 0 - 1\n     - Rounds: 0 - 0, 0 - 1\n     - Not a tie at the end of regulation (RC Lens won in aggregate).\n\n   - **Game 7:** AEP Bourg-sous-la-Roche vs Stade Quimp\u00e9rois\n     - Score: 3 - 5\n     - Rounds: 1 - 3, 2 - 2\n     - Not a tie at the end of regulation (Stade Quimp\u00e9rois won in aggregate).\n\n   - **Game 8:** So Ch\u00e2tellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil\n     - Score: 0 - 0\n     - Rounds: 0 - 0, 0 - 0\n     - The game is tied at the end of regulation.\n\n3. **Determine if Tied Games Went to Penalty Kicks:**\n   - For a game to go to penalty kicks, it must be tied in aggregate after both rounds.\n   - In markdown tables or typical football results, games that go to penalties are often noted with an indication like \"(aet)\" for \"after extra time\" or explicitly mention of penalties. However, this table does not provide such explicit information.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have identified two tied games at the end of regulation:\n     - Game 1: Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice (2 - 2)\n     - Game 8: So Ch\u00e2tellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil (0 - 0)\n   - There is no explicit indication that any of these games went to penalty kicks. The claim states that \"2 of those go to penalty kick,\" but without additional information, we cannot confirm this.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified two tied games at the end of regulation: Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice and So Ch\u00e2tellerault vs US Cr\u00e9teil.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all three tie games were settled by penalty shootouts\" is true or false, we need to analyze the scores from both rounds for each match that ended with an aggregate score of 2-2. A tie game in football (soccer) typically results in a penalty shootout if it's a knockout stage match and not resolved through extra time.\n\nHere's how we will proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Matches with Aggregate Score of 2-2:**\n   We need to identify which matches ended with an aggregate score of 2-2, as these are the ones that could have been settled by penalty shootouts if no goal difference or away goals rule resolved them.\n\n2. **Check Each Match's Round-by-Round Scores:**\n   For each match identified in step 1, we will examine the scores from both rounds to ensure they add up to a tie and check if any additional context (like extra time or penalty shootout) is provided.\n\n3. **Determine If Penalty Shootouts Were Mentioned:**\n   We need to verify whether the table explicitly mentions that these ties were settled by penalty shootouts.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Matches with Aggregate Score of 2-2\n\n- **Match 1:** Toulouse FC (d1) vs OGC Nice (d1)\n  - Aggregate Score: 2 - 2\n  - 1st Round: 1 - 1\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 1\n\n- **Match 2:** Lille OSC (d1) vs AJ Auxerre (d1)\n  - Aggregate Score: 2 - 2\n  - 1st Round: 1 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 2\n\nThese are the only two matches with an aggregate score of 2-2.\n\n### Step 2: Check Each Match's Round-by-Round Scores\n\nFor both identified matches, we confirm:\n\n- **Toulouse FC vs OGC Nice:** \n  - 1st Round: 1 - 1\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 1\n  - Aggregate: 2 - 2\n\n- **Lille OSC vs AJ Auxerre:** \n  - 1st Round: 1 - 0\n  - 2nd Round: 1 - 2\n  - Aggregate: 2 - 2\n\n### Step 3: Determine If Penalty Shootouts Were Mentioned\n\nThe table does not provide any additional information regarding extra time or penalty shootouts. Typically, if a match is settled by penalties, it would be noted in the score or description.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince there are only two matches with an aggregate score of 2-2 and no mention of penalty shootouts, the claim that \"all three tie games were settled by penalty shootouts\" is false.

Montpellier lost and scored no points.\n   \n   - **Match 4**: stade de reims (d2) vs le havre ac (d1)\n     - Aggregate score: 2 - 1\n     - Reims won, scoring points. Le Havre lost and scored no points.\n\n   - **Match 5**: fc metz (d1) vs fc mulhouse (d2)\n     - Aggregate score: 3 - 0\n     - Metz won, scoring points. Mulhouse lost and scored no points.\n   \n   - **Match 6**: fc s\u00e8te (d2) vs rc lens (d1)\n     - Aggregate score: 0 - 1\n     - Lens won, scoring points. S\u00e8te lost and scored no points.\n\n   - **Match 7**: aep bourg sous la roche (d2) vs stade quimp\u00e9rois (d2)\n     - Aggregate score: 3 - 5\n     - Quimper won, scoring points. Bourg-sous-la-Roche lost and scored no points.\n\n   - **Match 8**: so chtellerault (d2) vs us cr\u00e9teil (d3)\n     - Aggregate score: 0 - 0\n     - The match was a draw, so both teams earned 1 point each.\n\n3. **Identify Teams with No Points**:\n   - Montpellier HSC (lost to FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard)\n   - Le Havre AC (lost to Stade de Reims)\n   - FC Mulhouse (lost to FC Metz)\n   - FC S\u00e8te (lost to RC Lens)\n   - AEP Bourg-sous-la-Roche (lost to Stade Quimp\u00e9rois)\n\n4. **Count Teams with No Points**:\n   - There are 5 teams that failed to score any points.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states only 2 teams fail to score a single point, but we identified 5 teams that did not earn any points.
