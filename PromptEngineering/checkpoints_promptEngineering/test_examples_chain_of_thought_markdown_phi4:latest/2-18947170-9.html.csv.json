Therefore, the first part of the claim (\"Uganda have more than 3 peaks listed\") is FALSE since there are exactly 3 peaks, not more than 3.\n\n#### Step 2: Check Highest Prominence\nNow, let's find out if the highest prominence in Uganda is 2458 meters:\n\n- **Mount Elgon**: Prominence is 2458 meters.\n- **Mount Moroto**: Prominence is 1818 meters.\n- **Mount Kadam**: Prominence is 1690 meters.\n\nThe highest prominence among these peaks is indeed 2458 meters for Mount Elgon, which satisfies the second part of the claim (\"the highest prominence be 2458\").\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the first part of the claim is false (Uganda does not have more than 3 peaks listed), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\nThe relevant cells in the table are those pertaining to Uganda and their prominence values:\n\n- Mount Elgon: \n  - Row index: 3, Column name: \"country\"\n  - Row index: 3, Column name: \"prominence (m)\"\n  \n- Mount Moroto: \n  - Row index: 10, Column name: \"country\"\n  - Row index: 10, Column name: \"prominence (m)\"\n\n- Mount Kadam:\n  - Row index: 16, Column name: \"country\"\n  - Row index: 16, Column name: \"prominence (m)\"\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified three peaks listed for Uganda.
