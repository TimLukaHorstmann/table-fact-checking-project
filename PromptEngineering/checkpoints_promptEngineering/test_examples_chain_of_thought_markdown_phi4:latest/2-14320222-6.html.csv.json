To verify this, we need to check if:\n1. Game 61 is one of those games.\n2. There are exactly two other games besides game 61 which also result in a total of 86 points.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Points for Each Game:**\n   - From the table, observe the \"points\" column to see when the team's total points reached 86.\n   \n2. **Find Games with Total Points = 86:**\n   - Look at the \"record\" and \"points\" columns:\n     - Row 61 (Game 61): Record is 41-16-4, Points are 86.\n     - Row 62 (Game 62): Record is 41-17-4, Points are still 86.\n     - Row 63 (Game 63): Record is 41-18-4, Points remain 86.\n\n3. **Verify Total Games with 86 Points:**\n   - The total points column shows that the team has 86 points for games 61, 62, and 63.\n   - Therefore, game 61 is indeed one of three games where the total points are 86.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since game 61, along with games 62 and 63, results in a total of 86 points, the claim that \"game 61 be 1 of 3 game that total 86 point\" is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Game 61 (Row 11): Points = 86\n- Game 62 (Row 12): Points = 86\n- Game 63 (Row 13): Points = 86\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked the 'points' column for games where total points are 86.
