    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only the last 2 listed games have an attendance of more than 10000\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the 'attendance' column for each game listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We are interested in the 'attendance' column since it contains the number of attendees for each game.\n\n2. **Examine each row's attendance**:\n   - Row 1: Date \"12 December 1903\" has an attendance of 10000.\n   - Row 2: Date \"16 December 1903\" has an attendance of 5000.\n   - Row 3: Date \"21 December 1903\" has an attendance of 3000.\n   - Row 4: Date \"11 January 1904\" has an attendance of 9372.\n   - Row 5: Date \"6 February 1904\" has an attendance of 12000.\n   - Row 6: Date \"10 February 1904\" has an attendance of 18000.\n   - Row 7: Date \"20 February 1904\" has an attendance of 22051.\n\n3. **Identify which rows have attendance greater than 10000**:\n   - Row 1: Attendance is exactly 10000, not more.\n   - Row 2: Attendance is 5000, less than 10000.\n   - Row 3: Attendance is 3000, less than 10000.\n   - Row 4: Attendance is 9372, less than 10000.\n   - Row 5: Attendance is 12000, more than 10000.\n   - Row 6: Attendance is 18000, more than 10000.\n   - Row 7: Attendance is 22051, more than 10000.\n\n4. **Check the claim**: The claim states that only the last two games have an attendance of more than 10000. From our analysis:\n   - Games with more than 10000 attendees are Rows 5, 6, and 7.\n   - This means three games (not just the last two) have an attendance greater than 10000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because there are three games with an attendance of more than 10000, not just the last two.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5: Attendance = 12000\n- Row 6: Attendance = 18000\n- Row 7: Attendance = 22051\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the 'attendance' column for analysis.\",\n    \"Check each row's attendance value:\",\n    \"- Row 1 has 10000 (not more).\",\n    \"- Row 2 has 5000 (less than 10000).\",\n    \"- Row 3 has 3000 (less than 10000).\",\n    \"- Row 4 has 9372 (less than 10000).\",\n    \"- Row 5 has 12000 (more than 10000).\",\n    \"- Row 6 has 18000 (more than 10000).\",\n    \"- Row 7 has 22051 (more than 10000).\",\n    \"Determine that Rows 5, 6, and 7 have more than 10000 attendees.\",\n    \"Conclude the claim is FALSE because three games exceed 10000 in attendance.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
