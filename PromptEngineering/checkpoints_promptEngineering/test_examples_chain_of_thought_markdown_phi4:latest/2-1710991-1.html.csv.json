The steps involved are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Relevance**: \n   - The claim specifically mentions \"Liselotte Neumann.\" Therefore, we must first identify if there are any entries in the table associated with Liselotte Neumann.\n\n2. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - We will examine each row to see if Liselotte Neumann is listed as a winner or runner-up.\n   - Since the claim pertains to winning scores, we focus on the \"tournament\" and \"winning score\" columns for potential entries related to her victories.\n\n3. **Examine Relevant Entries**:\n   - Go through each row in the table:\n     - Row 1: US Women's Open - Winner is Patty Sheehan.\n     - Row 2: Mazda Japan Classic - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 3: Minnesota LPGA Classic - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 4: Weetabix Women's British Open - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 5: GHP Heartland Classic - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 6: Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 7: Ping/Welch's Championship (Tucson) - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 8: Edina Realty LPGA Classic - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 9: Welch's Championship - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 10: Toray Japan Queens Cup - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 11: Standard Register Ping - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 12: Chick-fil-A Charity Championship - No Liselotte Neumann mentioned.\n     - Row 13: Asahi Ryokuken International Championship - Winner is Grace Park.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - After reviewing all the rows, there are no entries indicating that Liselotte Neumann won any of these tournaments or had a margin of victory in this table.\n   - Therefore, we cannot verify any margins of victory for her within this dataset.\n\n5. **Final Decision**:\n   - Since there is no data on Liselotte Neumann's victories or margins of victory in the provided table, the claim about her margin of victory ranging from 1 stroke to 3 strokes cannot be substantiated as true based on this information.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was reviewed for entries related to Liselotte Neumann.

The tournament is listed as \"minnesota lpga classic\", and the winner's name is not mentioned in the relevant cells. Instead, it lists \"hiromi kobayashi\" as the runner-up.\n   - **1996 LPGA Classic**: Look at the row with the date \"6 jun 1996\". The tournament is listed as \"edina realty lpga classic\", and again, the winner's name is not mentioned in the relevant cells.
