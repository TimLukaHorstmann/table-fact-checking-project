We need to find a row in the table with this date.\n\n2. **Locate the Row**:\n   - Scan through the \"date\" column for \"25 october 2009\".\n\n3. **Check the Score**:\n   - Once we locate the row with the specified date, check the \"score\" column to see if it matches \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6\".\n\n4. **Verify Match**:\n   - If both the date and score match exactly as claimed, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Find the row with \"25 october 2009\" in the \"date\" column.\n  - This corresponds to the last row of the table.\n\n- **Step 2**: Check the \"score\" for this row.\n  - The score listed is \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6\".\n\nSince both the date and the score match exactly as stated in the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row with the date '25 october 2009'.\",\n    \"Locate this row in the table.\",\n    \"Check the score for this specific date.\",\n    \"Compare the score from the table to the claim '1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6'.\",\n    \"Since both match, the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\", \"value\": \"25 october 2009\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\", \"value\": \"1 - 6 6 - 1 3 - 6\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
