According to the table, this is in the first row (`row_index`: 1).\n   - Check the column `place` for this row. It shows \"t1\".\n   - Similarly, find the row where `player` is \"steve pate\". This is also in the second row (`row_index`: 2).\n   - Again, check the column `place` for this row. It also shows \"t1\".\n\n3. **Interpret the Place Values**:\n   - In golf, a place value prefixed with \"t\" indicates a tie.\n   - Both Raymond Floyd and Steve Pate have the place \"t1\", which means they are tied for first place.\n\n4. **Verify Scores**:\n   - Check their scores to ensure consistency with being tied for first place.\n   - Both players have a score of 64, as shown in their respective rows, further confirming they share the same position.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both Raymond Floyd and Steve Pate have the place \"t1\" and identical scores, they are indeed tied for first place.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that both Raymond Floyd and Steve Pate have a 'place' value of 't1', indicating they are tied.
