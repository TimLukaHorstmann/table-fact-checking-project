    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the table data systematically:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that the most number of points scored in a match was 3 and it was a draw.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - \"score\" column contains the goals each team scored in matches.\n   - \"result\" column indicates whether the match resulted in a win, loss, or draw.\n\n3. **Locate Maximum Score**: \n   - We need to find the highest score recorded in the \"score\" column and check if it corresponds to a \"draw\".\n\n4. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - Check each row's \"score\" for the maximum number of goals scored by either team.\n   - Verify if the match resulted in a draw when the score is at its maximum.\n\n5. **Review Each Entry**:\n   - 30 May 1993: Score 1-0, Result: Win\n   - 6 June 1993: Score 3-0, Result: Win\n   - 31 October 1993: Score 1-1, Result: Draw\n   - 27 March 1996: Score 0-1, Result: Loss\n   - 24 April 1996: Score 0-3, Result: Loss\n   - 12 March 1997: Score 1-0, Result: Win\n   - 11 June 1997: Score 13-0, Result: Win\n   - 19 June 1997: Score 2-0, Result: Win\n   - 28 June 1997: Score 3-0, Result: Win\n   - 6 July 1997: Score 2-0, Result: Win\n   - 22 November 1997: Score 1-1, Result: Draw\n   - 29 November 1997: Score 2-2, Result: Draw\n   - 14 December 1997: Score 0-0, Result: Draw\n   - 16 December 1997: Score 0-1, Result: Loss\n   - 19 December 1997: Score 1-0, Result: Win\n   - 21 December 1997: Score 0-6, Result: Loss\n   - 23 February 2000: Score 3-0, Result: Win\n\n6. **Determine Maximum Score**:\n   - The highest number of goals scored by a single team in any match is 13 (by the home team on 11 June 1997).\n   - Matches with scores involving 3 goals include 3-0 and 2-1, but none were draws.\n\n7. **Check for Draw with Maximum Score**:\n   - The highest score where both teams scored equally (a draw) is 2-2.\n   - This occurs on 29 November 1997.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim that the most number of points scored in a match was 3 and it was a draw is incorrect.
