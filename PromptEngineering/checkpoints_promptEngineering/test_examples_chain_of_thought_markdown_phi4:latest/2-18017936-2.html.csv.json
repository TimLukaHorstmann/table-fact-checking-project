    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the goal difference for club jfk olimps r\uce74ga have 2 times as much as skonto\" is true or false, we will analyze the relevant data from the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to look at the \"goal difference\" column for both clubs mentioned in the claim.\n   - The club \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" is listed in row 1.\n   - The club \"skonto - 2 riga\" is listed in row 3.\n\n2. **Extract Goal Difference Values:**\n   - For \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\":\n     - According to the table, the goal difference is +96 (cell at row index 1, column \"goal difference\").\n   - For \"skonto - 2 riga\":\n     - The goal difference is +55 (cell at row index 3, column \"goal difference\").\n\n3. **Perform Calculation:**\n   - We need to check if the goal difference of \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" is twice that of \"skonto - 2 riga\".\n   - Calculate 2 times the goal difference for \"skonto - 2 riga\": \\(2 \\times 55 = 110\\).\n\n4. **Compare Values:**\n   - The goal difference for \"jfk olimps r\uce74ga\" is +96.\n   - Twice the goal difference of \"skonto - 2 riga\" is 110.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 96 (goal difference of jfk olimps r\uce74ga) is not equal to 110 (twice the goal difference of skonto - 2 riga), the claim is false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we conclude that the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

However, we found two additional clubs (skonto - 2 riga and ventspils - 2) with a goal difference above 50.\n\n4. **Final Determination**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because there are more than just the two mentioned clubs with a goal difference greater than 50.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- jfk olimps r\uce74ga, Goal Difference: +96\n- fc ditton - 2 daugavpils, Goal Difference: +64\n- skonto - 2 riga, Goal Difference: +55\n- ventspils - 2, Goal Difference: +83\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated by checking each club's goal difference against the threshold of 50. jfk olimps r\uce74ga and fc ditton - 2 daugavpils have goal differences above 50, but skonto - 2 riga and ventspils - 2 also exceed this threshold, making the claim false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
