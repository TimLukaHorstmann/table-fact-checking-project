    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 2 player(s) that play center played from 1998 - 1999\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Players by Position:**\n   - The claim specifies players who play the position of \"center.\"\n   - From the table, locate all rows where the \"position\" column matches \"center.\"\n\n2. **Extract Relevant Rows:**\n   - Check each row for a player with the position \"center\":\n     - Row 1: Jason Lawson is listed as playing center.\n\n3. **Check Years Played:**\n   - For players identified in step 1, examine their \"years in orlando\" to see if they played from 1998 to 1999:\n     - Jason Lawson (Row 1) has the years 1997 - 1998.\n     - This does not include the year 1999.\n\n4. **Count Players:**\n   - The claim states there are \"2 player(s)\" who played center during 1998-1999.\n   - From step 3, only one player (Jason Lawson) was found playing center, and his years do not cover 1998-1999.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no players play the position of \"center\" from 1998 to 1999 in Orlando according to the table, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for this analysis are:\n- Jason Lawson's position and years (Row 1).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify players who play the position of 'center'.\",\n    \"From the table, only Jason Lawson plays center.\",\n    \"Check Jason Lawson's years in Orlando: 1997 - 1998.\",\n    \"The claim requires two players to have played from 1998-1999, but no player matches this criterion.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years in orlando\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
