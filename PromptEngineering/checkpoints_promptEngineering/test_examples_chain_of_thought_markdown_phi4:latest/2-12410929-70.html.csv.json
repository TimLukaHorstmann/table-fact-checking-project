    "resp": "To determine the veracity of the claim, we need to analyze the roles of Courtney Walsh throughout the matches listed in the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Role of Courtney Walsh:**\n   - According to the column \"away captain\" for all entries in the table, Courtney Walsh is consistently listed as the away captain. This implies that he was not a home captain in any match.\n\n2. **Examine the Matches:**\n   - Review each row in the table:\n     1. **Row 1**: Match dates are November 22-26, 1996 at Brisbane Cricket Ground with Mark Taylor as home captain and Courtney Walsh as away captain.\n     2. **Row 2**: Match dates are November 29 to December 3, 1996 at Sydney Cricket Ground with the same captains.\n     3. **Row 3**: Match dates are December 26-28, 1996 at Melbourne Cricket Ground with the same captains.\n     4. **Row 4**: Match dates are January 25-28, 1997 at Adelaide Oval with the same captains.\n     5. **Row 5**: Match dates are February 1-3, 1997 at WACA Ground with the same captains.\n\n3. **Determine Captaincy Roles:**\n   - In every match listed in the table, Courtney Walsh is identified as the away captain and not the home captain.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"courtney walsh be the home captain for half of the match.\" Since Courtney Walsh was never a home captain in any of these matches, he could not have been the home captain for even one match, let alone half of them.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the consistent role of away captain assigned to Courtney Walsh across all entries in the table, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Courtney Walsh was listed as the away captain for all matches. Therefore, he was never a home captain, making the claim that he was the home captain for half of the match false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away captain\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
