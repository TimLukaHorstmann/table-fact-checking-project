    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"only 10 Cleveland Browns' quarterbacks have won more than 30 games\" is true, we must analyze the table to identify which quarterbacks are from the Cleveland Browns and count how many of them have started more than 30 games with a win total exceeding 30.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Cleveland Browns Quarterbacks:**\n   - The claim specifically refers to quarterbacks who played for the Cleveland Browns, so we need to know which players are associated with this team.\n   - Notably, from sports knowledge, Bernie Kosar, Brian Sipe, and Bernie Kosar (again) are well-known as prominent quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns. We will start by examining these players.\n\n2. **Locate Players in Table:**\n   - Look through the table to find entries for known Cleveland Browns quarterbacks:\n     - **Bernie Kosar:** Row 2 (Kosar, Bernie)\n     - **Brian Sipe:** Row 1 (Sipe, Brian)\n\n3. **Check Games Started and Wins:**\n   - For each identified quarterback, check if they have started more than 30 games and won more than 30 of those games.\n\n4. **Analysis of Relevant Rows:**\n\n   - **Row 2 (Kosar, Bernie):** \n     - Games started: 105\n     - Wins: 53\n     - Since Kosar has both more than 30 starts and over 30 wins, he qualifies.\n   \n   - **Row 1 (Sipe, Brian):**\n     - Games started: 137\n     - Wins: 96\n     - Sipe also qualifies since his stats exceed both thresholds.\n\n5. **Find Other Potential Browns Quarterbacks:**\n\n   - Look for any other quarterbacks in the table who might have played for the Cleveland Browns and check their statistics.\n   - Based on historical data, no additional Browns quarterbacks are listed prominently in this dataset beyond Kosar and Sipe with significant career starts (more than 30).\n   \n6. **Count Qualifying Quarterbacks:**\n   - From the analysis above, only Bernie Kosar and Brian Sipe meet the criteria of having more than 30 wins and having started more than 30 games.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states that there are \"only 10\" such quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns. However, we found only two who fit this criterion based on the table provided.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false since the number of qualifying quarterbacks is not ten but rather two.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified known Cleveland Browns' quarterbacks from historical knowledge and verified their game statistics in the table.
