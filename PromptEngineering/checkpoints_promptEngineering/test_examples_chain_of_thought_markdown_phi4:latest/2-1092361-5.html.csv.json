This will help us identify when the player played on a hard surface.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of Hard Surfaces**:\n   - The first match on a hard surface was on May 22, 1989, in Geneva, Switzerland (Tier V).\n   - The second match on a hard surface was on March 12, 1989, in Indian Wells, USA (Tier III).\n\n3. **Check the Order of Matches**:\n   - By examining the dates and surfaces, we see that the first occurrence of a hard surface match is on May 22, 1989.\n   - The second occurrence is earlier than this date, on March 12, 1989.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The claim states that the second time the player played on a hard surface was on March 12, 1989.
