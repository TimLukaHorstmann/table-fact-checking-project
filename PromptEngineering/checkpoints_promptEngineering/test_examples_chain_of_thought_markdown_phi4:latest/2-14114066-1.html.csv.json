    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table based on the specified criteria: socket type (`fcbga1088`), frequency (`1.2 ghz`), and release price (USD `70`). Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Socket Type `fcbga1088`:**\n   - All entries in the table have a socket type of `fcbga1088`. Therefore, we consider all rows for further evaluation.\n\n2. **Find Entries with Frequency `1.2 ghz`:**\n   - We look at the \"frequency\" column to identify rows where the frequency is `1.2 ghz`.\n   - The relevant entries are:\n     - Row 3: Frequency is `1.2 ghz`\n     - Row 7: Frequency is `1.2 ghz`\n\n3. **Check Release Price for These Entries:**\n   - For each row identified with a frequency of `1.2 ghz`, we check the \"release price (usd)\" column.\n   - Row 3:\n     - Frequency: `1.2 ghz`\n     - Release Price: `70`\n   - Row 7:\n     - Frequency: `1.2 ghz`\n     - Release Price: `102`\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that there is a socket with `fcbga1088`, frequency of `1.2 ghz`, and release price of `70`.\n   - From our analysis, Row 3 matches all criteria: socket type `fcbga1088`, frequency `1.2 ghz`, and release price `70`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there exists an entry in the table that satisfies all the conditions specified in the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows with socket type 'fcbga1088'.

Although Row 5 also has a mult of 6 and matches the socket and voltage criteria, it does not have the specified part number.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there exists at least one entry that satisfies all conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified entries with 'mult' of 6.
