    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"there be 36 driver attempt to compete in the 1992 Australian Grand Prix\" is true, we need to analyze the provided table. The claim concerns the number of drivers who attempted to compete, which typically includes all those listed in the table with recorded laps or reasons for retirement.\n\nHere are the steps and reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand Table Structure**: \n   - Each row represents a driver's performance in the race.\n   - Columns include \"driver\", \"constructor\", \"laps\", \"time / retired\", and \"grid\".\n\n2. **Identify All Entries**:\n   - Every row corresponds to a driver who attempted to compete, regardless of whether they completed laps or were retired for some reason.\n\n3. **Count Rows**:\n   - We need to count the number of rows in the table to determine how many drivers attempted to participate in the race.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Manually count each row from the table, ensuring no entries are missed.\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - The table contains 36 rows, indicating there were 36 drivers who attempted to compete.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by counting:\n\n- Row 1: gerhard berger\n- Row 2: michael schumacher\n- Row 3: martin brundle\n- Row 4: jean alesi\n- Row 5: thierry boutsen\n- Row 6: stefano modena\n- Row 7: mika h\u00e4kkinen\n- Row 8: aguri suzuki\n- Row 9: christian fittipaldi\n- Row 10: gianni morbidelli\n- Row 11: nicola larini\n- Row 12: jan lammers\n- Row 13: johnny herbert\n- Row 14: jj lehto\n- Row 15: emanuele naspetti\n- Row 16: bertrand gachot\n- Row 17: riccardo patrese\n- Row 18: ukyo katayama\n- Row 19: andrea de cesaris\n- Row 20: nigel mansell\n- Row 21: ayrton senna\n- Row 22: maur\u00edcio gugelmin\n- Row 23: \u00e9rik comas\n- Row 24: michele alboreto\n- Row 25: pierluigi martini\n- Row 26: olivier grouillard\n\nCounting these rows confirms there are indeed 26 entries, not 36 as claimed.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists each driver who attempted to compete in the race.

Here's how I will approach it:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: Focus on the \"laps\" column in the table as this column indicates the number of laps each driver completed.\n\n2. **Count Drivers with 81 Laps**:\n   - Scan through the table and count the entries where the number of laps is exactly 81.\n   \n3. **List of Entries with 81 Laps**: \n   - Review the rows to find those that match this criterion, noting which drivers are associated with these row entries.\n\n4. **Verification**: \n   - Ensure each identified driver meets the condition of completing 81 laps and count them accurately.\n\n5. **Conclude**:\n   - Compare the counted number to six to verify the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Scanning the Table for \"laps\" = 81:**\n   - Row 1: Gerhard Berger, 81 laps\n   - Row 2: Michael Schumacher, 81 laps\n   - Row 3: Martin Brundle, 81 laps\n\n2. **Continuing to Scan**:\n   - No other rows below these have 81 laps.\n\n3. **Counting the Drivers**: \n   - We identified three drivers who completed exactly 81 laps: Gerhard Berger, Michael Schumacher, and Martin Brundle.\n   \n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim states there are six drivers with 81 laps, but only three were found in the table.\n\n5. **Final Decision**: \n   - Since we have counted only three drivers who completed 81 laps, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Scanned the 'laps' column of the table and identified drivers with exactly 81 laps.
