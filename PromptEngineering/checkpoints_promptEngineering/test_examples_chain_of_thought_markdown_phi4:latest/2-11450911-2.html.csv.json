    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Keiko Tamia didn't lose a single time after the 2nd round\" is true or false, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are interested in the rows where Keiko Tamia lost (\"res\" column equals \"loss\").\n   - For each of these loss entries, check the \"round\" column to see if any loss occurred after the 2nd round.\n\n2. **Examine Each Loss Record:**\n   - Row 1: Opponent = Shayna Baszler, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 2: Opponent = Marloes Coenen, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 3: Opponent = Michiko Takeda, Round = 2\n     - This is a second-round loss.\n   - Row 4: Opponent = Hitomi Akano, Round = 2\n     - This is a second-round loss.\n   - Row 5: Opponent = Megumi Fujii, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 6: Opponent = Natsuko Kikukawa, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 7: Opponent = Roxanne Modafferi, Round = 2\n     - This is a second-round loss.\n   - Row 8: Opponent = Hitomi Akano, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 9: Opponent = Kaoru Ito, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 10: Opponent = Akino Akino, Round = 2\n     - This is a second-round loss.\n   - Row 11: Opponent = Yuiga Yuiga, Round = 1\n     - This is a first-round loss.\n   - Row 12: Opponent = Yuuki Kondo, Round = 3\n     - This is a third-round loss.\n\n3. **Analyze the Data:**\n   - Out of all the losses recorded in the table, only one occurred after the 2nd round (Row 12: Opponent = Yuuki Kondo, Round = 3).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is at least one instance where Keiko Tamia lost after the 2nd round, the claim \"Keiko Tamia didn't lose a single time after the 2nd round\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 12 (Yuuki Kondo loss in Round 3) is relevant because it disproves the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
