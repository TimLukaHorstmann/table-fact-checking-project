The number of `lost` games is less than 2.\n\n### Step 2: Locate \"ver selb\" in the Table\nFrom the table, identify the row corresponding to \"ver selb\":\n\n| position | name     | played | drawn | lost | points |\n|----------|----------|--------|-------|------|--------|\n| 1        | ver selb | 14     | 2     | 1    | 24     |\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Position Condition\n- **Position**: The position for \"ver selb\" is 1.\n- Check if this value is smaller than 4.  \n  - Since 1 < 4, the first condition is satisfied.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Losses Condition\n- **Lost**: The number of losses for \"ver selb\" is 1.\n- Check if this value is smaller than 2.\n  - Since 1 < 2, the second condition is also satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are true.
