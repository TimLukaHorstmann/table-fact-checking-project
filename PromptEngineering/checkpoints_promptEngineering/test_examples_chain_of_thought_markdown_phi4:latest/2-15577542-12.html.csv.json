    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"China be the country where the Jiufotang formation be locate\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Relevant Formation:**\n   - We look for entries in the table where the `unit` column contains \"jiufotang formation\".\n\n2. **Check Corresponding Country:**\n   - Once identified, check the corresponding entry in the `location` column to see if it mentions \"china\" as the country.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. Scan through the `unit` column for any entries labeled as \"jiufotang formation\".\n2. In the third row of the table, we find:\n   - **name:** longchengpterus\n   - **status:** valid\n   - **authors:** wang li duan cheng\n   - **unit:** jiufotang formation (this matches our search criteria)\n   - **location:** china\n\n3.
