Identify if there is a person with a snatch of 153.0 and a clean & jerk of 180.0.\n2. Check if that person is \"jos\u00e9 espinoza (nca)\".\n3. Confirm if the bodyweight of this individual is greater than 100 kg.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Persons with Snatch 153.0 and Clean & Jerk 180.0:**\n   - Look through each row to find a person who has both snatch = 153.0 and clean & jerk = 180.0.\n   - From the table:\n     - Christian L\u00f3pez (gua) has a snatch of 153.0 but a clean & jerk of 182.0, not 180.0.\n     - No other individual in the table matches both criteria simultaneously.\n\n2. **Check if That Person is Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (NCA):**\n   - Since no person with both snatch = 153.0 and clean & jerk = 180.0 was found, it's impossible for that person to be \"jos\u00e9 espinoza (nca)\".\n   - Jos\u00e9 Espinoza has a status of \"dnf\" (did not finish), indicating missing data in the relevant columns.\n\n3. **Verify Bodyweight > 100 kg:**\n   - Although we've already determined there's no match for snatch and clean & jerk, if this were needed:\n     - Jos\u00e9 Espinoza's bodyweight is 99.4 kg, which is less than 100 kg.\n     - His data is incomplete due to \"dnf\" status.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is false because there is no person in the table with a snatch of 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0, thus making it impossible for that person to be Jos\u00e9 Espinoza or have any specific bodyweight.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n\n- **Christian L\u00f3pez (gua):** \n  - Snatch: 153.0\n  - Clean & Jerk: 182.0\n\n- **Jos\u00e9 Espinoza (nca):**\n  - Bodyweight: 99.4 kg\n  - Status: dnf (missing data)\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
