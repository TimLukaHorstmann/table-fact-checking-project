    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"am\u00e9rica scored the highest number of 1st leg goals\" is true, we will analyze the data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for 1st Leg Goals**: We need to examine the \"1st leg\" column, which contains the scores from the first match between each pair of teams.\n\n2. **Extract the First Leg Scores**:\n   - For `hotels international fc` vs. `aurora`: Score is `0 - 0`. Am\u00e9rica's equivalent entry would be in a different row.\n   - For `chicago croatian` vs. `olimpia`: Score is `0 - 4`.\n   - For `deportivo suchitep\u00e9quez` vs. `\u00e1guila`: Score is `2 - 1`.\n   - For `vida` vs. `fas`: Score is `1 - 1`.\n   - For `am\u00e9rica` vs. `guadalajara`: Score is `3 - 1`.\n\n3. **Identify Am\u00e9rica's 1st Leg Goals**: From the entry for `am\u00e9rica` vs. `guadalajara`, we see that Am\u00e9rica scored `3` goals in the first leg.\n\n4. **Compare with Other Teams' First Leg Goals**:\n   - `hotels international fc`: Scored `0`\n   - `chicago croatian`: Scored `0`\n   - `deportivo suchitep\u00e9quez`: Scored `2`\n   - `vida`: Scored `1`\n   - **`am\u00e9rica`**: Scored `3`\n\n5. **Determine the Highest Number of 1st Leg Goals**: From the comparison, Am\u00e9rica's score of `3` is indeed the highest among all teams listed in the table for their first leg matches.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"am\u00e9rica scored the highest number of 1st leg goals\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We checked the '1st leg' column to find out how many goals each team scored.
