    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine each row in the table to count how many games were played at the Boston Garden before December 17.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** We focus on the \"location / attendance\" column to find games played at the Boston Garden.\n2. **Check Date Constraint:** Additionally, we need to ensure these games occurred before December 17.\n3. **Examine Each Row:**\n   - **Row 20:** Location is \"boston garden\" and date is December 3. This counts as a valid game.\n   - **Row 21:** Location is \"st louis arena,\" so it does not count.\n   - **Row 22:** Location is \"cincinnati,\" so it does not count.\n   - **Row 23:** Location is \"new york, ny,\" so it does not count.\n   - **Row 24:** Location is \"boston garden\" and date is December 8. This counts as a valid game.\n   - **Row 25:** Location is \"boston garden\" and date is December 11. This counts as a valid game.\n   - **Row 26:** Location is \"boston garden\" and date is December 15. This counts as a valid game.\n   - **Row 27:** Location is \"detroit,\" so it does not count.\n   - **Row 28:** Location is \"boston garden\" and date is December 22, which is after December 17, so it does not count.\n\n4. **Count Valid Games:** We have identified four games at the Boston Garden before December 17 (Rows 20, 24, 25, and 26).\n\n5. **Conclusion:** The claim states there are \"8 game[s] at the boston garden, all before december 17.\" However, we found only four such games.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each row in the table to count games played at 'boston garden' before December 17.
