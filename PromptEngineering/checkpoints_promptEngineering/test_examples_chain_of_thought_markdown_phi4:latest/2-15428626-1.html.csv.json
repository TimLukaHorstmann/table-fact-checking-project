    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about October 27, 1963 being the date of a game against the Houston Oilers is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for October 27, 1963:**\n   - Look at the \"date\" column in the table to find the row corresponding to October 27, 1963.\n\n2. **Check the Opponent for That Date:**\n   - Once we have identified the correct row, examine the \"opponent\" column for that date to see which team was played against.\n\n3. **Verify if the Opponent is Houston Oilers:**\n   - Confirm whether the opponent listed for October 27, 1963 is indeed the Houston Oilers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Date in the Table:**\n   - The \"date\" column shows that October 27, 1963 corresponds to week 7.\n\n2. **Find the Opponent for Week 7:**\n   - In row 7 (week 7), the \"opponent\" column lists \"oakland raiders.\"\n\n3. **Compare with Claimed Opponent:**\n   - The claim states that the game on October 27, 1963 was against the Houston Oilers.\n   - However, the table shows that the opponent for that date is the Oakland Raiders.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the opponent listed in the table (Oakland Raiders) does not match the claimed opponent (Houston Oilers), the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 7, \"date\" column: October 27, 1963\n- Row 7, \"opponent\" column: Oakland Raiders\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row for October 27, 1963 in the 'date' column, which corresponds to week 7.
