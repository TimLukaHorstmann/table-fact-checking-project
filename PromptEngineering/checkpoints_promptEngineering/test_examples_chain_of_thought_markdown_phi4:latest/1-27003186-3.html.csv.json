Upon examining each city, we notice that no city has precisely 50.1% registered voters.\n\n2. **Check for Exact Match:**\n   - Since no city matches exactly 50.1% registered voters, it is unnecessary to proceed further in checking the \"other\" column for these cities as they do not exist in this dataset.\n\n3. **Conclusion on Claim Validity:**\n   - As there are no rows with a \"registered voters\" percentage of 50.1%, it's impossible for any city to have \"7.6% be other when register voter be 50.1%.\"\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the table, there is no city meeting both conditions specified in the claim.
