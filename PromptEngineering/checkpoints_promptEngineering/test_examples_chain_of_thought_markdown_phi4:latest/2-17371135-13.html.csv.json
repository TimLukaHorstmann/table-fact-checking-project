This row matches Chicago hosting Detroit but Conklin isn't the winner.\n\n    - **Row 4 (May 24)**:\n      - Visitor: detroit\n      - Home: chicago\n      - Decision: conklin\n      - Here, Chicago is indeed hosting Detroit and Conklin won the decision.

It shows \"conklin\", which aligns with the claim that Conklin was the decider for this game.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is partially correct: Conklin was indeed the decision maker on May 24.\n   - However, the claim incorrectly states that Chicago played as the home team.
