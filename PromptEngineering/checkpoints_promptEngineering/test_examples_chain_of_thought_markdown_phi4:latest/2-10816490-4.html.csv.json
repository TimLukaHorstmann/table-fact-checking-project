    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the average attendance for games played in May at the Eternal Derby (Croatia) being 22,666 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - Focus on games that took place in May.\n   - The competition type should be \"1. hnl\" since the Eternal Derby refers specifically to matches between Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb within the Croatian First Football League (1. HNL).\n\n2. **Locate All Matches in May with \"1. hnl\":**\n   - Review each row of the table where the month is May, the competition type is \"1. hnl\", and note down their attendance.\n\n3. **Calculate Average Attendance:**\n   - Sum the attendance figures for these matches.\n   - Divide by the number of such matches to find the average attendance.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Value:**\n   - Check if this calculated average is equal to 22,666.\n\nLet's go through each step using the table data:\n\n1. Identify Relevant Games:\n   - Row indices where the month is May and competition is \"1. hnl\":\n     - 13 (13 may 2001): Attendance = 25000\n     - 11 (11 may 2003): Attendance = 22000\n     - 15 (1 may 2004): Attendance = 20000\n     - 19 (13 may 2006): Attendance = 30000\n     - 31 (1 may 2010): Attendance = 13000\n\n2. Calculate the Average:\n   - Sum of attendance: 25000 + 22000 + 20000 + 30000 + 13000 = 110000\n   - Number of matches: 5\n   - Average attendance: 110000 / 5 = 22000\n\n3. Compare with Claimed Value:\n   - The calculated average is 22,000.\n   - The claimed average is 22,666.\n\n4.
