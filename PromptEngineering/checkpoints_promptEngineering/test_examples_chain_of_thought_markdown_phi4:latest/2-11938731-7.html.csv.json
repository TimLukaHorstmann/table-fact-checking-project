Therefore, for the claim to be true, all entries in the \"td 's\" column must be greater than 1.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry in the \"td 's\" Column**:\n   - Joel Gueli: 1\n   - Craig Walls: 0\n   - Russell Hairston: 1\n   - Creig Federico: 0\n   - Scott Dmitrenko: 0\n   - Mike Stoops: 0\n   - John McClennon: 0\n   - Ricky Mitchell: 0\n   - Jim Rafferty: 0\n   - Thomas Weaver: 0\n   - Earnest Adams: 0\n   - Mike Powell: 0\n   - Greg Best: 0\n   - Willis Yates: 0\n   - Lee Larsen: 0\n\n3. **Identify Entries with 1 or Fewer Touchdowns**:\n   - Joel Gueli scored exactly 1 touchdown.\n   - All other players scored 0 touchdowns.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since at least one player (Joel Gueli) did not score more than 1 touchdown, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**: The cells in the \"td 's\" column for all players are relevant because they need to be checked against the condition of having more than 1 touchdown.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we checked each entry in the 'td 's' column.
