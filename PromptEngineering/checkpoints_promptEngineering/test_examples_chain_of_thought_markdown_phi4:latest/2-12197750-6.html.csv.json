    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"5 schools are located in the Norsewood area\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the table for entries where the \"area\" column equals \"norsewood\". Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: We focus on the \"area\" column since it contains information about the location of each school.\n\n2. **Scan Each Row**: For each row in the table, we need to check if the value under the \"area\" column is \"norsewood\".\n\n3. **Count Matches**: Count how many times \"norsewood\" appears in the \"area\" column.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**: Check if this count matches the number stated in the claim (which is 5).\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- We start from the first row and move down each subsequent row.\n- For each school:\n  - Row 1: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 2: \"eketahuna\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 3: \"pahiatua\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 4: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 5: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 6: \"eketahuna\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 7: \"pahiatua\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 8: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 9: \"woodville\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 10: \"makuri\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 11: \"mangamaire\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 12: \"mangatainoka\" (not norsewood)\n  - **Row 13**: \"norsewood\" (matches the area we are looking for)\n  - Row 14: \"pahiatua\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 15: \"pahiatua\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 16: \"woodville\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 17: \"pongaroa\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 18: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 19: \"pahiatua\" (not norsewood)\n  - **Row 20**: \"dannevirke\" (not the area we are looking for, but worth noting it's part of a combined school with an integrated authority)\n  - Row 21: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood, integrated authority)\n  - Row 22: \"pahiatua\" (not norsewood)\n  - **Row 23**: \"norsewood\" (matches the area we are looking for)\n  - Row 24: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood)\n  - **Row 25**: \"dannevirke\" (not norsewood, but includes Norsewood in its integrated school name)\n  - Row 26: \"norsewood\" (matches the area we are looking for)\n  - Row 27: \"weber\" (not norsewood)\n  - Row 28: \"woodville\" (not norsewood)\n\n5. **Count the Matches**: There are three schools located in Norsewood:\n   - Norsewood and Districts School\n   - TKKM O Tamaki Nui A Rua (includes Norsewood in its integrated school name, but primarily Dannevirke)\n   - Totara College of Accelerated Learning (partially Norsewood, based on school name integration)\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The count is 3, not 5 as the claim states.\n\nTherefore, the claim \"5 schools are located in the Norsewood area\" is FALSE.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified 'area' column for location data.
