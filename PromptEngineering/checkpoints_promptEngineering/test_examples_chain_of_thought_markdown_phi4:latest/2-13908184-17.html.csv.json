    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"right wing Scott Jessee be draft last in the draft\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the relevant information from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Scott Jessee, who plays as a right wing, was drafted last in the draft order.\n   \n2. **Locate Scott Jessee's Information in the Table:**\n   - We need to find the row where \"player\" is \"scott jessee.\"\n   - According to the table:\n     - Row 11 contains the player \"scott jessee.\"\n     - The position listed is \"right wing,\" which matches part of the claim.\n     - The round number for Scott Jessee is 11.\n\n3. **Check if Scott Jessee was Drafted Last:**\n   - To confirm if he was drafted last, we need to check the highest round number in the table since the draft rounds are listed sequentially from lowest to highest.\n   - By examining the \"round\" column:\n     - The highest round number present is 14 (row 14).\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Data:**\n   - Since Scott Jessee was drafted in round 11, and there are players drafted in later rounds (e.g., round 13 and 14), he was not drafted last.\n   - Therefore, the claim that Scott Jessee was drafted last is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 11 with columns \"round,\" \"player,\" and \"position.\"\n- Row 14 to identify the highest draft round number.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: Scott Jessee was drafted last.\",\n    \"Locate Scott Jessee's row, which is row 11 with position 'right wing' and round 11.\",\n    \"Check for the highest draft round number in the table, which is 14.\",\n    \"Since round 11 is not the last round, Scott Jessee was not drafted last.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"all of the center draft be from the united state\" is true or false, we need to examine each row in the table for players listed as centers, identify their nationality, and check if all are from the United States.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify players with the position 'center':**\n   - We look at the \"position\" column to find entries labeled as \"center.\"\n\n2. **Check each center's nationality:**\n   - For each player identified in step 1, we check their \"nationality\" to determine if they are from Canada or the United States.\n\n3. **Verify claim against findings:**\n   - The claim states that all centers should be from the United States. We need to verify this by ensuring none of the players with the position 'center' have the nationality 'Canada.'\n\n### Examination:\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Player: Randy Andreachuk\n  - Position: center\n  - Nationality: Canada\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Player: Dennis Sobchuk\n  - Position: center\n  - Nationality: Canada\n\nFrom the table, we observe that both players listed as centers (Randy Andreachuk and Dennis Sobchuk) are from Canada.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince there are center positions listed for players from Canada, the claim \"all of the center draft be from the united state\" is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all players with position 'center' and checked their nationality.
