    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the table is true or false, we need to evaluate whether Fitzroy was indeed the home team with the highest score among all matches listed on 20 May 1972.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the Date:** \n   - The claim specifies \"at 18.11\", implying that we are considering a match involving Fitzroy, which took place on 20 May 1972. We need to focus only on this date for all teams and scores listed in the table.\n\n2. **Find Fitzroy's Match:**\n   - Locate Fitzroy as a home team in the \"home team\" column. In row 3 of the table, Fitzroy is listed as the home team against South Melbourne with a score of 18.11 (119).\n\n3. **Compare Home Team Scores:**\n   - List all scores for each match where teams were playing at home on 20 May 1972:\n     - Collingwood: 7.14 (56)\n     - Melbourne: 20.14 (134)\n     - South Melbourne: 9.7 (61) \n     - North Melbourne: 8.13 (61)\n     - St Kilda: 10.12 (72)\n     - Richmond: 11.25 (91)\n\n4. **Convert Scores to Decimal for Easy Comparison:**\n   - Convert each score in the form \"X.YY\" to its decimal equivalent:\n     - Collingwood: 56\n     - Melbourne: 134\n     - South Melbourne: 61\n     - North Melbourne: 61\n     - St Kilda: 72\n     - Richmond: 91\n\n5. **Compare Fitzroy's Score with Others:**\n   - Fitzroy's score of 18.11 (119) must be compared against the converted scores:\n     - Compare 119 to all other home team scores: 56, 134, 61, 61, 72, and 91.\n   \n6. **Determine if Fitzroy Has the Highest Score:**\n   - Melbourne's score is higher at 134 points (20.14), compared to Fitzroy\u2019s 119 points.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Fitzroy does not have the highest home team score on this date.
