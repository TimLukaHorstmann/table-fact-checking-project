These include:\n     - Thomas Cup\n     - Sudirman Cup\n     - European Men's Team Championships\n     - European Mixed Team Championships\n\n2. **Locate the Specific Event in Question:**\n   - The claim refers to a \"silver\" outcome at Amsterdam in 2012.\n   - We need to find the section of the table that contains records for the \"European Men's Team Championships\" and check if there is an entry with these details.\n\n3. **Find the Entry for European Men's Team Championships:**\n   - Within the European Men's Team Championships section, look for entries corresponding to the year 2012 and venue Amsterdam.\n   - The relevant row in this section shows:\n     ```\n     | silver                             | 2012                               | amsterdam                            | denmark ( jan \u00f8 j\u00f8rgensen )        | 0 - 3 (11 - 21 , 14 - 21)           |\n     ```\n\n4. **Compare the Claimed Score with Table Data:**\n   - The claim states that the score for this event is \"0 - 3 (11 - 21, 14 - 21)\".\n   - This matches exactly with the score provided in the table.\n\n5. **Conclude Based on Comparison:**\n   - Since the claimed score matches the score in the table, the statement is accurate.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to a 'silver' outcome at Amsterdam in 2012 for the European Men's Team Championships.
