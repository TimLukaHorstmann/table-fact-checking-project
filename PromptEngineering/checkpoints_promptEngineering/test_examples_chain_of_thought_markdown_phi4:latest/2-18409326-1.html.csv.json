Here's how we can proceed:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries**: We first identify which rows have \"vista broadcast group\" listed in the \"owner\" column.\n\n2. **Check Format for Variety**:\n   - For each identified row, we look at the \"format\" column to understand what type of content is played by that station.\n   - We then determine if the format represents a diverse range of hits or if it's limited to specific genres/styles.\n\n3. **Analyze Specific Entry**:\n   - In this table, \"vista broadcast group\" appears in one row (row 9).\n   - The corresponding \"format\" for this entry is \"adult hits.\"\n\n4. **Interpret the Claim**: \n   - The claim suggests that \"vista broadcast group play all type of hit.\" This implies a broad range covering various music genres or styles.\n   - The term \"all type of hit\" indicates a variety of popular songs from different categories, not limited to one genre.\n\n5. **Evaluate Against Table Data**:\n   - Since the only entry for \"vista broadcast group\" has a format labeled as \"adult hits,\" it suggests a focus on popular music but does not explicitly confirm coverage of all types or genres of hits.\n   - The term \"adult hits\" typically refers to popular music that appeals to an adult demographic, which might exclude other genres like rock, classical, jazz, etc.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the available data in the table, \"vista broadcast group\" is associated with only one format: \"adult hits.\"\n   - There is no evidence in this row that it covers \"all type of hit.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the information provided in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim 'vista broadcast group play all type of hit' was evaluated against the table data.
