    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Jeremija Sanders' opponent's record being 8-4 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Opponent:**\n   - Look at the row where Jeremija Sanders appears as the opponent.\n   - From the table, we find that Jeremija Sanders is listed in the row with a \"win\" result for the fighter (Row 17).\n\n2. **Verify the Record of Jeremija Sanders:**\n   - In Row 17, under the \"record\" column, it shows Jeremija Sanders' record as 0-1.\n\n3. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that Jeremija Sanders' opponent has a record of 8-4.\n   - We need to check if there is any other row where this fighter's opponent (the one who defeated Jeremija Sanders) has a record of 8-4.\n\n4. **Check All Rows for the Opponent:**\n   - Look through each row in the table to find where this fighter (who defeated Jeremija Sanders) appears as an opponent.\n   - The opponent is not named in the table, but we know from Row 17 that the fighter has a record of 8-2 before defeating Jeremija Sanders.\n\n5. **Calculate the Opponent's Record After the Fight:**\n   - Before defeating Jeremija Sanders, the fighter had a record of 8-2.\n   - After winning against Jeremija Sanders (record 0-1), the opponent's updated record becomes 9-2.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states the opponent's record should be 8-4 after defeating Jeremija Sanders, but based on our calculation, it is actually 9-2.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nHere is the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify Jeremija Sanders' row to find his record (0-1).
