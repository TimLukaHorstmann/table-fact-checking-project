    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim regarding Week 17's game, we will analyze the data from the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Week 17**: First, locate the row corresponding to Week 17 in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Relevant Information**:\n   - Check the \"week\" column for a value of 17.\n   - Once identified, examine the \"opponent\", \"result\", and other relevant details such as \"date\".\n\n3. **Examine the Result**: \n   - In Week 17, find the \"result\" column to determine whether the Dolphins won or lost against their opponent.\n\n4. **Verify Opponent**:\n   - Confirm that the opponent for Week 17 is indeed the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n5. **Evaluate Claim Against Data**:\n   - The claim states that the Dolphins did not win against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17.\n   - Compare this with the \"result\" from the table to determine if it matches the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Locate Week 17**: \n   - From the table, we find:\n     ```\n     |   week | date                | opponent             | result    | tv time      | attendance |\n     |-------:|:--------------------|:---------------------|:----------|:-------------|-----------:|\n     |     17 | december 29 , 2002  | new england patriots | l 27 - 24 | cbs 1:00 pm  |    68436   |\n     ```\n\n2. **Check Opponent**:\n   - The opponent listed for Week 17 is \"new england patriots\", not the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n3. **Examine Result**:\n   - The result column shows \"l 27 - 24\", indicating a loss against the New England Patriots.\n\n4. **Evaluate Claim**:\n   - Since there was no game between the Dolphins and the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17, the claim about not winning against them is irrelevant.\n   - However, since they did not play each other, it logically follows that they could not have won or lost against one another in Week 17.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim states that \"the game in week 17 be not a game where the dolphin win against the minnesota viking.\" Given that there was no game between these two teams in Week 17, this statement is technically true by default since they did not play each other.
