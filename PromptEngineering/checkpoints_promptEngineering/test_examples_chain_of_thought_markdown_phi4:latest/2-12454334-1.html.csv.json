The claim states that \"Cape Vincent, NY\" should be last among the city of license, with \"Webster, NY\" in first position.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column and Rows**: \n   - We focus on the column labeled \"city of license\".\n   - Extract the cities listed in this column along with their respective row indices.\n\n2. **Extract City Names**:\n   - Row 1: Cape Vincent, NY\n   - Row 2: Webster, NY\n   - Row 3: Malone, NY\n   - Row 4: Syracuse, NY\n   - Row 5: Cold Brook, NY\n\n3. **Determine Order in Table**:\n   - The order of cities as they appear in the table is:\n     1. Cape Vincent, NY (Row 1)\n     2. Webster, NY (Row 2)\n     3. Malone, NY (Row 3)\n     4. Syracuse, NY (Row 4)\n     5. Cold Brook, NY (Row 5)\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that \"Cape Vincent, NY\" should be last.\n   - According to the table order, Cape Vincent, NY is first, not last.\n   - The claim also states that \"Webster, NY\" should be in the first position.\n   - In the actual order, Webster, NY is second.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table's order.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 1, Column \"city of license\": Cape Vincent, NY\n- Row 2, Column \"city of license\": Webster, NY\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The city of license column lists cities in a specific order: 1.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to verify if there are two entries (class B) with a frequency of 91.1 FM.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Class B Entries:**\n   - We look at the \"class\" column in the table to find all entries that are classified as 'b'.\n   \n2. **Check Frequencies for Class B Entries:**\n   - For each entry identified as class 'b', we check its frequency listed under the \"frequency\" column.\n\n3. **Verify Frequency of 91.1 FM:**\n   - We need to see if any of these class 'b' entries have a frequency of 91.1 FM.\n   \n4. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - Finally, count how many times the frequency 91.1 FM appears among the class 'b' entries.\n\n### Applying Steps to the Table:\n\n- **Row 1:** wmhi, Class = a\n- **Row 2:** wmhn, Class = a\n- **Row 3:** wmhq, Class = a\n- **Row 4:** wmhr, Class = b, Frequency = 102.9 FM\n- **Row 5:** wmhu, Class = a\n\nFrom the above steps:\n\n1. Only one entry is of class 'b' (wmhr).\n2. The frequency for this class 'b' entry is 102.9 FM.\n3.
