    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Sweden earning 5 medals in total for cross-country skiing is true or false, we need to examine the table provided:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**:\n   - We are interested in rows where \"nation\" is \"sweden (swe)\" and \"sport\" is \"cross - country skiing\".\n\n2. **Locate Sweden's Entries for Cross-Country Skiing**:\n   - There are two relevant entries for Sweden in cross-country skiing:\n     - Row 3: `gold = 2`, `silver = 1`, `bronze = 1`\n     - Row 10: `gold = 2`, `silver = 0`, `bronze = 0`\n\n3. **Calculate Total Medals**:\n   - For the first entry (Row 3): \n     - Total medals = `gold + silver + bronze` = `2 + 1 + 1` = 4\n   - For the second entry (Row 10):\n     - Total medals = `gold + silver + bronze` = `2 + 0 + 0` = 2\n\n4. **Sum the Medals from Both Entries**:\n   - Combined total for Sweden in cross-country skiing = 4 (from Row 3) + 2 (from Row 10) = 6 medals.\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that Sweden earned 5 medals in total for cross-country skiing.\n   - Our calculation shows that Sweden actually earned 6 medals, not 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Sweden earned a total of 6 medals in cross-country skiing, not 5.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where nation is 'sweden (swe)' and sport is 'cross - country skiing'.\",\n    \"Locate relevant entries: Row 3 and Row 10.\",\n    \"Calculate total medals for each entry: Row 3 has 4 medals, Row 10 has 2 medals.\",\n    \"Sum the medals from both entries to get a combined total of 6 medals.\",\n    \"Compare this with the claim which states 5 medals; since 6 is not equal to 5, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"nation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"sport\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
