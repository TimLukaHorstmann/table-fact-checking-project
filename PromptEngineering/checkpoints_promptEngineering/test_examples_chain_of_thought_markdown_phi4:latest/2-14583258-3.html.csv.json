    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the information provided by both the table and the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information from the Table:**\n   - We need to look at the number of events played by Phil Mickelson and Vijay Singh according to the table.\n   - From the table:\n     - Phil Mickelson has \"23\" events listed under his row.\n     - Vijay Singh has \"26\" events listed under his row.\n\n2. **Interpret the Claim:**\n   - The claim states, \"Phil Mickelson played in 1 less event than Vijay Singh at the 2001 PGA Tour.\"\n   - This means we need to verify if the number of events Phil Mickelson participated in is exactly one less than that of Vijay Singh.\n\n3. **Compare the Number of Events:**\n   - According to the table:\n     - Phil Mickelson played in 23 events.\n     - Vijay Singh played in 26 events.\n   - Calculate the difference: \\(26 - 23 = 3\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim suggests a difference of 1 event, but our calculation shows a difference of 3 events.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the actual difference is 3 and not 1, the claim is false based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Relevant Cells from the Table:\n\n- Phil Mickelson's events: Row index 2, Column name \"events\"\n- Vijay Singh's events: Row index 4, Column name \"events\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of events played by Phil Mickelson and Vijay Singh from the table.\",\n    \"Phil Mickelson has 23 events; Vijay Singh has 26 events.\",\n    \"The claim states Phil Mickelson played in 1 less event than Vijay Singh.\",\n    \"Calculate the difference: 26 - 23 = 3.\",\n    \"The calculated difference is 3, not 1 as claimed.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"events\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
