    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"2 drivers leave the race early because they have engine problems\" is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the column related to race finish:** \n   - The relevant column for understanding why a driver did not complete the full 70 laps is the \"time / retired\" column.\n\n2. **Filter drivers with engine issues:**\n   - We need to identify all rows where the \"time / retired\" column mentions \"engine.\"\n\n3. **Count the number of drivers with engine problems:**\n   - After filtering, we will count how many drivers had engine-related retirements.\n\n4. **Evaluate the claim:**\n   - The claim states that 2 drivers left early due to engine issues. We need to verify if our filtered and counted list matches this number.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Step 1 & 2:** Check each row in the \"time / retired\" column for entries containing \"engine.\"\n\n  From the table:\n  - Riccardo Patrese: \"+ 7 laps, engine\"\n  - Philippe Alliot: \"engine\"\n  - Martin Brundle: \"engine\"\n  - Piercarlo Ghinzani: \"engine\"\n\n- **Step 3:** Count these drivers:\n  - Riccardo Patrese\n  - Philippe Alliot\n  - Martin Brundle\n  - Piercarlo Ghinzani\n\n  Total = 4 drivers with engine problems.\n\n- **Step 4:** Evaluate the claim:\n  - The table shows that 4 drivers retired due to engine issues, not 2 as claimed.\n\nThus, the claim is false. \n\nNow, let's format this in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column related to race finish: 'time / retired'.\",\n    \"Filter rows where 'time / retired' contains 'engine': Riccardo Patrese, Philippe Alliot, Martin Brundle, Piercarlo Ghinzani.\",\n    \"Count drivers with engine issues: 4 drivers.\",\n    \"Evaluate the claim: The table shows 4 drivers, not 2 as claimed.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Ferrari be the constructor of 3 of the cars driven in the race\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the provided table and count how many times Ferrari appears as a constructor.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Column of Interest**:\n   - The relevant column for this analysis is \"constructor,\" which lists who built each car that participated in the race.\n\n2. **Scan the Constructor Column**:\n   - Go through each row and look at the entries under the \"constructor\" column to identify all instances where \"Ferrari\" appears as a constructor.\n\n3. **Count Ferrari Entries**:\n   - For each entry, check if it matches \"ferrari.\"\n   - Keep a count of how many times \"ferrari\" is listed.\n\n4. **Relevant Rows Identification**:\n   - Record the row index and column name for all relevant entries where \"Ferrari\" appears as the constructor to verify our findings.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Row 5: Michele Alboreto, Constructor = Ferrari\n- Row 6: Stefan Johansson, Constructor = Ferrari\n\nUpon scanning through the table, \"Ferrari\" is listed only twice as a constructor. Therefore, there are not three cars driven in the race where Ferrari is the constructor.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that \"Ferrari be the constructor of 3 of the car drive in the race\" is FALSE because Ferrari was the constructor for only two drivers according to the table provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify and scan the 'constructor' column in the table.
