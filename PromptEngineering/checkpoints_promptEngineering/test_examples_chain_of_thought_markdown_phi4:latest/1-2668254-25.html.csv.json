For Virginia district 19, we find:\n     - **District:** virginia 19\n     - **Incumbent:** william mccoy\n     - **Party:** jacksonian\n     - **First Elected:** 1811\n\n3. **Check the \"First Elected\" Column:**\n   - The claim states that the candidate from Virginia district 19 was first elected in 1811.\n   - From our identified row, the \"first elected\" year for the incumbent william mccoy is indeed listed as 1811.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Candidate's Election Result:**\n   - We also note that in this case, the result shows \"re-elected,\" which implies he was first elected previously, and now re-elected.\n   - This does not contradict the claim about being first elected in 1811; it simply adds that he has been re-elected since then.\n\n5. **Conclude:**\n   - The table confirms that the candidate from Virginia district 19 (william mccoy) was first elected in 1811, which aligns perfectly with the statement of the claim.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- From the row for \"virginia 19,\" relevant cells are:\n  - `(\"virginia 19\", \"first elected\")` -> 1811\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists 'william mccoy' as the incumbent for Virginia district 19, with a first election year of 1811.
