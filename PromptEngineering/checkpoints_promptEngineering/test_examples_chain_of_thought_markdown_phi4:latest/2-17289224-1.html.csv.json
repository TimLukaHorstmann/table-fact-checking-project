    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We need to find all entries for the season 2005. In the table, there are two rows corresponding to the year 2005:\n   - Row 4: Formula Three Sudamericana with Bassani Racing.\n   - Row 5: Formula Renault 2.0 Brazil with Gramacho Racing.\n\n2. **Filter by Series**: The claim specifically mentions the \"Formula Three Sudamericana\" series, so we focus on row 4.\n\n3. **Check Pole Count**: In row 4, check the value in the \"poles\" column for the Formula Three Sudamericana series:\n   - Row 4: Poles = 1\n\n4. **Sum of Poles**: Since there is only one entry for the Formula Three Sudamericana series in 2005, the sum of poles for this series in that year is simply the value from row 4.\n\n5. **Verify Claim**: The claim states that \"in season of 2005, the sum of pole with the series of formula three sudamericana be 1\". Based on our examination:\n   - We found only one entry for Formula Three Sudamericana in 2005.\n   - The number of poles is indeed 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the calculated sum of poles (1) matches the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified rows for season 2005 and filtered by 'Formula Three Sudamericana' series.
