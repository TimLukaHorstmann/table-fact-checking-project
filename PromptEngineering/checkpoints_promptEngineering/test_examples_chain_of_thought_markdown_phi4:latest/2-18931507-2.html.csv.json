    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's break down the claim and verify each part against the data in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n\n1. **Event Name**: \"wff mma : pascua yaqui fight 4\"\n2. **Location**: \"tucson, arizona, united state\"\n3. **Number of Rounds**: \"1 round\"\n4. **Duration**: \"last 1:25\"\n\n### Verification Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant row**:\n   - We need to find the event named \"wff mma : pascua yaqui fight 4\". From the table, we see that this corresponds to the record where `event` is \"wff mma : pascua yaqui fights 4\", located in the fifth row.\n\n2. **Verify Location**:\n   - Check the `location` column for the same row (row index 5). The location listed is \"tucson, arizona, united states\". This matches the claim's location of \"tucson, arizona, united state\" except for a slight variation in punctuation (comma vs space after \"arizona\"). However, this difference is negligible and does not change the meaning.\n\n3. **Verify Number of Rounds**:\n   - Check the `round` column for the same row (row index 5). It shows that the fight lasted 1 round, which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Verify Duration**:\n   - Check the `time` column for the same row (row index 5). The duration is listed as \"1:25\", which matches the claim's duration of \"last 1:25\".\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAll parts of the claim are verified against the table data and found to be accurate. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The event 'wff mma : pascua yaqui fight 4' corresponds to row 5 in the table.

    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to compare the duration of the fight from the Gladiator Challenge event against the duration of the fight from the Pascua Yaqui Fights 4 event. Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Rows:**\n   - The row for the \"gladiator challenge\" event is Row 2, where Miguelito Marti was defeated via TKO (punches) at 1:43.\n   - The row for the \"pascua yaqui fights 4\" event is Row 5, where Michael Poe was defeated via submission (punches) at 1:25.\n\n2. **Extract the Time Taken from Each Event:**\n   - For the Gladiator Challenge fight against Miguelito Marti (Row 2), the time taken is listed as \"1:43.\"\n   - For the Pascua Yaqui Fights 4 event against Michael Poe (Row 5), the time taken is listed as \"1:25.\"\n\n3. **Convert Times to Seconds for Comparison:**\n   - Convert \"1:43\" into seconds: \\(1 \\times 60 + 43 = 103\\) seconds.\n   - Convert \"1:25\" into seconds: \\(1 \\times 60 + 25 = 85\\) seconds.\n\n4. **Compare the Times:**\n   - The fight at Gladiator Challenge lasted 103 seconds.\n   - The fight at Pascua Yaqui Fights 4 lasted 85 seconds.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the \"gladiator challenge\" fight was shorter than the \"pascua yaqui fight.\"\n   - From our calculations, the Gladiator Challenge fight (103 seconds) is longer than the Pascua Yaqui fight (85 seconds).\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify rows for 'gladiator challenge' and 'pascua yaqui fights 4'.
