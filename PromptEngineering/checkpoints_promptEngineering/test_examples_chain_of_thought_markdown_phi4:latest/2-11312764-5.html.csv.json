Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner should have a rank that is numerically 5 places higher than Kyoko Hagiwara and Hisao Ozaki.\n2. Additionally, they should also have a better (lower) place number compared to Kyoko Hagiwara and Hisao Ozaki.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Rank of Each Pair:**\n   - Tai Babilonia / Randy Gardner are ranked 1st.\n   - Kyoko Hagiwara / Hisao Ozaki are ranked 14th.\n\n2. **Check if the Rank Difference is 5:**\n   - The rank difference between Tai Babilonia / Randy Gardner (rank 1) and Kyoko Hagiwara / Hisao Ozaki (rank 14) is:\n     \\[\n     14 - 1 = 13\n     \\]\n   - This is not equal to 5, so the claim about their rank difference being 5 is false.\n\n3. **Check the Place Numbers:**\n   - Tai Babilonia / Randy Gardner have a place number of 12.\n   - Kyoko Hagiwara / Hisao Ozaki have a place number of 120.\n   - Since 12 is less than 120, Tai Babilonia / Randy Gardner are indeed placed higher than Kyoko Hagiwara / Hisao Ozaki.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim requires both conditions to be true: the rank difference must be exactly 5, and they must have a better place number.
