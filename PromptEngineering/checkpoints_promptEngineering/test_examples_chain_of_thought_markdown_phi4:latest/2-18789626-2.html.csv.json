    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"winamac join 10 year after southwestern join\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to examine the specific data from the table related to when each school joined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Join Year for Southwestern:**\n   - From the table, locate the row for \"southwestern\" under the column \"year joined.\"\n   - The value is 1958.\n   \n2. **Identify the Join Year for Winamac:**\n   - Locate the row for \"winamac\" under the same column.\n   - The value is 1947.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Years:**\n   - Subtract the year \"southwestern\" joined from the year \"winamac\" joined:\n     \\[\n     1947 - 1958 = -11\n     \\]\n   - This calculation shows that Winamac joined 11 years before Southwestern, not after.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Winamac join 10 years after southwestern join.\"\n   - Our calculation indicates that Winamac actually joined 11 years earlier than Southwestern.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- For \"southwestern,\" the relevant cell is:\n  - Row index: 7 (in zero-based indexing)\n  - Column name: \"year joined\"\n  \n- For \"winamac,\" the relevant cell is:\n  - Row index: 5\n  - Column name: \"year joined\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The join year for southwestern is 1958, and for winamac it is 1947. Calculating the difference (1947 - 1958) results in -11 years, indicating winamac joined 11 years before southwestern. Therefore, the claim that 'winamac join 10 years after southwestern join' is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
