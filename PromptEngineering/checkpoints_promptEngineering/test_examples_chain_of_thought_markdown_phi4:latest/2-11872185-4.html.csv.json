    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"lifetime India share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the data provided in the table for movies released before 2009.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Movies:**\n   - We are interested in movies whose release year is earlier than 2009.\n   - According to the table, all listed movies have a release year of either 2010 or later:\n     - \"3 idiots\" (2009)\n     - Other movies: 2011, 2012, and 2013\n\n2. **Check for Movies Before 2009:**\n   - None of the movies in the table were released before 2009.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - Since there are no entries for movies with a release year earlier than 2009, we have no data to contradict the claim.\n   - Therefore, by default, any movie not listed would have a lifetime India distributor share of 0, as per the table's scope.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The table does not contain any movies from before 2009; thus, their lifetime India distributor share is effectively 0 within this dataset.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE based on the data provided in the table.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists only movies released in or after 2009.
