    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE, we need to carefully analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"only Canada won more than 1 medal in football in the 2012 Summer Olympics.\"\n\n2. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Each row represents a country and its medal count.\n   - Columns include: `rank`, `nation`, `gold`, `silver`, `bronze`, and `total`.\n   - The table shows medal counts for each nation.\n\n3. **Identify Medal Counts**:\n   - Canada's row: \n     - Gold: 0\n     - Silver: 0\n     - Bronze: 1\n     - Total: 1\n\n4. **Check Other Nations**:\n   - Mexico, United States, Brazil, Japan, South Korea: All have a total of 1 medal.\n   - No nation has more than 1 medal according to the table.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim Against Table Data**:\n   - The claim specifies \"more than 1 medal,\" which implies at least 2 medals.\n   - Canada, as per the table, only won 1 bronze medal (Total: 1).\n   - No nation in the table has a total count greater than 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Since no country, including Canada, has more than 1 medal according to the table, the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those that show the `total` medals for each nation.\n   - Specifically: \n     - Canada's total medals (`row_index`: 5, `column_name`: \"total\")\n     - All other nations' totals to confirm none have more than 1 medal.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that only Canada won more than 1 medal.
