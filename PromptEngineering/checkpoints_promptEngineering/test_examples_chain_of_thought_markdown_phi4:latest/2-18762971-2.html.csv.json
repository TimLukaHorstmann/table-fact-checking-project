    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to evaluate each game's result and identify those matches where no goals were scored by either team (i.e., a 0-0 draw). Here\u2019s how we can systematically approach this:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column:**\n   - The column of interest is \"result,\" which indicates the scoreline for each game.\n\n2. **Examine Each Game's Result:**\n   - We need to scan through each row in the \"result\" column and count how many games ended with a 0-0 result, indicating no goals were scored by either side.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 0-0 Results:**\n   - As we check each entry in the \"result\" column:\n     - 13 August 2000: wolverhampton wanderers (1 - 1) - Not a 0-0\n     - 19 August 2000: huddersfield town (2 - 3) - Not a 0-0\n     - 26 August 2000: grimsby town (1 - 0) - Not a 0-0\n     - 28 August 2000: blackburn rovers (1 - 1) - Not a 0-0\n     - 9 September 2000: wimbledon (0 - 5) - Not a 0-0\n     - 13 September 2000: nottingham forest (0 - 1) - Not a 0-0\n     - 16 September 2000: tranmere rovers (0 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 23 September 2000: preston north end (1 - 3) - Not a 0-0\n     - 30 September 2000: gillingham (0 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 8 October 2000: west bromwich albion (1 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 14 October 2000: portsmouth (1 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 17 October 2000: burnley (0 - 1) - Not a 0-0\n     - 24 February 2001: preston north end (0 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 7 March 2001: portsmouth (0 - 0) - This is a 0-0 result\n     - 10 March 2001: west bromwich albion (2 - 1) - Not a 0-0\n     - 17 March 2001: burnley (2 - 0) - Not a 0-0\n     - 24 April 2001: sheffield united (1 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 7 April 2001: stockport county (1 - 2) - Not a 0-0\n     - 6 May 2001: crewe alexandra (0 - 0) - This is a 0-0 result\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have identified two games with a 0-0 scoreline:\n     - 7 March 2001 against portsmouth\n     - 6 May 2001 against crewe alexandra\n   - Therefore, there are not four different games where no goals were scored by either side.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim is false.
