Thus, his draft year matches his eligibility year.\n\n   - **Chris Jackson:**\n     - College: LSU\n     - NBA Draft Year: 1990\n     - Chris attended college at LSU before being drafted in 1990. Therefore, the draft year aligns with his eligibility after one college season.\n   \n   - **Chris Mills:**\n     - Colleges: Kentucky / Arizona\n     - NBA Draft Year: 1993\n     - With stints at both Kentucky and Arizona before the 1993 draft, Chris completed enough time in college to be eligible that year.\n\n   - **Billy Owens:**\n     - College: Syracuse\n     - NBA Draft Year: 1991\n     - Billy attended Syracuse and was drafted in 1991, suggesting he fulfilled eligibility requirements by attending at least one year of college.\n   \n   - **Kenny Williams:**\n     - Colleges: Barton CC / Elizabeth City State\n     - NBA Draft Year: 1990\n     - Kenny went to junior colleges before being drafted. Typically, players from junior colleges are eligible for the draft after their first year out of high school. His draft in 1990 indicates his eligibility was met.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Each player attended college or spent time at a junior college that aligns with the NBA draft rules for eligibility.\n   - All five players were selected in the NBA draft during the season they were eligible based on the information provided.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Each player attended college or spent enough time at a junior college to meet NBA draft eligibility requirements.

Thus, he is not from California.\n\n- Other players:\n  - **Alonzo Mourning:** Hometown is Chesapeake, VA.\n  - **Chris Jackson:** Hometown is Gulfport, MS.\n  - **Chris Mills:** Hometown is Los Angeles, CA.\n  - **Kenny Williams:** Hometown is Elizabeth City, NC.\n\n- The only player from California is Chris Mills (Los Angeles, CA).\n\n### Part 2: Was Billy Owens a first-round draft pick in 1993?\n\n- From the table, we need to examine the \"nba draft\" column for each player's draft details.\n  \n- **Billy Owens:** Drafted as a 1st round - 3rd pick of the 1991 draft by the Kings.\n\n- The claim states that Billy Owens was drafted in 1993, which is incorrect based on the table.

The tallest players are Alonzo Mourning and Kenny Williams at 6'10\". Therefore, the claim that \"Chris Mills be the tallest player\" is FALSE.\n\n2. **Evaluate Shortest Player:**\n   - Billy Owens's height is 6'9\".\n   - Chris Jackson's height is 6'0\".\n\n   Among all players listed, Chris Jackson is the shortest at 6'0\". Therefore, the claim that \"Billy Owens be the shortest player\" is FALSE.\n\n3. **Evaluate NBA Draft Selection:**\n   - Both Chris Mills and Billy Owens are indeed selected for the NBA as indicated in their respective rows:\n     - Chris Mills was drafted in the 1st round, 22nd pick of the 1993 draft (Cavs).\n     - Billy Owens was drafted in the 1st round, 3rd pick of the 1991 draft (Kings).\n\n   Therefore, the claim that \"both be selected for the NBA\" is TRUE.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim contains two false statements regarding height and one true statement about NBA selection.
