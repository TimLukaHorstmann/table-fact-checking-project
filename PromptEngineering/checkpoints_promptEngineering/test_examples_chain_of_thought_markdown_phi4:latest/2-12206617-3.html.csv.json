    "resp": "To determine if the claim about the Toronto Blue Jays playing in 8 games with an attendance greater than 5000 in May of the 1991 season is true, we need to analyze the provided table:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: \n   - We are looking for games involving the \"Toronto Blue Jays\" since they are referred to as such historically around this time period.\n   - The claim pertains specifically to the month of May 1991.\n\n2. **Extract the Opponent Column**:\n   - Check each row in the \"opponent\" column to see if it matches any known team names that could represent the Toronto Blue Jays during that era.\n\n3. **Known Team Abbreviations for Toronto Blue Jays**:\n   - The teams mentioned with similar abbreviations or full names include \"rangers,\" \"royals,\" \"white sox,\" \"athletics,\" and \"angels.\"\n   - Historically, the \"Athletics\" refers to Oakland Athletics in this context, which means these games are not against the Blue Jays.\n   - \"Angels\" likely refer to Los Angeles Angels.\n\n4. **Check for Other Opponents**:\n   - The remaining potential teams could be inferred as the Toronto Blue Jays based on elimination: \"rangers,\" \"royals,\" and \"white sox.\"\n\n5. **Determine Attendance**:\n   - For each identified game involving these possible opponents, check the \"attendance\" column to see if it exceeds 5000.\n\n6. **Count the Games**:\n   - Count how many games meet both criteria: opponent potentially being Toronto Blue Jays and attendance greater than 5000.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **May 1 vs Rangers**: Attendance = 33439\n- **May 2, 3, 4, 5 vs Royals**: Attendances are 22896, 20809, 22628, 22588 respectively.\n- **May 7, 8 vs Rangers**: Attendances are 44622, 43211 respectively.\n- **May 9, 10, 11, 12 vs White Sox**: Attendances are 47236, 50198, 50206, 50108 respectively.\n- **May 13, 14, 15 vs Royals**: Attendances are 44275, 43357, 50113 respectively.\n- **May 17, 18, 19 vs White Sox**: Attendances are 30095, 34861, 41015 respectively.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n\n- Games against \"Rangers\" on May 1, 7, and 8 have attendance greater than 5000.\n- Games against \"Royals\" on May 13 and 14 have attendance greater than 5000.\n- All games against \"White Sox\" (May 9 to 12, 17 to 19) have attendance greater than 5000.\n\nThis results in a total of **8 games** with an attendance greater than 5000 involving these potential opponents, which could be the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE based on historical context and the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify games involving teams potentially representing the Toronto Blue Jays (rangers, royals, white sox).

Thus, the games on May 28 do not form part of three consecutive losses since there was a day gap (May 27).\n\n5. **Determine if Team Matches:**\n   - The table does not explicitly mention \"Toronto Blue Jays.\" However, given historical context, these matches could be assumed to involve them due to the reference to teams like \"angels\" and \"athletics,\" which were part of Major League Baseball during that time.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are two consecutive losses on May 25 and May 26.\n   - The loss on May 28 is not consecutive with the previous two because of the gap on May 27.\n   - Therefore, there were not three consecutive losses between May 25 and May 28.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows that the team lost games on May 25, May 26, and May 28 against different opponents.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the Toronto Blue Jays' attendance figures for May 1991 is true or false, we will analyze the provided table step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that the Toronto Blue Jays played in 8 games with an attendance lower than 5,000 during May of the 1991 season.\n\n2. **Examine the Table Data:**\n   - We need to focus on the \"attendance\" column in the table provided.\n   - Each row represents a game played by the team and provides details including the date, opponent, score, loss pitcher with their record, attendance, and the team's record after that game.\n\n3. **Identify Games Played:**\n   - The table shows 31 games played from May 1 to May 31.\n   \n4. **Check Attendance Figures:**\n   - We need to check each entry in the \"attendance\" column to see how many of them have figures lower than 5,000.\n\n5. **Count Relevant Games:**\n   - As we look through each game's attendance:\n     - No entries in the table have an attendance figure lower than 5,000.\n     - The smallest recorded attendance is 20,809 (on May 3).\n\n6. **Compare with Claim Requirement:**\n   - The claim specifies that there should be 8 games with an attendance of fewer than 5,000.\n   - Since all attendances listed are significantly higher than 5,000, this condition is not met.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the games in May had an attendance lower than 5,000.
