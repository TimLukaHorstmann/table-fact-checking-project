    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the point score in the Indiana Pacers' 41st season is true, we need to analyze the scores of all games played by the Pacers as listed in the table. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Pacers Games**: First, identify which rows correspond to games where the Pacers were involved. In this table, these are the entries where \"home\" or \"visitor\" is \"pacers.\"\n\n2. **Extract Scores**: For each of these identified rows, extract both scores from the \"score\" column. The format is \"Pacers Score - Opponent Score,\" so we'll need to consider both parts.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum and Minimum Scores**:\n   - Find the highest score achieved by the Pacers in any game.\n   - Find the lowest score received by the Pacers in any game.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: Check if these maximum and minimum scores fall within the range specified by the claim (no greater than 129 and no less than 72).\n\nLet's go through each step with relevant data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Pacers Games**:\n   - Rows where \"home\" or \"visitor\" is \"pacers\": \n     - Row 2: Visitor\n     - Row 3: Home\n     - Row 4: Home\n     - Row 5: Home\n     - Row 6: Home\n     - Row 7: Home\n     - Row 8: Visitor\n     - Row 10: Home\n     - Row 11: Home\n     - Row 12: Home\n     - Row 13: Home\n     - Row 14: Visitor\n\n2. **Extract Scores**:\n   - Row 2: Pacers Score = 72, Opponent Score = 91\n   - Row 3: Pacers Score = 96, Opponent Score = 112\n   - Row 4: Pacers Score = 89, Opponent Score = 111\n   - Row 5: Pacers Score = 122, Opponent Score = 129\n   - Row 6: Pacers Score = 111, Opponent Score = 105\n   - Row 7: Pacers Score = 101, Opponent Score = 106\n   - Row 8: Pacers Score = 125, Opponent Score = 117\n   - Row 10: Pacers Score = 110, Opponent Score = 103\n   - Row 11: Pacers Score = 110, Opponent Score = 108\n   - Row 12: Pacers Score = 92, Opponent Score = 104\n   - Row 13: Pacers Score = 96, Opponent Score = 98\n   - Row 14: Pacers Score = 104, Opponent Score = 110\n\n3. **Determine Maximum and Minimum Scores**:\n   - Highest score by Pacers: 122 (from Row 5)\n   - Lowest score against Pacers: 72 (from Row 2)\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The highest score achieved by the Pacers is 122, which is less than or equal to 129.\n   - The lowest score received by the Pacers is 72, which is greater than or equal to 72.\n\nThe claim states that the point score in the Indiana Pacers' 41st season should be no greater than 129 and no less than 72. Both conditions are satisfied based on our analysis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Chain of Thought**: We identified all games involving the Pacers, extracted their scores, determined the maximum and minimum scores, and verified that these scores fall within the specified range.\n- **Answer**: TRUE\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - Row 2: {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 3: {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 4: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 5: {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 6: {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 7: {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 8: {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 10: {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 11: {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 12: {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 13: {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  - Row 14: {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified all games involving the Pacers, extracted scores, determined maximum and minimum scores, verified they fall within specified range.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
