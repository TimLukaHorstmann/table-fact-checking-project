We are interested in identifying games that went into overtime.\n\n2. **Identify Overtime Games:**\n   - Examine the \"result\" column to find any mention of overtime (denoted as \"ot\").\n   - According to standard sports terminology, if a game result includes \"(ot)\", it indicates an overtime situation.\n\n3. **Count Overtime Games:**\n   - Scan through each row in the table and count how many times \"(ot)\" appears in the \"result\" column.\n   \n4. **Relevant Row Identification:**\n   - Identify which specific rows (weeks) contain games that went into overtime.\n\n5. **Cross-Verify with Claim:**\n   - Check if the number of overtime games matches the claim's assertion of two instances in 1975.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- **Scan for Overtime Games:**\n  - Week 11 (Row 11): Result is \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\", indicating an overtime game.\n  \n- **Count Overtime Instances:**\n  - Only one instance of \"(ot)\" is found in the entire table.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim states there were two overtime games, but the table shows only one overtime game occurred.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells Identification:**\n   - Row 11, Column \"result\" contains the relevant information about the overtime game.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The task is to verify if there were two overtime games in 1975 for the Denver Broncos.\",\n    \"Overtime games are identified by '(ot)' in the 'result' column of the table.\",\n    \"Scan through each row and count occurrences of '(ot)'.\",\n    \"Only one occurrence of '(ot)' was found, specifically in Row 11.\",\n    \"The claim states there were two overtime games, but only one is recorded.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
