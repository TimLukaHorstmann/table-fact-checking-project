    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the argonaut give up 44 point only 1 time in the season\" is true or false, let's analyze the relevant data from the table step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**: \n   - We need to check the 'final score' column to find out how many points were given up by the Argonauts in each game.\n\n2. **Extract Information**:\n   - Look for games where the Argonauts lost (indicated by \"l\" in the 'final score') and identify the number of points they gave up.\n   \n3. **Analyze Each Row**:\n   - **Week 1, Date: August 19**: Final Score is \"l 44 - 7\". The Argonauts gave up 44 points.\n   - **Week 2, Date: September 1**: Final Score is \"l 31 - 24\". The Argonauts gave up 31 points.\n   - **Week 3, Date: September 5**: Final Score is \"l 26 - 17\". The Argonauts gave up 26 points.\n   - **Week 4, Date: September 13**: Final Score is \"l 24 - 21\". The Argonauts gave up 24 points.\n   - **Week 5, Date: September 20**: Final Score is \"l 17 - 14\". The Argonauts gave up 17 points.\n   - **Week 6, Date: September 27**: Final Score is \"l 28 - 4\". The Argonauts gave up 28 points.\n   - **Week 7, Date: October 4**: Final Score is \"l 14 - 10\". The Argonauts gave up 14 points.\n   - **Week 8, Date: October 11**: Final Score is \"l 28 - 15\". The Argonauts gave up 28 points.\n   - **Week 9, Date: October 18**: This was a win (indicated by \"w\"), so no points were given up in terms of losing the game.\n   - **Week 10, Date: October 25**: This was a win, so no points were given up in terms of losing the game.\n   - **Week 11, Date: November 1**: Final Score is \"l 44 - 7\". The Argonauts gave up 44 points.\n\n4. **Count Occurrences**:\n   - The Argonauts gave up 44 points twice: once on August 19 and again on November 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Argonauts gave up 44 points two times, not just one time, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\n- Row 1, Column 'final score': \"l 44 - 7\"\n- Row 11, Column 'final score': \"l 44 - 7\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The final score column was analyzed for losses.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the Argonauts win 7 games in a row during 1 stretch\" is true or false, we need to analyze the game records of the Argonauts from the provided table. Here's how we can systematically evaluate the claim:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Table Structure**: \n   - The table lists game results for each week with columns indicating `week`, `date`, `opponent`, `location`, `final score`, `attendance`, and `record`.\n   - The `record` column gives us wins (W), losses (L), or ties (T) in the form of \"Wins-Losses-Ties\".\n\n2. **Identify Winning Games**:\n   - A win is indicated by a 'w' in the `final score` column.\n\n3. **Check for Streaks of Wins**:\n   - We need to find any sequence of 7 consecutive wins (W) within the record.\n\n4. **Extract and Analyze Records**:\n   - Week 1: Loss (L), Win (W)\n   - Week 2: Loss (L), Loss (L)\n   - Week 3: Loss (L), Loss (L)\n   - Week 4: Loss (L)\n   - Week 5: Loss (L)\n   - Week 6: Loss (L)\n   - Week 7: Loss (L)\n   - Week 8: Loss (L), Win (W)\n   - Week 9: Win (W)\n   - Week 10: Win (W)\n   - Week 11: Loss (L)\n\n5. **Count Consecutive Wins**:\n   - The longest streak of consecutive wins is between Weeks 8 and 10, with only two wins in a row.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is no stretch of 7 consecutive wins in the record.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim that \"the Argonauts win 7 games in a row during one stretch\" is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was analyzed to identify streaks of consecutive wins.
