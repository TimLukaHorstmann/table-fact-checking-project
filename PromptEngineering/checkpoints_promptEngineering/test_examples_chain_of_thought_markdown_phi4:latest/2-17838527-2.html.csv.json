    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to verify each part of the statement against the data provided in the table.\n\n### Claim Breakdown:\n1. **\"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medal\":**\n   - We look at the row where `rank` is 1.\n   - The `total` column for this row shows the number of medals, which is 22.\n\n2. **\"total gold medal be 13\":**\n   - Again, we refer to the row where `rank` is 1.\n   - The `gold` column for this row indicates the number of gold medals, which is 13.\n\n### Verification Steps:\n- **Step 1:** Identify the row with `rank = 1`.\n  - This corresponds to the first row in the table.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Check if the total medals are more than 21.\n  - In the first row (`rank` = 1), the `total` column is 22, which is indeed more than 21.\n\n- **Step 3:** Verify the number of gold medals.\n  - In the same row, the `gold` column shows 13, matching the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth conditions specified in the claim are satisfied by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For \"total more than 21\": Row 1, Column \"total\"\n- For \"total gold medal be 13\": Row 1, Column \"gold\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row with rank = 1.\",\n    \"Check if the total medals in this row are more than 21.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"rank 3 have 6 total medal\" is true or false, we need to examine the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim refers to \"rank 3.\" In the table, rank 3 corresponds to the third row (since rows are numbered starting from 1).\n\n2. **Locate the Total Medals for Rank 3:**\n   - Within the third row, we need to look at the column labeled \"total\" to find the total number of medals for rank 3.\n\n3. **Extract the Data:**\n   - According to the table:\n     ```\n     |   rank |   gold |   silver |   bronze |   total |\n     |-------:|-------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|\n     |      3 |      1 |        3 |       12 |      16 |\n     ```\n   - The \"total\" column for rank 3 shows the value 16.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals.\n   - From the table, we see that rank 3 actually has a total of 16 medals.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 16 does not equal 6, the claim is false.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim refers to 'rank 3' having '6 total medal'.
