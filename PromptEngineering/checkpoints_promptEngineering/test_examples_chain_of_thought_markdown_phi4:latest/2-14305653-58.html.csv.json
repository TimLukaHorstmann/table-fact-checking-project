The Yugoslavian national team failed to score only one time.\n2. They dropped a World Cup qualifying match against Denmark with a score of 2:1.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Each Part of the Claim\n\n#### Part 1: Failed to Score Only Once\n\n- We need to identify all matches where the results show that Yugoslavia did not score any goals (i.e., their score is 0).\n\n**Table Analysis for Goals Scored by Yugoslavia:**\n- March 22, Sarajevo vs. Uruguay: 2:1\n- March 30, Belgrade vs. Romania: 2:0\n- April 26, Borovo vs. Poland: 2:1\n- August 27, Bucharest, Romania vs. Romania: 1:4 (Yugoslavia scored 1 goal)\n- September 10, Luxembourg vs. Luxembourg: 5:0\n- September 27, Ljubljana vs. Denmark: 2:1\n- November 15, Torino, Italy vs. Italy: 0:2\n\nFrom the table, we see that Yugoslavia failed to score only in the match on November 15 against Italy (score 0:2).\n\n#### Part 2: World Cup Qualifying Match Against Denmark\n\n- We need to check if there was a World Cup qualifying match against Denmark and verify the result.\n\n**Table Analysis for Matches Against Denmark:**\n- September 27, Ljubljana vs. Denmark: 2:1 (Type of game: 1982 WCQ)\n\nThe table shows that Yugoslavia played against Denmark in a World Cup qualifying match on September 27 and won with a score of 2:1.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n- The first part of the claim is true because Yugoslavia failed to score only once, which was against Italy.\n- The second part of the claim is false because they did not drop the World Cup qualifying match against Denmark; they won it 2:1.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim has two parts.

Compare these totals with our calculations to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - From the table, locate rows where \"type of game\" is \"1982 wcq\":\n     - Row 5: September 10, Luxembourg, results 5:0\n     - Row 6: September 27, Ljubljana, results 2:1\n     - Row 7: November 15, Torino, Italy, results 0:2\n\n   Since the claim mentions \"the 2 1982 world cup qualify score,\" we consider only the first two matches:\n   - Relevant rows are 5 and 6.\n\n2. **Extract Goals Scored and Allowed:**\n   - Row 5 (September 10): Results 5:0\n     - Goals scored by Yugoslavia = 5\n     - Goals allowed to opponent = 0\n   - Row 6 (September 27): Results 2:1\n     - Goals scored by Yugoslavia = 2\n     - Goals allowed to opponent = 1\n\n3. **Summarize Total Goals:**\n   - Total goals scored by Yugoslavia = 5 + 2 = 7\n   - Total goals allowed by Yugoslavia = 0 + 1 = 1\n\n4. **Verify Against Claim:**\n   - The claim states Yugoslavia scored 7 goals and allowed 3.\n   - Our calculation shows they scored 7 goals, but only allowed 1 goal.\n\nThus, the claim is false because the number of goals allowed does not match (1 instead of 3).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant games from rows with '1982 wcq'.
