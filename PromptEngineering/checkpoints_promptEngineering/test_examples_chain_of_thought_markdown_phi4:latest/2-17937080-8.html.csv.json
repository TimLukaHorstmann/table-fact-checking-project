Since `1.000 < 1.237`, the condition of having less than 1.237 goals per match is satisfied.\n\n- **Step 4: Determine Truthfulness**  \n  The claim that \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match\" is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row for rank 11 in the table and extract the 'goals per match' value, which is 1.000.
