For example, a record of 27-6 indicates 27 wins and 6 losses.\n   \n2. **Identify Total Losses by End of Season:**\n   - Check the final entry in the table for the season's record to determine the total number of losses.\n   - The last game listed is Game 46 with a record of 37-9.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Losses:**\n   - According to the final record (37-9), the team had 9 losses by the end of the season.\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Number of Losses:**\n   - The claim states that the Boston Celtics only lost 3 games in the 1984-85 season.\n   - Our analysis shows they actually lost 9 games, which contradicts the claim.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the team lost more than 3 games (specifically 9), the claim is false.\n\n**Relevant Cells for Determining Losses:**\n\n- The record column in each row provides cumulative wins and losses.

If the Knicks are the opponent, they would be listed as the away team.\n\n4. **Review Specific Games**:\n   - **Game 34**: Opponent is \"new york knicks\", score is \"105 - 94\".
