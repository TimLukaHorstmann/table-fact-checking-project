    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is true, let's analyze the table step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: We need to check two specific pieces of information from the table: \n   - The column for \"home team\" to verify if Carlton is listed.\n   - The column for \"venue\" to see if Prince Park is associated with Carlton.\n\n2. **Locate Carlton in the Table**:\n   - Scan the \"home team\" column to find where Carlton appears.\n   - Carlton is listed as the home team in row 3.\n\n3. **Check Venue for Carlton's Match**:\n   - In row 3, check the \"venue\" column corresponding to Carlton being the home team.\n   - The venue listed for this match is \"princes park.\"\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states \"prince park be home to the carlton team.\"\n   - The table shows \"princes park\" as the venue where Carlton played at home, which matches the claim when considering case insensitivity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is accurate based on the information in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 3, Column \"home team\" (Carlton)\n- Row 3, Column \"venue\" (princes park)\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the columns 'home team' and 'venue'. Locate Carlton in the 'home team' column at row 3. Check the corresponding 'venue' for this row, which is 'princes park'. The claim matches when considering case insensitivity, making it TRUE.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
