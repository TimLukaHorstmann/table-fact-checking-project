    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the smallest crowd be at venue mcg\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data focusing on the 'venue' and 'crowd' columns.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Venue \"mcg\":**\n   - From the table, locate the row where the 'venue' column has the value \"mcg\".\n   - The relevant row is:\n     ```\n     | melbourne       | 10.18 (78)        | essendon    | 13.9 (87)         | mcg                   |   31455 | 29 july 1961 |\n     ```\n\n2. **Determine the Crowd Size for \"mcg\":**\n   - In this row, the 'crowd' column shows a crowd size of 31,455.\n\n3. **Compare with Other Venues:**\n   - Now, compare this crowd size (31,455) with the crowd sizes of all other venues in the table.\n   - List of crowds for comparison:\n     - Kardinia Park: 25,723\n     - Brunswick Street Oval: 23,012\n     - Lake Oval: 14,350\n     - Arden Street Oval: 15,000\n     - Western Oval: 21,639\n\n4. **Determine the Smallest Crowd Size:**\n   - The smallest crowd size from the list above is 14,350 at Lake Oval.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 31,455 (crowd size for \"mcg\") is not the smallest number, the claim that \"the smallest crowd be at venue mcg\" is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row with 'venue' as \"mcg\": \n  - Row index: 3\n  - Column name: \"venue\", value: \"mcg\"\n  - Column name: \"crowd\", value: 31455\n\n- Other rows for comparison:\n  - Row index: 0, \"venue\": \"kardinia park\", \"crowd\": 25723\n  - Row index: 1, \"venue\": \"brunswick street oval\", \"crowd\": 23012\n  - Row index: 2, \"venue\": \"lake oval\", \"crowd\": 14350\n  - Row index: 4, \"venue\": \"arden street oval\", \"crowd\": 15000\n  - Row index: 5, \"venue\": \"western oval\", \"crowd\": 21639\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row where the venue is 'mcg' and note its crowd size (31,455).

The specific steps for analysis are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Column**: \n   - We need to look at the \"home team\" column since it contains information about which team was playing at home.\n\n2. **Examine Each Entry in the 'Home Team' Column**:\n   - Check each row of the table to see if \"geelong\" appears in the \"home team\" column.\n   - The rows and relevant cells are as follows:\n     - Row 1: \"geelong\"\n     - Row 2: \"fitzroy\"\n     - Row 3: \"south melbourne\"\n     - Row 4: \"melbourne\"\n     - Row 5: \"north melbourne\"\n     - Row 6: \"footscray\"\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences**:\n   - From the examination, we see that \"geelong\" appears only once in the \"home team\" column (in row 1).\n\n4. **Interpret 'Several Times'**:\n   - The term \"several\" generally implies more than two or three occurrences.\n   - Since \"geelong\" appears only once, it does not meet the criterion of appearing several times.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: \n   - Based on the analysis, the claim that \"geelong be the home team several time\" is FALSE because geelong is listed as the home team only once in the table.\n\nHere's the output with the relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
