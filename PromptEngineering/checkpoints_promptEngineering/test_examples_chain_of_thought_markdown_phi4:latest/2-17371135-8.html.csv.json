This is not a scoreless game for any team.\n\n4. **Check All Other Entries**:\n   - February 2: Score is \"3 - 4\". Neither team was scoreless.\n   - February 4: Score is \"4 - 5\". Neither team was scoreless.\n   - February 7: Score is \"3 - 8\". Neither team was scoreless.\n   - February 8: Detroit vs. Pittsburgh, score is \"3 - 0\".

These are the home games.\n\n2. **Count the Home Games**: Count how many times Detroit appears in the \"home\" column to determine the total number of home games during February 2008 as represented by the table.\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim**: Compare this count against the claim, which states there should be five home games for Detroit.\n\nNow, let's perform these steps using the data provided:\n\n1. **Identify Home Games**:\n   - On \"February 8\", Detroit is listed as the home team.\n   - On \"February 10\", Detroit is listed as the home team.\n   - On \"February 18\", Detroit is listed as the home team.\n   - On \"February 20\", Detroit is listed as the home team.\n   - On \"February 25\", Detroit is listed as the home team.\n\n2. **Count the Home Games**:\n   - By counting, we find that Detroit played 5 home games in February 2008.\n\n3. **Verify Against the Claim**:\n   - The claim states there were 5 home games for Detroit.
