    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Black Ice be first release on iTunes, internationally\" is true or false based on the provided table, we need to analyze the relevant information from the table.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:**\n   - The claim mentions a release on iTunes, so we focus on the row where the `format` column indicates \"digital download.\"\n   - The only row with `format` as \"digital download\" is:\n     - | country           | date             | label      | format                           | catalogue no   |\n       | global ( itunes ) | 19 november 2012 | columbia   | digital download                 | 88697338292    |\n\n2. **Determine the Date of Release on iTunes:**\n   - The release date for this iTunes version is \"19 November 2012.\"\n\n3. **Check for Earlier Releases in Other Formats:**\n   - We need to check if there are any earlier releases before 19 November 2012, as the claim states it should be the first release.\n   - Look at all other rows with earlier dates:\n     - Europe: 17 October 2008\n     - Australia: 18 October 2008\n     - United Kingdom: 20 October 2008\n     - Japan: 22 October 2008\n     - United States: 20 October 2008\n     - Germany: 5 December 2008\n\n4. **Analyze Earlier Releases:**\n   - All the earlier releases (from October to December 2008) are in physical formats such as CD and double LP.\n   - The iTunes release is specifically a digital download, which is different from these physical formats.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Black Ice be first release on iTunes, internationally.\"\n   - Since there are no earlier releases listed under \"digital download\" before 19 November 2012, this iTunes release is indeed the first digital (iTunes) release.\n   - The claim does not specify it being the first overall release but specifically mentions \"on iTunes,\" which we have confirmed.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, the claim that \"Black Ice be first release on iTunes, internationally\" is true.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows a digital download format under 'global (itunes)' with a date of 19 November 2012. All other releases before this date are physical formats.
