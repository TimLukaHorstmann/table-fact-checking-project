    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the New Jersey Devils playing more away games than home games in the 2007-08 season is true or false, we need to analyze the provided table by focusing on the \"visitor\" and \"home\" columns.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Context:**\n   - A \"visitor\" game means New Jersey played away.\n   - A \"home\" game means New Jersey was the home team.\n\n2. **Count Home Games:**\n   - Look at the \"home\" column for entries with \"new jersey\".
