We will then compare these totals to see if the 5th game has the highest total of 20 runs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:**\n   - The relevant column for checking scores is \"score,\" which contains information on how many runs each team scored in a game.\n\n2. **Extract and Calculate Runs for Each Game:**\n   - **Game 1:** Score is \"philadelphia athletics - 3 , chicago cubs - 1\"\n     - Total runs = 3 (Athletics) + 1 (Cubs) = 4\n   - **Game 2:** Score is \"philadelphia athletics - 9 , chicago cubs - 3\"\n     - Total runs = 9 (Athletics) + 3 (Cubs) = 12\n   - **Game 3:** Score is \"chicago cubs - 3 , philadelphia athletics - 1\"\n     - Total runs = 3 (Cubs) + 1 (Athletics) = 4\n   - **Game 4:** Score is \"chicago cubs - 8 , philadelphia athletics - 10\"\n     - Total runs = 8 (Cubs) + 10 (Athletics) = 18\n   - **Game 5:** Score is \"chicago cubs - 2 , philadelphia athletics - 3\"\n     - Total runs = 2 (Cubs) + 3 (Athletics) = 5\n\n3. **Compare Total Runs:**\n   - Game 1: 4 total runs\n   - Game 2: 12 total runs\n   - Game 3: 4 total runs\n   - Game 4: 18 total runs\n   - Game 5: 5 total runs\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"the 5th game of the series be the highest scoring with 20 run total.\"\n   - From our calculations, the 5th game has a total of 5 runs.\n   - Therefore, it is not true that the 5th game is the highest scoring game, nor does it have 20 runs.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is FALSE because none of the games had a total score of 20 runs, and specifically, the 5th game did not have the highest score.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Shibe Park has the same attendance as Wrigley Field\" is true or false, we need to examine the relevant data from the table regarding attendance at each location.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:**\n   - We need to focus on the 'location' and 'attendance' columns of the table because these will provide us with information about where each game was played and how many people attended those games.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance for Wrigley Field:**\n   - Look at rows 1 and 2 where the location is \"wrigley field.\"\n     - Row 1: Attendance = 50,740\n     - Row 2: Attendance = 49,987\n\n3. **Extract Attendance for Shibe Park:**\n   - Look at rows 3, 4, and 5 where the location is \"shibe park.\"\n     - Row 3: Attendance = 29,921\n     - Row 4: Attendance = 29,921\n     - Row 5: Attendance = 29,921\n\n4. **Compare Attendances:**\n   - Compare the attendance figures for both locations:\n     - Wrigley Field has two different attendances (50,740 and 49,987).\n     - Shibe Park consistently shows an attendance of 29,921.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the attendance figures for Shibe Park are all 29,921 and differ from those at Wrigley Field (which are both above 29,921), we can conclude that Shibe Park does not have the same attendance as Wrigley Field.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim \"Shibe Park has the same attendance as Wrigley Field\" is FALSE.
