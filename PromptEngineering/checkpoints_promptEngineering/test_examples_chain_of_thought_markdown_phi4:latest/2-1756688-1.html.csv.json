We need to calculate the total points (goals + behinds) for these years.\n\n2. **Extract Data for Points Calculation**:\n   - For each year, add the values from the \"goals\" column and the \"behinds\" column.\n   \n3. **Calculate Total Points for Each Year**:\n   - **2005**: Goals = 8, Behinds = 2\n     - Total points = 8 + 2 = 10\n   - **2006**: Goals = 4, Behinds = 3\n     - Total points = 4 + 3 = 7\n   - **2007**: Goals = 34, Behinds = 18\n     - Total points = 34 + 18 = 52\n\n4. **Compare Points Across Years**:\n   - 2005: 10 points\n   - 2006: 7 points\n   - 2007: 52 points\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that his best year for points was in 2008.\n   - However, there is no data provided for 2008 (all values are \"-\").\n   - Therefore, we cannot assess 2008 as it has no recorded statistics.\n\n6. **Determine the Best Year Based on Available Data**:\n   - Among the available years (2005, 2006, and 2007), 2007 had the highest points total of 52.\n   - Since there is no data for 2008, we cannot claim it was his best year.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that Nathan Ablett's best year for points with Geelong was in 2008 is false because there is no data available for 2008, and among the years he played (2005, 2006, 2007), 2007 had the highest point total.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine Nathan Ablett's best year for points with Geelong, we calculated the total points (goals + behinds) for each season he played (2005, 2006, and 2007).
