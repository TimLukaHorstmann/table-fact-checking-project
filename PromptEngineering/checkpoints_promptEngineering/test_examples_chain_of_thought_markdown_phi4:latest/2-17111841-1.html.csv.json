This requires looking at the \"original airdate\" column.\n   \n2. **Locate June 8, 2008 Date:**\n   - From the table, identify which episode has \"1 june 2008\", \"8 june 2008\", etc., as its original airdate.\n\n3. **Check for June 8, 2008:**\n   - Find the row where the \"original airdate\" is exactly \"8 june 2008\". \n\n4. **Verify Episode Number:**\n   - Check the episode number in that row to see if it corresponds with episode 4.\n\n5. **Ensure No Earlier Episodes for June 8, 2008:**\n   - Ensure there are no episodes with an earlier episode number than 4 that also aired on \"8 june 2008\".\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- **Row 3:** Episode 1, Date: 18 may 2008\n- **Row 4:** Episode 2, Date: 25 may 2008\n- **Row 5:** Episode 3, Date: 1 june 2008\n- **Row 6:** Episode 4, Date: 8 june 2008\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The table shows that episode 4 is indeed the one that aired on June 8, 2008.\n- There are no earlier episodes (with lower episode numbers) listed as airing on June 8, 2008.\n\nThus, the claim \"episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally air on june 8, 2008\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row with 'original airdate' of '8 june 2008'.
