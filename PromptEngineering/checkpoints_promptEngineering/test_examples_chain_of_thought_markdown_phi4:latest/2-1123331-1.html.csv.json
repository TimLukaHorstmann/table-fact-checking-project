    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine whether Damon Hill's grid number (associated with a hydraulics issue) is greater than 1.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Damon Hill's Row:**\n   - Look for \"damon hill\" in the driver column.\n   - From the table:\n     - Driver: damon hill\n     - Constructor: jordan - mugen - honda\n     - Laps: 19\n     - Time/Retired: hydraulics\n     - Grid: 7\n\n2. **Determine the Cause of Retirement for Damon Hill:**\n   - The \"time / retired\" column indicates \"hydraulics\" as the cause of retirement.\n\n3. **Check Damon Hill's Grid Number:**\n   - From the identified row, the grid number is 7.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that hydraulics have a grid number bigger than 1.\n   - Since Damon Hill retired due to hydraulics and his grid number is 7, which is greater than 1, this supports the truth of the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Damon Hill's retirement was due to hydraulics, and his starting grid position (grid number) is indeed greater than 1.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified Damon Hill's row in the table. Noted that he retired due to 'hydraulics' with a grid number of 7. Since 7 is greater than 1, the claim is true.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
