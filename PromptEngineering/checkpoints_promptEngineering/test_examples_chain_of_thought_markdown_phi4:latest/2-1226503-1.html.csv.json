    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Mauro Baldi driving a Cosworth V8 and not scoring any points is TRUE or FALSE, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement specifies that whenever Mauro Baldi drove with a Cosworth V8 engine, he did not score any points.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Information**:\n   - We need to find instances in the table where \"Mauro Baldi\" is mentioned as an entrant.\n   - We must check if these instances involve a \"cosworth v8\" engine.\n   - Finally, we verify whether he scored 0 points in those instances.\n\n3. **Examine the Table**:\n   - Go through each row to find any mention of Mauro Baldi as an entrant.\n\n4. **Check for Cosworth V8 Engine**:\n   - If a row lists Mauro Baldi and the engine is \"cosworth v8\", note the points scored in that entry.\n\n5. **Verify Points Scored**:\n   - Confirm whether the points are 0 whenever he drove with a Cosworth V8.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - If all instances where Mauro Baldi drove with a Cosworth V8 result in 0 points, the claim is TRUE.\n   - If there's any instance where he scored more than 0 points with a Cosworth V8, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Analysis of the Table:**\n\n- **Row 1**: Entrant = arrows racing team, Engine = cosworth v8, Points = 2\n- **Row 2**: Entrant = arrows racing team, Engine = cosworth v8, Points = 2\n\nIn neither row does \"Mauro Baldi\" appear as an entrant. Therefore, there are no instances where Mauro Baldi drove a Cosworth V8 in this table.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince there is no data about Mauro Baldi driving a Cosworth V8 in the provided table, we cannot find any instance to contradict the claim that he didn't score points with such an engine. Thus, based on the available information, the claim holds true as there are no counterexamples.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for instances where Mauro Baldi is listed as an entrant and uses a Cosworth V8 engine.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mauro Baldi never scored 0 point\" is true or false based on the given table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information:**\n   - We are interested in finding entries related to Mauro Baldi and checking if any of them have a points value of 0.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Driver Information:**\n   - The table does not directly list drivers, only teams, chassis, engines, and points.\n   - Therefore, we need external knowledge about which driver(s) were associated with each team during the specified years to determine if Mauro Baldi was involved in any of these entries.\n\n3. **Research Historical Context:**\n   - From historical data on Formula 1:\n     - In 1984, Mauro Baldi drove for Spirit Racing.\n     - This matches the entry from 1984 in the table with Spirit Racing and the chassis \"spirit 101\" scoring 0 points.\n\n4. **Check Points Scored by Mauro Baldi:**\n   - The row corresponding to the year 1984 shows that Spirit Racing scored 0 points.\n   - Since Mauro Baldi was part of Spirit Racing in 1984, he indeed scored 0 points in that season.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on this information, the claim \"Mauro Baldi never scored 0 point\" is false because there is evidence from the table (with external knowledge) that he did score 0 points in 1984.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
