This matches the venue mentioned in the claim.\n   - **Row 4**: The venue is \"princes park\".\n   - **Row 5**: The venue is \"junction oval\".\n   - **Row 6**: The venue is \"punt road oval\".\n\n3. **Verify Date Consistency**: Ensure that all these matches occurred on the same date, which is \"5 august 1961\". This is consistent across all rows.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since \"Victoria Park\" appears as a venue in row 3 and all games were played on 5 August 1961, it confirms that Victoria Park was indeed one of the venues used on that date.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's compile the relevant cells for the JSON output:\n\n- **Row Index**: 3\n- **Column Name**: \"venue\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The 'venue' column in the table lists the venues used for matches on 5 August 1961.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about crowd sizes at two different venues on a specific date is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Venues**: The claim involves two venues: \"windy hill\" and \"glenferrie oval\".\n\n2. **Find Relevant Rows**:\n   - Locate the row for the game played at \"windy hill\". According to the table, this is the second row.\n   - Locate the row for the game played at \"glenferrie oval\". This is found in the first row.\n\n3. **Extract Crowd Sizes**:\n   - For the \"windy hill\" venue: The crowd size is 27,500 (from the second row).\n   - For the \"glenferrie oval\" venue: The crowd size is 14,000 (from the first row).\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference**:\n   - Subtract the crowd size at \"glenferrie oval\" from that at \"windy hill\": \n     \\[\n     27,500 - 14,000 = 13,500\n     \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Claim**: The claim states there were 13,500 more participants at \"windy hill\" than at \"glenferrie oval\".
