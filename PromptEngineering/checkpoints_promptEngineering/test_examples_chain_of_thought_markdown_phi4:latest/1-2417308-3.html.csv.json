    "resp": "To determine the truth value of the claim, let's analyze each row in the table to identify the successors and their respective dates of formal installation between 1855 and 1857.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Time Frame:**\n   - The claim specifies a time frame from 1855 to 1857. We need to focus on entries within this period.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row for Successor Installations:**\n\n   - **Row 1 (New Hampshire, Class 2):**\n     - Successor: John Parker Hale\n     - Installation Date: July 30, 1855\n     - This falls within the specified time frame.\n   \n   - **Row 2 (Alabama, Class 3):**\n     - Successor: Benjamin Fitzpatrick\n     - Installation Date: November 26, 1855\n     - This also falls within the specified time frame.\n\n   - **Row 3 (Pennsylvania, Class 3):**\n     - Successor: William Bigler\n     - Installation Date: January 14, 1856\n     - This date is within the specified period.\n   \n   - **Row 4 (California, Class 3):**\n     - Successor: William M. Gwin\n     - Installation Date: January 13, 1857\n     - This date falls within the given range.\n\n   - **Row 5 (Indiana, Class 3):**\n     - Successor: Graham N. Fitch\n     - Installation Date: February 4, 1857\n     - This installation is within the specified time frame as well.\n\n3. **Count Total Number of Successors Installed Between 1855 and 1857:**\n\n   - From our analysis:\n     - John Parker Hale (July 30, 1855)\n     - Benjamin Fitzpatrick (November 26, 1855)\n     - William Bigler (January 14, 1856)\n     - William M. Gwin (January 13, 1857)\n     - Graham N. Fitch (February 4, 1857)\n\n   - Total number of successors: 5\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are \"2 successor in congress between 1855 and 1857.\"\n   - We identified 5 successors during this period.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe claim is FALSE because there are more than 2 successors installed within the specified time frame.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant entries based on installation dates from 1855 to 1857.\",\n    \"Check each row for successor installations and their dates.\",\n    \"Count the number of successors who were formally installed during this period.\",\n    \"Compare the count against the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"successor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of successors formal installation\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
