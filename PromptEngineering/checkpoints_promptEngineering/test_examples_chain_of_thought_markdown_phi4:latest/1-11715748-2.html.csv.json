This corresponds to series numbers 36 through 42, based on how seasons and episodes are structured in the table.\n\n3. **Check Directors for Each Episode in Season 13**:\n   - Series 36: Director is David Calloway\n   - Series 37: Director is Ken Wiederhorn\n   - Series 38: Director is Ken Wiederhorn\n   - Series 39: Director is Gilbert Adler\n   - Series 40: Director is Keith Samples\n   - Series 41: Director is Jonathan Glassner\n   - Series 42: Director is Richard T.
