    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to understand what the claim is stating about the table. The claim lists three major events: \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final,\" \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament,\" and \"usa 1999 fifa women's world cup.\" We need to verify whether these events are indeed represented as separate sections in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Sections in the Table:**\n   - The table is structured into sections, each representing a different event.\n   - Each section starts with a header row that repeats the event name across all columns for a specific match (e.g., \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final\").\n\n2. **Check for the First Event:**\n   - Look for the row where \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final\" appears as the match name in column `match`.\n   - This event spans rows 1 to 6.\n\n3. **Check for the Second Event:**\n   - Look for the row where \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament\" appears as the match name in column `match`.\n   - This event spans rows 7 to 11.\n\n4. **Check for the Third Event:**\n   - Look for the row where \"usa 1999 fifa women's world cup\" appears as the match name in column `match`.\n   - This event spans rows 12 and 13.\n\n5. **Verify Separation of Events:**\n   - Each event is separated by a distinct header row that repeats the event name across all columns.\n   - The table does not mix data from different events within the same section.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim accurately reflects the structure of the table, as it lists three separate and correctly identified sections corresponding to major women's football tournaments/events.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Header row for \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final\" (row 1):\n  - `match`: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n  - `date`: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n  - `location`: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n  - `lineup`: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n  - `result`: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n  - `competition`: \"sweden 1995 fifa women 's world cup final\"\n\n- Header row for \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament\" (row 7):\n  - `match`: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\"\n  - `date`: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\"\n  - `location`: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\"\n  - `lineup`: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\"\n  - `result`: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\"\n  - `competition`: \"atlanta 1996 olympic women 's football tournament\"\n\n- Header row for \"usa 1999 fifa women's world cup\" (row 12):\n  - `match`: \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\"\n  - `date`: \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\"\n  - `location`: \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\"\n  - `lineup`: \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\"\n  - `result`: \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\"\n  - `competition`: \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table is divided into sections representing different events.

This seems incorrect as per common formatting for dates; hence it should be checked if the month and day have been mistakenly swapped or miswritten. The actual entry is \"1996 - 08 - 01\", which matches our claim.\n\n2. **Location**: The location in the claim is \"athens, ga\".\n   - In row 11 of the table, the location is listed as \"athens, ga\". This matches the location specified in the claim.\n\n3. **Lineup**: The lineup in the claim is indicated by \"start\".\n   - According to row 11, the lineup is also \"start\", which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Result**: The result mentioned in the claim is \"2 - 1\".\n   - In row 11, the result given is \"2 - 1\". This exactly matches the result specified in the claim.\n\n5. **Competition Type**: The competition type described in the claim is \"gold medal match\".\n   - From row 11 of the table, the competition is indeed listed as a \"gold medal match\", which aligns with what is stated in the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll components of the claim (\"1996 - 08 - 01 athens , ga start 2 - 1 gold medal match\") are verified against the corresponding row (11) in the table, and they all match correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if the date '1996 - 08 - 01' matches with any entry.
