No other country surpasses this number except for Germany.\n   \n4. **Conclusion on Second Most Medals:**\n   - Since Canada, the United States, and Russia all have the same number of medals (2), they share the position for second most medals won.\n\n5. **Analyze the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that \"Germany win the second most medal in the 2008 FIBT world championship.\"\n   - Based on our analysis, Germany actually has the most medals, not the second most.\n   \n6. **Final Judgment:**\n   - Therefore, the statement is false because Germany won the most, not the second most.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells for determining this are:\n  - Germany's total medal count (row index 1, column \"total\")\n  - Canada's total medal count (row index 2, column \"total\")\n  - United States' total medal count (row index 3, column \"total\")\n  - Russia's total medal count (row index 4, column \"total\")\n  - United Kingdom's total medal count (row index 5, column \"total\")\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows the total medals won by each nation.
