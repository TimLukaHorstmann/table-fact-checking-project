    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"joe germanese be the 27th pick\" is true or false, let's follow a step-by-step reasoning process based on the provided table:\n\n1. **Identify the Column for Picks:**\n   - The column labeled \"pick\" contains numerical values indicating the order in which players are picked.\n\n2. **Locate Joe Germanese in the Table:**\n   - Search through the rows to find the player named \"joe germanese\".\n\n3. **Check the Corresponding Pick Number:**\n   - Once located, note the value in the same row under the \"pick\" column for Joe Germanese.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Found Data:**\n   - Compare the pick number associated with Joe Germanese to the claim that he is the 27th pick.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Examine the table and find the player named \"joe germanese\". This player appears in row 13.\n  \n- **Step 2:** Look at the value under the \"pick\" column for this row. The value is 27.\n\n- **Step 3:** Compare this pick number with the claim:\n  - The claim states that Joe Germanese is the 27th pick.\n  - From our examination, we see that in row 13, the \"pick\" value is indeed 27, matching the claim.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the steps above, the claim is verified to be true. Joe Germanese is listed as the 27th pick according to the table data.\n\nHere's the final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the column for picks and locate Joe Germanese by scanning through the player names.
