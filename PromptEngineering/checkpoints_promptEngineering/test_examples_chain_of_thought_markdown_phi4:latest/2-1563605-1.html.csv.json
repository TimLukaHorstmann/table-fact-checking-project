However, the claim specifies Adnan Al Talyani's involvement on April 7, 1986.\n   - We need to verify if he played in matches other than April 7, 1986.\n\n7. **Conclusion Based on Table Data**:\n   - Without explicit player data in the table, we rely on the structure of the claim and available data.\n   - The claim states Adnan Al Talyani played only on April 7, 1986, during the Gulf Cup. Since no additional information about players is provided, we assume the claim refers to his participation being noted or significant on that date.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the table's structure and the absence of explicit player data for other dates, the claim seems to be structured around the assumption that Adnan Al Talyani's notable involvement was on April 7, 1986.
