Therefore, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nHere are the relevant cells from the table:\n\n- **Ed Weir's school**: Row index 1 (tackles), Column \"school\", Value \"nebraska\".\n- **Ralph Chase's school**: Row index 1 (tackles), Column \"school\", Value \"pittsburgh\".\n- **Benny Friedman's school**: Row index 4 (quarterback), Column \"school\", Value \"michigan\".\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Verify the schools attended by Ed Weir and Ralph Chase.\",\n    \"Ed Weir is listed as attending Nebraska, not Princeton.\",\n    \"Ralph Chase is listed as attending Pittsburgh, not Princeton.\",\n    \"Both assertions about their attendance at Princeton are false.\",\n    \"Verify the school attended by Benny Friedman.\",\n    \"Benny Friedman is listed as attending Michigan, not Stanford.\",\n    \"The assertion about his attendance at Stanford is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school\", \"value\": \"nebraska\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"school\", \"value\": \"pittsburgh\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"school\", \"value\": \"michigan\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
