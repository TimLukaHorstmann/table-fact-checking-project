    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: The claim states that the oldest fight Librado Andrade won occurred on 2011-08-27.\n\n2. **Understand Table Structure**: The table lists results (\"win\" or \"loss\"), opponents, type of result (e.g., \"ko\", \"tko\"), round and time details, and date of each fight.\n\n3. **Filter Winning Fights**: We need to focus on rows where the \"result\" is \"win\".\n\n4. **Extract Date Information**: For each winning entry, extract the date of the fight.\n\n5. **Compare Dates for Oldest Win**:\n   - The goal is to find the earliest (oldest) date among all wins.\n   - Check if 2011-08-27 is indeed the oldest date or if there are any older dates where Librado Andrade won.\n\n6. **Analyze Winning Fights by Date**:\n\n   - Look at each row with a \"win\" result and note its corresponding date:\n     - 2011-08-27 (Matt O'Brien)\n     - 2010-05-28 (Eric Lucas)\n     - 2009-04-04 (Vitali Tsypko)\n     - 2008-03-22 (Robert Stieglitz)\n     - 2007-10-06 (Yusaf Mack)\n     - 2007-07-21 (Ted Muller)\n     - ... (continue this for all winning entries)\n\n7. **Find the Earliest Date**:\n   - The earliest date among these is 1999-08-14 (Marcus Harvey).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since 2011-08-27 is not the oldest win, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells include all rows with \"win\" in the \"result\" column and their corresponding dates:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the oldest fight Librado Andrade won was on 2011-08-27.\",\n    \"We need to examine each row where the result is 'win' and extract the date of the fight.\",\n    \"By comparing all dates associated with wins, identify the earliest (oldest) win date.\",\n    \"The date 1999-08-14 is found as the oldest win date for Librado Andrade.\",\n    \"Therefore, the claim that the oldest win was on 2011-08-27 is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 36, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 38, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
