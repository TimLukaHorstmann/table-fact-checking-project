    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"week 12 be the average for the result of 28 - 17\" is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The statement suggests that for Week 12, the game's result should have been an average score of \"28 - 17\". This implies comparing the actual score from Week 12 with this hypothetical average.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Row**: Look at the table and find the data corresponding to Week 12.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Week 12**:\n   - The row for Week 12 shows: \n     - Date: 1984-11-18\n     - Opponent: Houston Oilers\n     - Result: L 31 - 20\n     - Game Site: the astrodome\n\n4. **Compare Actual Result with Claimed Average**:\n   - The actual result for Week 12 is \"L 31 - 20\".\n   - The claimed average result is \"28 - 17\".\n\n5. **Analyze the Comparison**:\n   - The claim suggests that the score of \"28 - 17\" should be the outcome or average for Week 12.\n   - However, the actual recorded score was \"L 31 - 20\", which does not match \"28 - 17\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the actual result (31 - 20) is different from the claimed average (28 - 17), the statement is false.\n\n7. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells for this analysis are in row index 12, specifically under the columns \"result\" and any others needed to identify Week 12.\n\nBased on these steps, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim suggests that Week 12 should have had a result of '28 - 17'.
