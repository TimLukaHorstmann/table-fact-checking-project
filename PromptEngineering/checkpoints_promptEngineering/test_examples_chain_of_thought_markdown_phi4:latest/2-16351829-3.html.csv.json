These are tied games.\n\n3. **Check for Crystal Palace as Home Team**:\n   - Within those identified rows with a \"1 - 1\" score, find any row(s) where `Crystal Palace` is the home team.\n\n4. **Determine Lowest Tie Number**:\n   - Among the filtered results from step 3, identify the one with the lowest `tie no`.\n\n5. **Verification Against All Rows**:\n   - Ensure that this identified row indeed has a lower tie number than any other \"1 - 1\" score involving Crystal Palace as home team.\n\n### Examination of Table Data:\n\n- **Rows with 1 - 1 Score**:\n  - Row 3: `Watford` vs. `Wimbledon`\n  - Row 6: `Leicester City` vs. `Manchester City`\n  - Row 12: `Everton` vs. `Stockport County`\n  - Row 14: `Ipswich Town` vs. `Blackburn Rovers`\n  - Row 28: `Arsenal` vs. `Sheffield United`\n  - Row 29: `Hereford United` vs. `Tottenham Hotspur`\n  - Row 30: `Stoke City` vs. `Nottingham Forest`\n  - Row 32: `Birmingham City` vs. `Wolverhampton Wanderers`\n\n- **Crystal Palace as Home Team**:\n  - Row 24: Crystal Palace vs. Port Vale with score \"0 - 0\".\n  - No row shows Crystal Palace as the home team with a \"1 - 1\" score.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the data, there is no instance where `Crystal Palace` was the home team and had a \"1 - 1\" score in any tie. Therefore, the claim cannot be true because the condition of Crystal Palace being the home team with a \"1 - 1\" score is never met.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Checked all rows for '1 - 1' scores and verified if 'Crystal Palace' was listed as the home team.

Here, Walsall scored 1 goal, and Wigan Athletic did not score any goals (0).\n\n4. **Calculate Total Goals**:\n   - Total goals in the match = Home team goals + Away team goals = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that when Wigan Athletic was the away team, four goals were scored in total during the match.\n   - From our examination, only one goal was scored in this particular match involving Wigan Athletic as the away team.\n\nThus, based on the table and the steps above:\n\n- **Conclusion**: The claim is FALSE because only 1 goal was scored in the match when Wigan Athletic played as the away team, not 4 goals.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I located the row where 'wigan athletic' appears as the away team.
