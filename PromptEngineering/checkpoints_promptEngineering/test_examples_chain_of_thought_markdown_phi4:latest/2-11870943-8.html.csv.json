The US Open has an \"sf\" (semifinal) categorization between 2007 and 2009.\n\n2. **Examine the US Open Column**:\n   - We need to look at the \"us open\" column from the years 2007 to 2012 to verify these statements.\n\n3. **Check for \"2r\" Categorization (2010-2012)**:\n   - 2010: The categorization is \"sf\".\n   - 2011: The categorization is \"3r\".\n   - 2012: The categorization is \"sf\".\n   - Conclusion: There is no \"2r\" categorization for the US Open between 2010 and 2012.\n\n4. **Check for \"sf\" Categorization (2007-2009)**:\n   - 2007: The categorization is \"2r\".\n   - 2008: The categorization is \"1r\".\n   - 2009: The categorization is \"2r\".\n   - Conclusion: There is no \"sf\" categorization for the US Open between 2007 and 2009.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation**:\n   - Neither part of the claim is correct based on the data from the table.\n\n6. **Relevant Cells**:\n   - The relevant cells are those in the \"us open\" column for the years 2007 to 2012.\n\nBased on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states two conditions about the US Open categorizations.
