    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about week 4 is true or false, we need to evaluate two conditions stated in the claim:\n\n1. The game in week 4 does not have an attendance of 74,181.\n2. The game in week 4 was played on October 3, 1999.\n\nLet's analyze these claims using the data from the table:\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Week 4 Data:**\n   - Look at the row where \"week\" is equal to 4.\n   - According to the table, week 4 corresponds to:\n     - date: October 3, 1999\n     - opponent: New York Jets\n     - result: l 21 - 13\n     - attendance: 74,181\n\n2. **Evaluate Condition 1 (Attendance):**\n   - The claim states that the game in week 4 does not have an attendance of 74,181.\n   - From the data, we see that the attendance for week 4 is indeed 74,181.\n\n3. **Evaluate Condition 2 (Date):**\n   - The claim also states that the game was played on October 3, 1999.\n   - The table confirms that the date for week 4 is October 3, 1999.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- Since condition 1 is false (the attendance of week 4 is exactly 74,181), the entire claim is false because it requires both conditions to be true. \n- Condition 2 is true, but since one part of an \"and\" statement must be false for the whole statement to be false, the overall claim does not hold.\n\nThus, the final answer is that the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the data for week 4: date (October 3, 1999), opponent (New York Jets), result (l 21 - 13), attendance (74181).\",\n    \"Evaluate condition 1: The claim states that week 4 does not have an attendance of 74181. However, the table shows it does.\",\n    \"Evaluate condition 2: The claim states the game was on October 3, 1999. The table confirms this date for week 4.\",\n    \"Since condition 1 is false and the statement uses 'and', the entire claim is false.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
