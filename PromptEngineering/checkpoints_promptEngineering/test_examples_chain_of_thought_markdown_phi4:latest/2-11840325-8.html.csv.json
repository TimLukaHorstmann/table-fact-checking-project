    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's examine each part of the claim against the data provided.\n\n### Claim:\n\"In 2012, the Oakland Raiders lose to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15 - 0.\"\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Year Check**: The claim specifies the year as 2012.\n   - We need to find all entries in the table for the year 2012.\n\n2. **Teams Involved**: The claim involves two teams: Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs.\n   - Specifically, it mentions that Oakland Raiders lose to Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n3. **Location Check**: The match is claimed to have taken place at Arrowhead Stadium.\n   - We need to check if any 2012 games between these teams took place at this location.\n\n4. **Result Check**: The result specified in the claim is a loss for the Oakland Raiders with a score of 15 - 0.\n   - We need to verify if such a game exists in the table with this exact score and outcome.\n\n### Examination:\n\n- **Row 5** (2012, October 28):\n  - Winner: Oakland Raiders\n  - Result: 26 - 16\n  - Location: Arrowhead Stadium\n\n- **Row 6** (2012, December 16):\n  - Winner: Oakland Raiders\n  - Result: 15 - 0\n  - Location: Oco Coliseum\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- In 2012, there are two matches between the Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs.\n- Both games in 2012 were won by the Oakland Raiders.\n- The game with a score of 15 - 0 occurred at Oco Coliseum, not Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nTherefore, the claim is **FALSE** because:\n- The Oakland Raiders did not lose to the Kansas City Chiefs in any 2012 match.\n- There was no game at Arrowhead Stadium where the Raiders lost with a score of 15 - 0.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5: \n  - \"year\": 2012\n  - \"winner\": \"oakland raiders\"\n  - \"result\": \"26 - 16\"\n  - \"location\": \"arrowhead stadium\"\n\n- Row 6:\n  - \"year\": 2012\n  - \"winner\": \"oakland raiders\"\n  - \"result\": \"15 - 0\"\n  - \"location\": \"oco coliseum\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim specifies a year, teams, location, and result.
