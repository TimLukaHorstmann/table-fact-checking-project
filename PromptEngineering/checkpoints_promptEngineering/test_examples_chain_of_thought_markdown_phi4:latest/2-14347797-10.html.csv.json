We need to locate this date in the table.\n\n2. **Locate the Row with the Given Date**: \n   - Scan through the 'date' column to find \"april 14\".\n   - According to the table, \"april 14\" is listed in row 4.\n\n3. **Check the Opponent for the Identified Date**:\n   - Once we have located row 4, check the 'opponent' column of this row.\n   - The opponent listed in row 4 is \"new jersey devils\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Against the Table Data**:\n   - The claim states that \"the opponent for april 14 be the new jersey devil\".\n   - From our examination, the opponent on \"april 14\" is indeed \"new jersey devils\", which matches exactly with what the claim specifies (despite the minor grammatical error in \"be\").\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the table data and the steps above, the claim is true.\n\nNow, let's format this reasoning into a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the date 'april 14' in the 'date' column.
