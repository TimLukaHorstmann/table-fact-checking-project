It likely refers to Kiatprawut Saiewao, who should also be a defender (df) and released.\n- **\"suree sukha\"**: The player Suree Sukha should be a defender (df) who was released.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n1. **Michael Daly**:\n   - Check the table for Michael Daly.\n   - Row: 2, Column: `player` shows \"michael daly\".\n   - Position (`pos`) is \"df\" (defender).\n   - Transfer status to another club is \"released\".\n   - Conclusion: Matches the claim.\n\n2. **Kiatprawut Saiewao**:\n   - Check for Kiatprawut Saiewao, correcting the typo from \"kiatprawut saiweo\".\n   - Row: 8, Column: `player` shows \"kiatprawut saiwaeo\" (correcting \"saiwaeo\" to \"saiewao\").\n   - Position (`pos`) is \"df\" (defender).\n   - Transfer status is \"released\".\n   - Conclusion: Matches the claim.\n\n3. **Suree Sukha**:\n   - Check for Suree Sukha.\n   - Row: 9, Column: `player` shows \"suree sukha\".\n   - Position (`pos`) is \"df\" (defender).\n   - Transfer status is \"released\".\n   - Conclusion: Matches the claim.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nAll three players mentioned in the claim are indeed defenders who were released.
