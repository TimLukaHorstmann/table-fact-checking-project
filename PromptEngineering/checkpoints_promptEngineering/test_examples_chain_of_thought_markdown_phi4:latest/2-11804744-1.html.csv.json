This corresponds to:\n     ```\n     |       64 | l5640  | 2.26 ghz | 220 gb    | 24 gb qpi 5.86 gt / s | 12 mb   |\n     ```\n\n2. **Check the memory specification for \"number 64\":**\n   - The memory column for this row shows \"24 gb qpi 5.86 gt / s\". This matches part of the claim, specifically \"memory of 24 gb qri 586 gt / s\".\n   - Note: There is a typo in the claim (\"qri\" instead of \"qpi\"), but since it refers to the same specification (24 GB QPI), we consider this as equivalent for our purpose.\n\n3. **Verify the cache value for \"number 64\":**\n   - The cache column for this row shows \"12 mb\". This matches exactly with what is stated in the claim: \"the cache be 12 mb\".\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both conditions of the claim are satisfied for the entry where \"number\" is 64:\n     - Memory is indeed \"24 gb qpi 5.86 gt / s\".\n     - Cache is indeed \"12 mb\".\n   - Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row where 'number' is 64.

We need to locate the entry where \"number\" is 32.\n   - From the table, we see that the entry with \"number\" as 32 is in the third row.\n\n2. **Check the memory specification for number 32:**\n   - In the third row (where \"number\" is 32), look at the \"memory\" column.\n   - The value listed under \"memory\" is \"24 gb qpi 5.86 gt / s\".\n   - The claim states that the memory is \"24 gb qpi gt / s\". This matches the part of the specification up to \"24 gb qpi gt / s\", but it omits \"5.86\".\n\n3. **Check the clock speed for number 32:**\n   - In the same row, look at the \"clock\" column.\n   - The value listed under \"clock\" is \"2.26 ghz\".\n   - The claim states that the clock speed is \"226 ghz\". This does not match because \"2.26 ghz\" is equivalent to 2260 megahertz (MHz), not 226 GHz.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The memory specification in the table partially matches the claim, but it omits the exact transfer rate.\n   - The clock speed in the table is significantly different from what is claimed (2.26 GHz vs. 226 GHz).\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because both conditions specified in the claim are not fully satisfied.\n\n5. **Relevant cells:**\n   - For memory: Row 3, Column \"memory\"\n   - For clock: Row 3, Column \"clock\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate the row where 'number' is 32, which is the third row.
