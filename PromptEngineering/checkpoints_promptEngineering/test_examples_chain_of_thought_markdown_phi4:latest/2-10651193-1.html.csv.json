    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about players drafted from Tennessee State having a rank lower than 261 is true or false, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states there are no players drafted from Tennessee State with an overall draft ranking lower than 261.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Players**: We will look through the table and find any player who attended Tennessee State University.\n\n3. **Check Draft Positions**: For each identified player, we need to check their \"overall\" rank in the draft.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - If a player from Tennessee State has an overall ranking of 261 or higher, the claim holds true.\n   - If any player from Tennessee State has an overall ranking lower than 261, the claim is false.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- Look through the \"school / club team\" column for entries that mention \"tennessee state\".\n- Identify the row where this condition is met:\n  - The only player listed as from \"tennessee state\" is John Henry Smith.\n  \n- Check the overall draft rank for John Henry Smith:\n  - From the table, in the row with \"john henry smith\", the \"overall\" ranking is 261.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since John Henry Smith's rank is exactly 261 and there are no other players from Tennessee State listed, there are indeed no players drafted from Tennessee State with a rank lower than 261.\n   \nBased on this analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the only player from 'tennessee state' as John Henry Smith. Checked his overall draft rank and found it to be 261. Since there are no other players from Tennessee State listed, there are no ranks lower than 261 for any player from this school.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"school / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
