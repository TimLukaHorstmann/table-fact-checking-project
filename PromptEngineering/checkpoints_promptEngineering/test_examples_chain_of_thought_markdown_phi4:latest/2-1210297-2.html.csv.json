    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"both hunter and hyperion ship be laid down on different day\" is TRUE or FALSE, we will examine the table for the relevant information.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**:\n   - We need to find the dates when each of the ships, Hunter and Hyperion, were laid down.\n   \n2. **Locate \"Laid Down\" Dates in Table**:\n   - For each ship mentioned (Hunter and Hyperion), identify their respective \"laid down\" date from the table.\n\n3. **Extract Data for Hunter**:\n   - According to the table, the row containing information about the ship \"hunter\" is as follows:\n     - Row index: 8\n     - Column \"Laid Down\": 27 March 1935\n\n4. **Extract Data for Hyperion**:\n   - According to the table, the row containing information about the ship \"hyperion\" is as follows:\n     - Row index: 9\n     - Column \"Laid Down\": 27 March 1935\n\n5. **Compare Dates**:\n   - Compare the \"laid down\" dates for both ships.\n   - Both Hunter and Hyperion were laid down on the same day, 27 March 1935.\n\n6. **Determine Truth of Claim**:\n   - The claim states that both ships were laid down on different days. Since they were actually laid down on the same day, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the 'laid down' dates for Hunter and Hyperion from the table.
