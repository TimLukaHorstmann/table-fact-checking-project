    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to analyze the provided table focusing on the column labeled \"pick,\" which indicates the pick number within each round.\n\n**Claim:** \"The Atlanta Falcons have the 5th pick in the round in more than 4 separate rounds.\"\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant data:**\n   - We need to find instances where the \"pick\" value is equal to 5, as this corresponds to having the 5th pick in a given round.\n\n2. **Examine each row for a pick of 5:**\n   - Row 1: Round 1, Pick 2 (not relevant)\n   - Row 2: Round 2, Pick 17 (not relevant)\n   - Row 3: Round 4, Pick 5 (relevant)\n   - Row 4: Round 6, Pick 12 (not relevant)\n   - **Row 5**: Round 8, Pick 5 (relevant)\n   - Row 6: Round 8, Pick 19 (not relevant)\n   - Row 7: Round 9, Pick 4 (not relevant)\n   - Row 8: Round 10, Pick 5 (relevant)\n   - Row 9: Round 11, Pick 4 (not relevant)\n   - **Row 10**: Round 12, Pick 5 (relevant)\n\n3. **Count the number of rounds with a pick of 5:**\n   - We found instances in Rounds 4, 8, 10, and 12 where the pick was 5.\n\n4. **Evaluate against the claim:**\n   - The claim states that there are more than 4 separate rounds where the Falcons had the 5th pick.\n   - We identified only 4 rounds (Rounds 4, 8, 10, and 12) with a pick of 5.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Falcons have the 5th pick in exactly 4 separate rounds, not more than 4. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where 'pick' equals 5.\",\n    \"Row 3: Round 4, Pick 5 (relevant)\",\n    \"Row 5: Round 8, Pick 5 (relevant)\",\n    \"Row 8: Round 10, Pick 5 (relevant)\",\n    \"Row 10: Round 12, Pick 5 (relevant)\",\n    \"Count the relevant rows: There are 4 rounds with a pick of 5.\",\n    \"The claim states more than 4 rounds, but we found exactly 4.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
