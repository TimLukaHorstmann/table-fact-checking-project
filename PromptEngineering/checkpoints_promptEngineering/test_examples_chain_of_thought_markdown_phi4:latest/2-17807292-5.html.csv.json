Holmes is listed with:\n     - Place: t2\n     - Score: 71 + 68 + 70 = 209\n     - To Par: -1\n   - Henrik Stenson is also listed with:\n     - Place: t2\n     - Score: 71 + 70 + 68 = 209\n     - To Par: -1\n\n4. **Check Their Ranking and Scores:**\n   - Both J.B. Holmes and Henrik Stenson are ranked as tied for second place (t2) with a score of 209, which is -1 to par.\n\n5. **Compare with Claimed Information:**\n   - The claim incorrectly states they are tied for third place and have +1 to par.\n   - According to the table, they are actually tied for second place (t2) and their scores are -1 to par.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The information in the table contradicts the claim about their ranking and \"to par\" value.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- J.B.
