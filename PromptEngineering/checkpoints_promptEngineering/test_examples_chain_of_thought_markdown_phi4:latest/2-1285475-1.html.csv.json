Therefore, we need to find entries with a year less than 1999.\n\n3. **Check Power Rating Condition:**\n   - The power rating specified in the claim is \"100 kw (134hp) at 4000\". We will check if any of the m47d20 engine entries have this exact power rating.\n\n4. **Analyze Relevant Rows:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** \n     - Engine: m47d20\n     - Year: 1998\n     - Power: 100 kw (134hp) at 4000\n\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Engine: m47d20\n     - Year: 2001\n     - Power: 85 kw (114hp) at 4000\n\n5. **Verification Against the Claim:**\n   - Row 1 meets both conditions of the claim:\n     - The year is 1998, which is before 1999.\n     - The power rating is exactly \"100 kw (134hp) at 4000\".\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there exists at least one entry for the m47d20 engine that satisfies both conditions stated in the claim, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 1, Column \"engine\": m47d20\n- Row 1, Column \"year\": 1998\n- Row 1, Column \"power\": 100 kw (134hp) 4000\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is evaluated by identifying entries with engine 'm47d20', checking if any are made before 1999, and verifying if they have a power rating of '100 kw (134hp) at 4000'.

We need to locate all rows in the table that correspond to this engine type.\n\n2. **Filter by Year**:\n   - According to the claim, the engine was built in 2004. So we will filter the entries for the \"m47tu2d20\" model to see if any of them were built in 2004.\n\n3. **Check Power Specifications**:\n   - The claim specifies that this engine has a power rating of \"90 kw (121hp) 4000\".

Let's go through this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Power Specification:**\n   We are looking for engine rows with a power rating of \"90 kw (121hp) 4000.\"\n\n2. **Examine Each Row in the Table:**\n   - Row 1: Engine m47d20, Year 1998, Power 100 kw (134hp) 4000\n   - Row 2: Engine m47d20, Year 2001, Power 85 kw (114hp) 4000\n   - Row 3: Engine m47r, Year 1999, Power 100 kw (134hp) 4000\n   - Row 4: Engine m47r, Year 1999, Power 85 kw (114hp) 4000\n   - Row 5: Engine m47tud20, Year 2003, Power 85 kw (114hp) 4000\n   - **Row 6:** Engine m47tud20, Year 2001, Power 110 kw (148hp) 4000\n   - **Row 7:** Engine m47tu2d20, Year 2004, Power 90 kw (121hp) 4000\n   - **Row 8:** Engine m47tu2d20, Year 2005, Power 90 kw (121hp) 4000\n   - Row 9: Engine m47tu2d20, Year 2004, Power 120 kw (161hp) 4000\n\n3. **Extract Rows with the Target Power Rating:**\n   We find that there are two rows matching our target power specification:\n   - **Row 7:** Engine m47tu2d20, Year 2004\n   - **Row 8:** Engine m47tu2d20, Year 2005\n\n4. **Determine the Earliest Year:**\n   From the above entries, the years associated with a power of \"90 kw (121hp) 4000\" are 2004 and 2005.
