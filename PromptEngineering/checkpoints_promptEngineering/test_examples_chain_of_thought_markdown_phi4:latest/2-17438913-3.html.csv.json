The focus here is specifically on the \"sco\" entries.\n\n### Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant rows**: We will first extract all rows where the 'nat' column equals \"sco\".\n\n2. **Count the total number of \"sco\" entries**:\n   - Go through each row and count how many times \"sco\" appears in the 'nat' column.\n\n3. **Verify the claim regarding transfers**:\n   - The claim states that there are 22 transfers for \"sco\". We need to verify this by counting only those rows where the type is either 'end of contract', 'transfer', or 'loan'.\n\n4. **Compare with other nationalities**:\n   - Count entries for each other nationality in the table.\n   - Sum these counts and compare them to the count for \"sco\".\n\n5. **Determine if \"sco\" has more than all others combined**:\n   - If the total number of \"sco\" transfers is greater than the sum of all other nationalities, the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Counting \"sco\" entries**:\n   - There are 22 rows where 'nat' is \"sco\".
