This requires looking at the \"crew\" column for entries that include \"2\".\n\n2. **Examine Comments for These Rows**: Once we've identified rows with a crew size of 2, we need to examine the \"comments\" column for these specific rows to see if any mention \"daggerboard design: roy seaman.\"\n\n3. **List Relevant Rows and Check Comments**:\n   - Row 5 (\"model\": 5.0): Crew is 2.
