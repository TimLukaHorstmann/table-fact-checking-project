    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Panama, Trinidad and Tobago have more than 2 bronze medals each\" is true or false, let's evaluate the relevant data from the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate Panama in the Table:**\n   - Look for \"panama\" in the \"nation\" column.\n   - Row index: 11\n   - Check the value in the \"bronze\" column.\n   - The number of bronze medals for Panama is 1.\n\n2. **Locate Trinidad and Tobago in the Table:**\n   - Look for \"trinidad and tobago\" in the \"nation\" column.\n   - Row index: 12\n   - Check the value in the \"bronze\" column.\n   - The number of bronze medals for Trinidad and Tobago is 2.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - The claim states that both Panama and Trinidad and Tobago have more than 2 bronze medals each.\n   - From the data:\n     - Panama has 1 bronze medal, which is not more than 2.\n     - Trinidad and Tobago have 2 bronze medals, which is also not more than 2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since neither Panama nor Trinidad and Tobago have more than 2 bronze medals each, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- For Panama (Row index 11):\n  - Bronze column value: 1\n- For Trinidad and Tobago (Row index 12):\n  - Bronze column value: 2\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Locate 'panama' at row index 11 with 1 bronze medal.
