    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the 'avge' column from the table and calculate the difference between the highest and lowest values.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The claim pertains to the average goals per game (column name: `avge`). Thus, we focus on this column for our analysis.\n\n2. **Extract 'avge' values**:\n   - bobby campbell: 0.44\n   - frank o'rourke: 0.46\n   - dean windass: 0.35\n   - john hallows: 0.45\n   - joe cooke: 0.25\n   - gerry ingram: 0.37\n   - bobby ham: 0.34\n   - david mcniven: 0.3\n   - sean mccarthy: 0.48\n   - john hall: 0.15\n   - david jackson: 0.24\n   - bruce bannister: 0.29\n   - dicky bond: 0.2\n\n3. **Find the highest and lowest values**:\n   - The highest value in the 'avge' column is 0.48 (sean mccarthy).\n   - The lowest value in the 'avge' column is 0.15 (john hall).\n\n4. **Calculate the difference** between the highest and lowest average goals per game:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Difference} = 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evaluate the claim**: The claim states that there is less than a 2-point difference between the highest and lowest averages.\n\n6. **Compare the calculated difference with the claim**:\n   - Calculated difference: 0.33\n   - Claimed maximum allowed difference: 2\n\n7. Since 0.33 is indeed less than 2, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identified the relevant 'avge' column for analysis.
