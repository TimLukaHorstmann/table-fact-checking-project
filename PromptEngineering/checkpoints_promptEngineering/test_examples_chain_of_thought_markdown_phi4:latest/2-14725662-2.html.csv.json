    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table and check the details related to the game against Michigan. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can verify the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for the Game Against Michigan:**\n   - We need to find the row in which \"michigan\" is listed as the opponent.\n\n2. **Locate the Site Column for This Row:**\n   - Once we identify the correct row, we look at the 'site' column to determine where the game took place.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim Against the Data:**\n   - The claim states that the game against Michigan took place at \"memorial stadium, minneapolis, mn.\" We need to see if this matches the information in the site column for the row corresponding to the game against Michigan.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- From the table:\n  - Locate the row where the opponent is \"michigan\": This is on **row 9**.\n  \n- Check the 'site' column for this row:\n  - The entry in the 'site' column for this row is \"michigan stadium ann arbor, mi.\"\n\n- Compare with the Claim:\n  - The claim states that the game took place at \"memorial stadium, minneapolis, mn.\"\n  - However, according to the table, it actually took place at \"michigan stadium ann arbor, mi.\"\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- **The claim is FALSE** because the actual site of the game against Michigan was not Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, but rather Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the row where 'michigan' is listed as the opponent.
