    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about a Kansas City Royal victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th, which supposedly drops the Blue Jays' record to 18 - 12, is true or false, let's analyze the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Match Details:**\n   - The claim mentions a match between Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th.\n   - In the table under the \"date\" column for May 12, there is an entry:\n     ```\n     | date | opponent | score | loss       | attendance | record |\n     |------|----------|-------|------------|------------|--------|\n     | may 12 | royals  | 3 - 1 | cerutti (1 - 1) | 30034      | 18 - 12 |\n     ```\n   - This entry indicates a game against the Royals, not the Blue Jays.\n\n2. **Opponent Check:**\n   - The opponent listed for May 12th is \"royals,\" indicating the match was between Kansas City Royals and another team (not specified as Toronto Blue Jays in this row).\n\n3. **Record Analysis:**\n   - The record after the game on May 12th against the Royals is given as \"18 - 12.\"\n   - This record reflects the current standing of the team following their win over the Royals, not a Blue Jays' record.\n\n4. **Verify Opponent and Date:**\n   - There is no entry for a match against Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th in the table.\n   - The closest matches to the Blue Jays would be against the \"twins\" (Minnesota Twins), as indicated by entries from May 13th onwards, but there are no entries involving Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim references a specific match outcome and record change involving Toronto Blue Jays on May 12th that does not exist in the table.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false because it inaccurately describes an event (Kansas City Royals vs. Toronto Blue Jays) and its impact on the Blue Jays' record.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cell for checking the opponent and date is:\n  - Row index: 12\n  - Column names: \"date\", \"opponent\", \"record\"\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table shows a game against the Royals on May 12th with the record changing to 18 - 12.
