Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: \n   - The claim states that no division is present in the table with a season after 2012 reaching the round of 16 in the FA Cup.\n\n2. **Examine Table Data**:\n   - The table provides data for seasons from 2003 to 2012, including each year's division number, team ranking (tms), league position (pos), and progress in the FA Cup.\n   - We must check if there are any entries beyond the year 2012 that reach the round of 16 in the FA Cup.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Columns**:\n   - The relevant columns for this analysis are \"season\" and \"fa cup.\"\n   - Specifically, we need to look at seasons after 2012 and check their corresponding FA Cup progress.\n\n4. **Evaluate Seasons After 2012**:\n   - Review the \"season\" column to identify any season entries beyond 2012.\n   - The table only lists data up to the year 2012, so there are no seasons listed beyond this year.\n\n5. **Check for Round of 16 in FA Cup for Post-2012 Seasons**:\n   - Since no seasons after 2012 exist within the table's range (2003-2012), it is impossible for any season beyond 2012 to have reached the round of 16 or any other stage.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no entries in the table for seasons beyond 2012.\n   - Therefore, by default, there cannot be any post-2012 seasons reaching the round of 16 because such data does not exist within this table.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true. \n\nHere is the final JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists seasons from 2003 to 2012 only.
