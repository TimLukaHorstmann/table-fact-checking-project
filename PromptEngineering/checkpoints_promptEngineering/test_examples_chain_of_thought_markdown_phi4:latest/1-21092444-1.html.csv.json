This corresponds to row index 2 in the table.\n\n2. **Verify the score for Lehigh game**:\n   - In row 2, under the column \"black knights points\", we see a value of 54. This confirms that the Black Knights scored 54 points against Lehigh.\n\n3. **Verify the record after the Lehigh game**:\n   - Still in row 2, check the \"record\" column which shows \"2 - 0\". This indicates the record after winning against Lehigh.\n   - We need to determine if this was updated to \"2 - 2\" at any point after the Lehigh game. \n   - Check subsequent rows:\n     - Row 3 (Villanova, Sept 27): Record is \"2 - 1\".\n     - Row 4 (Stanford, Oct 4): Record is \"2 - 2\".\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that the Black Knights' record became 2-2 after their game against Stanford on October 4th, not after the Lehigh game.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe claim states that the record was 2-2 when they scored 54 points against Lehigh on September 20th.
