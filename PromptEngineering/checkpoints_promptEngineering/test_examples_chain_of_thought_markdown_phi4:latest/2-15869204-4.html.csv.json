We will consider each row as a separate game entry.\n   \n2. **Examine Each Game's Record**:\n   - For each game, note the record after that game is concluded.\n\n3. **Determine Final Record for November**:\n   - The final record at the end of November (after the last game on November 29) will indicate how many games were won and lost during the month.\n   \n4. **Check Against Claim**:\n   - Compare this final record with the claim that states a \"6 - 8\" record.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row 3**: Record is 2 - 1\n- **Row 4**: Record is 3 - 1\n- **Row 5**: Record is 3 - 2\n- **Row 6**: Record is 4 - 2\n- **Row 7**: Record is 4 - 3\n- **Row 8**: Record is 4 - 4\n- **Row 9**: Record is 4 - 5\n- **Row 10**: Record is 5 - 5\n- **Row 11**: Record is 5 - 6\n- **Row 12**: Record is 6 - 6\n- **Row 13**: Record is 6 - 7\n- **Row 14**: Record is 7 - 7\n- **Row 15**: Record is 8 - 7\n- **Row 16**: Final record for November is 8 - 8\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe final record after the last game on November 29 is \"8 - 8\".
