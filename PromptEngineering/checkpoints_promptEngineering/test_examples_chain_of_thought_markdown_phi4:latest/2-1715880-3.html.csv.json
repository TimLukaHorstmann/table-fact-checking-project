We need to find any records showing \"21 - X\", where X represents losses.\n   - The relevant row is:\n     - `win | 21 - 5 | keith jardine | decision (split) | ufc 76 | 3 | 5:00 | anaheim, california, united states`\n     - This indicates there's a fighter with 21 wins and 5 losses.\n\n2. **Check Rich Franklin\u2019s record:**\n   - Look for entries involving \"rich franklin\" in the opponent column (`opponent`).\n   - The relevant row is:\n     - `loss | 21 - 8 | rich franklin | ko (punch) | ufc 115 | 1 | 4:55 | vancouver, british columbia, canada`\n   - This shows that Rich Franklin has a record of \"21 wins and 8 losses.\"\n\n3. **Compare the number of losses:**\n   - The fighter with 21 wins in the table (Keith Jardine) has 5 losses.\n   - Rich Franklin has 8 losses.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since 8 losses (Rich Franklin) is greater than 5 losses (the other fighter with 21 wins), the claim that \"Rich Franklin have the most loss among the fighter with 21 win\" is true.\n\nNow, let's present this in the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify any fighters with a record of '21 wins' by looking at the 'record' column.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim is true, we need to analyze the data provided in the table concerning Chuck Liddell's fights and decisions made against him.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Decisions Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - From the table, we can see that there are three fights where Chuck Liddell lost via a decision:\n     1. Loss to Keith Jardine (UFC 76) - Decision (Split)\n     2. Loss to Randy Couture (UFC 43) - TKO (punches), but decisions generally mean referee or fighter stoppage, not technical knockouts.\n     3. Loss to Rich Franklin (UFC 115) - KO (Punch)\n\n   Only the fight against Keith Jardine was a decision loss for Liddell.\n\n2. **List Fighters Who Defeated Chuck Liddell via Decision:**\n   - Based on the table, the only fighter who defeated Chuck Liddell by decision is Keith Jardine.\n\n3. **Determine If Noe Hernandez Is Amongst Them:**\n   - The claim states that \"Noe Hernandez have the second highest number of win amongst the fighter who have a decision against Chuck Liddell.\"\n   - Since there's only one fighter (Keith Jardine) with a decision victory over Chuck Liddell, it is impossible for Noe Hernandez to be in any position other than not having defeated him by decision.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim suggests that Noe Hernandez has a number of wins against Chuck Liddell via decision, which is false because he did not have any decision victories over Liddell.\n   - Therefore, the statement is inherently incorrect as there are no multiple fighters with decisions against him for comparison.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Keith Jardine's Fight:**\n  - Row Index: 14\n  - Columns: \"Opponent\" (Keith Jardine), \"Result\" (Loss), \"Decision Type\" (Split)\n\n- **Noe Hernandez's Fight:**\n  - Row Index: 40\n  - Columns: \"Opponent\" (Noe Hernandez), \"Result\" (Win), \"Decision Type\" (Unanimous) \n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Chuck Liddell was defeated by decision only once, by Keith Jardine.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Noe Hernandez having the joint fewest losses among fighters who have a decision against Chuck Liddell is true, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Decisions Against Chuck Liddell:**\n   - Review each row in the table for fights where Chuck Liddell's method of winning or losing was by \"decision.\"\n\n2. **Count Decisions Against Liddell:**\n   - From step 1, we identify matches where Liddell faced a decision against him.\n   - These instances are:\n     - Row 10: Randy Couture vs Chuck Liddell at UFC 43 (Loss)\n     - Row 11: Tito Ortiz vs Chuck Liddell at UFC 66 (Win for Liddell)\n     - Row 12: Keith Jardine vs Chuck Liddell at UFC 76 (Loss)\n\n3. **Identify Opponents' Records of Losses:**\n   - For each fighter who has a decision against Liddell, check their record to count the number of losses.\n   - Randy Couture's loss record:\n     - Row 9: Loss (20-4)\n     - Row 12: Loss (20-5) [Total losses = 2]\n   - Tito Ortiz's loss record:\n     - Rows with \"loss\" under the res column for Tito Ortiz are:\n       - Row 7: Loss to Chuck Liddell at UFC 66\n       - No other rows in the table indicate additional losses.\n     - Total losses = 1\n\n4. **Determine Fewest Losses Among These Fighters:**\n   - We have Randy Couture with 2 losses and Tito Ortiz with 1 loss among opponents who had a decision against Chuck Liddell.\n\n5. **Evaluate Noe Hernandez's Record:**\n   - Check the record for Noe Hernandez:\n     - Row 23: Losses = 0\n\n6. **Compare Loss Records:**\n   - Since Noe Hernandez has 0 losses, which is fewer than both Randy Couture and Tito Ortiz, he does not have a joint fewest loss count with either of them.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim that \"Noe Hernandez have the joint fewest loss amongst the fighter who have a decision against Chuck Liddell\" is false because Noe Hernandez has fewer losses than any other opponent listed in step 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify fights where Chuck Liddell faced decisions against him.
