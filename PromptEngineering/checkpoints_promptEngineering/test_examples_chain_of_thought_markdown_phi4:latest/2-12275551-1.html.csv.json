Otherwise, it is false.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **Occurrences of Song Yang**:\n  - 1994: \"song yang\"\n  - 1995: \"song yang\"\n\n- **Count for Other Players**:\n  - Count how many times each other player appears in the 'Women\u2019s Singles' column.\n  - For example, \"li feng\" appears as a winner three times (1996, 1997, 1998).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Song Yang has won twice.\n- Li Feng has won more than Song Yang, with three wins.\n\nThus, the claim that Song Yang won the women's singles more than any other player is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I located the 'Women\u2019s Singles' column in the table.
