Not an away game for Colorado.\n   - November 3: Visitor is \"colorado\". Away game.\n   - November 5: Visitor is \"colorado\". Away game.\n   - November 9: Visitor is \"dallas\". Not an away game for Colorado.\n   - November 11: Visitor is \"colorado\". Away game.\n   - November 15: Visitor is \"colorado\". Away game.\n   - November 17: Visitor is \"calgary\".
