This satisfies the first part of the claim regarding the specific date.\n\n2. **Identify Matches with a Crowd Size of 5000**:\n   - We need to locate rows where the \"crowd\" column has a value of 5000.\n   \n3. **Count the Matches with a Crowd of 5000**:\n   - Row 1: Richmond vs St Kilda at Punt Road Oval, crowd size is 6000.\n   - Row 2: Hawthorn vs Melbourne at Glenferrie Oval, crowd size is 2000.\n   - Row 3: Collingwood vs Essendon at Victoria Park, crowd size is 6000.\n   - Row 4: Carlton vs Fitzroy at Princes Park, crowd size is 4000.\n   - **Row 5**: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne at Lake Oval, crowd size is 5000. (First match with a crowd of 5000)\n   - **Row 6**: Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park, crowd size is 5000. (Second match with a crowd of 5000)\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are exactly two matches on June 21, 1941, where the crowd was recorded as 5000.\n   - Therefore, the claim that \"on 21 june 1941 the crowd be 5000 for 2 match during the 1941 VFL season\" is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells corresponding to the matches with a crowd of 5000 are from rows 5 and 6 in the \"crowd\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, verify that all matches are on June 21, 1941.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the total score for the away team in 6 matches be 396\" is true, we need to calculate the total scores of all the away teams listed in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Score Format**: The scores are presented as `X.Y (Z)`, where:\n   - `X` is the number of goals (each goal = 6 points).\n   - `Y` is the number of behinds (each behind = 1 point).\n   - `Z` is the total score in points.\n\n2. **Extract and Sum the Scores**:\n   - For each match, we will extract the away team's score from column \"away team score\" and sum these scores to verify if they equal 396.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Score for Each Away Team**:\n   - **Richmond vs St Kilda**: \n     - St Kilda: `6.11 (47)`\n   - **Hawthorn vs Melbourne**: \n     - Melbourne: `12.12 (84)`\n   - **Collingwood vs Essendon**: \n     - Essendon: `7.10 (52)`\n   - **Carlton vs Fitzroy**: \n     - Fitzroy: `12.13 (85)`\n   - **South Melbourne vs North Melbourne**:\n     - North Melbourne: `6.6 (42)`\n   - **Geelong vs Footscray**:\n     - Footscray: `13.15 (93)`\n\n4. **Sum the Total Scores**:\n   - St Kilda: 47\n   - Melbourne: 84\n   - Essendon: 52\n   - Fitzroy: 85\n   - North Melbourne: 42\n   - Footscray: 93\n\n5. **Calculate the Overall Total**:\n   \\[\n   47 + 84 + 52 + 85 + 42 + 93 = 403\n   \\]\n\n6. **Compare with Claimed Total**:\n   - The calculated total score for all away teams is 403, not 396.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe claim that the total score for the away team in 6 matches is 396 is FALSE.
