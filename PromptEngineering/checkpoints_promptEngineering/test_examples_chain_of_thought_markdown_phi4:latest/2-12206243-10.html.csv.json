    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Mike Mussina got the win in the September 25 game against the Oriole\" is true or false, we need to analyze the relevant data from the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Date and Opponent:**\n   - The claim refers to a game on September 25 against the Orioles (Orioles).\n\n2. **Locate the Row for September 25:**\n   - Check the row with \"september 25\" in the table.\n\n3. **Examine the 'loss' Column for September 25:**\n   - The 'loss' column indicates which pitcher was credited with the loss.\n   - For September 25, the entry is \"mussina (15 - 8)\".\n\n4. **Understand the Implication of the Loss Entry:**\n   - In baseball, when a pitcher's name appears in the 'loss' column, it means that pitcher was credited with the loss for that game.\n   - Conversely, if a pitcher is not listed as the loss and the team won, they are often credited with the win.\n\n5. **Check the Record Column:**\n   - The record on September 25 is \"73 - 86\", indicating a win for the team (since the wins count increased from the previous day).\n\n6. **Determine if Mike Mussina Got the Win:**\n   - Since Mike Mussina is listed as the loss, he cannot be credited with the win.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the table, Mike Mussina was not credited with a win in the September 25 game against the Orioles; instead, he was credited with the loss.
