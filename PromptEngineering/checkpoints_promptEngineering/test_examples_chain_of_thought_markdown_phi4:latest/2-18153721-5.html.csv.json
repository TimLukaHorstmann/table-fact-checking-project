    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we will analyze the data step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim states there are 2 players tied for the lead with a score of \"2 under par.\"\n\n2. **Identify Key Columns:**\n   - `place`: This column shows where the player ranks in terms of scores.\n   - `score`: This column provides the total score (the sum of two rounds) achieved by each player.\n   - `to par`: This column indicates how many strokes over or under par a player is. \n\n3. **Identify Players at the Lead:**\n   - According to golf scoring, \"tied for the lead\" means having the lowest score on the leaderboard. The players with the lowest scores are marked by the same place number in the `place` column.\n   - In this table, rows with `place = t1` have the lowest scores.\n\n4. **Examine Players at `t1`:**\n   - There are two players at `t1`: David Graham and Sandy Lyle. \n   - Both have a score of 139, as indicated in their respective `score` columns.\n   - Their `to par` values are both `-1`.\n\n5. **Interpret `to par` Value:**\n   - The `to par` value indicates how many strokes under or over par the player is. A negative number means under par (e.g., `-1` is 1 under par).\n\n6. **Check Claim Against Table Data:**\n   - The players at the lead (`t1`) are David Graham and Sandy Lyle.\n   - Their `to par` value is `-1`, meaning they are 1 under par, not 2 under par.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - There are indeed two players tied for the lead, but their score is 1 under par, not 2 under par as claimed.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the table data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states there are 2 players tied for the lead with a score of 2 under par.\",\n    \"We need to identify players at the lead using the `place` column.

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the 3 player tie at 2nd place be even to par\" is true or false, let's analyze the information provided in the table step-by-step.\n\n1. **Identify the Positioning:**\n   - The table uses a position column (like t1, t2, etc.) to indicate tied positions.\n   - \"t1\" represents the players who are tied for 1st place.\n   - To find the group of players tied for 2nd place, we need to look at the next unique position in the table after \"t1\".\n\n2. **Locate the Tied Group:**\n   - After t1 (1st place), the next position is \"t3\".\n   - Therefore, the players listed under \"t3\" are tied for 3rd place.\n\n3. **Verify the Players and Scores:**\n   - The players in the \"t3\" row are:\n     - Tony Johnstone\n     - Christy O'connor Jnr\n     - D A Weibring\n   - All these players have a score of 140, which corresponds to \"e\" (even) on the course.\n\n4. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states there is a \"3 player tie at 2nd place\".\n   - From our analysis, it's clear that the 3 players are tied for 3rd place, not 2nd.\n   - Thus, the position in the claim is incorrect.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the tied group is actually at 3rd place and not 2nd as claimed, the statement is false.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - The relevant cells to this analysis are those that show the players at \"t3\" (i.e., rows for Tony Johnstone, Christy O'connor Jnr, and D A Weibring) with their scores and position indicators.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table indicates that 't1' is for players tied at 1st place.
