    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the average win percentage against Rajasthan Royals and Kochi Tuskers Kerala being 50% is true or false, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data**: We need to find the win percentages for matches against Rajasthan Royals and Kochi Tuskers Kerala.\n\n2. **Extract Win Percentages**:\n   - From the table, locate the row corresponding to \"Rajasthan Royals\":\n     - Win %: 50\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"Kochi Tuskers Kerala\":\n     - Win %: 0\n\n3. **Calculate Average Win Percentage**:\n   - Add the win percentages: \\(50 + 0 = 50\\)\n   - Count the number of oppositions: There are 2 (Rajasthan Royals and Kochi Tuskers Kerala).\n   - Calculate the average: \\(\\frac{50}{2} = 25\\)\n\n4. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the average win percentage is 50%.\n   - Our calculated average is 25%.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 25% does not equal 50%, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n- Rajasthan Royals: Row index 6, Column \"win %\"\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala: Row index 10, Column \"win %\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified win percentages for Rajasthan Royals (50%) and Kochi Tuskers Kerala (0%).
