This is at row index 34 (considering zero-based indexing).\n\n3. **Check Population (\"pop\") Value:**\n   - In the identified row (row index 34), look at the \"pop\" column.\n   - The population value listed is indeed 709,888.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the population for Shizuoka matches the claim of 709,888, the statement is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was scanned to find 'shizuoka' in the capital column.
