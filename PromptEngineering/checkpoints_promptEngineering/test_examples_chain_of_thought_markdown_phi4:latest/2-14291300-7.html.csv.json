    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"the toronto maple leaf be the only opponent with 63 point\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table for games where the points are 63 and check which opponents were involved.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with 63 Points:**\n   - Look through the \"points\" column in the table to find all instances where the value is 63.\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 68 has 63 points.\n\n2. **Check Opponent for Each Relevant Row:**\n   - For row 68, which has 63 points, identify the opponent from the \"opponent\" column.\n   - In row 68, the opponent is \"toronto maple leafs.\"\n\n3. **Verify Uniqueness of the Opponent:**\n   - Check if there are any other rows where the points are 63 and see if they list a different opponent.\n   - From our analysis in step 1, row 68 is the only row with 63 points.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since row 68 is the only instance of 63 points and the opponent listed is \"toronto maple leafs,\" this confirms that Toronto Maple Leafs are indeed the only opponent associated with a game resulting in 63 points.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify rows where the 'points' column has the value 63.
