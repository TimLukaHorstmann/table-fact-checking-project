The claim involves a specific player (\"lj burger\") on a specific date (\"19 - 2 - 2003\").\n\n2. **Locate \"lj burger\" in the Table**:\n   - We search through the \"player\" column to find entries with the name \"lj burger\".\n\n3. **Check Date Correspondence**:\n   - Once we locate \"lj burger\", check if this player is associated with the date \"19 - 2 - 2003\". This involves looking at the same row where \"lj burger\" appears and verifying the corresponding entry in the \"date\" column.\n\n4. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - If \"lj burger\" is indeed a player on \"19 - 2 - 2003\", then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\n### Examination of Table:\n\n- The table row with \"lj burger\" as the player appears in the third row (row index: 3).\n- In this row, under the \"date\" column, the entry is \"19 - 02 - 2003\".\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied\u2014lj burger is listed as a player on \"19 - 2 - 2003\"\u2014the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The cell in the table where \"lj burger\" appears in the \"player\" column and the corresponding date in the \"date\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, I identified that we need to check both the 'player' and 'date' columns.
