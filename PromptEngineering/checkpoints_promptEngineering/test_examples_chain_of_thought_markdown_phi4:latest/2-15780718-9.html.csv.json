    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Michael Bradley, Jelani McCoy (14) have the highest rebound against Miami\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the specific games played against Miami from the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games Against Miami:**\n   - The team plays two games against Miami on April 8 and April 15.\n   \n2. **Check Rebounds in Each Game:**\n   - **Game 77 (April 8, Miami):** \n     - High rebounds listed are for \"Michael Bradley (8)\".\n     - No mention of Jelani McCoy as having high rebounds.\n\n   - **Game 81 (April 15, Miami):**\n     - High rebounds listed are for \"Jerome Williams (17)\".\n     - Again, no mention of Michael Bradley or Jelani McCoy in this category.\n\n3. **Compare Rebounds Against Other Players:**\n   - In both games against Miami, Jerome Williams has the highest rebound count (8 and 17 respectively).\n   - Michael Bradley only appears as having high rebounds in Game 77 with a count of 8.\n   - Jelani McCoy does not appear at all for any high rebounds in these two games.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim mentions \"Michael Bradley, Jelani McCoy (14)\" but neither player has recorded the highest rebound count against Miami according to the table data.\n   - Therefore, the claim is FALSE because Jerome Williams has higher rebounds than both Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy in these games.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- **Game 77:**\n  - `row_index`: 5\n  - `column_name`: high_rebounds\n\n- **Game 81:**\n  - `row_index`: 10\n  - `column_name`: high_rebounds\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The team played against Miami on April 8 and April 15.
