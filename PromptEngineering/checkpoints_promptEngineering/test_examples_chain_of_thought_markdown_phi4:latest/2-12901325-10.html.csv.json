    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the only non-pitcher to be drafted by the last player\" is true, we need to carefully analyze each row of the table for player positions and their draft order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand Positions:**\n   - A pitcher typically plays as a Right Handed Pitcher (RHP), Left Handed Pitcher (LHP), or can also be a catcher or any other specialized pitching role.\n   - Non-pitchers usually occupy positions like infield (inf) or outfield.\n\n2. **Identify the Last Player Drafted:**\n   - The last player drafted is in row 5, \"george putz.\"\n\n3. **Check George Putz's Position:**\n   - According to row 5, \"george putz\" plays as a \"1b,\" which stands for first baseman.\n\n4. **Determine if First Baseman is a Pitcher:**\n   - The position \"1b\" (first baseman) is not typically associated with pitching; it is an infield position and thus considered a non-pitcher role.\n\n5. **Examine Other Non-Pitchers in the Draft:**\n   - Row 1, \"pat harrison,\" plays as \"inf\" (infielder), which is a non-pitcher.\n   - Row 4, \"william ferguson,\" also plays as \"1b\" (first baseman), another non-pitcher.\n\n6. **Conclusion on Non-Pitchers:**\n   - There are two non-pitchers before the last player: pat harrison and william ferguson.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nThe claim is false because there were other non-pitchers drafted before \"george putz,\" specifically in rows 1 and 4. Therefore, \"the only non-pitcher to be drafted by the last player\" is incorrect since non-pitchers appeared earlier in the draft order.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the positions of each player. Verified that 'george putz' in row 5 plays as a first baseman, which is a non-pitcher position. Checked other players and found pat harrison (row 1) and william ferguson (row 4) are also non-pitchers. Thus, the claim is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
