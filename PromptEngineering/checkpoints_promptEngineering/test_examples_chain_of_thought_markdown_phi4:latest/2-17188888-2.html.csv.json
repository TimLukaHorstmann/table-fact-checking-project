This matches part of the claim, indicating there is one indoor game. The year is 1949, which is indeed after 1946.\n\n   - **Row 6 (Year: 1949)**:\n     - Surface is \"grass\", not relevant to the claim.\n   \n5. **Confirm the Conditions**:\n   - We have identified exactly one game played on an indoor surface.\n   - The year of this indoor game is 1949, which satisfies the condition of being after 1946.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, there is only one game that was played on an \"indoor\" surface and it took place in 1949.
