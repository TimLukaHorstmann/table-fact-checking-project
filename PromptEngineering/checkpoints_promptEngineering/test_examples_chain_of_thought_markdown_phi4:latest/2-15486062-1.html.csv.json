Here's how we can proceed:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - We need to find all the rows that correspond to games played in November 2001. This involves checking the \"date\" column for entries with \"November.\"\n\n2. **Extract Dates and Results:**\n   - For each relevant row, we will extract both the date and the result of the game.\n\n3. **Analyze Game Outcomes:**\n   - We need to determine if any of these games resulted in a loss for the team (\"L\" in the \"result\" column).\n\n4. **Compile Relevant Data:**\n   - List all rows with November dates and their corresponding results.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Claim:**\n   - If there are no losses (i.e., no \"L\" in the result) in November 2001, the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **Row 9:** Date is \"November 11, 2001,\" and the result is \"l 20 - 13.\" This indicates a loss.\n- **Row 10:** Date is \"November 18, 2001,\" and the result is \"l 36 - 3.\" This also indicates a loss.\n- **Row 11:** Date is \"November 22, 2001,\" and the result is \"l 26 - 24.\" This indicates another loss.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe team lost all three games they played in November 2001.
