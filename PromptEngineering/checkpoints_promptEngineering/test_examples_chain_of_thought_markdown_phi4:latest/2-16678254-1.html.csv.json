This is specified in the \"date\" column of the same row.\n\n3. **Verify the result**:\n   - Confirm if the \"result\" column for this row shows a win (denoted as 'w').\n   - The claim states that the result should be a win ('w').\n\n4. **Confirm the score**:\n   - Verify the exact score mentioned: 65 - 20.\n   - This information is found in the \"result\" column, which includes both the outcome and the scores for each game.\n\n5. **Cross-check all conditions**:\n   - Ensure that all aspects of the claim (week number, date, result, and score) match exactly with the data provided in the table.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given table:\n\n- In row 8 of the table, we have:\n  - \"week\" = 8\n  - \"date\" = November 13, 1949\n  - \"result\" = w 65 - 20\n\nThis matches the conditions specified in the claim: it is indeed week 8 on November 13, 1949, with a win result ('w') and a score of 65 - 20.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row where 'week' equals 8.\",\n    \"Ensure the 'date' for week 8 matches November 13, 1949.\",\n    \"Check that the 'result' column indicates a win ('w').\",\n    \"Verify the score in the 'result' column is 65 - 20.\",\n    \"All conditions of the claim are satisfied by the data in row 8.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
