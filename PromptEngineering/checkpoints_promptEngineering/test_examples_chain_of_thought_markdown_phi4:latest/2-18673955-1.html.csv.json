    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, let's break down the problem step-by-step using the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim:**\n   - The claim states there are \"no game that be play on october 30 , 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\"\n   - This means we need to verify if any game listed after Week 7 is also scheduled for October 30, 1977.\n\n2. **Identify the Game on October 30, 1977:**\n   - From the table:\n     - Row 7 corresponds to October 30, 1977.\n     - The opponent was \"tampa bay buccaneers\" and the result was a win (w 20 - 10).\n\n3. **Examine Weeks After Week 7:**\n   - We need to check if any game listed after Week 7 has the date October 30, 1977.\n   - This involves looking at Rows 8 through 14.\n\n4. **Check Dates for Weeks 8 to 14:**\n   - Row 8: November 6, 1977\n   - Row 9: November 13, 1977\n   - Row 10: November 20, 1977\n   - Row 11: November 27, 1977\n   - Row 12: December 4, 1977\n   - Row 13: December 12, 1977\n   - Row 14: December 18, 1977\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - None of the games listed after Week 7 are on October 30, 1977.\n   - Therefore, there is no game scheduled for October 30, 1977, beyond Week 7.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that there is no game listed after Week 7 with the date October 30, 1977. By examining each row from Week 8 to Week 14, we find that none of these weeks have the date October 30, 1977.
