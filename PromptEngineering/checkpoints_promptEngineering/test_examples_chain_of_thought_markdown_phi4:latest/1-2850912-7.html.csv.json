    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"8 of the picked players show in the table play the position other than centre\" is true or false, we need to analyze the 'position' column for each player listed in the table and count how many are playing positions other than 'centre'. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: We focus on the \"position\" column since it indicates whether a player plays as a centre or another position.\n\n2. **Count occurrences of 'centre'**:\n   - Row 129: Timothy Hanley is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 130: Joseph McInnis is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 132: Mike Stapleton is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 134: Cliff Ronning is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 135: Luciano Borsato is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 136: Blaine Chrest is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 143: Timo Iljima is listed as a \"centre\".\n   - Row 145: Mark Thietke is listed as a \"centre\".\n\n3. **Count players with positions other than 'centre'**:\n   - Rows with non-centre positions are all others not mentioned in the above list of centres.\n   - Tom Ryan (defence)\n   - Ian Ferguson (defence)\n   - Mike Vellucci (defence)\n   - Stefan Larsson (defence)\n   - Scott Mactavish (defence)\n   - Kevan Melrose (defence)\n   - Vladimir Kyhos (left wing)\n   - Thomas Hussey (left wing)\n   - Henrik Cedegren (right wing)\n   - Tom Allen (defence)\n   - Darcy Wakaluk (goaltender)\n   - Kelly Murphy (defence)\n   - Heikki Riihijarvi (defence)\n\n4. **Calculate the number of players not playing as a centre**:\n   - Total players listed: 15\n   - Players identified as centres: 8\n   - Therefore, players in other positions = Total players - Centre players = 15 - 8 = 7\n\n5. **Evaluate the claim**: The claim states that \"8 of the picked players play the position other than centre\". However, based on our analysis, only 7 players are playing a position other than 'centre'.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we found 7 players in non-centre positions instead of 8 as claimed, the statement is false.\n\nNow let's list the relevant cells for verification:\n\n- Cells where \"position\" is not \"centre\":\n  - Row 1: defence\n  - Row 2: defence\n  - Row 4: defence\n  - Row 5: defence\n  - Row 7: defence\n  - Row 8: defence\n  - Row 9: left wing\n  - Row 10: left wing\n  - Row 11: right wing\n  - Row 12: defence\n  - Row 14: goaltender\n  - Row 16: defence\n  - Row 17: defence\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To verify the claim, we examined each player's position in the 'position' column.
