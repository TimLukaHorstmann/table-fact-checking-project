This is inferred from the fact that if their \"difference\" is negative, it implies they conceded more goals than they scored.\n\nFrom Step 1, we know these teams:\n- Row 5 (portuguesa): difference = -10\n- Row 7 (vasco da gama): difference = -2\n- Row 8 (am\u00e9rica): difference = -10\n- Row 9 (s\u00e3o paulo): difference = -13\n\nAdditionally, we need to check other teams to see if they have a negative goal difference:\n\n- Row 1 (flamengo): difference = 8\n- Row 2 (fluminense): difference = 10\n- Row 3 (corinthians): difference = 4\n- Row 4 (palestra it\u00e1lia): difference = 3\n- Row 6 (botafogo): difference = 0\n\nNone of these teams have a negative goal difference.\n\nThus, the teams with more goals scored against them are:\n- Row 5 (portuguesa)\n- Row 7 (vasco da gama)\n- Row 8 (am\u00e9rica)\n- Row 9 (s\u00e3o paulo)\n\nThere are 4 such teams.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- **Less than 3 teams have a negative goal difference:** FALSE, as there are 4.\n- **More than 5 teams have more goals scored against them:** FALSE, as there are only 4.\n\nThe claim is FALSE because neither condition is satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified 4 teams with a negative goal difference (portuguesa, vasco da gama, am\u00e9rica, s\u00e3o paulo).
