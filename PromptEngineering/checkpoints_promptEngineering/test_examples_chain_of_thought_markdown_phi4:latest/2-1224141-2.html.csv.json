None have higher than `h78`.\n\nThe ship with the highest pennant number is **fame**.\n\n### Step 2: Check Launch Date for Ship with Highest Pennant Number\n\n- Look at the launch date for `fame`:\n  - `fame` was launched on `28 june 1934`.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Ship with Lowest Pennant Number\n\n- From the table:\n  - The ship `faulknor (flotilla leader)` has a pennant number of `h62`.\n  - Check other ships for lower numbers.
