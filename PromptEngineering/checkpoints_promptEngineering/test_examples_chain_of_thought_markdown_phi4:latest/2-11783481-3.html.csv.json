He has zero yards.\n     2. His longest run (long) is also zero.\n     3. This occurred with only five carries.\n\n3. **Verify \"Zero Yards\":**\n   - Look at the column labeled \"yards\" for Andy Kelly:\n     - Cell: `5`th row, `yards` = `0`\n   - The claim states he has zero yards, which matches the table data.\n\n4. **Verify \"Long is Zero\":**\n   - Check the column labeled \"long\" for Andy Kelly:\n     - Cell: `5`th row, `long` = `0`\n   - The claim states his longest run is zero, which also matches the table data.\n\n5. **Verify \"Only Five Carries\":**\n   - Look at the column labeled \"car\" for Andy Kelly:\n     - Cell: `5`th row, `car` = `5`\n   - The claim states he had five carries, which again matches the table data.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - All parts of the claim are verified against the table data and found to be true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the claim about Andy Kelly's performance is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row for 'andy kelly' in the table shows that he had zero yards, a longest run of zero, and five carries.
