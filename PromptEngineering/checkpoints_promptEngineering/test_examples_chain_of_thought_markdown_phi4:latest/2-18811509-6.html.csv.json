    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the score for Tom Watson is 206\" is true or false, we need to examine the table provided.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Locate the Row for Tom Watson:**\n   - We look at the `place` column to find the entry corresponding to \"Tom Watson\". According to the table, he is listed in row 1 with a place of \"1\".\n\n2. **Check the Player Name:**\n   - In row 1 under the `player` column, it confirms that the player's name is indeed \"Tom Watson\".\n\n3. **Verify the Score Calculation:**\n   - The score for Tom Watson is given as \"65 + 70 + 71 = 206\". We need to verify this calculation:\n     - Calculate \\(65 + 70 + 71\\):\n       \\[\n       65 + 70 = 135\n       \\]\n       \\[\n       135 + 71 = 206\n       \\]\n\n4. **Compare with the Claimed Score:**\n   - The calculated score matches the value stated in the table (206), which is exactly what the claim states.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since both the table and our calculation confirm that Tom Watson's score is 206, the claim is true.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row index 1:\n  - Column `player`: \"Tom Watson\"\n  - Column `score`: \"65 + 70 + 71 = 206\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, locate Tom Watson in the table under the 'place' column, which is row 1.
