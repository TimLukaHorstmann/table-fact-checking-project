    "resp": "To determine the truthfulness of the claim, we need to examine the attendance figures for each game listed in the table and check which games have an attendance over 70,000.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Attendance Data:**\n   - We will focus on the \"attendance\" column to evaluate the claim.\n   \n2. **Evaluate Each Game's Attendance:**\n   - **17 September 2008 vs. Villarreal (h):** \n     - Attendance = 74,944\n     - Over 70,000: Yes\n   - **30 September 2008 vs. Aalborg BK (a):**\n     - Attendance = 10,346\n     - Over 70,000: No\n   - **21 October 2008 vs. Celtic (h):** \n     - Attendance = 74,655\n     - Over 70,000: Yes\n   - **5 November 2008 vs. Celtic (a):**\n     - Attendance = 58,903\n     - Over 70,000: No\n   - **25 November 2008 vs. Villarreal (a):** \n     - Attendance = 22,529\n     - Over 70,000: No\n   - **10 December 2008 vs. Aalborg BK (h):**\n     - Attendance = 74,382\n     - Over 70,000: Yes\n\n3. **Count Games with Attendance over 70,000:**\n   - From the evaluations above:\n     - Games with attendance over 70,000 are on dates: \n       - 17 September 2008\n       - 21 October 2008\n       - 10 December 2008\n\n4. **Compare to Claimed Dates:**\n   - The claim states that games on \"30 September 2008,\" \"5 November 2008,\" and \"25 November 2008\" have attendance over 70,000.\n   - Based on our evaluation:\n     - None of these dates have attendance figures over 70,000.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim is incorrect as none of the specified dates in the claim meet the condition of having an attendance over 70,000.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Attendance for each game (row indices and column \"attendance\"):\n  - Row index 0: 74,944\n  - Row index 1: 10,346\n  - Row index 2: 74,655\n  - Row index 3: 58,903\n  - Row index 4: 22,529\n  - Row index 5: 74,382\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that three specific games have attendance over 70,000.
