    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about game 40 having a high assist of Eric Gordon (6) is true or false, we need to examine the relevant row for game 40 in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Game 40:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to \"game\" number 40.\n   - The relevant row in the markdown table is:\n     ```\n     |     40 | january 19 | minnesota     | l 86 - 94 (ot)   | eric gordon (25)                  | deandre jordan (10)                             | mardy collins (8)             | staples center 14399           | 9 - 31   |\n     ```\n\n2. **Examine the \"high assists\" column:**\n   - Check the value in the \"high assists\" column for game 40.\n   - The entry is \"mardy collins (8)\".\n\n3. **Determine if Eric Gordon had a high assist:**\n   - According to the data, Mardy Collins had 8 assists, which is recorded as the highest number of assists for that game.\n   - Eric Gordon does not appear in the \"high assists\" column for this game; thus, he did not have a high assist.\n\n4. **Verify against the claim:**\n   - The claim states that Eric Gordon had a high assist of 6 in game 40.\n   - Since Mardy Collins is listed as having the highest assists with 8 and there is no mention of Eric Gordon having 6 or any number of assists, the claim is false.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the information from the table, the claim about Eric Gordon's high assist in game 40 being 6 is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Game 40 corresponds to a match against Minnesota with a final score of 86-94 (OT). The 'high assists' for this game are recorded as Mardy Collins (8), indicating he had the highest number of assists. Eric Gordon is not mentioned in the 'high assists' column, and therefore did not have the high assist value claimed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
