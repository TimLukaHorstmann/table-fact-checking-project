Let's analyze the table based on the given claim:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Series Number**:  \n   The claim concerns \"series number 39.\" According to the table, this corresponds to the row where the `series` column is 39.\n\n2. **Locate the Row for Series 39**:\n   - In the table, find the row with the series number 39.\n   - The relevant row is:  \n     |   series |   season | title      | directed by :   | written by :       | original airdate |\n     |---------:|---------:|:-----------|:----------------|:--------------------|:-----------------|\n     |       39 |       13 | flying solo| michael lembeck | leslie rieder       | january 7 , 1991 |\n\n3. **Examine the \"Directed by\" Column**:  \n   - The claim mentions Michael Lembeck as a writer, but in this context, we're checking if he directed or wrote.\n   - According to the row for series 39, \"directed by\" is indeed listed as Michael Lembeck.\n\n4. **Examine the \"Written by\" Column**:\n   - For series number 39, the \"written by\" column lists \"leslie rieder.\"\n   - This indicates that Leslie Rieder was responsible for writing this episode, not Michael Lembeck.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   - The claim specifically states that series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck.\n   - Based on the table data, Michael Lembeck directed the episode but did not write it; he was credited as a writer in other episodes but not for series number 39.\n   \n### Final Answer\n\n- **Chain of Thought**:  \n  We examined the row corresponding to series number 39 and found that while Michael Lembeck directed this episode, Leslie Rieder wrote it. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n- **Relevant Cells**:\n  - For Series: `{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"series\"}`\n  - For Directed By: `{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"directed by :\"}`\n  - For Written By: `{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"written by :\"}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined the row corresponding to series number 39 and found that while Michael Lembeck directed this episode, Leslie Rieder wrote it.
