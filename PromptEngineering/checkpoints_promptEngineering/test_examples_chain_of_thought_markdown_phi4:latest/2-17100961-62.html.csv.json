    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"a Michigan State player was drafted in the third round\" is true or false, we need to examine the table for any entries where both the college is \"michigan state\" and the draft round is 3.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns**: The relevant columns from the table are `round`, `college`, and `name`.\n\n2. **Examine Each Row**:\n   - **Row 1**: \n     - `round`: 1\n     - `college`: michigan state\n     - This row does not satisfy the condition because it is in the first round, not the third.\n   \n   - **Row 2**:\n     - `round`: 3\n     - `college`: southern california\n     - This row does not match \"michigan state\" for college.\n\n   - **Row 3**:\n     - `round`: 6\n     - `college`: texas a&m\n     - This row neither matches the third round nor \"michigan state\".\n\n   - **Row 4**:\n     - `round`: 7\n     - `college`: texas\n     - Again, this does not match the criteria.\n\n   - **Row 5**:\n     - `round`: 8\n     - `college`: florida\n     - This row does not meet the conditions.\n\n   - **Row 6**:\n     - `round`: 9\n     - `college`: baylor\n     - This does not match either condition.\n\n   - **Row 7**:\n     - `round`: 10\n     - `college`: bowling green\n     - This row is irrelevant to our criteria.\n\n   - **Row 8**:\n     - `round`: 11\n     - `college`: jacksonville state\n     - No match for either condition here.\n\n   - **Row 9**:\n     - `round`: 12\n     - `college`: nevada - las vegas\n     - This row also does not meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: After examining all rows, there is no entry where a player from \"michigan state\" was drafted in the third round.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The claim is FALSE.\n\n5. **Relevant Cells**: Since we found that no row satisfies both conditions (round = 3 and college = michigan state), only the cells related to \"michigan state\" and any third-round entries are relevant for verification purposes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Examine each row of the table to find if there is a player from 'michigan state' drafted in the third round. No such entry exists.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
