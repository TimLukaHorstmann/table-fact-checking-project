Thus, the claim about his highest margin of victory being 14 strokes remains unverifiable from this dataset alone.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table was examined for any mention of Johnny Miller as a winner or runner-up.

    "resp": "To determine if the claim \"at&t pebble beach national pro - be the only tournament Johnny Miller never play\" is true or false, we need to analyze the table data for any mention of Johnny Miller and his participation in tournaments.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Examine Table Entries:**\n   - We have a list of golf tournaments from 1971 to 1994.\n   - For each tournament, information includes the date, tournament name, winning score, margin of victory, and runner-up(s).\n\n2. **Identify Mentions of Johnny Miller:**\n   - We need to check if Johnny Miller is mentioned as either a winner or a runner-up in any of these tournaments.\n\n3. **Check Specific Tournaments:**\n   - The claim specifically mentions \"at&t pebble beach national pro-am.\" We will first look for entries with this tournament name.\n   - There are two instances:\n     1. January 11, 1987, with a winning score of -10 and Payne Stewart as the runner-up.\n     2. February 6, 1994, with a winning score of -7 and runner-ups being Jeff Maggert, Corey Pavin, and Tom Watson.\n\n   - In both instances, Johnny Miller is not listed among the winners or runners-up.\n\n4. **Check All Other Tournaments:**\n   - We need to verify if Johnny Miller appears in any other tournament as a winner or runner-up.\n   - Upon examining each row of the table:\n     - There are no mentions of Johnny Miller being a winner or runner-up in any of the listed tournaments from 1971 to 1994.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Johnny Miller is not mentioned at all in the table as participating (either winning or as a runner-up) in any tournament, it implies he did not play in these tournaments.\n   - The claim specifies \"at&t pebble beach national pro-am\" and states it should be the only one Johnny Miller never played. Given that there are no mentions of his participation anywhere, this condition holds true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table lists various golf tournaments from 1971 to 1994.
