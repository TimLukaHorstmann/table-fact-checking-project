    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the respect party earn 4.5% more of the share of the vote than left list\" is true or false, let's go through the following reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify Share of Vote for Respect Party:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the \"respect\" party.\n   - From the table, the \"respect\" party has a share of 2.4%.\n\n2. **Identify Share of Vote for Left List:**\n   - Locate the row corresponding to the \"left list.\"\n   - From the table, the \"left list\" has a share of 0.9%.\n\n3. **Calculate Difference in Share of Votes:**\n   - Subtract the share of votes for the left list from that of the respect party.\n   - Calculation: \\(2.4\\% - 0.9\\% = 1.5\\%\\).\n\n4. **Compare Calculated Difference to Claimed Difference:**\n   - The claim states that the \"respect\" party has 4.5% more of the share of the vote than the \"left list.\"\n   - Our calculated difference is 1.5%, which does not match the claimed difference of 4.5%.\n\nBased on these steps, the claim is false because the actual difference in the share of votes between the respect party and the left list is only 1.5%, not 4.5%.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify the share of vote for 'respect' (2.4%) and 'left list' (0.9%).
