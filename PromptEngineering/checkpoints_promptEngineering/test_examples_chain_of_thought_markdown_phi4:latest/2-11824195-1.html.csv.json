Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Row for Week 6**: \n   - Locate the row where the \"week\" column has the value 6. This corresponds to the sixth row in the table.\n\n2. **Check the Attendance for Week 6**:\n   - In the sixth row, find the value under the \"attendance\" column. According to the table, this value is 33057.\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that a crowd of 33057 attended the week 6 game.\n   - Since the attendance for week 6 is indeed 33057, as confirmed by checking the relevant cell in the table, the claim matches the data provided.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the examination of the table, the claim is accurate.\n\nThe final answer is TRUE.
