There is an artist with a non-empty album title listed.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Rows After 2005**:\n   - We need to focus on rows where the `year` column has a value greater than 2005.\n   - From the table, these years are 2010.\n\n2. **Check Album Titles for Non-Empty Entries**:\n   - For each row identified in step 1, check if the `album` column contains any text other than \"n / a\" or is empty.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Relevant Row**:\n\n   - **Row 5 (Year: 2010)**:\n     - Artist: pixie lott\n     - Album: turn it up\n     - This album title is not \"n / a\" and is non-empty, so it qualifies.\n\n   - **Row 6 (Year: 2010)**:\n     - Artist: perry mystique\n     - Album: n / a\n     - This entry does not qualify as the album title is \"n / a\".\n\n4. **Determine if There Is Exactly One Artist**:\n   - From the evaluation, only pixie lott (Row 5) has a non-empty album title after 2005.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- There is exactly one artist with a non-empty album title listed after 2005: pixie lott.\n- Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nThe relevant cells are those that pertain to the artist \"pixie lott\" in Row 5:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where the year is greater than 2005.\",\n    \"Check if these rows have a non-empty album title.\",\n    \"Row 5 (Year: 2010) has artist pixie lott with album 'turn it up', which is valid.\",\n    \"Row 6 (Year: 2010) has artist perry mystique with album 'n / a', which is not valid.\",\n    \"Only one artist, pixie lott, meets the criteria.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
