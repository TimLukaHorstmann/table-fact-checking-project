    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about Ryan Farquhar having no time listed for Tuesday, June 2nd, is true or false, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Rider**: Locate Ryan Farquhar's entry in the table. He is ranked 12th.\n\n2. **Verify Motorcycle Type**: Confirm that Ryan Farquhar is indeed riding a 1000cc Kawasaki. The table indicates \"kawasaki\" as his motorcycle type, and it specifies \"1000cc.\"\n\n3. **Check the Date**: Identify the column corresponding to Tuesday, June 2nd. According to the table headers, this is the second column.\n\n4. **Examine Ryan Farquhar's Time for June 2nd**: Look at the cell in the row where Ryan Farquhar is listed (row 12) and the column for June 2nd.\n\n5. **Determine if \"No Time\" is Listed**: Verify whether the entry for this date is \"-- no time.\"\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- Ryan Farquhar is in row 12.\n- He rides a 1000cc Kawasaki.\n- The column for June 2nd is labeled as \"tue 2 june.\"\n- In row 12 and column \"tue 2 june,\" the entry is \"18'36.60 121.644 mph.\"\n\nSince Ryan Farquhar has a recorded time for Tuesday, June 2nd, the claim that he has no time listed for this date is false.\n\nHere is the JSON output with the reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Ryan Farquhar is ranked 12th and rides a 1000cc Kawasaki.
