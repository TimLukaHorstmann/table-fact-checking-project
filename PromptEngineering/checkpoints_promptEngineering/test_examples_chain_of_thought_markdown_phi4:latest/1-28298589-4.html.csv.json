    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"the home team win all of the games played on the day listed\" is true or false, we need to examine each game played on September 11th and check the result column for each entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Games Played on September 11:**\n   - We focus only on the rows where the date is \"september 11\".\n\n2. **Examine Results for Each Game:**\n   - For each game, check the 'result' column to see if the home team won (indicated by 'w').\n\n3. **Game-by-Game Analysis:**\n\n   - **Row 2:** \n     - Date: September 11\n     - Result: l 14 - 38 (South Florida vs. No. 8 Florida)\n     - Home Team: Florida\n     - Outcome: Florida won, indicated by 'l' for visiting team (South Florida).\n   \n   - **Row 3:** \n     - Date: September 11\n     - Result: w 40 - 7 (Indiana State vs. Cincinnati)\n     - Home Team: Cincinnati\n     - Outcome: Cincinnati won, indicated by 'w' for home team.\n   \n   - **Row 4:** \n     - Date: September 11\n     - Result: w 62 - 3 (Texas Southern vs. Connecticut)\n     - Home Team: Connecticut\n     - Outcome: Connecticut won, indicated by 'w' for home team.\n   \n   - **Row 5:** \n     - Date: September 11\n     - Result: w 38 - 16 (New Hampshire vs. Pittsburgh)\n     - Home Team: Pittsburgh\n     - Outcome: Pittsburgh won, indicated by 'w' for home team.\n   \n   - **Row 6:** \n     - Date: September 11\n     - Result: w 23 - 13 (Eastern Kentucky vs. Louisville)\n     - Home Team: Louisville\n     - Outcome: Louisville won, indicated by 'w' for home team.\n\n4. **Identify Any Losses by Home Teams:**\n   - All games except the first one listed on September 11 show a win for the home team.\n   - In row 2, Florida (home team) wins, but the result is recorded as 'l' for the visiting team, which confirms the home team's victory.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Every game played on September 11th results in a win for the home team.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each game played on September 11th and checked if the home team won.
