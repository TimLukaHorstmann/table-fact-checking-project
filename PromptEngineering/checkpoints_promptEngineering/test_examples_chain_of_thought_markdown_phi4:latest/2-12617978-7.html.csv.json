    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: The claim states, \"the most amount of money request be tie at 20000 in 2006 's season of the dragons' den\". This implies that the highest amount requested by entrepreneurs in a single episode was $200,000.\n\n2. **Identifying the Relevant Column**: We need to focus on the column labeled \"money requested\" to identify the amounts requested in each episode.\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Episode**:\n   - Episode 1: James Seddon requested \u00a375,000.\n   - Episode 2: Gary Taylor requested \u00a3200,000.\n   - Episode 3: Matthew Hazell requested \u00a3100,000.\n   - Episode 4: Ian Chamings requested \u00a3150,000.\n   - Episode 5: Richard Lee & Daren Duraidi requested \u00a3150,000.\n   - Episode 6: Stephen Bellis initially requested \u00a350,000 (but received \u00a365,000).\n   - Episode 7: Peter Sesay requested \u00a3100,000.\n   - Episode 8: Ian Daintith & Richard Adams requested \u00a3200,000.\n\n4. **Finding the Maximum Requested Amount**:\n   - The highest amount requested is \u00a3200,000, which appears in both Episode 2 and Episode 8.\n\n5. **Checking for a Tie**: \n   - A tie at the maximum amount means more than one episode has the same highest request.\n   - Episodes 2 and 8 both have requests of \u00a3200,000.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is true because there is indeed a tie for the most money requested, with two episodes having requests of \u00a3200,000.\n\nNow, let's compile this reasoning into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states that the highest amount requested in 2006 was \u00a3200,000 and it ties at this amount.\",\n    \"Focus on the 'money requested' column to find the amounts for each episode.\",\n    \"List of requests: Episode 1 - \u00a375,000; Episode 2 - \u00a3200,000; Episode 3 - \u00a3100,000; Episode 4 - \u00a3150,000; Episode 5 - \u00a3150,000; Episode 6 - \u00a350,000 (received \u00a365,000); Episode 7 - \u00a3100,000; Episode 8 - \u00a3200,000.\",\n    \"Identify the maximum requested amount: \u00a3200,000 in Episodes 2 and 8.\",\n    \"Confirm that there is a tie at the highest request of \u00a3200,000.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Richard Farleigh invests the most out of the dragons in 2006's season of Dragons' Den\" is true or false, we need to examine each episode where Richard Farleigh appears as an investor and tally his total investment amount.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify Episodes with Richard Farleigh:**\n   - From the table, locate the rows where \"richard farleigh\" appears in the \"investing dragon (s)\" column.\n   - Episode 1: Richard Farleigh is listed as one of the investing dragons for James Seddon's pitch for Eggxactly, requesting \u00a375,000. The exact amount invested by Richard Farleigh is not specified here.\n   - Episode 3: Richard Farleigh is the sole investor for Matthew Hazell's First Light Solutions, which requested \u00a3100,000. Since he is alone in this episode, we can assume he likely invested the full amount unless stated otherwise.\n\n2. **Determine Total Investment by Richard Farleigh:**\n   - For Episode 1, without specific allocation details, we cannot determine his exact investment.\n   - In Episode 3, he invests \u00a3100,000 since there is no co-investor mentioned.\n\n3. **Assess Other Dragons' Investments for Comparison:**\n   - We need to evaluate if any other dragon invested more than Richard Farleigh across the season:\n     - Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis frequently appear together, suggesting they might have significant combined investments.\n     - Reviewing their episodes:\n       - Episode 2: They jointly invest in Gary Taylor's Alpine Cleaning, requesting \u00a3200,000. The exact split is not specified.\n       - Episode 4: Invest in Ian Chamings' Mixalbum for \u00a3150,000.\n       - Episode 6: They co-invested in Stephen Bellis's Nuts Poker League, which requested \u00a350,000 but received \u00a365,000.\n       - Episode 8: Invest in Ian Daintith & Richard Adams's Coin Metrics for \u00a3200,000.\n\n4. **Calculate Potential Maximum Investment by Other Dragons:**\n   - Since specific investment splits are not provided except for Stephen Bellis\u2019s case, assume possible maximums when there is no split mentioned:\n     - Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis could each have invested up to half of the requested amount in episodes where they co-invested unless otherwise specified.\n     - For example, in Episode 2 and 8, if we consider each dragon investing half (a reasonable assumption due to lack of details), they each might invest \u00a3100,000 per episode.\n\n5. **Compare Richard Farleigh\u2019s Investment with Others:**\n   - Total known investment by Richard Farleigh is \u00a3100,000 from Episode 3.\n   - Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis likely have higher investments in individual episodes (e.g., potentially up to \u00a3100,000 each for Episodes 2 or 8).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the table and logical assumptions regarding shared investments between co-investors, Richard Farleigh's known total investment (\u00a3100,000) does not exceed the potential maximum investment by Deborah Meaden or Theo Paphitis in any single episode.\n\n- **Final Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
