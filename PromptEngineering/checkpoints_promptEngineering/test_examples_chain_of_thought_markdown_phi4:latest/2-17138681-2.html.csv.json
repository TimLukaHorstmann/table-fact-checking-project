    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to analyze the given table and verify the information related to the specified condition: \"there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating/share 3.2 / 8.\"\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Row with Rating/Share 3.2 / 8**:\n   - We need to find the row in which the `rating / share (18 - 49)` column has the value \"3.2 / 8\".\n   - According to the table, this condition is met at the seventh row: `7.2 | 11 | 3.2 / 8`.\n\n2. **Check the Viewers for This Row**:\n   - In the seventh row, check the `viewers (millions)` column to see how many viewers were recorded.\n   - The value in this column is `12.42`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   - The claim states there should be more than 12.42 million viewers for an entry with a rating/share of 3.2 / 8.\n   - Since the row that matches the condition \"rating/share 3.2 / 8\" has exactly 12.42 million viewers, not more, the claim is FALSE.\n\n4. **Verify No Other Rows Meet the Condition**:\n   - Re-examine all other rows to ensure no additional entries meet the rating/share condition.\n   - No other row in the table has a `rating / share (18 - 49)` value of \"3.2 / 8\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - There are no entries with more than 12.42 million viewers for the specified rating/share, thus confirming the claim is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify the row where 'rating/ share (18 - 49)' equals '3.2 / 8'.
