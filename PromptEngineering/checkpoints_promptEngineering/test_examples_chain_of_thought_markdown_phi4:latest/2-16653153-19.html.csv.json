We need to find this date in the \"date\" column.\n   \n2. **Locate the Row for December 4**:\n   - Scan through the \"date\" column to identify the row with the date \"4 december\".\n\n3. **Check the Venue for This Date**:\n   - Once the row is located, check the \"venue\" column to see if it matches \"north shore events centre\".\n\n4. **Verify the Claim Components**:\n   - The claim mentions a game being played on December 4 at the North Shore Events Centre. Both components need to be true for the entire claim to be TRUE.\n\n### Verification:\n\n- **Row Identification**: \n  - In the table, the row with \"date\" as \"4 december\" is found.\n  \n- **Venue Check**:\n  - For the row on December 4, the \"venue\" column shows \"north shore events centre\".\n\nSince both conditions (the date and the venue) match the claim, the statement is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- The relevant cells for this verification are:\n  - Row index: 2\n    - Column name: \"date\", Value: \"4 december\"\n    - Column name: \"venue\", Value: \"north shore events centre\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
