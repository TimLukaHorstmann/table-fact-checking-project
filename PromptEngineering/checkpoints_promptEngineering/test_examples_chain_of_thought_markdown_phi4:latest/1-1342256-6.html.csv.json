We need to verify if any of the republican incumbents were elected before 1940 or if 1940 is indeed the earliest.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Districts with a Republican Incumbent:**\n   - California 2: harry lane englebright, first elected in 1926.\n   - California 4: thomas rolph, first elected in 1940.\n   - California 9: bertrand w gearhart, first elected in 1934.\n\n2. **First Elected Years for Republican Incumbents:**\n   - Harry lane englebright (California 2) was first elected in 1926.\n   - Thomas rolph (California 4) was first elected in 1940.\n   - Bertrand w gearhart (California 9) was first elected in 1934.\n\n3. **Earliest Election Year for Republicans:**\n   - The earliest year among the Republican incumbents is 1926, from Harry lane englebright of California 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since there is a republican incumbent who was first elected before 1940 (specifically in 1926), the claim that \"republican be the party with first elect be 1940\" is false.
