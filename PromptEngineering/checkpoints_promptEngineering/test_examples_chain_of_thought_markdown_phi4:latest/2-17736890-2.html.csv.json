The goal is to identify which game had the highest attendance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column**:  \n   We are interested in the \"attendance\" column since it contains the data needed to evaluate the claim about game attendances.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Data**:\n   - Game 1: Coventry City vs Aldershot Town - 9293\n   - Game 2: Milton Keynes Dons vs Norwich City - 6261\n   - Game 3: Wycombe Wanderers vs Birmingham City - 2735\n   - Game 4: Brighton & Hove Albion vs Barnet - 2571\n   - Game 5: Gillingham vs Colchester United - 2566\n   - Game 6: Southend United vs Cheltenham Town (including extra time) - 2998\n   - Game 7: Swansea City vs Brentford - 5366\n   - Game 8: Luton Town vs Plymouth Argyle - 2682\n   - Game 9: Exeter City vs Southampton - 6471\n   - Game 10: Watford vs Bristol Rovers - 5574\n   - Game 11: Bournemouth vs Cardiff City - 3399\n   - Game 12: Bristol City vs Peterborough United - 5684\n   - Game 13: Charlton Athletic vs Yeovil Town - 6239\n   - Game 14: Millwall vs Northampton Town - 3525\n   - Game 15: Swindon Town vs Queens Park Rangers - 7230\n   - Game 16: Crystal Palace vs Hereford United - 3094\n   - Game 17: Dagenham & Redbridge vs Reading - 2360\n   - Game 18: Ipswich Town vs Leyton Orient - 10477\n\n3. **Compare Attendance Figures**:\n   We need to find the maximum attendance figure from the extracted data.\n   \n   - The highest number among these figures is 10477, which corresponds to the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Claim**:\n   The claim states that \"the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient have the highest attendance of the list.\" Based on our analysis, this statement is correct as 10477 is indeed the highest attendance recorded in the table.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:  \n   Since the attendance figure for the game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient is the highest among all listed games, the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Row 18, Column \"attendance\" with value 10477\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We examined each row's attendance data to find the maximum figure.
