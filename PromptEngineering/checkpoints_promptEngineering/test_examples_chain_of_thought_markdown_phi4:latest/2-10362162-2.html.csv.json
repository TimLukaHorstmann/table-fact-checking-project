    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the game on November 21, 1993, having the lowest attendance is true or false, we need to examine each entry's attendance figure in the table.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Claimed Date and Attendance:**\n   - The claim specifies that the game on November 21, 1993, had an attendance of 40,848.\n   - We will verify if this is indeed the lowest attendance compared to other games listed.\n\n2. **List All Attendances for Comparison:**\n   - Week 1 (September 5, 1993): Attendance = 44,120\n   - Week 2 (September 12, 1993): Attendance = 57,921\n   - Week 4 (September 26, 1993): Attendance = 61,746\n   - Week 5 (October 3, 1993): Attendance = 63,071\n   - Week 6 (October 10, 1993): Attendance = 54,215\n   - Week 8 (October 25, 1993): Attendance = 64,677\n   - Week 9 (October 31, 1993): Attendance = 53,428\n   - Week 10 (November 7, 1993): Attendance = 55,527\n   - **Week 12 (November 21, 1993): Attendance = 40,848** (Claimed lowest)\n   - Week 11 (November 14, 1993): Attendance = 67,329\n   - Week 13 (November 28, 1993): Attendance = 53,030\n   - Week 14 (December 5, 1993): Attendance = 63,216\n   - Week 15 (December 12, 1993): Attendance = 63,321\n   - Week 16 (December 19, 1993): Attendance = 54,773\n   - Week 17 (December 26, 1993): Attendance = 59,236\n   - Week 18 (December 31, 1993): Attendance = 42,836\n\n3. **Identify the Minimum Attendance:**\n   - Comparing all attendance figures listed above, the lowest value is 40,848 from week 12.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The game on November 21, 1993, indeed has the lowest attendance in the table with an attendance of 40,848.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- Week 12 (November 21, 1993): Attendance = 40,848\n- All other weeks and their attendances are relevant for comparison but do not have a lower attendance than week 12.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claimed date and its corresponding attendance.\",\n    \"List all attendances from each game in the table to compare.\",\n    \"Determine which attendance is the lowest among all listed games.\",\n    \"Confirm that November 21, 1993, has the lowest attendance of 40,848.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
