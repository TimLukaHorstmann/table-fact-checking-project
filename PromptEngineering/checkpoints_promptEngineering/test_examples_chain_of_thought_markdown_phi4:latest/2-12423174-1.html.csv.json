    "resp": "To determine whether the claim about the table is true or false, we need to analyze the specific match involving \"as porto novo\" against \"victoria club mokanda.\" Here are the steps for evaluating the claim:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Match:**  \n   - Look through the table to find the row where \"team 1\" is \"as porto novo\" and \"team 2\" is \"victoria club mokanda.\"\n\n2. **Check Aggregate Score (agg):**  \n   - The claim states that \"as porto novo score[d] 3 point[s]\" against \"victoria club mokanda.\" This suggests an aggregate score of 3-0 or 1-2, etc., where the total goals scored by as porto novo should be 3.\n\n3. **Verify 1st and 2nd Leg Scores:**  \n   - Check both the \"1st leg\" and \"2nd leg\" columns for the corresponding row to see how many goals as porto novo scored in each game.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Goals Scored by as porto novo:**\n   - Sum up the goals from both legs to confirm if their total equals 3.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. Locate the row with \"as porto novo\" and \"victoria club mokanda\":\n   - Found in Row 4, where \"team 1\" is \"as porto novo\" and \"team 2\" is \"victoria club mokanda.\"\n\n2. Check the aggregate score (agg):\n   - The aggregate score for this match is listed as \"0 - 3.\" This means victoria club mokanda scored a total of 3 goals, while as porto novo scored 0.\n\n3. Verify the individual leg scores:\n   - In the \"1st leg,\" as porto novo scored 0 against victoria club mokanda.\n   - In the \"2nd leg,\" as porto novo again scored 0.\n\n4. Calculate Total Goals Scored by as porto novo:\n   - Total goals = 0 (from the 1st leg) + 0 (from the 2nd leg) = 0\n\nBased on this analysis, the total number of points or goals scored by \"as porto novo\" against \"victoria club mokanda\" is 0, not 3.\n\nThus, the claim that \"as porto novo score[d] 3 point[s]\" against \"victoria club mokanda\" is FALSE. \n\nThe relevant cells from the table are:\n- Row 4, Column \"team 1\"\n- Row 4, Column \"agg\"\n- Row 4, Column \"team 2\"\n- Row 4, Column \"1st leg\"\n- Row 4, Column \"2nd leg\"\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The row with 'as porto novo' against 'victoria club mokanda' shows an aggregate score of 0 - 3.
