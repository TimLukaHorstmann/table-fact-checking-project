The position is indicated in the first column.\n   - We need to find the row where the position is 5.\n\n3. **Extract Information from the Relevant Cell**:\n   - In the row where the position is 5 (which corresponds to \"mackenzie\"), we look at the value in the \"difference\" column.\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that the goal difference for fifth position should be 0.\n   - We need to check if the value in the \"difference\" column for position 5 is indeed 0.\n\n5. **Verify and Conclude**:\n   - From the table, the row for position 5 (\"mackenzie\") has a goal difference of 0.\n\nBased on these steps, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant column 'difference' for goal difference.\",\n    \"Locate the row where position is 5, which corresponds to team 'mackenzie'.\",\n    \"Extract the value from the 'difference' column for this row.\",\n    \"The value is 0, matching the claim that the goal difference for fifth position is 0.\",\n    \"Thus, the claim is true.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
