However, since no specific team information is given for each player, we assume all entries are potentially relevant unless otherwise specified.\n\n### Counting Transfers:\n\n- **Summer Transfers:**\n  - van der vaart (row 1)\n  - javi garc\u00eda (row 2)\n  - de la red (row 3)\n  - garay (row 4)\n  - gonz\u00e1lez (row 5, loan return)\n  - ury garc\u00eda (row 6, loan return)\n  - agus (row 7, loan return)\n  - granero (row 8, loan return)\n\n  Total Summer Transfers = 8\n\n- **Winter Transfers:**\n  - huntelaar (row 9)\n  - lass (row 10)\n  - parejo (row 11, loan return)\n  - faubert (row 12)\n\n  Total Winter Transfers = 4\n\n### Comparison:\n\n- Difference = Summer Transfers (8) - Winter Transfers (4) = 4\n\nThe claim states there should be 6 more summer transfers than winter transfers.
