    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true, we need to evaluate if there is an album listed in the table that was released under the same label across two different regions.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim states that \"the album be release on the same label in 2 region\". We are looking for a situation where an album has been released in at least two different regions with the same label.\n\n2. **Identify Unique Labels and Regions**:\n   - Review each row to identify unique labels.\n   - Check if any of these labels appear more than once across different regions.\n\n3. **Examine Each Label**:\n   - **Toshiba EMI**: \n     - Region: Japan\n     - Date: 30 July 2008\n     - Only one entry for this label, so it cannot satisfy the claim.\n   \n   - **Parlophone**:\n     - Regions: United Kingdom and Ireland (2 entries)\n     - Dates: 4 August 2008 and 11 August 2008\n     - This label appears twice but in the same region (United Kingdom and Ireland), so it does not satisfy the claim for different regions.\n   \n   - **Because Music**:\n     - Region: France\n     - Date: 4 September 2008\n     - Only one entry, so it cannot satisfy the claim.\n\n   - **Astralwerks**:\n     - Regions: United States (2 entries)\n     - Dates: 13 January 2009\n     - This label appears twice but in the same region (United States), so it does not satisfy the claim for different regions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - No single label is associated with releases in two different regions according to the data provided.\n   \n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The claim is FALSE because there are no instances of an album being released under the same label across two different regions.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Parlophone entries: Rows 2 and 3 (same region, United Kingdom and Ireland)\n- Astralwerks entries: Rows 5 and 6 (same region, United States)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires an album to be released under the same label in two different regions.
