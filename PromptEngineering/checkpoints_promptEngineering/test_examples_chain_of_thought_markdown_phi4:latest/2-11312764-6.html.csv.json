This involves scanning through the \"nation\" column.\n   \n2. **Locate Relevant Rows:**\n   - Row 5: The entry is `janet thompson / warren maxwell` with a score of `194`.\n   - Row 8: The entry is `jayne torvill / christopher dean` with a score of `187.84`.\n   - Row 13: The entry is `karen barber / nicky slater` with a score of `169.74`.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Points for United Kingdom:**\n   - Sum the points from all entries corresponding to \"united kingdom\":\n     - Janet Thompson and Warren Maxwell: 194\n     - Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean: 187.84\n     - Karen Barber and Nicky Slater: 169.74\n   - Total Points = 194 + 187.84 + 169.74 = 551.58\n\n4. **Compare with Claimed Score:**\n   - The claim states that the United Kingdom finished with `187.84` points.\n   - Our calculated total is `551.58`, which differs from `187.84`.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The claim incorrectly refers to a single entry's score (Row 8) as the total score for all teams representing the \"united kingdom\".\n   - Therefore, the statement is FALSE.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 5, Column \"points\": 194\n- Row 8, Column \"points\": 187.84\n- Row 13, Column \"points\": 169.74\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, identify all entries for 'united kingdom' in the table.
