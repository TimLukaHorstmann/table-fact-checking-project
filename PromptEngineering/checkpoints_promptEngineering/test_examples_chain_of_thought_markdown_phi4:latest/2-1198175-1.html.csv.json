    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to determine if there are indeed 16 players from the table who were drafted and attended college through or via Ca Technical High School. The claim does not directly state which high school these players attended; rather, it implies they went to a particular college after attending that specific high school.\n\n**Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Claim**: We need to verify if there are 16 players who were drafted and attended college via Ca Technical High School. However, the table does not list high schools attended by these individuals\u2014only colleges.\n\n2. **Checking Draft Status**: The claim specifies that these players were \"drafted.\" Therefore, we must filter out any player listed as \"undrafted\" in the \"drafted\" column.\n\n3. **List of Undrafted Players**:\n   - Walter Clago\n   - Ben John Paolucci\n   - Pat Ivey\n   - Clarence Williams\n\n4. **Counting Drafted Players**: Excluding undrafted players, we have 15 drafted players remaining in the table.\n\n5. **Checking College Attendance via Ca Technical High School**: The claim mentions attending college through or via Ca Technical High School, but there is no such information provided about high school attendance for any player in this table. It only lists the colleges attended by these individuals.\n\n6. **Verification of Colleges**: Without information on which college graduates came specifically from Ca Technical High School (or if they even went to that high school), we cannot verify their educational path.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since there is no data provided about the players' high schools, and because we only have 15 drafted players in total\u2014not 16\u2014the claim cannot be substantiated based on the information available in this table.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires identifying 16 drafted players who attended college via Ca Technical High School. The table does not provide high school information, only college and draft status. Filtering out undrafted players leaves us with 15 drafted players.
