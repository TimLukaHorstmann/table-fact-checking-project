    "resp": "To determine whether the claim \"Beno Udrih scored the most points of any Kings player in 3 games\" is true or false, we need to analyze each game listed in the table for Beno Udrih's performance compared to other players from the Sacramento Kings.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: \n   - The \"high points\" column shows the player who scored the most points in a particular game and their respective score.\n\n2. **Filter data for Beno Udrih**:\n   - We need to identify games where Beno Udrih is mentioned as the high scorer.\n\n3. **Check each relevant row**:\n   - Game 34: Beno Udrih scored 25 points (highest in this game).\n   - Game 35: Beno Udrih and Francisco Garcia both scored 26 points (tied for highest).\n   - Game 37: Beno Udrih scored 29 points (highest in this game).\n   - Game 40: Beno Udrih scored 20 points, but Demarcus Cousins and Carl Landry also scored 8 each (not the highest).\n   - Game 41: Tyreke Evans scored 35 points (highest), not Beno Udrih.\n   - Game 44: Demarcus Cousins scored 27 points (highest), not Beno Udrih.\n\n4. **Count the games where Beno Udrih was the sole high scorer**:\n   - Game 34: Beno Udrih is the sole highest scorer.\n   - Game 37: Beno Udrih is the sole highest scorer.\n   - Game 35: Beno Udrih tied for highest, but not solely.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Beno Udrih was the sole high scorer in only 2 games (34 and 37).
