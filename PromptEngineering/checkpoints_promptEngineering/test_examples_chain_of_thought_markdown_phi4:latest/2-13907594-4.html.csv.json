    "resp": "To determine whether the claim is true or false, we need to analyze the table for specific details related to the score, date, location/attendance, and any entries after May 10.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Score in Question:**\n   - The claim mentions a score of \"5 - 4 (ot)\".\n   - From the table, we find that this score appears on row 7 with date May 10, at the Montreal Forum.\n\n2. **Verify Location/Attendance for the Score:**\n   - For the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\", the location is indeed \"montreal forum\".\n\n3. **Check for Entries After May 10:**\n   - The claim specifies that there should be another entry with this score and location after May 10.\n   - We need to examine rows beyond row 7 (May 10) to see if any match these criteria.\n\n4. **Examine Rows Beyond May 10:**\n   - The table ends at row 7, which is the date May 10.\n   - There are no additional rows or entries after May 10 in the provided table.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there are no further entries beyond May 10, it is impossible for there to be another instance of the score \"5 - 4 (ot)\" at the Montreal Forum after this date.\n   - Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n- Row 7, Column \"score\": \"5 - 4 (ot)\"\n- Row 7, Column \"location / attendance\": \"montreal forum\"\n- No additional rows beyond May 10 exist in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim requires a score of '5 - 4 (ot)' at Montreal Forum after May 10.
