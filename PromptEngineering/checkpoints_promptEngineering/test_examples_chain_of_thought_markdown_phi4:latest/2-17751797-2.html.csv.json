Specifically, we'll examine the rows in the table to find any matches that fit this criterion and determine whether Woking was involved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Claim**: The claim is specifically about Woking playing a game where they achieved their highest scoring shut out win at \"4 - 0\".\n\n2. **Identify Key Terms**:\n   - A \"shut out\" game means one team won without conceding any goals.\n   - The score of \"4 - 0\" suggests that the winning team scored four goals while the opposing team did not score.\n\n3. **Examine Woking's Match**: \n   - Locate the row for Woking in the table to find their match and score.\n   - In row 5, we see: `woking | 5 - 1 | merthyr tydfil`.\n\n4. **Check if It Matches the Criteria**:\n   - The score of \"5 - 1\" does not meet the \"4 - 0\" shut out criteria.\n\n5. **Search for Other Teams with a 4 - 0 Shut Out**:\n   - Review each row to find any game where the score is \"4 - 0\".\n   - None of the matches listed in the table show a score of \"4 - 0\".\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - Woking did not play in a match with a score of \"4 - 0\". Additionally, no such shut out games appear in the entire table.\n\n7. **Final Decision**:\n   - Since there is no evidence of Woking playing a game that ended in \"4 - 0\", and no other team achieved this shut out score either, the claim must be false.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Woking played a 'highest scoring shut out' game with a score of '4 to 0'.

We'll use the date column to identify which matches took place on the earliest available date in the table.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Earliest Date:**\n   - The dates provided are mostly either \"08/12/1990\", \"11/12/1990\", or \"12/12/1990\". \n   - Among these, \"07/12/1990\" is the earliest date.\n\n2. **Find Matches on 07/12/1990:**\n   - Look for matches with a date of \"07/12/1990\".\n   - In row 9, we have:\n     - Home team: Fulham\n     - Score: 0 - 0\n     - Away team: Cambridge United\n     - Date: 07 / 12 / 1990\n\n3. **Determine the Result for the Home Team on 07/12/1990:**\n   - On this date, the match between Fulham and Cambridge United ended in a draw (0-0).\n   - A draw means neither team won; therefore, the home team, Fulham, did not win.\n\n4. **Evaluate Other Matches on 08/12/1990:**\n   - Next earliest date is \"08/12/1990\".\n   - Review matches with this date:\n     - Row 2: Bournemouth (Home) vs Hayes (Away), Score: 1-0\n       - Home team, Bournemouth, won.\n     - Row 5: Woking (Home) vs Merthyr Tydfil (Away), Score: 5-1\n       - Home team, Woking, won.\n     - Row 11: Scunthorpe United (Home) vs Tranmere Rovers (Away), Score: 3-2\n       - Home team, Scunthorpe United, won.\n     - Row 15: Aldershot (Home) vs Maidstone United (Away), Score: 2-1\n       - Home team, Aldershot, won.\n     - Row 16: Wigan Athletic (Home) vs Hartlepool United (Away), Score: 2-0\n       - Home team, Wigan Athletic, won.\n     - Row 20: Swansea City (Home) vs Walsall (Away), Score: 2-1\n       - Home team, Swansea City, won.\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Analysis:**\n   - On the first day of the cup (\"07/12/1990\"), Fulham did not win.\n   - However, on subsequent days with matches dated \"08/12/1990\", multiple home teams (Bournemouth, Woking, Scunthorpe United, Aldershot, Wigan Athletic, Swansea City) won their games.\n\nSince the claim specifies \"on the first day of the cup,\" and no home team won on that specific date (07/12/1990), but other home teams did win on a later date (08/12/1990), the claim is **TRUE** regarding the very first day.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The earliest date in the table is '07/12/1990'.
