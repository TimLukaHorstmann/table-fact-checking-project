We start from the latest year in the table, which is 2013 and work our way back, examining each year's winner's share.\n   3. In Row 1 (year: 2013), the winner's share is 15000, which meets the condition of being greater than or equal to 15000.\n   4. In Row 2 (year: 2012), the winner's share is also 15000, which meets the condition of being greater than or equal to 15000.\n   5. We continue this process for all the remaining rows, but since we have already found a case where the condition holds true (i.e., in 2013 and 2012), there is no need to check further as the claim states \"after 2012\".\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare each winner's share from the year 2013 onwards with the value of 15000\", \"Start from the latest year and work backwards\", \"Examine each year's winner's share to see if it is greater than or equal to 15000\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n  ]\n}",
