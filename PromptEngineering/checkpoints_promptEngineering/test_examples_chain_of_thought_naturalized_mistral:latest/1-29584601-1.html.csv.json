Next, we will compare the values in the \"no in season\" column for all rows where the title matches \"knight of the drones (part 2)\".\n\n3. Find the row numbers where the title matches.

If both values are equal, then there is no 2nd lowest number and thus our answer will be FALSE. However, in this case, the values in rows 2 and 4 for \"no in season\" are 2 and 4 respectively.
