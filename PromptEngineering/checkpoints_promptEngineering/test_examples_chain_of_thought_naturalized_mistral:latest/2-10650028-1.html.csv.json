List all the rows where the position column equals 'defensive tackle'. This will include rows 3, 6, and 11.\n3. Check the round column for these rows. We can see that all three players (James Jones, Frank Conover, Elijah Austin) were drafted in different rounds (Rounds 3, 8, 12 respectively).\n4. Check which of these defensive tackles was selected last. In this case, Elijah Austin is the player with the highest round number (Round 12), meaning he was drafted last among the defensive tackles listed in the table.\n5.
