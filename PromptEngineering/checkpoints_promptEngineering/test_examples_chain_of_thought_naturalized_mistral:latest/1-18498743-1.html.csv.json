    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the countries mentioned in the claim, which are Croatia (since \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti\" translates to \"from here forever\", a title of a soap opera, and it appears twice in the table).\n\n2. Check for any other soap operas with the same title that were airing on different channels but from the same country.\n\n3. In our table, we have two rows for Croatia with the soap opera \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti\". In row 4, it is aired on nova tv and in row 5, it is aired on doma tv.\n\n4. The claim states that \"croatia air odavde do vje\u010dnosti on doma tv after they air it on nova tv\". This implies that the soap opera should be aired first on nova tv and then on doma tv.\n\n5. Looking at the start dates in rows 4 and 5, we can see that \"odavde do vje\u010dnosti\" started on nova tv before it started on doma tv.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given table and the provided claim conditions, it can be concluded that \"croatia air odavde do vje\u010dnosti on doma tv after they air it on nova tv\".\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify countries and soap operas mentioned in claim\", \"Check if any other versions of the soap opera exist for the same country\", \"Find the starting dates of the soap opera on different channels\", \"Compare the start dates to check if 'odavde do vje\u010dnosti' was aired first on nova tv and then on doma tv\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Start Date\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Start Date\"}]\n}\n```",
