Scan through the table to find the row where the opponent's name matches 'cleber luciano'. In this case, it can be found in row 12.\n3. Check if there's a time value in the same row that matches '7:57'. The column header for time is 'time', so we will look for a cell where 'row_index' equals 12 and 'column_name' equals 'time'.\n4. Inspect the value in the 'time' column of row 12, which is indeed '7:57'.\n5. Conclude that the claim is TRUE since the table indicates a match with opponent cleber luciano lasting exactly 7:57 minutes.\n\n   Here's the JSON format answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the claim and the relevant opponent\",\n       \"Scan through the table to find the row where the opponent's name matches 'cleber luciano'\",\n       \"Check if there's a time value in the same row that matches '7:57'\",\n       \"Inspect the value in the 'time' column of the found row\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\n         \"row_index\": 12,\n         \"column_name\": \"time\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Find all rows related to UFC events, since the claim involves a fight at UFC 20. This can be done by looking for the column 'event' and finding rows where the value is UFC 20 or UFC 20\\*.\n\n2. From the rows found in step 1, check the 'round' column to find fights that took place in round 1. This will help narrow down the list of potential matches.\n\n3. For each match in round 1 of a UFC event found in step 2, inspect the 'method' column to see if it mentions TKO (cut). If it does, then the claim is true; otherwise, move on to the next match.\n\n4. After checking all matches in step 3, if no match had TKO (cut) as its method, the claim is false.\n\nApplying these steps to the table:\n- There are two rows with 'event' equals to UFC 20 (rows 10 and 11). Both of them have a round of 1.\n- Row 10 has TKO (strikes) as its method, but it is not TKO (cut).\n- Row 11 has TKO (cut) as its method in the 'method' column.\n\nSo, the claim \"tko (cut) be the method in round 1 of the ufc 20 event\" is TRUE, with relevant cells:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Find rows where event equals UFC 20 or UFC 20*, filter for round 1, inspect 'method' column to see if it mentions TKO (cut).\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"event\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"round\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"method\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
