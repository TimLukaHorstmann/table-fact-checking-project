We can do this by looking for the places column and finding rows where the place is either \"jacksonville\" or \"phoenix\".\n   2. In the table, row 11 corresponds to Jacksonville (finished: 3rd, place: jacksonville) and row 2 corresponds to Phoenix (finished: 5th, place: phoenix).\n   3. Next, we need to compare the dates of these two rounds. We can do this by looking at the date column in the table.\n   4. In row 11, the date is \"march 19\" and in row 2, the date is \"january 15\". Comparing these dates shows that March 19 is later than January 15.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the rows corresponding to 'jacksonville' and 'phoenix'.\",\n    \"Compare the dates of their rounds.\",\n    \"The date for jacksonville is later than the date for phoenix.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\" }\n  ]\n}",
