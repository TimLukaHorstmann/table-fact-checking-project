    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. First, we will loop through each row in the table to check if any home team scored less than 11 points.\n   2. Start from the first row with the home team \"geelong\" and compare it against 11. The score of geelong is 89 (11.23), which is greater than 11, so we move on to the next row.\n   3. Next, check the second row with the home team \"fitzroy\". Compare its score (108) against 11. It's greater than 11, so we move on to the third row.\n   4. On the third row, the home team is \"st kilda\" with a score of 96, which is also greater than 11. Continue to the fourth row.\n   5. The fourth row has the home team \"richmond\" scoring 104, which is greater than 11, so we move on to the fifth row.\n   6. On the fifth row, the home team \"footscray\" scored 87, which is equal to 11 minus 3 (since scores are in the format of goal:behind). However, since the claim specifies that no home team should score less than 11 and not equal to 11, we treat this as a score greater than 11.\n   7. Lastly, on the sixth row, the home team \"north melbourne\" scored 71, which is less than 11, but this does not violate the claim since it's only referring to the home teams.\n\n   Since we have gone through all six rows without finding a home team that scored less than 11, the claim is TRUE.\n\n   Here is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": \"Check each row for home teams with a score less than 11.
