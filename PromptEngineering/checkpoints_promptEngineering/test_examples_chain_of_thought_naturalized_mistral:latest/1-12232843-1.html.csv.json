    "resp": "1. First, identify the season when Jamie van hooijdonk competed in the men's singles event. This can be found by scanning through the table and noting down the seasons where the mens singles champion is not 'jamie van hooijdonk'. The relevant row for this is Row 9.\n2. Next, find out the women's doubles team in that particular season (Row 9) to check if it consists of Kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey. In this row, the women's doubles team is 'kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey'.\n3. Compare the results from steps 1 and 2. Since we have found that in Season 2008 (Row 9) Jamie van hooijdonk competed in the men's singles and the women's doubles team for that season was 'kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey', it follows that there is a woman's double team consisting of Kerry ann sheppard and Carolina Harvey when Jamie van hooijdonk competes in the men's single.\n4.

Check if any of these women's doubles pairs are present when Jamie van Hooijdonk is competing in the mens singles, which can be found in the 'womens doubles' column for rows where 'mens singles' is Jamie van hooijdonk.
