So, there is 1 season whose season premiere occurred on this date.\n4. Since the total number of episodes for a season does not matter in determining if there are more than one season premiering on September 23, 2009, we can conclude that the claim about having more than 23 episodes with the September 23, 2009 premiere is FALSE.\n\nNow, here's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: 'there be more than 23 episode where the season premiere be september 23 , 2009'\",\n    \"Count the number of seasons whose season premiere occurred on September 23, 2009\",\n    \"Verify the count from the table\",\n    \"Find that only one season (Row 6) has the season premiere date of September 23, 2009\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"season premiere\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
