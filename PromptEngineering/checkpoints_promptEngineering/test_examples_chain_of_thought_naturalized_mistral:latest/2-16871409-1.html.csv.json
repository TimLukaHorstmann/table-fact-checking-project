    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, identify the season for which we need to check whether Zang Jialiang was the lead and Li Dongyan was an alternate. In the claim, it's mentioned as the 2008 wmcc.\n\n2. Scan the table to find the row that corresponds to the 2008 - 09 season or any earlier season since the event should have occurred before the Olympics (as per the sequence of events in the table). The relevant rows are: Row 4: season: 2008 - 09, and Row 3: season: 2007 - 08.\n\n3. Since we're looking for the 2008 wmcc, neither of these rows contains the event name exactly as specified in the claim (which is \"2008 wmcc\"). However, given that the events are listed chronologically and the Olympics appear to be the latest event in the table, it can be inferred that the event before the Olympics is the 2008 wmcc.\n\n4. Now, check the lead player and alternate for this inferred event (the 2008 wmcc). From Row 4, we see that for the season: 2008 - 09, the lead is zang jialiang, which matches with the claim's requirement. However, the alternate is not Li Dongyan but Chen Lu'an (Row 4).\n\n5. Since the lead player matches, we can infer that the claim \"the lead was Zang Jialiang\" is correct. However, since the alternate does not match, the claim \"and an alternate was Li Dongyan at the 2008 wmcc\" is incorrect.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the event from the claim (2008 wmcc).\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to this event.\",\n    \"Infer that the event before the Olympics is the one we're looking for (the 2008 wmcc).\",\n    \"Check the lead and alternate players for the inferred event.\",\n    \"Compare the result with the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lead\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"alternate\" }\n  ]\n}",
