    "resp": "Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the districts where the incumbent was first elected before 1924 (since the table starts from 1924). In the provided table, only Massachusetts 12 has an incumbent (James A Gallivan) who was first elected in 1914.\n\n2. Verify if there is a row in the table that indicates the re-election and unopposed status of James A Gallivan in 1914. In the provided table, since the earliest year for incumbent re-elections is 1924, we cannot find a specific row with this information about James A Gallivan. However, since he was first elected in 1914 and there is no indication of his defeat or retirement during the years between 1914 and 1924, it can be reasonably assumed that he remained as an incumbent and ran unopposed in 1914.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the districts where the incumbent was first elected before 1924\", \"Verify if there is a row in the table that indicates the re-election and unopposed status of James A Gallivan in 1914\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"incumbent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
