The opponent or second team in the row is the away team.\n\n2. Next, we will look for rows where the home team is St Kilda. We see three such instances: Row 2, Row 3, and Row 5.\n\n3. For each of these rows, we compare the listed away team with Melbourne to check if Melbourne is indeed the away team when the home team is St Kilda.\n\n   - In Row 2, the away team is St Kilda, not Melbourne. So it does not meet our condition.\n   - In Row 3, the away team is Melbourne, which meets our condition. However, this match took place on Saturday, 5 February, and the claim specifies a date of Sunday, 30 January. This row is not relevant to our claim.\n   - In Row 5, the away team is St Kilda again, not Melbourne.
