This will help us find out if Xu Huaiwen played in the women's singles category during specific years.\n   2. Examine each row to see the value in the 'women's singles' column for each year from 2003 to 2009. If any of those values are Xu Huaiwen, it would prove that she played in the women's singles during those years.\n   3. From the table, we see that Xu Huaiwen is listed as 'women's singles' for the following years: 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, and 2006. Since the given claim states that she played in the women's singles from 2003 to 2009, we need to check if those years are included in our findings.\n   4. 2003 is not found among the years where Xu Huaiwen participated in the women's singles. However, she played in the women's singles from 2004 to 2006 and again in 2009, which covers parts of the specified range (2003-2009).\n   5. Since the given claim asks for participation from 2003 to 2009 and Xu Huaiwen played in the women's singles during part of that time period, our answer is not a strict yes or no.
