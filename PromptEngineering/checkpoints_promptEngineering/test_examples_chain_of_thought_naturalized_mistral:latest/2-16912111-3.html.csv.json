Look for a row where the team is playing against Montreal Alouettes (October 26) followed by a row where they play at home versus Hamilton Tiger-Cats (November 1).\n\nAfter following these steps, we can find that:\n- Row 4 is a match with opponent Montreal Alouettes on October 26.\n- Row 9 does not have the required information to be considered in our analysis since it doesn't have an opponent or date filled out.

Check the table for rows where the opponent is Edmonton Eskimos and the result shows a loss by the Blue Bombers on the road. This will give us the game in question where they lost after winning at home.\n4. In the table, we can see that there are multiple such rows (e.g., weeks 14 and 15). However, we need to find the one where the score is closer to 30 - 23, as that is what the claim states was the previous home win.\n5. In week 15, the Blue Bombers lost to the Eskimos at home by a score of 36 - 22.
