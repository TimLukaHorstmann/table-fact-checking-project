Check if the winner, runner-up, and semi finalists mentioned in the claim match the winners, runner-ups, and semi finalists for those specific matches:\n   - Row 5 has a winner of Conchita Mart\u00ednez, runner-up Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, and semi finalists Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce. This partially matches the claim (winner = Conchita Mart\u00ednez and semi finalists = Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce).\n   - Row 6 has a winner of Gigi Fern\u00e1ndez and Natalia Zvereva, runner-up Conchita Mart\u00ednez and Patricia Tarabini, and semi finalists Helena Sukov\u00e1 and Mary Pierce.
