We find all the games played on that date by looking for rows where the 'date' column equals 'september 11'. This includes rows 3 and 4 in our table.\n3. Next, we look at the 'attendance' column of these two rows to compare their respective attendance numbers.\n4. The attendance for Indiana State vs Cincinnati (row 3) is 30807 and the attendance for any other game on that date (including row 4) is greater than this number.\n5.
