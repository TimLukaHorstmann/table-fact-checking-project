    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the two companies mentioned in the claim, which are Beach Break Live and Conete Mintrate Design (since the second company name seems to be misspelled).\n\n2. Look for each of these companies in the table to find out who invested in them and how much they requested.\n\n3. Check each episode in the table for the presence of Beach Break Live. There is one instance of it on Row 1, where Peter Jones invested. However, the amount requested was not 35000 but 50000. So, the claim about Beach Break Live is partially correct - it was invested by Peter Jones, but not with more than 35000 requested.\n\n4. Check each episode for Conete Mintrate Design (again, seemingly misspelled from the original product name). There are no instances of this company in the table, which means there is no record that it was ever pitched on Dragon's Den or received investment.\n\n5. Since only one out of the two companies mentioned in the claim had an investment recorded and it wasn't the one with more than 35000 requested, the overall claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the two companies mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find out who invested in each of these companies and how much they requested\",\n    \"Check for Beach Break Live and Conete Mintrate Design in the table\",\n    \"Determine if any investments were made with more than 35000 requested\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"money requested\" },\n    { \"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\" }\n  ]\n}",
