To do this, we look at the \"round\" column and compare each value with 7.\n2. Second, for each pick in the 7th round, we check if the \"overall\" column value is less than or equal to 256 (since there are only 7 rounds, and the last pick of the draft occurs at the 256th position). This condition ensures that we are considering picks made during the 2001 draft.\n3. If a pick in the 7th round meets both conditions, it means that the Jacksonville Jaguars obtained this pick during the 2001 draft.\n4. Since there is more than one pick meeting these conditions (rows 7, 8, 9, and 10), we can confirm that the Jacksonville Jaguars got 4 picks during the 7th round in the 2001 draft.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify all picks in the 7th round, compare with overall picks < 256 to ensure 2001 draft.\", \"Confirm that Jacksonville Jaguars obtained these picks.\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7}, {\"row_index\": 8}, {\"row_index\": 9}, {\"row_index\": 10}]\n   }",
