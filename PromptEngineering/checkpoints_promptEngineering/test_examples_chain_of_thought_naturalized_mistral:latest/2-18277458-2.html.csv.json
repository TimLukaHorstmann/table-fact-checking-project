    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that out of 41 shows, 24 are considered sell-outs.\n\n2. Find the total number of shows: In the last row (row_index=40), the total number of shows is provided as 739118. To get the actual count of shows, divide this by the average attendance per show (since some shows are not sell-outs). Assuming an average attendance of one person for each ticket, there are 739118 / 2 = 369559 shows in total.\n\n3. Count the number of sell-out shows: In the table, each show that is a sell-out has a sold/available percentage greater than or equal to 100%. Using this criterion, we can count the number of sell-outs: (row_index=40, column_name=\"ticket sold / available\") = 708028 / 739118 * 100 = 95.8%\nSince 95.8% is greater than or equal to 100%, we can assume that every show listed as having a sold/available percentage of 100% is a sell-out. Therefore, the number of sell-out shows is the count of rows with a sold/available percentage of 100%. Using this criterion, we find 40 rows in the table (since row_index=39 and 40 are included).\n\n4. Compare the number of sell-outs with the claim: The claim states that out of 41 shows, 24 are considered sell-outs. Comparing our calculated count of sell-outs (40) with the claimed count (24), we find that there is a discrepancy between the values.\n\n5. Output final answer: To summarize, out of 41 shows, the number of sell-outs is either 40 or more, depending on the exact interpretation of \"considered\" in the claim. Since it is not explicitly defined, we can consider both 40 and greater than 40 as valid answers based on a broader interpretation of the claim. However, since the table shows exactly 40 sell-outs, our final answer will be:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim, find the total number of shows, count the number of sell-out shows, compare the number of sell-outs with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"ticket sold / available\"}]\n}",
