A shutout occurs when a team does not allow the opposing team to score any runs during the game.\n2.

This is because the claim specifies that \"4 of the games end in a shutout\" and not \"4 of the games were shutouts for our team\".\n3. In the table provided, we can see that some games have scores like 6-1, 5-2, or 7-5, indicating that both teams scored during these games. However, there are also games with scores like 0-4, 0-3, 0-8, etc., which would be shutouts if the team that scored zero was our team. But since we only see losses for our team in these games, they do not count as shutouts for us (as specified in step 2).\n4. The only game that might potentially count is on Row 19 with a score of 5-4 but it has an asterisk (*) which indicates the game went into extra innings and the score was 5-4 after 13 innings.
