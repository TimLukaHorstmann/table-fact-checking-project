    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the show/work we are looking for in the table to verify if it won any drama award. The claim mentions \"shrek\" as the work, but it does not specify the year.\n   2. Check each row of the table where the 'nominated work' column contains 'shrek'. We find that the show 'shrek' was nominated in 2009 (rows 15-18) for Tony Award, Drama Desk Award, Drama League Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award.\n   3. Since we are looking for a drama award specifically, let us focus on the awards that are categorized as 'drama' or have 'drama' in their name: Drama Desk Award, Drama League Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award.\n   4. Check the results of these awards for 'shrek'. For both the Drama Desk Award (row 16) and Outer Critics Circle Award (row 18), the result is 'won'. However, we did not find a 'win' for either award in rows 15 or 17.\n   5. Since we have found a win for both the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award, we can say that 'shrek' won at least one drama award in 2009. The Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Awards are both considered drama awards, so it matches the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the show/work we are looking for in the table to verify if it won any drama award.
