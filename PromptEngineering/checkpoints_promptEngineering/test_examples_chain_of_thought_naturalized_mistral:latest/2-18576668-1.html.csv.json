Check if these events correspond to the given dates: The claim mentions two specific date ranges for the events in 2003 - 25-26 January 2003 and 12-13 July 2003.\n   - Row 12 corresponds to an event held on 12-13 October 2002, which does not match the first date range given in the claim.\n   - Row 14 corresponds to an event held on 12-13 July 2003, which matches the second date range given in the claim.\n\n4. Check if there are any other events in 2003 that also correspond to these dates: Since we have only found one event for each of the mentioned date ranges, it implies that these are indeed the only game plays in 2003 as per the table provided.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Filter rows based on the given year (2003)\", \"Check if the found events correspond to the given dates\", \"Verify there are no other events with matching date ranges\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"}]\n}",
