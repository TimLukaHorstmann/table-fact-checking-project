Locate the rows in the table that match the engine and year specified (row_index=3 for generation: i, years: 1972).\n3. Verify if there is a value for power listed for the found row. In this case, there is no value for power listed (power: -).\n4. Compare the value found in step 3 with the required unit in the claim, which is horsepower (hp or kW). Since the value in the table is not in the appropriate unit, it indicates that the engine power for the given year and engine type was not provided in horsepower.\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the engine being referenced\", \"Locate the rows that match the engine and year\", \"Verify if there is a value for power listed\", \"Compare the value with the required unit in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"power\"}]\n}",
