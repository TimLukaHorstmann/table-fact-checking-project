    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to identify what constitutes an episode number in this table. Since each row represents a different episode with a unique title, directed by a specific person, written by a particular writer, and having its original air date, we can assume that the episodes are listed chronologically based on their air dates.\n\n2. We then look for the episode which falls under season 1 (since there is no explicit mention of 'season' in the claim). From the table, we notice that all episodes have a unique number from 1 to 36, and they seem to be sorted chronologically based on their air dates.\n\n3. We need to find an episode from season 1 that matches the director and writer mentioned in the claim (Ray Austin and R Scott Gemmill). From our analysis in step 2, we know that episodes are listed chronologically, so we look for Ray Austin's directed episodes first. The earliest directed episode by him is on row 2 with title 'secrets'.\n\n4. Next, we check if the writer of this episode (the one directed by Ray Austin) matches the claim. In our table, the written-by column for row 2 shows that the episode was written by Tom Towler, not R Scott Gemmill as mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. Since no other episodes match both the director and writer specified in the claim, we conclude that the statement is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify what constitutes an episode number by examining the table structure\",\n    \"Find the episodes for season 1 based on their order in the table\",\n    \"Look for the episode directed by Ray Austin and written by R Scott Gemmill\",\n    \"Check if the writer of the selected episode matches the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"directed by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"written by\" }\n  ]\n}",
