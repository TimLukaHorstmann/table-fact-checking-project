Identify the specific teams mentioned in the claim: The claim mentions no specific team, but it is implied that the team in question is Texas since we are analyzing its records.\n\n2. Find the relevant records related to the last 10 meetings: We need to look for the \"last 10 meetings\" record for Texas with all its opponents.\n\n3. Check if there are ties among those records: To determine if there are ties, we will count the number of matches that end in a draw (5-5) and compare it against the total number of the last 10 meetings.\n\n4. Identify the number of Texas victories at its home venue during the last 10 meetings: We will also check how many of these 10 games were won by Texas in Austin (ut column).\n\nNow, let's analyze the data for each opponent:\n\n- Baylor: Last 10 meetings: tied 5-5. Victories at Austin: 5-5\n- Colorado: Last 10 meetings: ut 8-2. No ties.\n- Iowa State: Last 10 meetings: tied 5-5. Victories at Austin: 6-4 (3 at home, 3 on neutral site)\n- Kansas: Last 10 meetings: ut 7-3. No ties.\n- Kansas State: Last 10 meetings: ksu 6-4. No ties.\n- Missouri: Last 10 meetings: ut 9-1. No ties.\n- Nebraska: Last 10 meetings: ut 8-2. No ties.\n- Oklahoma: Last 10 meetings: tied 5-5. No victories at Austin.\n- Oklahoma State: Last 10 meetings: ut 7-3.

Check the overall record for each of these pairs in the \"overall record\" column: For every pair where Texas is listed first, the overall record is greater than or equal to 5 wins and less than or equal to 5 losses (since Texas leads in all cases).\n  3. Calculate the total number of wins for Texas in the first 10 meetings: Sum up the number of wins for Texas against each team in the \"overall record\" column. This gives us a sum of 57 + 14 + 10 + 11 + 10 + 15 + 12 + 21 + 21 + 58 = 169 wins for Texas in the first 10 meetings.\n  4. Calculate the total number of losses for Texas in the first 10 meetings: Sum up the number of losses for Texas against each team in the \"overall record\" column, excluding the draws (since we are only considering wins and losses, not ties). This gives us a sum of 23 + 4 + 9 + 7 + 8 + 13 + 5 + 13 + 7 + 15 = 90 losses for Texas in the first 10 meetings.\n  5. Find the number of ties (draws) between Texas and its opponents: In the table, there are several instances where the last 5/10 meetings or the current streak is listed as a draw (e.g., tied 4 - 4, 5 - 5, l 2). Counting these gives us 6 ties.\n  6. Compare the calculated number of wins and losses for Texas in the first 10 meetings: In our calculation, we found 169 wins and 90 losses, which totals to 259 games. However, since there are only 10 teams, Texas can play a maximum of 49 games (each team twice plus one game against itself). The discrepancy between the number of games played and the number of teams suggests that we have overcounted some matches.\n  7. Review the last 5/10 meetings and current streak for each pair to identify potential duplicates: In the table, there are instances where the last 5/10 meetings or the current streak is listed as a draw (e.g., tied 4 - 4, 5 - 5, l 2). Some of these draws might represent the same game being counted twice due to different perspectives (e.g., Texas's perspective vs. their opponent's perspective). We will need to eliminate any duplicates if they exist.\n  8. Adjust the number of ties if necessary: After reviewing the last 5/10 meetings and current streak, we find that there are no duplicate draws in our table. Therefore, there is no need to adjust the number of ties.\n  9. Compare the calculated number of wins, losses, and ties for Texas in the first 10 meetings against the claim: In our calculation, we found 169 wins, 90 losses, and 6 ties. Comparing this with the claim \"in the first 10 meeting, the score be tie, 5 - 5 4 time and 2 time at ut, 8 - 2,\" we can see that there are 4 instances where the score is tied (5-5), which matches our calculation of 6 ties.
