    "resp": "Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, count the number of appearances for each team in the table. To do this, go through every row where the \"team\" column has the specified team's name (Golden State or New York) and note down the number of rows for each team.\n2. For Golden State, there are 3 rows where the team is Golden State: game 40, game 41, and game 42.\n3. For New York, there are also 3 rows where the team is New York: game 38, game 39, and game 46.\n4. Compare the count for each team to determine if one team appears more often than the other.\n5. In this case, both teams appear the same number of times (3).\n\nSince Golden State does not appear more often than New York in the given table, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Count the number of appearances for each team by going through every row where the 'team' column has the specified team's name (Golden State or New York) and note down the number of rows for each team.\",\n                       \"For Golden State, there are 3 rows where the team is Golden State: game 40, game 41, and game 42.\",\n                       \"For New York, there are also 3 rows where the team is New York: game 38, game 39, and game 46.\",\n                       \"Compare the count for each team to determine if one team appears more often than the other.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n                     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"team\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"team\"}]\n}\n```",
