Obtain the earnings of each player from the table: Tiger Woods - $5,687,777; Phil Mickelson - $4,403,883.\n4. Calculate the difference in earnings between the players: Difference = Tiger's earnings - Phil's earnings = 5,687,777 - 4,403,883 = $1,283,894 (positive value means Tiger Woods earned more).\n5.
