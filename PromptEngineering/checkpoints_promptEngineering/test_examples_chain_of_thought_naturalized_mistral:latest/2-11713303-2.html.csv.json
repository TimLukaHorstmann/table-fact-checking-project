    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which managers from the table quit their teams during the 2007-2008 season.\n2. Check the \"manner of departure\" column for any instances of 'quit'.\n3. From the table, it can be observed that neither Hugo Broos (team genk) nor Jos\u00e9 Riga (team Mons) are listed as quitting their teams according to this column. However, Albert Cartier (team Brussels) is marked as fired, but we will also check if he quit by examining the timeline of events.\n4. If a manager was fired and then rehired as a caretaker or replaced with another caretaker shortly after, it could suggest they were originally fired for a reason other than quitting. We need to investigate these instances (Albert Cartier, Enzo Scifo, Edy de Bolle, Geert Broeckaert).\n5. By examining the timeline of events in the table, we find that Albert Cartier was initially fired and then rehired as a caretaker on two separate occasions (first on 17 December 2007, second on 28 January 2008), which does not align with the pattern typically associated with a resignation or quitting.\n6. After analyzing all relevant information in the table, we can determine that Hugo Broos of team Genk and Jos\u00e9 Riga of team Mons did not quit their teams during the 2007-2008 season. Albert Cartier was initially fired but cannot be definitively labeled as having quit based on the provided timeline and circumstances of his rehiring as a caretaker.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify managers who quit during the 2007-2008 season\", \"Check 'manner of departure' for instances of 'quit'\", \"Investigate instances where a manager was fired and rehired as caretaker or replaced with another caretaker shortly after\", \"Analyze the timeline of events in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"}\n  ]\n}",
