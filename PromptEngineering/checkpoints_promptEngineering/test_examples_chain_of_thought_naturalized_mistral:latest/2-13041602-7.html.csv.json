However, it's important to note that they also played against the Padres again on September 13, 14, and 15.\n\n2. Determine if there are any other teams the Brewers played against at least 4 times during the season. To do this, we should look for groups of consecutive rows where the opponent is the same team. In this table, it appears that the Brewers played the Reds and the Astros more than once.\n\n3. Examine if there are any other instances of playing against the Padres 4 times consecutively. In this case, while the Brewers did play the Padres multiple times, they didn't have a block of 4 consecutive games only with the Padres as the opponent.\n\nSince the condition that the opponent was the same team for four games in a row isn't met, the Padres would not be the Brewers' season opponent 4 times.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the opponent for Milwaukee Brewers throughout the season and check if they played against this team 4 times consecutively\", \"Check if there are any other teams the Brewers played against at least 4 times during the season\", \"Examine if there are any instances of playing against the Padres 4 times consecutively\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

There are no more rows with the opponent as the Padres.\n\n3.

We find a row (row 5) where the opponent is the Reds, which follows the last game against the Padres (row 4).\n\n5.

There are six columns: date, opponent, score (home team - away team), loss (pitcher), attendance, record.\n\n2. Identify the relevant column for determining whether a game was a \"no point\" game or not. In this case, it is the \"score\" column.\n\n3. Determine the format of the scores in the table. The scores are given as Home Team - Away Team. If the home team score is 0, then it can be said that no points were scored by the home team (i.e., a \"no point\" game).\n\n4. Iterate through each row and check if the value in the \"score\" column indicates a \"no point\" game for the home team. To do this, we need to check if the home team's score is 0.\n\n5. Inspect rows where the home team is the Milwaukee Brewers (since the claim pertains to the Brewers). The home team can be identified by looking at the first number in the \"score\" column. If it's an even number, then the Brewers are the home team; if odd, then they're away.\n\n6. Based on step 5, inspect rows 1, 3, 15, 17, and 25 as these rows contain games where the Brewers were at home. In these five rows, we find that the scores are (in naturalized form) 0-3, 0-2, 0-0, 0-2, 0-11, which means that indeed, there were 4 games where the Brewers did not score any points.\n\n7.

The Cubs appear in rows 17-20, which means they are opponents in four games (rows).
