    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the date (June 9) from the table.\n2. Find the row corresponding to the given date. In this case, Row 9.\n3. Check the columns of that row for the relevant information:\n   a. Opponent: The opponent in this game was the Yankees (confirmed).\n   b. Record: The record before this game would be the sum of all previous wins and losses, which from the table can be calculated as 28 wins and 30 losses (not including this game yet) (confirmed).\n   c. Loss: The loss in this game was Mulholland (confirmed).\n   d. To find Mulholland's win-loss record, we need to count all the wins and losses associated with his name in the table. We can see that his losses are as follows: 2 - 1 (Row 1), 3 - 2 (Row 8), 5 - 6 (Row 9). Adding these up, we get a record of 5 - 6 for Mulholland (confirmed).\n\nWith all the necessary information confirmed, we can now provide our answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the given date and find its corresponding row\", \"Check the opponent, record, loss, and calculate win-loss record for Mulholland\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"loss\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win-loss (Mulholland)\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"win-loss (Mulholland)\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"win-loss (Mulholland)\"}]\n}",
