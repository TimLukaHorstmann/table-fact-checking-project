    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to determine if any of the players listed in the table were drafted by the Washington Redskins. To do this, we don't need to look at their positions as the claim doesn't specify which two players we should consider.\n2. Next, we scan the table for columns \"pick\" and \"overall\" to find any players who were picked by the same team (same pick number or overall position). The Washington Redskins have only one pick in each round, so if a player was drafted by them, it should be clear from their pick number.\n3. We observe that the values in the \"pick\" column do not repeat, which means no two players were picked by the same team. However, we also notice that the values in the \"overall\" column do repeat for some players. For example, both Bobby Wilson and Dennis Ransom have an overall position of 17, but this doesn't necessarily mean they were drafted by the same team as their pick numbers are different.\n4. To find out if any two players with the same overall position were drafted by the same team, we need to look at their respective rows for the \"name\" and \"college\" information. Comparing each pair of players with the same overall position, we don't observe any pairs where both players are from the Washington Redskins (indicated by college being undefined or having a value that can be traced back to the Washington Redskins).\n5. Therefore, our final conclusion is that no two players drafted to the Washington Redskins have a DB position since we couldn't find any relevant pairs of players who are from the Washington Redskins and play the DB position based on the given table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check if there are any players drafted by the Washington Redskins, scan the 'pick' and 'overall' columns for repetitions, compare pairs of players with the same overall position who might be from the Washington Redskins.\", \"No two players drafted to the Washington Redskins have a DB position because we couldn't find any relevant pairs of players who are from the Washington Redskins and play the DB position based on the given table.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
