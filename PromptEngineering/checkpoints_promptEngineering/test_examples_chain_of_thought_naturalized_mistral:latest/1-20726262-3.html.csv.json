The production codes are listed under the column \"production code\" and there's no indication of a season number in the provided table.\n2. Next, I should find out if there's any relationship between the production code and the season number in this context. However, since neither the table nor the claim explicitly states such a relationship, I can only assume that they might be related sequentially.\n3. After that, I compare each production code with the claimed production code (2wab12). This comparison will allow me to find out if the claimed production code is present in the table or not.\n4. If the claimed production code is found, I then check its row index and verify if it corresponds to a season number of 12.\n\n   Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
