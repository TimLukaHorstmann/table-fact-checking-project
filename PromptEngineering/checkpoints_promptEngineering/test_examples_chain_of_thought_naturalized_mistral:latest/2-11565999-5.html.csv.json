    "resp": "Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row corresponding to track 23 in the table. This row has \"track: 23\".\n2. Examine the column named \"song title\" for the identified row. This cell contains the song title of the given track, which is \"he'll have to go\".\n3. Compare this song title with the claim's title, which is \"just a little bit\". These do not match.\n4. Since the given song title does not match the claim's title, it can be concluded that the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify track 23 in the table\",\n    \"Check the 'song title' for the identified row\",\n    \"Compare the given song title with the claim's title\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"song title\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"title\" }\n  ]\n}",
