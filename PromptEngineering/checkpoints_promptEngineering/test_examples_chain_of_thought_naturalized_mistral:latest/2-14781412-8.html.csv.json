Identify the locations where the Asian Games were held, which are New Delhi (Row 1), Seoul (Row 2), Hiroshima (Row 3), Bangkok (Row 4), Busan (Row 5), Doha (Row 6), and Guangzhou (Row 7).\n\n2. Check if any of these locations match South Korea, to find out if the country has hosted the Asian Games more than once. Seoul (Row 2) and Doha (Row 6) are the only cities that correspond to South Korea according to the table. Since it's mentioned in the claim that Incheon was also a host city but not listed in the table, we cannot be certain if Incheon is another location in South Korea or a different country.\n\n3. However, since we only have two occurrences of Asian Games hosted by a country whose name might be South Korea, it means that either:\n   - South Korea has indeed been the only country to host the Asian Games more than once (with Seoul and Doha as the cities), or\n   - There's an error in the table, because if there are more locations hosted by other countries, then South Korea wouldn't be the only one with multiple hosting occurrences.\n\n4.
