    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the data relevant to the claim, which includes the number of games (7), losses (4), point differential (19-19) and points (6).\n2. Search the table for a row that matches these conditions.\n3. The fourth row has 7 games, 2 lost (which is less than 4), a point difference of 23 - 28 (not exactly 19-19), and points of 8. This does not match the claim's condition of having 4 losses and a 19-19 point differential.\n4. The next matching row is the sixth one, which has 7 games, 4 losses, a point difference of 19-19, and points of 6. This matches all the conditions in the claim.\n5. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant data (games=7, losses=4, point diff=19-19, points=6).\", \"Search table for a row that matches these conditions.\", \"Find row 6 matches all the given conditions.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"games\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}]\n}",
