Next, we need to check the position of the player named Mark Polak. In our given table, under Row 17, the position of Mark Polak is listed as centre (column name: position).\n3. Now, we need to determine the pick number for Mark Polak. Since we know his position and row index, we can compare this information with the rest of the data in the table. However, since the claim specifically asks about the pick number without specifying whether it should match exactly or be the same as Mark Polak's actual pick number, we cannot verify this aspect based on the provided information.\n4. To answer the claim directly, we compare the position listed for Mark Polak (centre) with the position given in the claim (centre). Since they are identical, we have confirmed that the statement is true regarding Mark Polak's player position.
