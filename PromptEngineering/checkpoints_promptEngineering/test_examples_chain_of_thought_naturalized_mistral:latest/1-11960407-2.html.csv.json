    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the game row that corresponds to the date specified (November 20). In this table, game 10 matches the specified date.\n2. Verify if the team mentioned in the claim (Dallas) is the same as the one listed for the identified row. The team in game 10 is Dallas. So, the teams match.\n3. Compare the score listed for the identified row with the score claimed. The score in game 10 is a loss for the Toronto Raptors, whereas the claim suggests a win for them. This means the scores do not match.\n4. Since the scores do not match and the table shows the result of the game as a loss, it is clear that the claim \"the result of the game on November 20 in Dallas be w 110 - 101 (ot)\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the row corresponding to the specified date\",\n    \"Verify if the team mentioned in the claim matches the one listed for the identified row\",\n    \"Compare the score listed with the score claimed\",\n    \"If scores match, compare other relevant details (high points, high rebounds, etc.) and verify they also match\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
