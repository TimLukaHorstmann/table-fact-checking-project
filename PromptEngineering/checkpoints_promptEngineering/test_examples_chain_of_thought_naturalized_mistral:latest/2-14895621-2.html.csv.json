    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the partner of Hwang Sun in various events throughout the years. From the table, we can see that Hwang Sun's partner was Kang Haeng-Suk for the events with \"wd\" (Withdrew) in 1982 (row 4) and 1985 (rows 2 and 6).\n\n2. Check if there is an event win by Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk that occurred before the 1985 India Open. From the table, we don't have specific information about wins in open tournaments or any other events besides the world championships, Asian Games, and \"wd\" events. However, if we assume that the \"asian games\" row represents a win at the Asian Games, then there is a preceding victory (in 1982 according to row 4) before the 1985 India Open.\n\n3. Verify if Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk finished first in the 1985 India Open. From the table, we don't have specific results for individual tournaments like the India Open, but the claim mentions that they finished \"first 2.\" Given that there is no clear contradiction in the table for this event and since \"1\" represents a win or first place, we can infer that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk finished first 2 years after their victory at the Asian Games (in 1985 India Open).\n\n4. Cross-check if the claimed year is correct. The 1985 India Open occurred in the correct year according to the table's information (rows 2 and 6 indicate events in 1985).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Hwang Sun's partner for each event\",\n    \"Check if there is a preceding victory before the 1985 India Open\",\n    \"Verify that Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk finished first in the 1985 India Open\",\n    \"Cross-check the claimed year\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"partner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

In Row 4 and Row 6, Kang Haeng-Suk is listed as a partner, but the events are not \"world championships\" or the same for both instances. This means that Hwang Sun might have partnered with Kang Haeng-Suk in different tournaments other than the world championship.\n4. In Row 2 and Row 4, the events where they partnered are \"wd\", which likely stands for \"withdrawn\".
