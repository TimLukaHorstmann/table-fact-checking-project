Since we are trying to determine if a specific score of 24-28 applies at \"the stoop\", and no match was found for \"the stoop\" in the table, it means that there is no relevant data about scores at \"the stoop\".\n3. Therefore, since no data was found to support or contradict the claim, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n4. To provide a final answer, we will consider two scenarios:\n   - If the score 24-28 applies at some other venue in the table, then the claim is FALSE because it specifically refers to \"the stoop\".\n   - If there are no scores of 24-28 anywhere in the table, then we can neither confirm nor deny the claim as true.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify 'the stoop' in the table, find any match for score 24-28 at 'the stoop', determine if data supports or contradicts the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

Examine each row that meets the conditions: Go through every row in the table, check whether McNamara scored 3 out of 4 goals when the venue was \"the stoop\".\n\nReasoning step-by-step inspection of the table shows that there is no row where both conditions (McNamara's goals and the venue being \"the stoop\") are satisfied.
