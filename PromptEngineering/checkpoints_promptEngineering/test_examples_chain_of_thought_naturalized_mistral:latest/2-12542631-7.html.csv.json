We will compare the initials of the full names mentioned in the claim with those in the table.\n\n1. For 'andrew': In the table, we find 'andrews' who is Mr Thomas. Comparing the initials, we see they match ('a', 't').\n2. For 'chisholm': In the table, we find 'chisholm' who is Mr Roderick Robert Crispin. Comparing the initials, we see they match ('c', 'r').\n3. For 'parr': In the table, we find 'Parr' who is Mr William Henry Marsh. Comparing the initials, we see they match ('p', 'w').\n4. We could not find any matching names for 'mr thomas', 'Mr roderick robert crispin', and 'Mr william henry marsh'. However, if we compare their initials (t, rrc, whm), we can see that they all have 'w' as the third letter.\n5. To check the class of these passengers, we need to look for the column 'class' in the table. In the table, we find that Andrews, Chisholm, and Parr are all listed under either 'first' or 'second' classes. However, if we remember our initial observation about their third letters, we can deduce that they all boarded second class from Belfast since 'second' comes after 'first'.\n6. To confirm the hometown of these passengers, we need to look for the column 'hometown' in the table. In the table, we find that Andrews, Chisholm, and Parr all have 'Belfast, Ireland' as their hometown.\"],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"class\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"class\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 8,\n        \"column_name\": \"class\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"hometown\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 3,\n        \"column_name\": \"hometown\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 8,\n        \"column_name\": \"hometown\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }",
