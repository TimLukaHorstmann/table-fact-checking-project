In the given table, the 'introduced' values are either a single year or a range of years represented as \"year_1 - year_2\". We'll convert these ranges into individual years and treat them equally for comparison purposes. For example, \"1978 - 1981\" will be treated as having four instances: 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981.\n3. Now, we compare each 'introduced' value (after conversion) to find the maximum.\n4. In the table, classes 'dsc', 'tr', and 'dx' have introduced dates ranging from 1959 to 1978. Class 'dl' has an introduced date of \"2010 -\", which can be considered infinite for this comparison since it is later than any specific year.\n5.

Check if the 'dl' class is complete: we cannot definitively say whether a class is complete or not since we don't know if more examples are going to be added in the future. However, we can check whether all instances of the 'dl' class listed in the table are in service.\n4. Check the status of all 'dl' class instances: in the table, there are 48 'dl' class units, and 40 of them are in service (number in service: 40).
