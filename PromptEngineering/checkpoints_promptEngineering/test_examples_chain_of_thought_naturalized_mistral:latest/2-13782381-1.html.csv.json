    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the values corresponding to week 13 from the table. In this case, we are looking for Row 13 with columns \"week\", \"result\".\n2. Since week 13 corresponds to Row 13, the result for that week is in the \"result\" column of Row 13, which is \"l 28 - 17\".\n3. To check if this matches the claim, we compare the obtained value with the claim's expected result: \"l 28 - 17\".\n4. As both the obtained value and the claim match, the answer is TRUE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the values for week 13 in the table (Row 13).\", \"Extract the 'result' column value from Row 13 which is 'l 28 - 17'.\", \"Compare the obtained result with the expected result in the claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that week 12 should be the average for the result of 28-17.\n2. Identify the data structure: The table is in a naturalized format, where each row represents a game and includes columns for week, date, opponent, result (score), game site, attendance.\n3. Find the row corresponding to week 12: To do this, we need to find the row with \"week\": 12. In our table, it is on row number 12.\n4. Extract the relevant data from the identified row: Since we are interested in finding the score (result), we extract that value from the row for week 12. In this case, the result was a loss with a score of 31-20 against the Houston Oilers.\n5. Identify the total number of games: To find the average, we need to know the total number of games for comparison. In our table, there are 16 rows (games) in total.\n6. Find the count of games with a score equal to the target score: In our case, we want to find the count of games where the result is 28-17. However, no such game is present in our table, which implies that there are no games with this exact score.\n7. Determine if it makes sense for week 12 to be the average: Since there is no game with a score equal to 28-17 and we cannot find an average based on existing scores, it does not make sense for week 12 to be the average for the result of 28-17.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify the data structure\",\n    \"Find the row corresponding to week 12\",\n    \"Extract the relevant data from the identified row\",\n    \"Identify the total number of games\",\n    \"Find the count of games with a score equal to the target score\",\n    \"Determine if it makes sense for week 12 to be the average\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
