In Row 1, the date of vacancy for Daniel Uberti is given as 14 August 2008, and there is no subsequent record of his sacking on December 29, 2008.\n3. Find the row containing Nelson Ancheta's information (Row 7: team: fas). Check if there is a date for his appointment as a manager that matches with the vacancy date of Daniel Uberti (December 29, 2008).\n4. In Row 7, the date of appointment for Nelson Ancheta is given as January 1, 2009 (not December 29, 2008), so there's no coincidence with Daniel Uberti's vacancy date.\n5.

In this case, we can see that he managed Balboa (Row 3) and FAS (Row 7).\n   2. Check if Roberto Gamarra was the outgoing manager of any team in the table.
