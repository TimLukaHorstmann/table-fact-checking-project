Next, find the corresponding rows for each team in the table. Rows 1 to 5 are for Houston, Sacramento, Dallas, New Orleans, and Memphis respectively. The sixth row (Minnesota) is not relevant because it's not one of the mentioned teams. Row 7 (Memphis) is repeated but we will use it for comparison purposes. Rows 8 (Golden State) and 81 (Memphis, again) are the remaining ones.\n3. Look at the \"location attendance\" column for each team to find their respective game attendance numbers. For Golden State, it's \"us airways center\" but since we don't have a specific row with that data yet, let's mark this as unknown for now (U). Similarly, for Memphis in Row 7 and Row 81, the attendance is \"us airways center 18422\" and \"us airways center\", respectively. New Orleans has \"new orleans arena 17781\" in Row 4.\n4. Compare the attendance values:\n   - Memphis (Row 7 and Row 81): us airways center 18422 and us airways center, which seem to be equal but we don't have a definitive number for Row 81 yet.\n   - New Orleans: new orleans arena 17781\n5. As the information about Golden State's attendance (Row 8) is still unknown, we can't make a final conclusion based on the current table data.
