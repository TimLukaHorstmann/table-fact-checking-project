We will look for rows where the \"laps\" column equals 69 and the \"time / retired\" cell is not marked with a \"+\", which indicates retirement during the race.\n\n2. Starting from the top row (Row 1), we find that Nigel Mansell completed 70 laps, which is more than 69 laps, so he is disregarded.\n\n3. Moving on to Row 2, Alain Prost also retired with a time +18.772 seconds, so he is disregarded as well.\n\n4. Similarly, we find that Row 3's driver Nelson Piquet retired (+49.274), Row 5's Michele Alboreto retired one lap later, and Row 6's Stefans Johansson also retired one lap later. Therefore, rows 3-6 are disregarded.\n\n5. Starting from Row 7 (Ren\u00e3 Arnoux), we find that all drivers up to Row 14 (Riccardo Patrese) retired before or during the race, and so they are disregarded.\n\n6. Finally, in Rows 15-24, only three drivers made it past 69 laps: Johnny Dumfries, Thierry Boutsen, and Christian Danner. However, both Christian Danner (Row 11) and Jonathan Palmer (Row 12) retired with a time +3 laps later, so they are disregarded as well.\n\n7. In Row 10, Thierry Boutsen officially retired with a time +3 laps later, but he completed 67 laps before retiring.
