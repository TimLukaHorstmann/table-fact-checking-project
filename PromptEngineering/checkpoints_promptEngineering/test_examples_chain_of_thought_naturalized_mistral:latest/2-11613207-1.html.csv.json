Compare the number of tournaments and the average OWGR points for May and October to check if they are indeed the most popular months and if the average OWGR points are 6 respectively.\n\nReasoning:\n- We can see that there are multiple tournaments in May (Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5) and October (Rows 10, 11, and 14). This indicates that both May and October may be among the most popular months to host golf tournaments in Korea.\n- To check the average OWGR points for each month, we need to calculate the sum of OWGR points for all tournaments in a specific month and divide it by the number of tournaments in that month.\n  - For May: Sum = (34 + 8 + 6 + 6) / 4 = 10.25\n  - For October: Sum = (6 + 6 + 14) / 3 = 7.33\n- The average OWGR points for May and October are not exactly 6, but they are close to it (10.25 for May and 7.33 for October).
