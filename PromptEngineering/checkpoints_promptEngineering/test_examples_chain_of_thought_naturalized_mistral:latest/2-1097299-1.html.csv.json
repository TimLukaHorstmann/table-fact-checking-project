    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, we need to count how many justices were appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n2. We iterate through the table and note down all the rows where the \"appointed by\" column equals \"Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n\".\n3. We find 4 such rows: Row 1, Row 4, Row 5, and Row 6.\n4. Since there are 9 rows in total, counting those appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n gives us a count of 4 justices.\n5. Comparing this with the total number of justices (9), we see that 4 is less than half of 9 (which would be 4.5 as an approximation).\n6. However, the question asks for \"new\" justice appointments, and since a chief justice does not retire, only associate justices retire.\n7. Out of the 4 justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n, all of them are associate justices (as evidenced by their years until mandatory retirement), so they qualify as new appointments.\n8. Counting just the associate justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n gives us a count of 4, which is less than half of the total number of associated justices (5 out of 9). However, since one of them (Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton) is the chief justice and does not retire, we should only be counting associate justices in our calculation.\n9. With this adjustment, we now have a count of \"new\" justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n as equal to 4, which is exactly one third of the total number of associate justices (12 if we exclude the chief justice).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count how many justices were appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n\",\n    \"Iterate through the table and note down all the rows where the 'appointed by' column equals 'Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n'\",\n    \"Find 4 such rows: Row 1, Row 4, Row 5, and Row 6\",\n    \"Since a chief justice does not retire, only associate justices retire\",\n    \"Counting just the associate justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n gives us a count of 4\",\n    \"Adjust our calculation to exclude the chief justice, giving us a total of 5 associate justices\",\n    \"With this adjustment, we now have a count of 'new' justices appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n as equal to 4, which is exactly one third of the total number of associate justices\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1 },\n    { \"row_index\": 4 },\n    { \"row_index\": 5 },\n    { \"row_index\": 6 }\n  ]\n}",
