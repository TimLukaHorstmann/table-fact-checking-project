    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the table and locate the rows that contain matches played in 2006. In this table, there are three matches played in 2006 (rows 4, 6, and 8).\n\n2. Within those rows, look for the columns that contain the information about goals scored by Cho Jae-jin. In each of these rows, only one column contains a value related to goals scored (\"score: 1 goal\" in rows 4 and 5, \"score: 2 goals\" in rows 6 and 8).\n\n3. Check if there are any other rows where Cho Jae-jin scored more than one goal in the same match. Since there is no such row, we can focus on the rows with a single goal score for Cho Jae-jin.\n\n4. Count the number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in those rows. We have two rows with a single goal score (rows 4 and 5). Thus, Cho Jae-jin scored one goal in each of these matches.\n\n5. Sum up the number of goals scored in these rows to get the total number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in matches played in 2006. In this case, that sum is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSince the claim states \"Cho Jae-jin score a total of 5 goal in the match play in 2006\", and we found out that Cho Jae-jin scored only 2 goals in matches played in 2006, our answer is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the table and locate the rows that contain matches played in 2006\", \"Within those rows, look for the columns that contain information about goals scored by Cho Jae-jin\", \"Check if there are any other rows where Cho Jae-jin scored more than one goal in the same match\", \"Count the number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in those rows\", \"Sum up the number of goals scored in these rows to get the total number of goals scored by Cho Jae-jin in matches played in 2006\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
