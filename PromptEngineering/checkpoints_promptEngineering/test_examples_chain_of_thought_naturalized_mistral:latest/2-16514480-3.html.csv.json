    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the key claim components: the player (Greg Norman) and country (Australia). Also, the claim mentions a score that is below par by 12 strokes.\n\n2. Check the table for each player to find out their respective countries and scores.\n\n3. In the table, row 1 corresponds to Greg Norman who played for Australia. The total score of Greg Norman is 132 (63 + 69), which is a cumulative score over several rounds.\n\n4. Since we are looking for the round's score that was below par by 12 strokes, it would be helpful to find out the par scores as well since they aren't explicitly provided in the table but can be calculated based on the difference between the total score and the rank position:\n    - Greg Norman has a rank of 1st place, so he must have scored lower than other players.\n    - Looking at Nick Faldo (2nd place) and his score being +8 to par (row 2), we know that the par for this round is likely less than or equal to 136 (since Greg Norman's score is lower).\n    - Now let us assume the par was 136 in this scenario. To have a score of 132, Greg Norman would need to be -4 under par (136 - 132 = 4; since we are looking for a negative difference, it must be -4).\n    - However, his actual to-par value as per the table is -12. To confirm this, let's calculate the par for Greg Norman based on his rank:\n        1st place (Greg Norman) - 1 = (Par + number_of_strokes_above_par)\n        136 (Nick Faldo's score to par) + 12 = Par\n        So, Par = 148\n    - With the new calculated par, Greg Norman's score of 132 would be -16 under par (148 - 132). This doesn't match his actual to-par value in the table.\n\n5. Since we have tried various methods to find a plausible explanation and failed, let us revisit the initial assumption that the par for this round was indeed 136 as inferred from Nick Faldo's score. However, with the calculated par now being 148, it is apparent that our initial assumption was incorrect, and the true par value for this round should be different than what we assumed based on Nick Faldo's score.\n    - We don't have enough information to determine an accurate par value as it isn't explicitly provided in the table. However, since Greg Norman's to-par score is given, we can confirm that he indeed played for Australia and had a score that was 12 strokes below par based on the data from the table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the key claim components (player, country, and score-to-par).\",\n    \"Check the table for each player to find out their respective countries and scores.\",\n    \"Calculate the par value based on the rank of each player.\",\n    \"Compare Greg Norman's score with calculated par values to determine if his score was below par by 12 strokes.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\" }\n  ]\n}",
