    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify all parties (rows) in the table.\n2. For each party, find the number of members on the industrial and commercial panel (column name: \"industrial and commercial panel\").\n3. For each party with non-zero industrial and commercial panel members, find the number of members on the labour panel (column name: \"labour panel\").\n4. For each party with non-zero industrial and commercial panel members and at least one labour panel member, find the number of members on the cultural and educational panel (column name: \"cultural and educational panel\").\n5. Find the number of nominated members by the Taoiseach for each party (column name: \"nominated by the taoiseach\").\n\n6. Check if there exists a party where the number of industrial and commercial panel members is non-zero, the number of labour panel members is greater than 1, the number of cultural and educational panel members is smaller than 0, and the number of nominated members by the Taoiseach is less than 11.\n\nBased on the given table:\n\n- There are 6 unique parties (Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, Labour Party, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, and Independent).\n- None of these parties have industrial and commercial panel members greater than 1.\n- None of the parties with non-zero industrial and commercial panel members have labour panel members greater than 1 (all are exactly 1).\n- All parties except Fine Gael have cultural and educational panel members that are either 0 or not applicable (Fine Gael has 1, the others are all 0).\n- The number of nominated members by the Taoiseach for Fianna F\u00e1il is 9, which is greater than 11.\n\nSince no party meets the required conditions, the claim is FALSE.\n\n   Here's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all parties in the table\",\n    \"Find number of industrial and commercial panel members for each party\",\n    \"For parties with non-zero industrial and commercial panel members, find number of labour panel members\",\n    \"For parties with non-zero industrial and commercial panel members and at least one labour panel member, find number of cultural and educational panel members\",\n    \"Find the number of nominated members by the Taoiseach for each party\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"industrial and commercial panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"labour panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"cultural and educational panel\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated by the taoiseach\"}\n  ]\n}",
