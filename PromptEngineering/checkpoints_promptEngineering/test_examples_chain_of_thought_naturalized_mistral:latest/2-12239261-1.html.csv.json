Next, check if the \"holder at the end of the series\" column for that row matches the claim (\"west indies\"). Yes, it does match.\n3. Then, verify if there is another row where the season is 1991 and the host is England (the host in this claim). No such row exists in the table.\n4. Lastly, confirm if there is a row where the season matches 1991, the host is England, and the series result is \"series drawn\". Since no such row was found, it contradicts the claim that the series was drawn for England as the host.\n\nAs there is a match for the holder at the end of the series (west indies) but not for the host or the series result, the claim is false.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify row with season 1991 (row 14).\", \"Check if 'holder at the end of the series' matches claim ('west indies').
