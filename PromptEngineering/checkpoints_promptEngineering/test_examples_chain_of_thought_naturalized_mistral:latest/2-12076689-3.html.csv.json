However, since the game's outcome hasn't been updated yet on May 31, the current loss of the team is still the same as the previous day, and so the record remains 28 - 25 until the outcome of the game is known.\n4.

In the table, the games played on May 6 are against the Yankees. We can see that from rows 14 to 18, the team is playing against the Yankees.\n4. To find the game on May 6, we look at the date column for each of these rows. Since we know that the date on May 6 falls between May 5 and May 7, we can start with row 14 (May 15) and go backwards, looking for the row with a date that is earlier than May 6 but not before May 2 (the earliest game in the table).\n5. In row 13, we find another game against the Yankees on May 14, which is earlier than May 6. Since there are no games listed for May 12 or 13, this confirms that the game on May 6 was not played against the Yankees.\n6. Now we know that the game on May 6 was not against the Yankees, so it must have been played on a different day or against a different team.
