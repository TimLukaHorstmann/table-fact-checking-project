Identify the columns in the table that are relevant to calculating the goal conceded time, as this is the factor used in determining the club with the least goal conceded time. In this case, we need to look at the \"goals conceded\" column.\n\n2. Calculate the goal conceded time for each club by subtracting their goals scored from goals conceded and multiplying by -1 (since a smaller number indicates a lower goal conceded time). In this case, we have:\n   - Atletas Kaunas: `(15 - 65) * -1 = 50`\n   - Saving\u0117 Kai\u0161iadorys: `(9 - 40) * -1 = 31`\n   - Sveikata Kybartai: `(22 - 38) * -1 = 6`\n   - Lietava - 2 Jonava: `(38 - 27) * -1 = 11`\n   - \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 Vilkavi\u0161kis: `(44 - 32) * -1 = 12`\n   - \u0160ilas Kazl\u0173 R\u016bda: `(54 - 15) * -1 = 39`\n   - Mituva Jurbarkas: `(31 - 12) * -1 = 19`\n\n3. Compare the goal conceded times calculated for each club to determine the club with the least goal conceded time. In this case, Sveikata Kybartai has the smallest value (6), followed by Lietava - 2 Jonava (11), Atletas Kaunas (50), \u0160e\u0161up\u0117 Vilkavi\u0161kis (12), \u0160ilas Kazl\u0173 R\u016bda (39), and Mituva Jurbarkas (19).\n\n4. Now, compare the positions of these clubs in the table to determine if the club with the least goal conceded time is in the highest position.
