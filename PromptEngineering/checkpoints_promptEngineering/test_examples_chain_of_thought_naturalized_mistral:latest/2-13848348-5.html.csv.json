    "resp": "Here are the steps of my reasoning:\n1. Identify the relevant date for which to check the attendance. In this case, it's April 29th.\n2. Find the row number that corresponds to this date in the table. The dates in the table are not explicitly given, but we can deduce that each row represents one day since the first game is on April 1st and there are 29 rows (one for each day of April). Therefore, April 29th corresponds to Row 28 or Row 29. Since the opponent for Row 29 is also \"tigers\", it seems that April 29th corresponds to Row 28 because there's only one game against the Tigers in this table (Row 28).\n3. The opponent and score are not relevant to determining the attendance, so we can ignore those columns. The attendance is given in column \"attendance\".\n4. Check the value of the cell in Row 28 for the \"attendance\" column.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the relevant date (April 29), find the corresponding row number (Row 28 or 29, but since there's only one game against Tigers, it's Row 28), check the value of the cell in Row 28 for the 'attendance' column.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",
