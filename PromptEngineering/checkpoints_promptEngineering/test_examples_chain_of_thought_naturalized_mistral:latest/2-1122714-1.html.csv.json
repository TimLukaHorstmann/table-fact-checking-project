Next, check if there is a \"time / retired\" value for this row. In this case, there is no \"time / retired\" value for row 12.\n   3. Since the row does not contain a \"time / retired\" value, we cannot directly compare it to a specific time value or determine if it's a \"+4 laps\" in the \"time / retire\" section.\n   4. However, the absence of a \"time / retired\" value implies that there is no information about the retirement time or number of laps for this driver (alex ribeiro).\n   5.

Find the relevant row: Locate the row that corresponds to grid 23 in the table. In this case, Row 23 has \"driver: hans binder\" and \"constructor: surtees - ford\".\n\n4. Check the information in the relevant row: Look at the 'time/retired' column of the found row (Row 23). Since it says \"hans binder, constructor: surtees - ford, laps: 1, time / retired: collision, grid: 21\", there is no specific number of laps before retirement mentioned.\n\n5.
