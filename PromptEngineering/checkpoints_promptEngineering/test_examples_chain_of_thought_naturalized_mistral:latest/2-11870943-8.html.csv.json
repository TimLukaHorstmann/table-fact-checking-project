Determine the categorization for each year: To check if the claim is correct, we need to examine the year-wise performance of the US Open from 2007 to 2012 as per the table. For this purpose, we will look at the values in rows 5, 6, and 16 (since the first column indicates the tournament and the second columns represent the years).\n3. Compare the given claim with the findings from step 2: According to the table, the US Open had a 2r categorization between 2010 and 2012 as indicated by the values \"2r\" in rows 5 and 6 for those years (see relevant_cells below). Also, between 2007 and 2009, the US Open had an sf categorization as indicated by the value \"sf\" in row 5 for 2007 and \"sf\" in row 16 for 2009 (see relevant_cells below).\n4.
