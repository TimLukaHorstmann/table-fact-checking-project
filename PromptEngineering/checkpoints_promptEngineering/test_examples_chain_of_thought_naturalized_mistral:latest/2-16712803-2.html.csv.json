From the table, it appears that the season consists of 16 games. Thus, the last two games would be games 15 and 16.\n\n2. Determine the home or away status: To find out if these are home games, we need to check the opponent's team name as it is not explicitly stated whether each game is a home game or an away game in the table. However, considering that teams usually play their opponents both at home and away during a season, it seems unlikely for the last two games to be home games if all previous games have been away games (which is not the case as there are wins recorded).\n\n3. Check the results of the last 2 games: To check if these were wins, we can look at the \"result\" column in the table for games 15 and 16. If the result shows a 'W' for either of these two games, it would mean that our claim is false because there was at least one win during the last two games.\n\n4. Evaluate the claim: Based on the reasoning above, if both games 15 and 16 were losses (indicated by an 'L'), then the claim \"the last 2 games of the season be win for opponent in a home game\" would be false because we don't have enough information to determine whether these were home or away games.
