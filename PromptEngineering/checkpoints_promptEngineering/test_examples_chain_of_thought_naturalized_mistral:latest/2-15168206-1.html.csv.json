    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim and the table provided. The claim states that there be only one year (1983) with a title of \"kriegspiel\" in the genre \"arcade\".\n2. Scan the table to find any rows where the \"title\" is \"kriegspiel\" and the \"genre\" is \"arcade\". We find two such rows: Row 2 and Row 11.\n3. Check the \"year\" for both these rows. For Row 2, the year is 1983. For Row 11, the year is also 1983.\n4. Since we found two rows where the title is \"kriegspiel\" and the genre is \"arcade\", but they are in the same year (1983), our next step is to determine whether this contradicts or supports the claim. The claim states that there be only one such row, not necessarily that it should belong to a single year. However, since we found multiple rows belonging to the same year, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim and table\",\n    \"Scan the table for relevant rows\",\n    \"Check the 'year' for the found rows\",\n    \"Determine whether the findings support or contradict the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year\" }\n  ]\n}",
