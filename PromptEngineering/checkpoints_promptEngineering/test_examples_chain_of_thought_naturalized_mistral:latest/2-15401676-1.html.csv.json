Examine the 'difference' column to find teams with a difference of 21 or less. However, there are no teams with this specific difference in the table.\n\n3. Since there are no teams meeting the specified difference criteria, the total number of such teams is indeed zero.\n\n4. To check if any team has less than 32 against, we can scan the 'against' column. No team has fewer than 32 points against.\n\n5. Therefore, the claim that \"zero be the total number play with a difference of 21 and less than 32 against\" is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify key factors in the claim\",\n    \"Examine 'difference' column for teams with 21 or less difference\",\n    \"No such teams found\",\n    \"Scan 'against' column to check for teams with less than 32 against\",\n    \"No team has fewer than 32 points against\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim is TRUE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
