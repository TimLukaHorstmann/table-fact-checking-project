    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. First, identify the player whose average we are trying to determine: Deon Kruis (Row 17)\n2. Find the relevant columns for this player: matches (row_index = 17, column_name = \"matches\"), innings (row_index = 17, column_name = \"innings\"), not out (row_index = 17, column_name = \"not out\"), runs (row_index = 17, column_name = \"runs\")\n3. Calculate the number of innings played by Deon Kruis: Deon has played 1 innings as per the table.\n4. Calculate the total runs scored by Deon Kruis: Deon has scored 3 runs as per the table.\n5. Find the relevant columns for calculating average: matches (row_index = 17, column_name = \"matches\"), runs (row_index = 17, column_name = \"runs\")\n6. Calculate the average of Deon Kruis by dividing the total runs scored by the number of innings played: Average = Total Runs / Innings = 3 / 1 = 3\n7. Compare the calculated average with the claim's value (0.1): The calculated average is not equal to 0.1, so it does not meet the condition for the claim to be true.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player\",\n    \"Find relevant columns for this player\",\n    \"Calculate number of innings played by Deon Kruis\",\n    \"Calculate total runs scored by Deon Kruis\",\n    \"Find relevant columns for calculating average\",\n    \"Calculate the average of Deon Kruis\",\n    \"Compare calculated average with claim's value\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"matches\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"not out\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"runs\"}\n  ]\n}",
