    "resp": "Here are the steps to analyze the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which matches took place on the first day of the cup competition. To do this, we look for the earliest date in the table, which is 08 / 12 / 1990.\n\n2. Then, we go through each match that occurred on the first day and check if the away team won or not.\n\n3. From rows 2 to 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20, we see that no matches were won by the away teams on this day (as they all show scores where the home team has a higher score).\n\n4. In rows 3, 13, and 15, we have replay matches, which are essentially second games played later. For our analysis, it's essential to know that these replays were not part of the first day of the competition but occurred on subsequent days. So, for the purpose of this claim, we can ignore these rows since they do not occur on the first day.\n\n5. The last two matches from row 18 and row 24 have a score draw (1-1) and will have replays played on later dates. Again, as with the replay matches mentioned earlier, these games are not part of the first day, so we can ignore them for this claim analysis.\n\n6. Since no away team won any game on the first day of the cup competition (as per rows 2 to 6, 9, 11, 14, 16, and 17), the claim is correct.\n\nNow let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify matches from the earliest date in the table\",\n    \"Check if any away team won on this day by looking at each match\",\n    \"Exclude replay matches since they occurred on later days\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    // ...

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will go through each row to find the teams that scored 0 points (zero).\n2. To do this, I will check for rows where the score column contains a hyphen (-), indicating a draw, and both values on either side of the hyphen are zero. Note that the \"replay\" ties are not considered since they are separate matches from the original tie.\n3. If I find any such teams, I will record their row indexes to verify my answer later.\n4. After checking all rows, I will compare the number of rows found against the claim.\n5. If the number of rows found is equal to or greater than 8, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nNow let me search through the table for zero-scoring teams:\n\n1. Row 3 (barnet vs Northampton Town) \u2013 Score: 0 - 0, so this team scored zero.\n2. Row 11 (Fulham vs Cambridge United) \u2013 Score: 0 - 0, so these two teams scored zero.\n3. Row 15 (Huddersfield Town vs Blackpool) \u2013 Score: 0 - 2, so Huddersfield Town scored zero.\n4. Row 17 (Rotherham United vs Halifax Town) \u2013 Score: 1 - 1, so neither team scored zero in this match.\n5. Row 19 (Aldershot vs Maidstone United) \u2013 Score: 2 - 1, so neither team scored zero in this match.\n6. Row 21 (Colchester United vs Leyton Orient) \u2013 Score: 0 - 0, so these two teams scored zero.\n7. Row 25 (Chester City vs Leek Town) \u2013 Score: 1 - 1, so neither team scored zero in this match.\n8. Row 26 (Swansea City vs Walsall) \u2013 Score: 2 - 1, so Swansea City did not score zero.\n\nSo I found three teams that scored zero points: Fulham, Barnet, and Huddersfield Town.
