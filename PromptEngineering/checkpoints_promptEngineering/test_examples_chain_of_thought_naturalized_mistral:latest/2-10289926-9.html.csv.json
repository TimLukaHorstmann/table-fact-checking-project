    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Count the total number of swimmers: There are 8 rows (swimmers) in the table.\n2. Determine the number of swimmers with an overall rank lower than 100: From the table, we can see that there are 5 swimmers with an overall rank lower than 100: Erik Rajohnson (Row 1), Yassir Abalalla (Row 2), Jonathan Calderon (Row 3), Leonel dos Santos Matonse (Row 4), and Luke Hall (Row 5).\n3. Check if 25% of the swimmers have an overall rank lower than 100: To find 25% of the total number of swimmers, we divide by 4 since 1/4 is equal to 25%. In this case, that's 2 swimmers (0.25 * 8). Comparing the number of swimmers with an overall rank lower than 100 (5) to the calculated value (2), we see that it exceeds the expected number (2), which means that more than 25% of the swimmers have an overall rank lower than 100.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the total number of swimmers\",\n    \"Determine the number of swimmers with an overall rank lower than 100\",\n    \"Check if 25% of the swimmers have an overall rank lower than 100\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall rank\" }\n  ]\n}",
