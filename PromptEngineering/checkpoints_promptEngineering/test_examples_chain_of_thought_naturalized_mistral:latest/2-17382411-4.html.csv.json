Next, we need to find the maximum high point among these instances for bob rule. By looking at the table, we can see that bob rule scored 47 points in game 20, which is the highest number of points he scored during this season.\n\n3. To determine if he has the highest high point overall, we now need to compare bob rule's maximum score (47) with the high points of other players during the same season. Scanning through the table again, we can see that no other player has a higher number of points scored in a single game than bob rule did.\n\n4. Therefore, since bob rule has the highest number of points scored in a single game (47) during the 1967-68 seattle supersonics season and no other player scored more, we can conclude that \"bob rule in the 1967 - 68 seattle supersonics season has the highest high point.\"\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify all instances of bob rule's high points, find maximum high point for bob rule, compare bob rule's maximum score with other players' scores during the same season, and conclude if bob rule has the highest high point\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"high points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"high points\" }\n  ]\n}",
