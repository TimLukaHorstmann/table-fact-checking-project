    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. First, we need to count the number of wins for each surface type (clay, hard) for all players in the table.\n   2. Next, compare the counts for clay surfaces for each player to determine who has the most wins on clay.\n\n   However, it's important to note that this task requires a more efficient approach if dealing with large datasets, as counting and comparing manually would be very time-consuming. In practice, you might want to use a programming language like Python or R to quickly sort and count data.\n\n   Since we are working with a small dataset in this example, let's manually count the wins for each surface type:\n\n   1. Count the number of wins on clay surfaces:\n      - Katerina Maleeva has 8 wins (rows 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15).\n\n   Now we compare the number of wins on clay surfaces for all players. Unfortunately, without counting the wins on hard surfaces as well, it is impossible to definitively say whether Katerina Maleeva has the most wins on clay compared to other players.\n\n   Therefore, the data provided is insufficient to give a definitive answer about who has the most wins on clay. However, for this specific case with small dataset and no need of comparison, it seems that Katerina Maleeva has 8 wins on clay surfaces (which is a majority).\n\n   Final Answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Count the number of wins on clay surfaces for each player.\",\n       \"Compare the counts to determine who has the most wins on clay.\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n     ]\n   }",
