The Packers start with a record of 1 - 0, then win their second game to have a record of 2 - 0. They lose their third and fourth games, so their record becomes 2 - 2 after these four games. No more information about wins or losses is given in the table, so we know that the Packers' record doesn't change from 2 - 2 at this point.\n\n2. Check each game site for the games where the Packers had a 2 - 2 record. Rows 1 and 2 have the Packers with a record of 1 - 0, so they don't match our criteria. Row 3 has a loss, so it doesn't match either. In rows 4 and 5, the Packers' record is 2 - 2, but these games are not at Lambeau Field or Raymond James Stadium (the game sites in rows 1-3 were Lambeau Field). Row 6 has a win, so the record becomes 3 - 3, and it's not at either stadium. In row 7, the Packers have a win and their record is now 4 - 3, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n\n3. The game in row 9 has a loss, so the record becomes 4 - 4. It's not at Lambeau Field or Raymond James Stadium. Row 10 has a loss, so the record is now 4 - 5. It's not at either stadium either. In rows 11-14, the Packers have losses and their records don't match 2 - 2 anymore. In row 15, they lose again, and the record becomes 5 - 9. This game is also not at Lambeau Field or Raymond James Stadium. In row 16, they lose in overtime to have a record of 5 - 10. It's not at either stadium.\n\n4. Finally, we find the game in row 17 where the Packers play Detroit with a final score of 31 - 21 and their record is now 6 - 10.
