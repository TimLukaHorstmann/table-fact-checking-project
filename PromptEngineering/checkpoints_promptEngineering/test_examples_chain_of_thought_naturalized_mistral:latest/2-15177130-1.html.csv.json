Verify the date: Scan through the table to find rows with the matching date (May 31, 1953). There are multiple rows related to the Grand Prix de l'Albigeois event on this date, so it is necessary to check if any of them also specify the car driven as BRM Type 15 and the driver as Ken Wharton.\n\n3. Verify the car and driver: Check each row that contains the matching date from step 2. In rows 30-35, we find multiple instances of the Grand Prix de l'Albigeois qualifying heats and final. Among these rows, there is no specific mention of the BRM Type 15 car in any of them. However, row 32 corresponds to Ken Wharton participating in the qualifying heat at circuit: albi (which also took place on May 31, 1953).\n\n4. Connect the dots: Since there is no mention of the BRM Type 15 car for Ken Wharton in the final event, and considering that participation in a qualifying heat typically implies progression to the final (assuming no disqualification or other issues), it seems reasonable to infer that Ken Wharton did not drive the BRM Type 15 at the Grand Prix de l'Albigeois final.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Verify the date\", \"Verify the car and driver\", \"Connect the dots\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 32, \"column_name\": \"circuit\"}\n  ]\n}",

Look for rows where the driver is not specified or unclear (e.g., (not specified)), as these could potentially be races involving BRM Type 15 cars. However, this assumption would require confirmation from additional information that the table does not provide.\n3. For the confirmed races with specific drivers, check if they occurred on the Albi circuit by comparing the circuit column.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- Row 20, event: gran premio del valentino, circuit: valentino park (This race is excluded from the analysis since it did not occur at the Albi circuit.)\n- All other rows that have driver but no car type specified (e.g., Row 16, 18, 26, 28) are potential BRM Type 15 races, but they can't be confirmed without additional information.\n- Rows where the race occurred on the Albi circuit:\n  - Row 22, grand prix de l'albigeois qualifying heat (Juan Manuel Fangio, Jose Froilan Gonzalez)\n  - Row 23, grand prix de l'albigeois qualifying heat (Jose Froilan Gonzalez)\n  - Row 24, ulster trophy (Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss)\n  - Row 25, ulster trophy (Stirling Moss)\n\nWithout additional information about the unspecified races, it is not possible to confirm whether BRM Type 15 took part in 8 different races on the Albi circuit.
