    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, identify the season from which the claim refers to. The claim mentions \"Smallville\", so we are looking for data related to Smallville.\n2. Second, find out the specific season by noting that episode numbers increase sequentially in the table. Since there are 214 episodes in total, we can deduce that this is season 10 of Smallville because the first episode of the season would have a \"no\" value of 201 (196+5=201).\n3. Third, identify the start and end dates for this season. In the table, the first row corresponds to episode no: 196 (Row 1), which has an air date of September 24, 2010. The last row corresponds to episode no: 214 (Row 19), which has an air date of April 29, 2011.\n4. Fourth, check if there are 19 episodes between the start and end dates of this season. Calculate the number of episodes from September 24, 2010 to April 29, 2011 (excluding both dates). Since the table doesn't have a daily entry for each episode, we will calculate the difference in weeks between these two dates and multiply it by the average number of episodes per week during this season.\n   - Number of weeks from September 24, 2010 to April 29, 2011: (April 29, 2011 - September 24, 2010) / 7 = approximately 38 weeks (rounded down since we are excluding the start and end dates).\n   - Average number of episodes per week during this season can be approximated by the number of episodes in a half of the season. Since there are 214 episodes in total, there should be roughly 42 episodes in each half of the season (214/2=42.7\u224842).\n   - Approximated number of episodes between September 24, 2010 and April 29, 2011: 38 weeks * 42 episodes per 38 weeks \u2248 156 episodes\n5. Fifth, compare the calculated number with the actual number mentioned in the claim (19). Since the calculated number (156) is greater than the claimed number (19), it means that there were more than 19 episodes between September 24, 2011 and April 29, 2011.\n\nFinal answer: {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the season by finding episode no: 201.\",\n    \"Find start and end dates for this season.\",\n    \"Calculate number of episodes between these dates.\",\n    \"Compare calculated number with claimed number\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"air date\" }\n  ]\n}",
