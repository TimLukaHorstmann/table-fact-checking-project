Each row represents a different pick, with columns for round, pick number, player name, position, school, and presumably team (but this is not explicitly stated).\n\n2. Determine the question's requirement: The claim states that Green Bay had 6 tackles in their team in 1960. Since we do not have a column for teams, it is impossible to definitively confirm or deny this claim using only this table. However, if we find more than 5 players listed as \"tackle\" for any team (even Green Bay), then the claim would be FALSE because at least one player listed as \"tackle\" would not be part of Green Bay's team.\n\n3. Check for relevant rows: We will examine each row where the position is listed as \"tackle\".\n\n4.
