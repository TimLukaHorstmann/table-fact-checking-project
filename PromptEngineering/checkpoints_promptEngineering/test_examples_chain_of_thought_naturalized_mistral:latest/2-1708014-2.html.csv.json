    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the relevant columns in the table for comparison. These are 'starts', 'position', and 'poles'. The claim specifies a start of 4 and a position of 46, so we will look for rows where both conditions match.\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table (rows 1 to 17) and compare the values for 'starts' and 'position' columns with the specified values (4 and 46 respectively).\n\n3. In row 9, we find a match where 'starts' equals 4 and 'position' equals 41st, which is less than 46th as per the claim. However, in this row, 'poles' does not equal 0, which contradicts the claim.\n\n4. Moving on to the next rows, we do not find any matches where both 'starts' equals 4 and 'position' is greater than or equal to 46th.\n\n5. Since no match was found where both conditions (starts=4 and position>=46) are true AND poles=0, the claim \"when there be a start of 4 and a position of 46 , the pole be 0\" is FALSE.\n\nHere's the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify relevant columns (starts, position, poles), iterate through each row, compare values for starts and position with specified values (4 and 46 respectively)\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"starts\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"poles\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
