    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find all characters who have exited the cube from the table.\n2. We can see that four characters (Kazan, David Worth, Quentin, Joan Leaven) have prison connections and therefore could be those who exited the cube.\n3. Out of these four characters, Kazan is alive after exiting the cube.\n4. The claim states that both a male and female leave the cube alive.\n5. Since we know that one male (Kazan) leaves the cube alive, we now need to find out if any female character also leaves the cube alive.\n6. Among the remaining three characters who could have exited the cube, Joan Leaven is a female and she is dead.\n7. The only other female in the table (Dr Helen Holloway) does not have information about whether or not she has exited the cube. However, since we are looking for a scenario where both a male and female leave the cube alive, it doesn't matter if Dr Helen Holloway left the cube dead.\n8. Therefore, based on the given table, we cannot confirm that both a male and female leave the cube alive since we don't have enough information about Dr Helen Holloway.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find characters who exited the cube from the table, check their gender and status after exiting the cube.\", \"Check if there is at least one male and one female character who leave the cube alive.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"status\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"status\"}]\n}",
