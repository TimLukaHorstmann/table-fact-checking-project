From the table header (which is not provided), it seems that the column \"competition\" should include the major championships like the Olympic Games.\n\n2. Next, we go through each row in the table and check if the competition matches with the Olympic Games based on the information in the \"competition\" column. We also note the corresponding row index for each Olympics appearance found.\n\n3. In this case, we find two instances where the competition is 'olympic games': Rows 7 (2008 Beijing) and Row 9 (2012 London).\n\n4. To confirm that these entries represent different Olympic Games appearances, we also check if there's a unique \"year\" for each occurrence in the table. In our example, the years are distinct (2008 and 2012), which confirms that Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich competed in two separate Olympic Games.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify columns with relevant information\",\n    \"Check each row for Olympic Games appearances\",\n    \"Confirm unique years for Olympics appearances\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"competition\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning through the given table:\n\n1. First, we need to find the last two competitions of Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich by sorting the table in descending order of year. This will allow us to easily identify his most recent competitions. However, since there is no direct way to sort this table in place or return a sorted version, we will have to manually look for his most recent competitions.\n\n2. Next, we need to find the distances thrown by Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich during these last two competitions. In the table, column 'position' indicates where he stood in the competition and the 'notes' column contains the distance he threw. To find his average distance for these two competitions, we will add up his distances in these events and then divide that sum by 2 (since there are two events).\n\n3. We will compare the calculated average to the value given in the claim (78.27 m).\n\nNow, let's look at the table again. Since the data is not sorted, we need to find Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's last two competitions. Row 9 has year: 2012 and position: 6th, while row 10 has year: 2013 and position: 3rd. These are his last two events as he placed higher in more recent years than the other competitors.\n\nFor Row 9 (year: 2012), notes: 77.17 m\nFor Row 10 (year: 2013), notes: 79.36 m\n\nNow let's calculate Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's average distance over the last two competitions:\n(77.17 + 79.36) / 2 = 78.265 m\n\nFinally, we compare this calculated value (78.265 m) to the given claim value (78.27 m). Since they are practically equal (within rounding errors), it is reasonable to say that the claim is true.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find Luk\u00e1\u0161 Melich's last two competitions by looking at the table and determining his position in it.\",\n    \"Extract the distances he threw during these two events from the 'notes' column.\",\n    \"Calculate the average distance of the two events.\",\n    \"Compare this calculated value to the claim's value.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"notes\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"notes\" }\n  ]\n}",
