    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. To check if the claim \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer\", we need to compare the scores of the first leg and second leg for Bolton Wanderers.\n\n2. In the table, Row 3 refers to the match between Bolton Wanderers and Sporting CP. To find the scores, we look for the 'agg' column which represents the aggregate score (the sum of scores from both legs) and the relevant leg scores are located within each row.\n\n3. The value in the 'agg' column for Row 3 is 1 - 2, which means the total score over two legs was 1 - 2 in favor of Sporting CP. Since the aggregate score indicates that there is a difference between the scores from both legs, it implies that the first leg score and the second leg score are not the same for Bolton Wanderers.\n\n4.
