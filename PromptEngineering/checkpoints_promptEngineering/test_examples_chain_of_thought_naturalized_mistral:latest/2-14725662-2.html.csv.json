    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Compare the opponent (Michigan) for the game where the result is l0 - 6 from the table with the sites mentioned in the table.\n2. Find the row in the table that matches the opponent (Michigan) and the site (Michigan Stadium Ann Arbor, MI). Since there is no such row, we can assume that this information was not provided for the Michigan game.\n3. However, since all other games listed in the table took place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN, it is reasonable to infer that the site of the game against Michigan might have also been at Memorial Stadium but this information is missing from the table.\n4. To confirm the claim, we would need additional information about the site of the game against Michigan. Since only the opponent and result are provided in the table for this game, it seems plausible that the game could have taken place at Memorial Stadium in Minneapolis, MN.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare the opponent (Michigan) with sites mentioned in the table, Find row matching opponent and site, Infer that the game might have taken place at Memorial Stadium based on other games' locations but this information is missing from the table for this game.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"site\"}]\n}",
