Check each row in the table to find the game where Detroit is the opponent (the \"team\" column). The first instance where the team is Detroit is in Row 1.\n   3. Compare the value of the \"score\" column for this row with the claim score. The value in Row 1 for the \"score\" column is 'w 97 - 72 (ot)', which matches the claim score.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team we are looking for in the table\", \"Check each row to find the game where the opponent is the identified team\", \"Compare the score from the found game with the claim score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
