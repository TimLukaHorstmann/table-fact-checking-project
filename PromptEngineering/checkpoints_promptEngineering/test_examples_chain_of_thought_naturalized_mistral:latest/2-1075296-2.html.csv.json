    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n   1. To verify the claim, we need to find the driver whose constructor is Ferrari, and compare their grid number and retirement time with Michael Schumacher's values from Row 1 of the table.\n   2. We iterate through each row in the table, comparing the constructor (column name: \"constructor\") and the driver's details (grid number and retirement time) with the information for Michael Schumacher (Row 1).\n   3. If we find a driver whose constructor matches Ferrari and whose grid number and retirement time match those of Michael Schumacher, then the claim is true.\n   4. We repeat this process for all rows in the table.\n\n   Based on my reasoning, here's the final answer:\n\n  {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare each driver's constructor, grid number, and retirement time with Michael Schumacher's values from Row 1.\"],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"constructor\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"grid\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"row_index\": 1,\n        \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }",
