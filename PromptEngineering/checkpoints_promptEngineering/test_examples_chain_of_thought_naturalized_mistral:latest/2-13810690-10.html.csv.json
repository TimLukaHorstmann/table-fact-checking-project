Second, I will check the opponent for those two games on September 5 and September 6.

Since the question asks for \"only 2 games,\" we need to confirm that there aren't any other such instances. By scanning the table again, we find no other instances where both teams scored zero points.\n\n3. Compare the identified dates (September 2 and September 5) with the dates of the given claim.

To check for this, we will look for days where not only a game was played, but another one was played as well on the same row (i.e., the same day).\n\n3. Search for matches: In the table, there are no instances where a game is followed by another one on the exact same row. However, we do find two instances of postponed games due to weather: September 6 and September 12. Since these games were not played, they could potentially be part of double headers scheduled for other days.\n\n4. Cross-reference with subsequent days: To confirm if the postponed games are indeed part of a double header, we need to check if any game was rescheduled (in the same or following rows) on those dates.\n\n5. Review the schedule: We see that the game from September 6 is played on September 17 and the game from September 12 is played on September 13. Neither of these games are followed by another game on the same day, so they were not part of a double header.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Determine if any double headers\", \"Search for matches\", \"Cross-reference with subsequent days\", \"Review the schedule\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the games played on each day: From the table, we can see that there are multiple games played against the Nationals, Mets, Marlins, Brewers, and Braves. The game against the Mets is postponed twice (on September 6 and 12), so we will focus on the other teams.\n\n2. Find the game played on September 7: From the table, we find that there are two games played on September 7 - one against the Mets with an attendance of 55797 and another also against the Mets as a DH-2 (Designated Hitter-2) game with an attendance of 54980.\n\n3. Compare the attendance of these two games on September 7: We see that both games had an attendance, but the one labeled as \"Mets (dh - 1)\" has a higher attendance (55797) compared to the other game on the same day (54980).\n\n4. Determine if it is the lowest attendance for any game: To find out if this is the lowest attendance for any game, we need to compare it with the attendance of all games listed in the table. We can see that there are games with lower attendances such as 20202 (September 19) and 44145 (September 26), but these do not match our criteria since they are for a different game on September 7. Therefore, we only compare the attendance of the two games played on September 7, which are both higher than the minimum we found.\n\n5.

So, the teams involved in this claim could be the Mets or the opponents of the postponed games.\n\n2. Check the scores for each game day where at least one team scored zero points. In this table, we find the following instances:\n   - September 12 and September 21 are postponed due to weather, so no score was recorded. However, since these games were postponed (and not rescheduled yet), it means that no team scored zero points on these days.\n   - On September 12 and September 21, the teams playing had scores of \"postponed due to weather\" for both teams.
