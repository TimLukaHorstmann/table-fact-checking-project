Determine the final season mentioned in the claim. The claim does not specify an exact season, so we cannot definitively state that there is a competition before this final season. However, based on the given seasons and matches played by Red Bull Salzburg, it's clear that they did not participate in any other competitions besides Europa League or Champions League during these years.\n\n3.
