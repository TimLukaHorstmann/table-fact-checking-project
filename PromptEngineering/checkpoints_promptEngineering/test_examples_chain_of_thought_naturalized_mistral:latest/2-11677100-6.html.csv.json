    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the player we are interested in, which is Adrian Gonzalez from Eastlake High School.\n2. Check the position of the player to ensure he's the one we are looking for. Since the table provides positions, it's easy to confirm that Adrian Gonzalez is an infielder (Row 9).\n3. Determine the MLB draft information for the player. We can see that Adrian Gonzalez was the first pick of the 2000 draft (Row 9).\n4. Check if the player's draft position indicates he was picked in the last round. The first-round pick number varies based on the number of teams, but it is always before the last round. In a standard MLB draft, there are 30 teams, so the last round (round 40) would have picks 1261-1290. Since Adrian Gonzalez was picked first overall in the 2000 draft, he was not a last-round pick.\n\nWith these steps, we can conclude that Eastlake High School's Adrian Gonzalez was NOT the MLB's last round pick.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player of interest: Adrian Gonzalez\",\n    \"Confirm the position of the player: Infielder\",\n    \"Determine the draft information for the player: First pick of the 2000 draft\",\n    \"Check if the player's draft position indicates he was picked in the last round\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mlb draft\" }\n  ]\n}",
