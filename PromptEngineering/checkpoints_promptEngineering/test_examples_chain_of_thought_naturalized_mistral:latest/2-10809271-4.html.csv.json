    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the home team scores for Geelong and Melbourne from the table. In this case, their respective home team scores are 9.13 (67) (row 2 for Geelong) and 9.11 (65) (row 1 for Melbourne).\n\n2. Calculate the individual sum of the home team scores for each team: Sum(Geelong home score) = 9 + 13 = 22, Sum(Melbourne home score) = 9 + 11 = 20\n\n3. Since we want to find the average, divide the total score of each team by the number of games (in this case, since there's only one game for each team, the number of games is 1): Average(Geelong home score) = 22 / 1 = 22, Average(Melbourne home score) = 20 / 1 = 20\n\n4. To find the average of the two teams' home scores, add their individual averages and divide by 2: (Average(Geelong home score) + Average(Melbourne home score)) / 2 = (22 + 20) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21\n\n5.
