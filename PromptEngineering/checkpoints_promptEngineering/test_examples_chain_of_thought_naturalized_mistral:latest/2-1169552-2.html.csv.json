Look for rows in the table where the manufacturer is nine elms works and the wheel arrangement matches the claim (2 - 4 - 0wt). This will help to find possible candidates for the train model that match the requirements of the claim.\n   3. From step 2, we can see that row 13 has a matching manufacturer and wheel arrangement (nine elms works, 2 - 4 - 0).

Search the table for rows where the \"class\" column matches the given class name. In our table, we don't find any rows with the \"eagle\" class. This could potentially mean that no eagles were made. However, since there are other classes (like 177 and lion) which have multiple manufacturers, it is possible that the eagle was made by a manufacturer not listed here.\n3. To confirm our assumption from step 2, let's verify whether any row has \"eagle\" in the \"class\" column AND \"0\" in the \"preserved\" (or \"quantity preserved\") column - this would confirm that 0 eagles were preserved. In our table, we don't find any rows with both conditions met.\n4. However, since we didn't exhaustively scan all possible manufacturers, it is still possible that some eagle class locomotives were made and not preserved but are not accounted for in the provided table.\n5. As a final step, we should also consider that the claim only says \"15 of the eagle class were made\" without specifying whether they were all preserved or not. The provided data does not give us enough information to confirm this specific claim since it doesn't tell us how many eagles were made in total.\n\nIn summary, due to the limitations in the given data, we cannot definitively answer the claim as either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\".
