Scan through the table to find out who directed the episodes (column \"directed by\") and who wrote the episodes (column \"written by\").\n3. Observe that the column \"directed by\" has multiple instances of \"michael rauch\", which indicates he directed more than one episode. However, we do not know the exact number of episodes he directed yet.\n4. Similarly, observe that the column \"written by\" also has three instances of \"michael rauch\". This suggests that he wrote at least three episodes.\n5. To find out if he directed exactly 1 episode and wrote 3, we need to count the number of rows where his name appears in both columns (as director and writer).\n6. By examining each row, we can observe that \"michael rauch\" is listed as a writer but not as a director in rows 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10. In rows 2, 7, and 11, he is listed only as the director without any indication of writing the episode.\n7. Finally, we find that in row 6 (about face), \"michael rauch\" is both the director and writer of the episode.\n8. Count the number of rows where Michael Rauch appears as a writer and also as the director: 1 (row 6).\n9. Compare this count with the total number of times he wrote episodes: 3 (rows 2, 7, 11 do not count since he is only listed as the writer in these rows).\n10.

Next, we need to find the viewer count for each episode. We will sort the episodes by their viewer counts in descending order.
