We then look for the row in the table that has a \"series\" value equal to 54. This is row 9.\n3. In column 'written by', we find out who wrote the episode for series number 54.\n4. The 'written by' value for series number 54 is \"Jonathan Frakes, M Scott Veach & Rebecca Kirsch\".\n5. Comparing this to the claim, we see that M Scott Veach and Rebecca Kirsch did write the episode for series number 54.\n6.
