Identify the fighter whose fights we need to check: In this case, the claim does not specify a fighter, but the table only contains information about Gabriel Veiga. So, we will focus on Gabriel Veiga's fights.\n2. Check Gabriel Veiga's fights for fights in the third round: Scroll through the table and look for rows that have \"Gabriel Veiga\" in the first column (which represents the fighter names) and a value of 3 (round number) in the column that corresponds to the round number.\n3. Check if there is a match between Gabriel Veiga's name and the third round: We find one such row with row_index = 16, which indicates that Gabriel Veiga had a fight in the third round.\n4. Verify if it was a loss: In the column that corresponds to the results, we can see that the value for this row is \"win\" (row_index = 16), indicating that Gabriel Veiga did not lose in the third round.\n5. Final answer: Since Gabriel Veiga did not lose in the third round, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are as follows:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Fighter\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Round\"}\n]\n\nThe output in JSON format is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the fighter whose fights we need to check\",\n    \"Check Gabriel Veiga's fights for fights in the third round\",\n    \"Check if there is a match between Gabriel Veiga's name and the third round\",\n    \"Verify if it was a loss\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Fighter\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Round\"}\n  ]\n}",
