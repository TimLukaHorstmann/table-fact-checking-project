There are two such rows: Row 1 and Row 3.\n2. Next, we need to check if any of these rows have a hard value of 1 - 0 and a clay value of 0 - 0.\n3. Row 1 has a hard value of 0 - 0, which doesn't match the required condition, so we move on to row 3.\n4. Row 3 does indeed have a hard value of 1 - 0, which satisfies one part of the condition. We also need to check if it has a clay value of 0 - 0, and fortunately, in this case, it does.\n5.
