However, the table does not provide the names for each row, so we need to assume that the rows represent different tournaments, and each cell within a row represents the year and result for one specific tournament.\n\n2. Check the results for the US Open: For each year from 1980 to 1996, examine the corresponding cells in Row 4 (US Open). If there are any instances where the result is 'qf' (quarter-finalist), then Leconte was a quarter-finalist in the US Open.\n\n3. Check the results for the French Open: For each year from 1980 to 1996, examine the corresponding cells in Row 2 (French Open). If there are any instances where the result is 'qf' (quarter-finalist), then Leconte was a quarter-finalist in the French Open.\n\n4. Compare the results: If we find 'qf' for both the US Open and the French Open at least once, then the claim \"Leconte has been a quarter-finalist in both the US Open and the French Open\" is TRUE. Otherwise, if neither tournament had Leconte as a quarter-finalist, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the player from the table\",\n    \"Check the results for the US Open and French Open\",\n    \"Compare the results to determine if Leconte has been a quarter-finalist in both tournaments\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1985\" }, // US Open, quarter-finalist in 1985\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1985\" }, // French Open, quarter-finalist in 1985\n  ]\n}",
