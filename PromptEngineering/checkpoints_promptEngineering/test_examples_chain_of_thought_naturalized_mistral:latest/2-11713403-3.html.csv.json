Identify the relevant data from the table: The number of receptions (rec) for each player, as well as the number of touchdowns (td 's).\n2. Filter the players who have had multiple receptions: Go through the table and count how many times a player's row number appears more than once in the \"rec\" column. From this, we get a list of players who have made multiple receptions: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].\n3. From this filtered list, find the players who have also scored multiple touchdowns: Go through the table again and count how many times a player's row number appears more than once in the \"td 's\" column. From this, we see that only players with row numbers 1, 2, and 4 have scored multiple touchdowns from our initial list.\n4. Compare the two lists: Since the list of players who made multiple receptions ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) and the list of players who scored multiple touchdowns ([1, 2, 4]) have different members, it means that there are players with multiple receptions that do not have multiple touchdowns.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the number of receptions and touchdowns for each player.\",\n    \"Filter the players who have had multiple receptions.\",\n    \"Find the players who have also scored multiple touchdowns.\",\n    \"Compare the two lists to see if any players with multiple receptions do not have multiple touchdowns.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rec\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"td 's\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"rec\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"td 's\" },\n    // ... continue for all rows\n  ]\n}",
