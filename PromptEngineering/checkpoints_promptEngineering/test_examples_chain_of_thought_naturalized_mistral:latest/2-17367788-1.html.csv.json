    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the column where the points are stored. In the table, it is the 7th column labeled as \"points 1\".\n2. Next, we will go through each row and note down the value in the \"points 1\" column for comparison later.\n3. After all the values have been noted down, we can compare them to find if they are within the range of 25 and 71.\n\nNow let's check the values from the table:\n\n- Row 1: 71\n- Row 2: 65\n- Row 3: 62\n- Row 4: 62\n- Row 5: 59\n- Row 6: 58\n- Row 7: 57\n- Row 8: 57\n- Row 9: 55\n- Row 10: 53\n- Row 11: 44\n- Row 12: 42\n- Row 13: 40\n- Row 14: 39\n- Row 15: 39\n- Row 16: 38\n- Row 17: 37\n- Row 18: 35\n- Row 19: 34\n- Row 20: 34\n- Row 21: 33\n- Row 22: 33\n- Row 23: 32\n- Row 24: 25\n\nAs we can see, all the values are within the range of 25 and 71. Therefore, the number in the \"points 1\" column is indeed between 25 and 71.\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'points 1' column\", \"Go through each row and note down values in 'points 1'\", \"Compare all noted-down values to find if they are between 25 and 71\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"points 1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
