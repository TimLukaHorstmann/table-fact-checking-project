Assuming they belong to the Liberal Unionist Party for this analysis.)\n   - Liberal: 3 (The Hon Thomas Agar - Robartes, The Hon Harold Thomas Cawley, The Hon Oswald Cawley)\n   - Irish Parliamentary Party: 2 (William Hoey Kearney Redmond and Dr John Joseph Esmonde)\n   - Independent Unionist: 1 (Francis Bennett - Goldney)\n3. Compare the count of Conservative MPs to the total number of MPs: 10 out of 17 Conservative MPs + 2 Liberal Unionist Party MPs = 12 out of a total of 24 MPs.\n4. Since a majority is more than half of the total, compare 12 (the count of Conservative and Liberal Unionist MPs) to 13 (half of 26, which is the nearest whole number greater than 12). 12 > 13 means it is not a majority.\n5. Since a plurality is more than the largest minority, compare 12 (the count of Conservative and Liberal Unionist MPs) to the second-largest minority, which consists of 3 Liberal MPs. 12 > 3, so Conservative has the largest minority.\n6.
