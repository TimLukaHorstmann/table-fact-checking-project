    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. First, identify the competition mentioned in the claim (\"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\").\n2. Search for all rows in the table where the \"competition\" column matches the one identified above (2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier).\n3. The relevant cells for this step are:\n    - { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n    - { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n4. Verify if there's any additional information about the venue in these rows.\n5. The relevant cells for this step are:\n    - { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\" }\n    - { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"venue\" }\n6. As there's no information about the venue in either of these rows, the table does not provide any explicit information regarding whether or not the matches were played at Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila. However, the fact that multiple matches for the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier took place at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona suggests that this may not be the correct venue for all games.\n7.
