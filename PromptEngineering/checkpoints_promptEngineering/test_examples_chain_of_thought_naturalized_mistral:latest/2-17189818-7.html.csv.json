Examine the columns for each city where the players competed, looking specifically at the columns \"jermuk\" and \"nalchik\".\n3. Observe that the value under \"jermuk\" for Player Leko is indeed 100 (in row 7, column \"jermuk\").\n4. Similarly, observe that the value under \"nalchik\" for Player Leko is also 140 (in row 7, column \"nalchik\").\n\nThe final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player whose name is Peter Leko, examine 'jermuk' and 'nalchik' columns for this player\", \"Observe that the value under 'jermuk' for Player Leko is indeed 100\", \"Observe that the value under 'nalchik' for Player Leko is also 140\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nalchik\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify players who have 4 games played (played: 4) to find those relevant for the claim. This includes players with row numbers 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, and 19.\n2. Filter the list to only include players that qualified using the \"rl\" method (qual: rl). This leaves us with players from rows 7, 8, and 19.\n3. Check the Jermuk scores for these players. Row 7 has a Jermuk score of 20, row 8 has a Jermuk score of 100, and row 19 has a Jermuk score of 10.\n4. Compare the Jermuk scores of the remaining players to 140. Row 8 has a Jermuk score of 100 which is greater than 140, but rows 7 and 19 have Jermuk scores less than 140 (20 and 10 respectively).\n5. Since there is only one player (row 8) with a Jermuk score greater than 140 among the filtered players, we can conclude that it's not true that all players with 4 games played, rl qualification, and a Jermuk score of less than 140 do not exist. However, there is at least one player (row 7 or 19) who fits the condition in the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players with 4 games played, filter by rl qualification and Jermuk scores less than 140\", \"Compare the remaining players' Jermuk scores to 140\", \"Check if all remaining players have a Jermuk score greater than 140\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"}, {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"jermuk\"}]\n}",
