    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the age at which princess Louise got married. This information can be found under the 'date married' column. However, it doesn't provide explicit ages for the marriages, but instead gives years when the marriages took place.\n\n2. Next, we look up the exact birth year of princess Louise (1867) and find her parents' birth years to calculate her age during her marriage. Princess Louise was married in 1889, so we need to subtract this from 1867 to get the number of years between their births and deduct another year for Louise's age at the time of marriage (since she was married on the date provided).\n\n3. We know that both parents of princess Louise were born in 1841 (Edward VII) and 1865 (George V), respectively. Subtracting 1889 from these years gives us their ages at the time of their daughter's marriage: Edward VII was 48 and George V was 24. Adding Louise's age (22) to George V's age at that time (24) results in an approximate total age of 46 for Louise at the time of her marriage.\n\n4. Finally, we compare this calculated age with the claim: \"princess louise do not married until she be around 38 year old\". The calculated age is 46, which is greater than 38; therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the year of marriage for princess Louise, look up the birth years of her parents to calculate her age at the time of marriage, and compare it with the given claim.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"parent\"}\n  ]\n}",

Check for unique husband values in the column \"husband dates\".\n3. Compare the husband values for Princess Anne, who has two rows in the table due to her current status as a reigning princess (the table includes information both before and after her marriage). For this comparison, we will use the first row since it contains information about her earlier life when she had only one husband.\n4. The husband value for the first row of Princess Anne is \"mark phillips 1948 -\". This means that at some point in time, Princess Anne was married to Mark Phillips.\n5. The husband value for the second row of Princess Anne is \"sir timothy laurence 1955 -\", which represents her current marriage.\n6.
