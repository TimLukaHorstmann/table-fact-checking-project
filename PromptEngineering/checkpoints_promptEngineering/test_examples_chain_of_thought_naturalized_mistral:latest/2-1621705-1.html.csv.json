In our table, there are three types of pollutants: those that are only secondary, those that are only primary, and those that are both primary and secondary. Since we're interested in finding the ones that are only secondary, we can filter out the rows where 'type' is either 'primary' or 'both'.\n3.

Compare the minimum and maximum values from the extracted standards: To find the range, take the smallest and largest values among the found standard values. In this case, the smallest value is '0.030 ppm' (from Row 2, but considering it as the minimum since it doesn't have a standard value), and the largest value is '0.5 ppm'.\n5. Determine if there are any time range constraints: Scan through the rows to find any time ranges associated with the SO2 pollutant. We can see that SO2 standards can be found for 24-hour, annual, 3-hour, and undefined averaging times (as in Row 2).\n6. Check if the provided time range is within the found averaging times: The claim specifies a time range from annual to 2 hours.
