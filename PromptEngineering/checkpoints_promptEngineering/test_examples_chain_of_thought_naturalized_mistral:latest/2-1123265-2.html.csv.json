    "resp": "Here are the steps I followed to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the driver whose grid position we want to find: In this case, it's Tarso Marques.\n2. Search for the row in the table where the driver column matches the target driver (Tarso Marques): The relevant row is Row 22 since driver: tarso marques appears there.\n3. Note the grid value in the grid column of the found row: In this case, the grid value is 21. However, this is not our final answer because the grid position and the non-completion of laps are two separate pieces of information.\n4. Check if Tarso Marques completed any laps: We know that a driver's number of laps is given in the 'laps' column. In Row 22, there is no value for the 'laps' column, indicating that Tarso Marques did not complete any lap.\n5. Compare the grid position and the completed laps: Since Tarso Marques did not complete any lap (based on step 4), he started from a certain grid position but could not finish the race. Comparing this information with our initial assumption (grid position 13 but does not complete any lap), we find that both pieces of information are true for Tarso Marques.\n\nOutput:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the driver whose grid position and laps completion status we want to check\",\n    \"Search for the row in the table where the driver column matches the target driver\",\n    \"Note the grid value in the grid column of the found row\",\n    \"Check if the target driver completed any laps based on the 'laps' column\",\n    \"Compare the grid position and the completed laps to verify the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"driver\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"grid\" }\n  ]\n}",
