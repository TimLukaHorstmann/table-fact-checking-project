    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Bob Sand wrote episode 149.\n   2. Determine the table structure: The table provides information about different TV episodes, including their titles, directors, writers, original air dates, etc. Each row represents a single episode.\n   3. Find episode 149: We need to find the row where \"no in series\" is equal to 149 (since that's what the claim refers to). In this table, Row 5 has the information for episode 149 as it contains \"no in series: 149\".\n   4. Check the writer of the episode: In Row 5, we find that the written by column value is Bob Sand.\n   5. Compare with the claim: The person who wrote episode 149 (Bob Sand) matches the person mentioned in the claim.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Determine the table structure\", \"Find episode 149\", \"Check the writer of the episode\", \"Compare with the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}]\n}",
