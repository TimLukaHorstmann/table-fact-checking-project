Now, let's check the table:\n   - Player 'austin kafentzis' appears only once (row 1), so he plays only one position (quarterback).\n   - Players 'greg bryant', 'derrick green', 'kelvin taylor', 'laquvionte gonzalez', 'leonard fournette', 'tramel terry', 'jalen brown', 'kyle bosch', 'cameron hunt', and 'thomas duarte' each appear only once, so they each play only one position.\n   - Since player 'greg bryant' appears only once in the table (row 2), he plays only one position (running back).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check for duplicate players to find multiple positions per player\", \"Iterate through each row and check for duplicate players\", \"If a player appears more than once, the claim is TRUE.
