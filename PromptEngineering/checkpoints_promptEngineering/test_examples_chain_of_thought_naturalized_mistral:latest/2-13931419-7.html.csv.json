    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the team names involved in the claim: King and Penguin.\n2. Iterate through each row of the table to find a match where both the \"visitor\" or \"home\" columns contain either 'king' or 'penguin'.\n3. Check the dates for each match found, as we know that the event in question happened on March 20.\n4. Compare the scores at the matches found on March 20 to see if they match the claimed score of '2 - 4'.\n5. If a match is found with a score of '2 - 4', then the claim is TRUE. If no such match is found, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this problem would be those that correspond to the row(s) containing the team names 'king' and 'penguin' and the date 'March 20'. In this case, there is only one such row (Row 4), so the relevant_cells list would look like:\n\n[ { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\" } ]\n\nThe JSON output would be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [ \"Identify teams in the claim\", \"Iterate through each row of the table\", \"Check dates for each match found on March 20\", \"Compare scores to find a match with the claimed score of '2 - 4'\" ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\" } ]\n}",
