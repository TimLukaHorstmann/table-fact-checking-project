Since our claim states that Tony Lema makes it to the top 10 but does not continue on, we need to determine whether or not he made it to the top 10 in the PGA Championship and then find out if he played any further tournaments after this event (since \"does not continue on\" implies playing no more tournaments afterwards).\n4.
