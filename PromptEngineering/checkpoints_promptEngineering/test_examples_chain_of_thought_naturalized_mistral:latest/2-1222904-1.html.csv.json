Identify the years in the dataset that belong to the 1940s (1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1950 are the relevant years).\n\n2. Check how many rows in the table correspond to these identified years (in the given dataset, only the years 1947, 1948, 1949, and 1950 have corresponding entries).\n\n3.
