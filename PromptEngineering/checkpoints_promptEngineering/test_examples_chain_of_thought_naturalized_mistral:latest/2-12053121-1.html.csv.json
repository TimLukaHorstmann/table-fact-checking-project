Determine if there's a ship built in 1977 or later that entered service after 2003 and has a speed less than 27 knots. To do this, I will go through the table row by row and compare the \"built\" year with the \"entered service\" year and check if the \"knots\" value is less than 27.\n3. No ship in the table matches the conditions specified: all ships were built before 1978, none entered service after 2003, and all have speeds greater than or equal to 17.5 knots (the minimum speed in the table).\n4.
