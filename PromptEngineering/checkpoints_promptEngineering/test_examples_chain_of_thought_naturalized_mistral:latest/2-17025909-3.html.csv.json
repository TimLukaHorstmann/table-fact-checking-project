Check if Australia has any gold medals by looking at the \"gold\" column of the corresponding row. If there are any gold medals, then the claim would be FALSE since they would have more than 0 gold medals. However, in this case, we find that Australia has no gold medals (row 18, column \"gold\").\n3. Check if Australia has more than 1 bronze medal by looking at the \"bronze\" column of the corresponding row. If there are less than or equal to 1 bronze medals, then the claim would be FALSE since they do not have more than 1 bronze medal. However, in this case, we find that Australia has 1 bronze medal (row 18, column \"bronze\").\n4.
