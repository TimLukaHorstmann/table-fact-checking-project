From the table, we can see the following crowd sizes:\n    - Row 1: 13000 (Richmond vs St Kilda)\n    - Row 2: 11000 (Essendon vs North Melbourne)\n    - Row 3: 10000 (South Melbourne vs Melbourne)\n    - Row 4: 15000 (Geelong vs Footscray)\n    - Row 5: 10000 (Hawthorn vs Collingwood)\n    - Row 6: 33000 (Fitzroy vs Carlton)\n\n2. Next, we sort the crowd sizes in ascending order to compare them easily. The sorted list is:\n    - 10000 (South Melbourne vs Melbourne, Row 3)\n    - 10000 (Hawthorn vs Collingwood, Row 5)\n    - 11000 (Essendon vs North Melbourne, Row 2)\n    - 13000 (Richmond vs St Kilda, Row 1)\n    - 15000 (Geelong vs Footscray, Row 4)\n    - 33000 (Fitzroy vs Carlton, Row 6)\n\n3. Now we see that the game with South Melbourne and Melbourne (Row 3) is among the two games with the smallest crowd on 1st July 1933, since it shares the same crowd size (10000) as one other game (Hawthorn vs Collingwood, Row 5).\n\n4. To find out if it's exactly one of the two games with the smallest crowd, we need to compare the number of occurrences of this minimal crowd size in our sorted list. Since there are only two instances of the minimal crowd size (10000), we can conclude that the game with South Melbourne vs Melbourne is indeed one of the two games with the smallest crowd on 1st July 1933.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Gather all crowd sizes for games played on 1st July 1933 from the table, sort them in ascending order, and determine if the game with South Melbourne vs Melbourne (Row 3) is among the two games with the smallest crowd size.\",\n                      \"Find out if it's exactly one of the two games with the smallest crowd by comparing the number of occurrences of the minimal crowd size.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}]\n}\n```",
