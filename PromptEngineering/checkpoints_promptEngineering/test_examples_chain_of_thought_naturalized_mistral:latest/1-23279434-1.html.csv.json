The relevant columns are \"written by\" (column that contains the writer), \"title\" (contains the episode title), and \"season\" (contains the episode season).\n\n2. Examine each row of the table to find the episodes in season 13. To do this, we look for rows where the value in the \"season\" column is equal to 13. In our table, there are no such rows because the series numbers provided do not go up to 13.\n\n3. However, since the table seems to be a list of episodes from different seasons, it's possible that we have missed some episodes in our initial examination. To account for this possibility, we check if the season numbers in our table are in the correct sequence and if there is any gap between them. In this case, there does not seem to be any missing or misplaced episode.\n\n4.
