In the given data, there are multiple matches played at this venue, but not all of them are Euro 1980 qualifiers.\n2. Filter matches by competition: Among the matches played at Praterstadion, Vienna, we need to find the ones that were Euro 1980 qualifiers. In the given data, there are two such matches: rows 28 and 29.\n3. Check the score of these matches: The scores of these matches can be found in the \"score\" column. We need to verify if either of them is 4-0.\n4. Compare scores with claim: If any of the scores match the claimed score (4-0), then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\nMy final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the venue from the claim\",\n    \"Filter matches by competition (Euro 1980 qualifier)\",\n    \"Check the score of these filtered matches\",\n    \"Compare scores with claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 29,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
