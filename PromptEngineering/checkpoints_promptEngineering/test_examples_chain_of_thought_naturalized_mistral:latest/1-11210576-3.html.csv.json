Check if bob keaton has any final episode titled \"vengeance\". To do this, we need to compare the final episodes listed for each row with the title \"vengeance\". However, bob keaton's final episodes are listed as \"big brother\" in Row 17 and \"vengeance\" in Rows 17 (again), but it appears to be a duplicate row.

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the character for whom we are looking for the duration from episode 2x03 to 3x05. This information is not directly provided in the table, but we can deduce it by looking for Max Martini's character.\n\n2. We know that Max Martini plays Bob Keaton, who is a DEA Agent. To find his duration, we need to identify rows where the position matches \"DEA agent\" and the actor matches Max Martini.\n\n3. In our table, Row 17 matches these criteria: character is Bob Keaton, position is DEA agent, and actor is Max Martini.\n\n4. Now that we have found the relevant row, check if the given duration (02x03 - 03x05) is present in the table for this character.\n\n5. In Row 17, the first episode of Bob Keaton is \"big brother\" and the last episode is \"vengeance\". If we compare these episodes with our given range (02x03 - 03x05), we can see that \"big brother\" is earlier than 02x03 and \"vengeance\" is later than 03x05, so neither of them falls within the range 02x03 - 03x05. However, there are two instances where Bob Keaton's appearance overlaps with this range: 02x08 (which is earlier than 02x03) and 03x20-03x22 (which is later than 03x05). Unfortunately, the table does not provide specific episode counts for these ranges.\n\n6. Since the given duration is not explicitly present in the table, we cannot definitively say whether it's true or false based on the information provided. However, it seems likely that the duration 02x03 - 03x05 does not exist for Max Martini (Bob Keaton) as per this specific table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the character for whom we are looking for the duration from episode 2x03 to 3x05.\",\n    \"Find rows where the position matches DEA agent and the actor matches Max Martini.\",\n    \"Check if the given duration is present in the table for this character.\",\n    \"Since the given duration is not explicitly present in the table, we cannot definitively say whether it's true or false based on the information provided.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"Indeterminate\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"actor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
