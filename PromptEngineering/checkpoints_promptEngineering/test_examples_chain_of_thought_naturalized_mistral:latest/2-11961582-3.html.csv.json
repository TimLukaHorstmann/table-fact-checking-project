    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the game number corresponding to November 16th from the table. The date column helps us identify that the 8th game, with a date of November 16th, should be our focus as it is the closest to November 16th and there are no later dates in the table.\n\n2. Check the score of the 8th game as per the claim. According to the table, the score of the 8th game was indeed l 123 - 126 (loss with a score of 123 points against 126 points).\n\n3. Since both the identified score and the claimed score match, there is no need to look further. The claim is verified by comparing the table data with the provided claim.\n\nNow, let's format our answer as required:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the game number on November 16th from the table\", \"Check the score of the identified game against the claim score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
