In this case, we need to find the year where the qualification (qual) was 165.229 and check if there is a corresponding \"finish\" value for that row.\n\n2. Scan through the table to find a row with a qual column equal to 165.229. In this case, it can be found in Row 11 (year: 1970.0).\n\n3. Check if there is a corresponding \"finish\" value for that row. In this case, the finish value for Row 11 is 27.0.\n\n4.
