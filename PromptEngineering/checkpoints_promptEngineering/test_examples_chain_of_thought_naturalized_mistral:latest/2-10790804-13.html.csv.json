    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. First, we compare each home team score from the table to determine which team scored the highest points at 17.20 (since the claim mentions this specific score). The home teams are Geelong, Fitzroy, South Melbourne, Hawthorn, Richmond, and Essendon in the given order.\n   2. We compare each home team's score at row 1 (Geelong with 17.20 points) to the rest of the home team scores. In this case, Geelong has the highest score among all home teams.\n   3. Next, we check if any away team scored more than 17.20 points on August 1, 1936. To do this, we compare the home team scores from step 2 with the corresponding away team scores in each game (in the same order). In this case, North Melbourne scored 80 points, Melbourne scored 85 points, St Kilda scored 89 points, Footscray scored 69 points, Collingwood scored 96 points, and Carlton scored 118 points.\n   4. Since no away team score is greater than 17.20 points, we conclude that on August 1, 1936, at the 17.20 point mark, Geelong achieved the highest score of all teams and games in their specific match.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Compare home team scores to determine which has the highest score at 17.20 points\",\n    \"Compare corresponding away team scores to ensure no away team scored more than 17.20 points on August 1, 1936\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}",

Next, we will iterate through each team's score to check if any of them scored below 10 points. In this table, we find the following scores:\n   - Row 1: Home team score is 122 and Away team score is 80, both greater than 10\n   - Row 2: Home team score is 91 and Away team score is 85, both greater than 10\n   - Row 3: Home team score is 103 and Away team score is 89, both greater than 10\n   - Row 4: Home team score is 91 and Away team score is 69, both greater than 10\n   - Row 5: Home team score is 80 and Away team score is 96, both greater than 10\n   - Row 6: Home team score is 59 and Away team score is 118, both greater than 10\n3.
