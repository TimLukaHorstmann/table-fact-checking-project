    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the information needed from the table to verify the claim: We need to find a team with 114 played games, 107 points and specific details about the season 1987 - 88 (number of games and points).\n\n2. Examine each row in the table for the required information:\n   - Row 13 (talleres de cordoba): 114 played games, 109 points (not 107), and 1987 - 88: 27 games and 38 points. So this team doesn't match the claim exactly but has some of the required information.\n   - Rows with less than 114 played games are excluded because they don't meet one of the conditions in the claim.\n   - Rows with more than 107 points are also excluded, as their total points are greater than 107 (except for talleres de cordoba).\n\n3. Since none of the remaining rows match the specific team requirements, no exact match is found in the table for the claim \"114 be play when point be 107 and when 1987 - 88 be 31\".
