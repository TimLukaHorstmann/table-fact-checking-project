Compare the director values for both names: If we find a row where the \"director\" is either \"Andrew Davis\" or \"Rennie Harlin\", then we need to check if they are referring to different films. If the rows have the same title, then the claim is incorrect because Andrew Davis is not the director of a film directed by Renny Harlin.\n\n5.
