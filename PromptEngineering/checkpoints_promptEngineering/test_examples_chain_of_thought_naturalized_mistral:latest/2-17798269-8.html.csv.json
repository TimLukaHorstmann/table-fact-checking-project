    "resp": "Here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the games played by Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 and find their scores. The table provides dates, so we can confirm that these are all from March 2009.\n\n2. Then, we will look for the highest scoring game. To do this, compare each score row-by-row in the given table.\n\n3. In the table, we see multiple games against both Anaheim Ducks (rows 11, 13) and Edmonton Oilers (rows 9, 25). We will now check the scores of these games one by one.\n\n4. Row 11 shows a game against Anaheim Ducks with a score of 7 - 2, which is one possible highest scoring game.\n\n5. Row 13 shows another game against Anaheim Ducks with a score of 4 - 1. Since the initial game's score was higher (7 - 2), we don't need to compare any further games against Anaheim Ducks.\n\n6. Similarly, we look at the games against Edmonton Oilers. Row 9 shows a game with a score of 8 - 1 and row 25 shows a game with a score of 7 - 2. Since the earlier game's score was higher (8 - 1), we don't need to compare any further games against Edmonton Oilers.\n\n7. In conclusion, the highest scoring game for Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 was indeed against both Anaheim Ducks and Edmonton Oilers, specifically a game with an 8 - 1 score.\n\nNow, let's present the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the games of Colorado Avalanche in March 2009 from the given table, compare their scores to find the highest scoring game.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
