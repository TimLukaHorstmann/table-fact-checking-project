    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the songs mentioned in the claim: you don't bring me flowers (barbra streisand and neil diamond) and with a little luck (paul mccartney and wings).\n2. Find the rows in the table that match each song: Row 22 for you don't bring me flowers, and Row 10 for with a little luck.\n3. Extract the relevant information about the number of weeks on top from these rows: 3 weeks on top for you don't bring me flowers (from row 22), and 3 weeks on top for with a little luck (from row 10).\n4. Compare the number of weeks on top for each song: 3 weeks on top for you don't bring me flowers, and 6 weeks on top claimed in the statement.\n5. Since the actual number of weeks on top for you don't bring me flowers is less than the claimed number of weeks on top for with a little luck (3 < 6), the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify songs mentioned in claim\", \"Find rows in table that match each song\", \"Extract number of weeks on top from the rows\", \"Compare the number of weeks on top for each song\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"}]\n}",
