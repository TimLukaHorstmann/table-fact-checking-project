In this case, only one win against the Indianapolis Colts is recorded in row 11 with a result of W 16 - 0.\n   4. Compare the number of wins found in step 3 with the claim that the Indianapolis Colt defeat the Bucs \"2 times\" in 1985. Since only one win was found, it is clear that this claim is false.\n\nHere is the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team from the claim\",\n    \"Look for any rows where the opponent's name matches the identified team\",\n    \"Check if there are two wins against this team by examining the 'result' column\",\n    \"Compare the number of wins with the claim of '2 times'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
