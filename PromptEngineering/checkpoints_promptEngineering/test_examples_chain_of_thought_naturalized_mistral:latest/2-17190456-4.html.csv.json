    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the date specified in the claim (December 26). Find the corresponding row from the table where the 'date' matches this value. In this case, Row 12 has a date of December 26.\n\n2. Check if the home team for the game on this date is St. Louis or Pittsburgh. The home team in Row 12 (December 26) is St. Louis.\n\n3. Verify if the score for this match is 3-2 with the home team (St. Louis) scoring 3 points and away team (Pittsburgh) scoring 2 points. In Row 12, the score is indeed 3-2 (for St. Louis).\n\n4. Check if the total points accumulated by Pittsburgh at this point in time match the claim's value of 20 points. In order to do this, we have to find all rows related to Pittsburgh and add up their 'points' values.\n   - Adding the points for Pittsburgh from each row: Row 1 (Pittsburgh): 15, Row 5: 18, Row 11: 20, Row 12: 20. The total is 71 points. However, it's important to note that this calculation includes December 26 as well as other dates.\n   - To find the accumulated points for Pittsburgh on December 26 only, we need to compare with their previous point value and then add new points earned on December 26. From Row 1 (December 1), Pittsburgh had 15 points, so they scored additional 3 points on December 26 (score in row 12) that increases their total to 18 points.\n   - Now we can verify if the accumulated points for Pittsburgh at the end of December 26 matches the claim's value: The calculated points should be 15 (from Dec. 1) + 3 (additional points on Dec. 26) = 18, which is indeed equal to the claimed points value of 18.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the date from the claim\",\n    \"Find the corresponding row with the specified date\",\n    \"Check if the home team is St. Louis or Pittsburgh\",\n    \"Verify if the score for this match matches the claimed value (3-2)\",\n    \"Add up the points accumulated by Pittsburgh until December 26\",\n    \"Compare the calculated points on December 26 with the claimed points to ensure they match\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}",

Scan the table for rows where Pittsburgh is the visitor. There are 6 such rows (Rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 12).\n\n3. Check if any of these games meet the additional condition that the total points be less than 20.
