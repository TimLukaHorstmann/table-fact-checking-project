Compare the scores found for each team during this step.\n\nThe reasoning can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Row 1 (geelong) and Row 2 (collingwood) are not relevant to the claim since they do not involve Melbourne or South Melbourne.\n- Row 3 (carlton) is not relevant to the claim since it involves Carlton, not Melbourne or South Melbourne.\n- Row 4: home team = Melbourne, home score = 10.17 (77).
