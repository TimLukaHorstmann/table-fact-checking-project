Instead, they made it directly to the semifinals, with pourtaghi advancing to the final in Row 10 but losing, and azizpour not advancing past the semifinals in Row 11.\n\n5.

Determine how many Iranian athletes made it to the semifinals. Based on the table, no Iranian athlete advanced to the semifinal.\n3. Compare the counts from steps 1 and 2. If the number of athletes that made it to the semifinals is greater than or equal to half of the total number of athletes, then the claim is true. In this case, none of the Iranian athletes advanced to the semifinal, so the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of Iranian athletes in the table.\",\n    \"Determine how many Iranian athletes made it to the semifinals.\",\n    \"Compare the counts from steps 1 and 2.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"semiFinal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"semiFinal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"semiFinal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"semiFinal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"semiFinal\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"semiFinal\" }\n  ]\n}",
