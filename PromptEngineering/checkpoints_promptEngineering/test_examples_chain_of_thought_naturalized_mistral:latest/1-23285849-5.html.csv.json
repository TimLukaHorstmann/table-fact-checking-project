    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the answer:\n\n1. Identify the player we're looking for: In this case, it's Ty Lawson.\n2. Go through each game (row) in the table.\n3. For each game, find the high assists value: This will be under the \"high assists\" column.\n4. Compare the high assists value with Ty Lawson's performance: If the high assists value is equal to or greater than Ty Lawson's performance for that game, mark it as not relevant for our claim. Otherwise, mark it as potentially relevant.\n5. Count the number of games where Ty Lawson has the same or higher number of assists than the high assists value (potentially relevant games).\n6. Compare the count with 10: If the count is equal to or greater than 10, the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nAfter checking each game and performing the comparison as described above, we can see that Ty Lawson had a higher number of assists in six games (rows 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 13). So the claim is FALSE since he did not lead or tie for the lead in assists for 10 out of 13 games.\n\nHere's the JSON format of the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify Ty Lawson as the player to focus on, then compare his performance in each game with the high assists value.
