The Vancouver Grizzlies are listed from their inception until they moved to Memphis in 2001.\n\n2. Next, find the first row where the team name is changed from Vancouver Grizzlies to Memphis Grizzlies (row 8).\n\n3. Check if there's any row where both the 'season' and 'division' columns are 'Memphis Grizzlies'. This would indicate that the team has moved divisions.\n\n4. If a row with these conditions is found, it implies that the Grizzlies moved to another division between 2001 (the last season for Vancouver) and the subsequent seasons when Memphis appears in the table.\n\n5. To find out if they moved to the Southwest division specifically, we need to compare the 'division' column before and after the team name change.\n\n6. In the last four rows with Vancouver Grizzlies (rows 5 to 8), the division is consistently 'midwest'. After the team name change in row 8, the division in subsequent rows is 'Memphis Grizzlies', but this does not provide enough information about the specific division.\n\n7. To find out the division for Memphis Grizzlies, we look at the 'conference' and 'division' columns from row 9 onwards. We observe that after the team name change, the 'conference' remains constant as 'west', but the 'division' changes between 'southwest' and 'memphis grizzlies'.\n\n8. Unfortunately, the table does not provide enough information about which specific season the Grizzlies moved to the Southwest division. However, since we know they were still in the Midwest division during their last seasons as Vancouver Grizzlies, it is implied that they moved divisions at some point between 2001 and the subsequent seasons when Memphis appears in the table.\n\n9. Since we do not have the exact season when the Grizzlies moved to the Southwest division, we cannot definitively say which season they made the move.
