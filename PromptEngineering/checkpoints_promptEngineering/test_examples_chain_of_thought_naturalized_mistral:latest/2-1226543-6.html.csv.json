The relevant engines are unique across rows (Oldsmobile, Ford Cosworth DFX, Judd, Chevrolet, Mercedes - Benz IC108B).\n2. Count the number of times each engine appears as a starting point in a race (i.e., the \"start\" column for each row where the engine is Oldsmobile). For Oldsmobile, we find 5 instances: 1998, 1999, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001.\n3. Repeat step 2 for all other engines and compare the counts to see if any engine has more starts than Oldsmobile. For Ford Cosworth DFX: 6 instances (1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1992, 1993); Judd: 2 instances (1989, 1990); Chevrolet: 2 instances (1992, 2002); Mercedes - Benz IC108B: 1 instance (1995).\n4.

Compare the number of finishes for both teams: Since we don't have complete information about team 'simon', we can only compare team 'shierson' and 'rahal / hogan'. For team 'shierson', they have 3 finishes (7, 3, and 19). For team 'rahal / hogan', they have 1 finish (20).\n\n4. Determine the answer: If we compare the number of finishes for both teams, team 'shierson' has more finishes than team 'rahal / hogan'.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the explanation and final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all teams mentioned in the table\",\n    \"Find the number of finishes for each team\",\n    \"Compare the number of finishes for both 'shierson' and 'rahal / hogan'\",\n    \"Determine if they have the same amount of finishes\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"finish\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"finish\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. First, identify the team for which we are looking for finishes, which is 'simon'.\n   2. Iterate through each row to find all instances where the 'team' column matches 'simon'.\n   3. For those rows, note down the values in the 'finish' column as they represent the individual finishes for 'team simon'.\n   4. Sum up the individual finish values found in step 3 to get the total number of finishes for 'team simon'.\n   5. To check if a maximum number of finishes occurred in 1993, compare each year's finish value with 1993 (the earliest potential maximum year) and see if it is greater or equal. If a year has a greater or equal value, it means that the most finishes were not in 1993.\n   6. Repeat step 5 for all 'simon' rows found in step 2.\n   7. If no year has a greater or equal value than 1993's finish, then it is possible that 1993 had the most finishes.\n   8. To confirm if 1993 indeed had the most finishes, compare the total sum calculated in step 4 with the 'finish' values of each 'simon' row where the 'year' equals 1993. If the individual finish value for 1993 is equal to or greater than the total sum calculated in step 4, then it confirms that 1993 had the most finishes.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team: 'simon'\",\n    \"Find all instances where 'team' column equals 'simon'\",\n    \"For those rows, note down the values in the 'finish' column\",\n    \"Sum up individual finish values to get total finishes for 'team simon'\",\n    \"Compare each year with 1993 (the earliest potential maximum year) and see if it has a greater or equal value\",\n    \"If no year has a greater or equal value, then check if 1993 has the same or higher value as the total sum of finishes calculated earlier\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"finish\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"finish\"\n    },\n    ...
