In row 6, we can see that the candidate's name is \"mike huckabee\" and his cash on hand is indeed 603490.\n3. The total debt for this candidate is not directly given in the table but it can be calculated by subtracting the after debt value from the cash on hand value. In this case, Total Debt = Cash On Hand - After Debt = 603490 - 651300 (as per the claim)\n4. Since the total debt should be a negative value if it represents actual debt, the calculation above would result in a negative number. However, the table shows that after debt is 651300 which implies there is no debt for this candidate. This means our calculation for Total Debt is incorrect.\n5.
