Iterate through each row in the table:\n       a. If the team name matches \"triumph\", store the relevant data for further analysis (row_index and agg score).\n   3. Since we found \"triumph\" in row 6, we need to compare its aggregate score with \"telindus oostende\".\n   4. The aggregate score of triumph is given as 146 - 159 (78 + 68 from the two legs).\n   5. We need to find the aggregate score for telindus oostende, but it is not explicitly stated in the table. Instead, we see that triumph played against telindus oostende with a score of 78 - 78 (from the first leg) and 68 - 81 (from the second leg). This means that the total aggregate score for their matchup was 78 + 68 (first leg) + 68 + 81 (second leg), which equals 293.\n   6.
