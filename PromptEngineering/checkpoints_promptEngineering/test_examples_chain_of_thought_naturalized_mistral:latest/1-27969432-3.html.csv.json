Note down the \"no in series\" column values for these rows to compare them. For Dee Johnson, the values are 2, 18, and undefined (since it's not provided for row 8).\n   3. Sort the values obtained from step 2 in ascending order: [2, 18]. This implies that there is one value (2) which is smaller than the other (18).\n   4. Compare this sorted list with the index of Dee Johnson's episodes in the table. The index of the smallest value (2) corresponds to the episode titled \"Living Proof\" (row 2), which aired on August 1, 2011.\n   5. Since there is only one episode written by Dee Johnson that aired on August 1, 2011, and it has the smallest index among all episodes written by her, it follows that this is indeed the episode with the lowest number of episodes in the series that airs on August 1, 2011.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
