In this case, the team entries do not explicitly mention the drivers, but we can infer that teams are associated with specific years, so a driver would need to race in the same year for a particular team to score points.\n2. Look for rows where the entrant column contains any variation of \"Marc Surer\" (since the table does not provide individual driver entries). No such row is found.\n3. Check if there are any rows that have the same entrant, chassis, and engine as in the years 1985 and 1986 to ensure they represent Marc Surer's team in both years. This check is necessary because a single team might change its name or use multiple chassis models within a season or across seasons.\n4. Compare the rows where entrant = \"motor racing developments ltd\" (from 1985) and entrant = \"barclay arrows bmw\" (from 1986). The respective chassis are brabham bt54 and arrows a8, which are different models.\n5. Check the row where entrant = \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\" (from 1984), since it uses the same chassis (arrows a6) as the 1983 entry of Arrows Racing Team.
