    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the player for whom we need to find the finish position and total score: Tiger Woods\n2. Find all rows in the table where the \"player\" column matches \"tiger woods\": Row 3\n3. Extract the relevant information from that row, specifically the \"finish\" and \"total\" columns: \"t12\" and \"282\" respectively\n4. Compare the extracted finish position (\"t12\") with the claim's finish position (\"tie for 12th\"): They are the same\n5. Since both positions match, we can conclude that Tiger Woods did indeed tie for 12th with a score of 282\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify player in claim\", \"Find rows where 'player' matches claimed player\", \"Extract relevant information from matching row\", \"Compare extracted data to the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"finish\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]\n}\n```",
