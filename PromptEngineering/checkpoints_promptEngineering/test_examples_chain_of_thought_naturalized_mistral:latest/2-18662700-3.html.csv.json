The time given (7:09.06) has two decimal places, while the other times have three decimal places (e.g., 7:11.17). If we assume that the missing digit is 0, the shared time would be 7:09.060, and it would match with row 2's time. However, since the table has inconsistent formatting for times, we cannot confirm whether there is a tie or not based on this data alone. It would require either adjusting the formatting to be consistent or looking at additional relevant information (such as a tiebreaker rule) to make a definitive determination.",
