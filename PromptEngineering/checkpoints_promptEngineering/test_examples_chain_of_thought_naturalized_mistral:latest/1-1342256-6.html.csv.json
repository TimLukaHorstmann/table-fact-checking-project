Check each of these rows to see if the incumbent was re-elected. (district 3, 7, 10, 16 all have \"result: re - elected\")\n3. Verify that there were no challengers for the Democrat in any of these districts (districts 3, 7, and 10 have \"candidates: <incumbent> (<party>) unopposed\", district 16 has no candidates section)\n4. Compare the results from steps 2 and 3 to see if there's a pattern of Democrats maintaining their seats when they don't face opposition. (All re-elected incumbents didn't have opponents, so the party maintained the office in these cases.)\n5. Check the remaining row where the Democrat lost the seat (district 17). Since there was an election and a Republican gained the seat, this case doesn't fit the pattern specified in the claim.\n6. Since only the cases that meet the conditions of the claim were considered and all of them showed the party maintaining the office when they didn't face opposition, it can be concluded that the claim is mostly true for the given table, but not universally true due to the exception observed in district 17.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify rows where the party is Democrat\",\n    \"Check if the incumbent was re-elected\",\n    \"Verify that there were no challengers for the Democrat\",\n    \"Compare results to see if the pattern holds\",\n    \"Check remaining row to identify exceptions\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"MOSTLY_TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"party\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"candidates\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"party\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"candidates\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"party\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"candidates\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"party\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"candidates\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"party\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"candidates\" }\n  ]\n}",
