The fighter's name isn't specified, but we can find it by looking for the highest win count (number of wins greater than losses).\n2. Scan through the rows in the table and find the row with the maximum number of wins. In this case, it's row 1 (res: win, record: 13 - 10) because no other row has more wins than this one.\n3. Check if any other rows have the same or higher total wins but a different loss count. If there are such rows, choose the one with a lower loss count as the fighter with the highest win-loss record.
