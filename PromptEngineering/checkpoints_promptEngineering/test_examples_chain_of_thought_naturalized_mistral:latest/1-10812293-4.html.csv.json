    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the game for which we need to check whether the high point score was more than 25. In this case, it's the game on December 20.\n   2. Look for the row in the table that corresponds to this date (December 20). The relevant row is Row 11 as it shows the date \"december 20\".\n   3. Find the column that represents the high points for each game. In this table, it's the 'high points' column.\n   4. Check the value in the 'high points' column of the identified row (Row 11). The value is \"fred jones (23)\" which indicates that Fred Jones scored 23 points.\n   5. Compare the found value with the claim's condition: 25 > 23. Since 25 > 23, the condition is not met.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the game for which we need to check the high points score.
