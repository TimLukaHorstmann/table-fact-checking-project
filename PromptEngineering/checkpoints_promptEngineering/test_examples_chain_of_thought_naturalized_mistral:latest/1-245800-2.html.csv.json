    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the expeditions mentioned in the claim: `expedition: salyut 6 - eo - 1` and `expedition: salyut 6 - ep - 1`.\n\n2. Check each row of the table to find the ones that match the given expedition numbers (e.g., rows where the 'expedition' column contains \"salyut 6 - eo - 1\" or \"salyut 6 - ep - 1\").\n\n3. For each matching row, verify whether the crew listed in the table matches the crews mentioned in the claim (e.g., for `expedition: salyut 6 - eo - 1`, the crew should be 'yuri romanenko' and 'georgi grechko', and for `expedition: salyut 6 - ep - 1`, the crew should be 'vladimir dzhanibekov' and 'oleg makarov').\n\n4. If both crews match for their respective expeditions, then the claim is TRUE. If either crew does not match, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the expeditions mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Check each row to find matching expedition numbers\",\n    \"Verify whether the crew listed in the table matches the crews mentioned in the claim for each matching row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crew\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"crew\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExplanation: The relevant cells refer to the crew columns for the expeditions salyut 6 - eo - 1 and salyut 6 - ep - 1. The claim is not true because the crew listed in the table for salyut 6 - eo - 1 is 'yuri romanenko georgi grechko', which does not match the crews mentioned in the claim (yuri romanenko and georgi grechko are part of the crew, but they should be together). For salyut 6 - ep - 1, the listed crew is 'vladimir dzhanibekov oleg makarov', which matches the crews mentioned in the claim. However, this does not make the claim true as a whole because the crew for salyut 6 - eo - 1 did not match.",
