Next, we need to compare the area of the Saint James parish with other parishes in Charlotte County. To do this, we will look for the areas of all the parishes in the table.\n   3.

Now, we will go through all the rows to check if there's any other parish with a larger area than Saint James. We compare the found area (555.99) with each parish's area in the table:\n       - No parishes have a larger area, as their areas are lower than 555.99 (499.51, 363.88, 104.41, 189.91, 39.59, 209.4, 37.93, 236.76, 78.67, 24.38, 12.4, 375.06, 6.2, 492.84).\n   5.
