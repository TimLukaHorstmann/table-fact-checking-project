Check if there exists any row with the release date matching 1954 - 09 - 04 (column name: 'release date'). This will help us narrow down our search to relevant rows.\n\n3. Of the remaining rows, check if any of them have a director as Robert McKimson (column name: 'director'). This will further help us narrow down our search to relevant cells with both release date and director as required by the claim.\n\n4. From the remaining rows with both release date and director matching the claim, verify if there exists any cell where the production number is greater than 1289 (column name: 'production number'). This will help us determine if any of the remaining rows satisfy the production number requirement stated in the claim.\n\n5. Lastly, check if among the remaining cells that meet all the above criteria, there exists a cell where the title matches \"Sheep Ahoy\" (column name: 'title').
