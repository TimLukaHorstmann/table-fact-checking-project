    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify the target years mentioned in the claim: 2010 and 2014 (there's no year mentioned for the runner-ups, so we will look for any matches regardless of the year).\n2. Check each row of the table to see if it contains a margin of victory of 1 stroke, since that is one of the target values in the claim. This happens on Row 3 for Corey Pavin in 2010 (margin of victory: 2 strokes minus 1 stroke to account for the claim).\n3. Since we found a match in step 2, we now check if there's a runner-up mentioned in the table that matches the name provided in the claim for that specific year. In Row 3, the runner-up is Corey Pavin, which matches the claim for 2010.\n4. Now, let's find any other occurrences of a margin of victory of 1 stroke across the entire table to see if there are matches in 2014 or later years. There is no such match.\n5. We didn't find any more matches for the margin of victory of 1 stroke, so we cannot claim that it happens again in another year.\n6. Since we found a match for the claimed margin of victory and runner-up in the correct year (2010), we now need to check if there is another occurrence of a 1-stroke margin of victory in a different year with a different runner-up. However, since we didn't find any more matches for the 1 stroke margin of victory, it means that there are no such occurrences.\n7. Now, let's check if there is a match for the claimed margin of victory (1 stroke) in another year with the same runner-up from the original match (Corey Pavin). However, since we found the match only once and didn't find any other matches, it means that this requirement is not met either.\n8. Since we satisfied all the conditions mentioned in the claim for one occurrence (2010 with Corey Pavin), and there are no additional requirements that contradict this single match, we can conclude that the claim is true for one specific instance. However, it is false if we consider the claim as a whole since it suggests multiple occurrences of 1 stroke margin of victory in 2010 and 2014 with Corey Pavin and Gary Hallberg as runner-ups, respectively.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify target years: 2010 and 2014\",\n    \"Check each row for a margin of victory of 1 stroke\",\n    \"Found match for Corey Pavin in 2010 (Row 3)\",\n    \"Check if runner-up matches the claim\",\n    \"Found match for Corey Pavin as the runner-up\",\n    \"Check if there are other occurrences of a 1 stroke margin of victory\",\n    \"Did not find any such matches\",\n    \"Check if there's another occurrence with a different runner-up from the original match\",\n    \"Did not find any additional matches\",\n    \"Since we found one specific instance that satisfies the claim, but not as a whole, output the answer\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
