    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find the game where team Portland plays against Houston, which can be identified by looking for a row where the 'team' column has either 'Portland' or 'Houston'. In this table, we only have one such matchup, which is game 3 (row 3).\n2. Next, we need to check if any of Vince Carter or Hakeem Olajuwon had the highest rebounds in that specific game. In row 3, 'high rebound' column has 'Vince Carter, Hakeem Olajuwon (7)' which means both players tied for the highest number of rebounds. However, since 'high points' also indicate individual performance and Vince Carter had higher points in this game, we would typically assume that he was the high scorer and not the high rebounder if both were tied.\n3. To confirm this assumption, we should look at other games where either Vince Carter or Hakeem Olajuwon has the highest number of rebounds to ensure they are indeed the high rebounders in most cases when they tie. Unfortunately, the table only shows two instances (game 62 and game 8) where both players had the highest number of rebounds, making it difficult to make a definitive conclusion based on other games.\n4. However, considering that Vince Carter was the high scorer in this specific game, we can infer that Hakeem Olajuwon was not the high rebounder in this game.\n5. Since our claim is specifically about game 62 and we found out that neither of the players was the high rebounder in this game, our final answer will be 'FALSE'.\n\n   Final Answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the relevant matchup between Portland and Houston\",\n       \"Check if Vince Carter or Hakeem Olajuwon were the high rebounders in that game\",\n       \"Assume that when tied for highest rebounds, Vince Carter was the high scorer and not the high rebounder\",\n       \"Check other instances where both players had the highest number of rebounds to confirm the assumption\",\n       \"Since our claim is specific to game 62 and we found out that neither player was the high rebounder in this game, conclude that the answer is 'FALSE'\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebound\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\" }\n     ]\n   }",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the validity of the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to find the game on March 10th from the table. This information is available in the \"date\" column. The date \"march 10\" appears in row 6, which corresponds to the Orlando game.\n2. Second, we need to check if Vince Carter scored the highest points in this game. In the Orlando game (row 6), the high points were scored by Vince Carter with 16 points. However, the claim states that Vince Carter scored 43 points on March 10th, which is not the case according to the data.\n3. Third, we need to check if Alvin Williams had the highest assists in this game. In the Orlando game (row 6), the high assists were made by Chris Childs with 7 assists. However, the claim states that Alvin Williams had 9 assists on March 10th, which is not the case according to the data.\n4. Based on steps 2 and 3, we can conclude that the claim \"on march 10 , vince carter (43) have high point and alvin williams (9) have high assist\" is FALSE as the provided data does not support these values for the game on March 10th.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
