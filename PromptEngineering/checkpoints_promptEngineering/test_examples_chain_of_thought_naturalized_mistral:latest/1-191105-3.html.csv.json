In our table, there is only one episode with that subject, which is titled \"telegraph line\" and performed by Jaime aff and Christine Langner.\n2. Next, check if any of these episodes have music composed or performed by George Newall or The Tokens. In our table, neither George Newall nor The Tokens performed an episode about the nervous system. However, we can see that \"george newall\" composed music for another episode titled \"them not - so - dry bones\", but this episode is about the skeletal system, not the nervous system.\n3. Since there's no episode where both the subject is the nervous system and George Newall or The Tokens are involved in performance or composition, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nHere's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify episodes about the nervous system\",\n    \"Check if George Newall or The Tokens are involved in any of these episodes\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"subject\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"performed by\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"performed by\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
