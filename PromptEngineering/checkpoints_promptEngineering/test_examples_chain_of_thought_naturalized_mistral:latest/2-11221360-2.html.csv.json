Find the rows in the table that correspond to these fights based on the opponent names (Daisuke Ishizawa in Row 5 and Manabu Inoue in Row 10).\n3. Compare the methods of victory for each fight - unanimous decision for both fights, but the round and time are different (Round 2, Time: 5:00 for Daisuke Ishizawa and Round 2, Time: 5:00 for Manabu Inoue).\n4. Determine if there's a difference in the results of the fights - both fights resulted in wins for Usui, so the records are different (8-6-1 for Daisuke Ishizawa and 5-5 for Manabu Inoue).\n5. Identify the \"convincing\" aspect - a convincing victory is typically defined by a significant difference in skill level, domination of the fight, or a decisive outcome (such as a knockout or submission). Since both fights ended in decisions and the records show that Usui had more wins in the fight against Daisuke Ishizawa, it can be argued that the victory over Daisuke Ishizawa may have been more convincing due to the additional wins on his record.\n6. Summarize the conclusion - Based on the comparison and definition of a \"convincing\" victory, we cannot definitively state whether Usui defeated Daisuke Ishizawa more convincingly than he defeated Manabu Inoue because it is subjective and depends on factors not provided in the table.
