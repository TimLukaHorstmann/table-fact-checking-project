Identify the claim we are trying to verify, which is whether or not on October 29, the Kansas City Chiefs play at 1:00 PM in Three Rivers Stadium.\n\n2. Scan through the table to find a row that matches the date and team specified in the claim.\n\n3. In the table, Row 8 corresponds to the week of October 29 and the opponent is Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n4. Verify if the time mentioned in the claim matches the time given in the table. The claimed time is 1:00 PM, and in the table for this row, the time is also 1:00 PM.\n\n5. Verify if the location mentioned in the claim matches the location given in the table. In the table, it is confirmed that the location was Three Rivers Stadium on October 29.\n\nSince all conditions in the claim have been matched and verified, we can conclude that the Kansas City Chiefs did indeed play at 1:00 PM in Three Rivers Stadium on October 29.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Check the date, opponent, time, and location specified in the claim against the table\", \"Find row that matches the date (Oct 29) and opponent (Kansas City Chiefs)\", \"Verify if the time and location in the table match the ones claimed.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"time ( et )\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"}]\n}",

After the game with the New England Patriots (week 15), the team's record would have increased since they won that game (record: 8 - 7 in row 15). To verify this, we can check the subsequent rows after row 15 to ensure there is no other instance of a 3 - 4 record.\n   4.
