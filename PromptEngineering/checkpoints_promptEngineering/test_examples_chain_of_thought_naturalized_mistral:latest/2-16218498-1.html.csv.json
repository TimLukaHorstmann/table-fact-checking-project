Identify the games to compare: The 4th game on the list is between LPRC Oilers (team 1) and Mighty Blackpool (team 2), with an aggregate score of 2 - 3, and the 6th game on the list is between Port Autonome (team 1) and Sporting Clube da Praia (team 2), with an aggregate score of 0 - 0.\n\n2. Determine if either game has already ended: Both games have two legs, so we need to compare their scores from both legs to determine the overall higher scoring game. Neither of these games has more than two legs completed, so we can't definitively say which one is higher scoring at this point. However, it's clear that if the 4th game (LPRC Oilers vs Mighty Blackpool) continues and reaches a conclusion, it will be a higher scoring game since it already has more aggregate goals than the 6th game (Port Autonome vs Sporting Clube da Praia).\n\n3. State the final answer: Since we cannot definitively say whether the 4th game will reach a conclusion that makes it higher scoring without more information, our final answer must be \"FALSE\" in this context because we can't compare two games where one is still ongoing.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"agg\" }\n]",
