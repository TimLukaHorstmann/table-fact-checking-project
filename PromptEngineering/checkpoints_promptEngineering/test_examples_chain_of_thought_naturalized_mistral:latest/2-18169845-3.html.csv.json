    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the year for which we are checking awards: 2010 (from all rows)\n2. Find the number of nominations for The Addams Family musical in Tony Awards:\n   - Check for a row with \"award\": \"tony award\", \"year\": 2010, and category either \"best original score\" or \"best performance by a featured actor in a musical\". Since Andrew Lippa was nominated for the former category and Kevin Chamberlin was nominated for the latter, there are at least two nominations.\n3. Check if The Addams Family musical has more than two nominations in Tony Awards:\n   - No other row matches the condition in step 2, so it has exactly 2 nominations in Tony Awards.\n4. Find the number of nominations for The Addams Family musical in Drama Desk Awards and Drama League Awards:\n   - Check each row with \"award\": \"drama desk award\" or \"drama league award\", \"year\": 2010, and category can be any, as there could be nominations in various categories. Count the number of rows where the musical or its cast is nominated.\n5. Check if The Addams Family musical has more than 2 + (number of nominations from steps 4) nominations in total:\n   - In Drama Desk Awards, it was nominated in 5 categories and won once. In Drama League Awards, it was nominated twice. So, there are a total of 7 nominations for The Addams Family musical in Drama Desk Awards and Drama League Awards.\n6. Add the number of nominations from Tony Awards (2) to the number of nominations from steps 5: 2 + 7 = 9\n7. Check if there are any additional awards won by The Addams Family musical other than the one in Drama Desk Awards:\n   - Find a row with \"year\": 2010, and award that is not \"tony award\", \"drama desk award\", or \"drama league award\" (as we have checked these already) where The Addams Family musical won.\n   - The winning award for The Addams Family musical was the \"outstanding set design\" in the Drama Desk Awards, as seen in row 9.\n8. Add the number of awards won by The Addams Family musical: 1 (from step 7) + 0 (as no other award was found) = 1\n9.

Check if there is any row corresponding to \"award: tony award, category: outstanding music\" and \"award: tony award, category: outstanding lyrics\". No such rows are found in the table, so we can't confirm whether \"the addams family musical be nominated for tony award outstanding music and outstanding lyric.\"\n\n3. However, since we have seen nominations for the Drama Desk Award in the categories of outstanding music (Row 7) and outstanding lyrics (Row 8), we know that the musical was indeed nominated for those awards.\n\n4.

    "resp": "1. Identify the award-winning productions from the table: The production was nominated for multiple Tony, Drama Desk, Drama League, and Outer Critics Circle awards. To find out if it won more awards than any other cast member, we need to compare the number of awards won by the production against the number of awards won by individual cast members.\n\n2. Count the number of awards for the production: The production was nominated in various categories but only won one award (Outstanding Set Design - Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch). Since it won one award, we know that the production did not win more awards than any individual cast member.\n\n3. Count the number of awards for each cast member: Nathan Lane was nominated for 5 awards (Tony, Drama Desk, Drama League, OCC - Outstanding Actor in a Musical, and Drama League Distinguished Performance) and won 2 awards (Drama League Distinguished Achievement in Musical Theatre and Drama League Distinguished Performance). Bebe Neuwirth was nominated for 3 awards (Tony, Drama Desk, OCC - Outstanding Actress in a Musical) and won 2 awards (Drama League Distinguished Performance and Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical). Kevin Chamberlin was nominated for 4 awards (Tony, Drama Desk, Drama League, and OCC - Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical) but did not win any. Carolee Carmello was nominated for 3 awards (Tony, Drama Desk, and OCC - Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical) but did not win any.\n\n4. Compare the number of awards won by the production against individual cast members: Since the production won one award and no individual cast member won more than two, it is clear that the \"Addams Family\" musical's Nathan Lane and distinguished production of a musical were not nominated for more awards than any other cast member.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify award-winning productions, Count the number of awards for the production, Count the number of awards for each cast member, Compare the number of awards won by the production against individual cast members\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
