If we find an album that has a higher position, then the claim is FALSE because the album \"unwritten\" by natasha bedingfield does not have the highest position among all albums listed.\n4. Check every row in the table to ensure no album has a higher position than 1 (the position of \"unwritten\"). Since we didn't find any, we confirm that the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare each row for the title 'unwritten', Find the highest position for this album, Compare found highest position with positions listed in the table\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"highest position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"highest position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"highest position\"\n    },\n    ...
