    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim components: The claim consists of three parts - a place (t6), money amount greater than 17333, and player from Australia (seve ballesteros).\n\n2. Check for t6 in the table: Scan the table to find the rows that have 'place' as t6.\n\n3. Compare money amounts for t6: For each row where place is t6, compare their money amounts with 17333. If any of these amounts are greater than 17333, then the claim about money amount is TRUE.\n\n4. Check if player is seve ballesteros: Once we have found a player in t6 whose money is greater than 17333, verify that this player is not from Australia (seve ballesteros is Spanish).\n\n5. Check for players from Australia: Scan the entire table to see if any player from Australia (Greg Norman, Ian Woosnam, Nick Faldo, etc.) has t6 as their place. If so, the claim about the country is FALSE.\n\n   After following these steps, we can output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the components of the claim\",\n       \"Check for t6 in the table\",\n       \"Compare money amounts for t6 with 17333\",\n       \"Check if player from Australia is present as t6\",\n       \"If no player from Australia as t6, then the claim is TRUE\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"money\" }\n     ]\n   }",
