Go through each row of the table to find players who were drafted by Ottawa Senators\n3. Check their nationalities to determine if they are American or not\n4. Count the number of Americans and non-Americans among those picked by Ottawa Senators\n5. Compare the count of Americans against the total count of picks by Ottawa Senators in 2009 to see if the majority are non-American\n\nBased on this process, let's check each row:\n\n1. Jared Cowen (Canada) was drafted by the Spokane Chiefs (WHL), not Ottawa Senators - skipping this row\n2. Jakob Silfverberg (Sweden) was not drafted by Ottawa Senators - skipping this row\n3. Robin Lehner (Sweden) was drafted by Columbus and traded to Ottawa, making him a non-American pick for Ottawa Senators\n4. Chris Wideman (United States) was picked in the 4th round, not Ottawa Senators - skipping this row\n5. Mike Hoffman (Canada) was not drafted by Ottawa Senators - skipping this row\n6. Jeff Costello (United States) was drafted by Boston and traded to Phoenix, then to Ottawa, making him an American pick for Ottawa Senators\n7. Corey Cowick (Canada) was not drafted by Ottawa Senators - skipping this row\n8. Brad Peltz (United States) was not drafted by Ottawa Senators - skipping this row\n9. Michael Sdao (United States) was drafted by Edmonton and traded to Ottawa, making him an American pick for Ottawa Senators\n\nFrom the table analysis, only Jeff Costello (row 6) and Michael Sdao (row 9) were picked by Ottawa Senators, with one being American (Jeff Costello) and the other not American (Michael Sdao). Since there are only two picks in total, and one is American, it means that most draft picks in 2009 for the Ottawa Senators are non-American.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
