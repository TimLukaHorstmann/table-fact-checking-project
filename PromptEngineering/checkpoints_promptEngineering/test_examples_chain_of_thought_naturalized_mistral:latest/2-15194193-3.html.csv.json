This implies we need to find out how many points he has won in his races, and how many of those races he actually won.\n\n2. Identify which team Alberto Pagani raced for: To do this, I will look through the table for a row where the column 'team' contains the name of a team that Alberto Pagani might have ridden for. Since there is no explicit mention of Alberto Pagani in the table, we can assume he rode for any of the teams appearing multiple times across the years (as it is likely that a single racer would race with only one team). In this case, Aermacchi appears frequently throughout the years. However, without knowing who Alberto Pagani is exactly, I cannot definitively say he raced for Aermacchi.\n\n3. If we find out that Alberto Pagani did indeed ride for a certain team in the table, then we would need to look for all the instances where that team won races and record their points. We would also need to count how many times they actually won races (number of rows with 'wins' equal to 1).\n\n4. Calculate the average points per race win for that particular team by dividing the total points they won in races they won by the number of races they won.\n\n5.
