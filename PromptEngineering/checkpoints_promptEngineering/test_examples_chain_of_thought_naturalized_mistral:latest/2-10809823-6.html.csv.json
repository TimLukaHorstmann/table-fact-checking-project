In Row 5, I will compare North Melbourne with the teams in the claim. North Melbourne is still not in the claim, so I will move on to the last row.\n7. In Row 6, I will compare Richmond with the teams in the claim. Richmond is not in the claim, but I notice that one of the away teams in the table (Geelong) is in the claim. However, to verify if any other home team mentioned in the claim appears in the table, I should compare the remaining away teams from the table with those in the claim.\n8.
