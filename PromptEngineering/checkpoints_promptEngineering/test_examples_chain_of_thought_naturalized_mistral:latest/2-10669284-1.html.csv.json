Check the table row by row for the specified year (1977). Note that a \"winner\" outcome indicates a match win, but the score in the final may differ depending on whether it's a straight-set victory or a three-set victory.\n3. In 1977, there are two rows (rows 17 and 18) with \"outcome: winner\". For row 17, the tournament is Indianapolis, and for row 18, it's Santiago.\n4. Examine the scores in the final for these matches. A straight-set victory would mean the score is either 'w / o', '3 - 0', or '2 - 0'. If the score in any of the finals in 1977 includes more than two sets (indicated by a set score other than '3 - 0' or '2 - 0'), then there were two matches played for a win.\n5. In row 17, the score is '6 - 7', '6 - 4', and '6 - 3'. This indicates three sets were played, so it is not a straight-set victory.\n6. In row 18, the score is '5 - 7', '6 - 1', and '6 - 1'. This also indicates three sets were played, so it is not a straight-set victory.\n7.
