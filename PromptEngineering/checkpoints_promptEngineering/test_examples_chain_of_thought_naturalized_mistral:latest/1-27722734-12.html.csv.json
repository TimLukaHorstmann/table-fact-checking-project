The table lists the dates, teams, and locations of each game played by the New Orleans team during this season. Since there's no game on April 17, it implies that either the game was played without any attendance or at a different venue that is not mentioned in our table.\n\n2. To verify if the Los Angeles Lakers rest on April 17, we can compare the given dates with the home games listed for the Los Angeles Lakers (New Orleans Arena) in the table. There are no matches listed for April 17 or subsequent days at the New Orleans Arena which suggests that the Los Angeles Lakers might have been resting on those days.\n\n3. Finally, to confirm if it was indeed a rest day, we would need to look up external sources like NBA schedules from the 2010-11 season to verify whether the Los Angeles Lakers were resting or playing at an unlisted venue during that time.
