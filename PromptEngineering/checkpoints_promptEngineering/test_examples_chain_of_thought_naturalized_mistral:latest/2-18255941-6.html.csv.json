From the found rows, identify the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals by looking at the draw date column. The relevant rows are 11 (round of 16) and 12 (quarter-finals).\n\n4. In the row for the quarter-finals (row 12), find the first leg date: \"5 - 6 april 2011\". This indicates that at least one leg of the quarter-final matches was in April 2011.\n\n5. Since we have found a match with April, we know that the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the start date for the quarter-finals and semi-finals from the table\",\n    \"Scan through the table to find the rows with the relevant phases (knockout phase, round of 16, quarter - finals, or semi - finals)\",\n    \"From the found rows, identify the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals by looking at the draw date column\",\n    \"In the row for the quarter-finals (row 12), find the first leg date: '5 - 6 april 2011'\",\n    \"Since we have found a match with April, we know that the claim is FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"first leg\" }\n  ]\n}",
