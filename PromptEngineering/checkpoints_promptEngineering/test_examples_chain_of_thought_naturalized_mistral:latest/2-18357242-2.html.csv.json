    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. First, identify all the drivers from the American Spirit Team Johansson to check if they meet the conditions in the claim.\n   2. Go through the table row by row and find the drivers who are on this team by checking the \"team\" column for matches with \"American spirit team johansson\".\n   3. For each driver from the American Spirit Team Johansson, check their points and grid positions as mentioned in the claim.\n       a. Check if they have fewer than 2 points by comparing their points (found in the \"points\" column) to 2.\n       b. Check if their grid position is larger than 4 by comparing their grid position (found in the \"grid\" column) to 4.\n   4. If both conditions are met for a driver, mark them as satisfying the claim.\n   5. Repeat step 3 for all drivers from the American Spirit Team Johansson.\n   6. Check if there are any drivers who do not satisfy the claim but were initially included in the list of drivers from the American Spirit Team Johansson. If so, mark them as not satisfying the claim.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify drivers from American Spirit Team Johansson\", \"Check points and grid positions for each driver\", \"Compare results with given conditions\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the team name: Patrick Racing.\n   2. Filter the table for drivers from this team.\n   3. Filter the results to include only those with fewer than 2 points.\n   4. Further filter the results to include only those with a grid position larger than 4.\n   5. Check if the filtered list contains Ryan Hunter-Reay or Oriol Servi\u00e0.\n\n   After following these steps, we can find two drivers from Patrick Racing in the table:\n   - Row 11: driver: jo\u00ebl camathias, team: dale coyne racing, laps: 84, time / retired: + 1 lap, grid: 19, points: 2. (This driver has more than 2 points)\n   - Row 15: driver: rodolfo lav\u00edn, team: walker racing, laps: 81, time / retired: + 4 laps, grid: 18, points: 0. (This driver has the required number of points and grid position)\n\n   Since there are no other drivers from Patrick Racing with fewer than 2 points and a grid larger than 4 in the table, we can conclude that Ryan Hunter-Reay and Oriol Servi\u00e0 do not meet the given condition. However, it is important to note that the claim states \"be\" Ryan Hunter-Reay and Oriol Servi\u00e0, which implies that at least one of them should be from Patrick Racing with the specified conditions. Since no such driver was found in the table, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the team name\", \"Filter the table for drivers from this team\", \"Filter results to include only those with fewer than 2 points\", \"Further filter results to include only those with a grid position larger than 4\", \"Check if the filtered list contains Ryan Hunter-Reay or Oriol Servi\u00e0\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n     ]\n   }",
