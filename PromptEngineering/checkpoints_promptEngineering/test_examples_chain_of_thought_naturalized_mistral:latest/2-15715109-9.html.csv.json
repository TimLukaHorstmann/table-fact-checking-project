Check the cells in each row to verify the details provided in the claim: height, weight, and birthdate.\n4. For William Reichart:\n   - Row 12 has his name, so we compare the values in this row with the given information.\n   - The value in the 'height (cm)' column is 170, which matches the claim.\n   - The value in the 'weight (kg)' column is 71, which also matches the claim.\n   - The value in the 'birthdate' column is 3 july 1935, which does not match the claim as it should be 3 July 1935 (month/day/year format). However, since the date format in the table and the claimed date format are different, we can still consider the other piece of information for comparison.\n\n5. For Wayne Meredith:\n   - Row 11 has his name, so we compare the values in this row with the given information.\n   - The value in the 'height (cm)' column is 175, which does not match the claim as it should be 175 cm (the same value provided). However, since the date format in the table and the claimed date format are different, we can still consider the other piece of information for comparison.\n   - The value in the 'weight (kg)' column is 80, which matches the claim.\n   - The value in the 'birthdate' column is 4 October 1939, which does not match the claim as it should be 4 October 1939 (day/month/year format). However, since the date format in the table and the claimed date format are different, we can still consider the other piece of information for comparison.\n\n6. Compare the remaining pieces of information provided in the claim with those in the table to confirm their matching values.\n   - Both William Reichart and Wayne Meredith are listed as being born in Minnesota, which matches the \"born in Minnesota\" part of the table.\n   - The teams they played for (rochester mustangs for William Reichart and st paul saints for Wayne Meredith) do not have exact matches in the table. However, since the table lists different leagues/teams with abbreviations, we cannot definitively confirm or deny this information without more specific data on league names and teams.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"william reichart weigh 71 kg and have a height of 170 cm and be bear on 3 july 1935 while wayne meredith weigh 80 kg and have a height of 175 cm and be bear on 4 october 1939\" is partially correct (some information matches the table, but some does not due to different date formats).\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the individuals mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"Find their rows based on names\",\n    \"Compare provided details with cell values in the table\",\n    \"Consider differences in date format\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"PARTLY_CORRECT\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"height (cm)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"weight (kg)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"height (cm)\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"weight (kg)\" }\n  ]\n}",
