Identify the goal difference for each game from the score column: Subtract the home team's score (Minnesota's score in this case) from the away team's score. For example, in row 13, Minnesota scored 3 and Tampa Bay scored 2, so the goal difference is 2 - 3 = -1.\n\n5. Check if the goal difference for each game is more than 2: In row 13, the goal difference is -1, which is not more than 2, and in row 14, the goal difference is also -1.

Calculate the difference between the scores: |1 - 1| = 0. However, since there seems to be a misunderstanding in the claim about the score format, let's verify if the difference in goals scored by Minnesota Wild on these dates is more than 2.\n5.
