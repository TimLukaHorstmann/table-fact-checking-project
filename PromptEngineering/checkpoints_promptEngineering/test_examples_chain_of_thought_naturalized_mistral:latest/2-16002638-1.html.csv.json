Since the team gets promoted at the end of the season, it should be the most recent season in the table. In this case, the relevant row is Row 5 (season: 2007).\n\n2. Find the number of wins and losses for the team in 2007. For the \"hurricane\" (assuming that's the correct name of the team), they had 9 wins and 1 loss. So, the total games played are 9+1=10.\n\n3. Calculate the win percentage by dividing the number of wins by the total number of games played: 9/10 = 0.9 or 90%.\n\n4. To check whether the promotion happened in 2007, we look for any row where the final position is 1 and notes contain \"promoted\". Row 5 matches this condition (final position: 1 / 6, notes: promoted to division 1 north).\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team that got promoted\",\n    \"Find the year of the promotion (2007)\",\n    \"Find the number of wins and losses for the team in that year\",\n    \"Calculate win percentage using the found number of wins and games played\",\n    \"Check if the final position and notes match the condition for promotion\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"final position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"notes\" }\n  ]\n}",
