After that, David Le Lay (FRA) takes over as the series leader in Row 8 and continues to be the series leader until the end of the table.\n\n2. Look for the winner of the Tour du Haut Var in the table. The winner is Davide Rebellin (ITA) from Row 1, which happens before the series leadership changes from J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pineau (FRA) to David Le Lay (FRA).\n\n3. Compare the series leader at the time of the event and the winner of the Tour du Haut Var.
