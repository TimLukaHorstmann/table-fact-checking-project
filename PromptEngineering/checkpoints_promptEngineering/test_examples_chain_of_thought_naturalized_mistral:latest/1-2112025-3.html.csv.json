    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the claim, which states that after 1968, Billie Jean King (or Owen Davidson) was the opponent of the player in the final.\n   2. Check the table for any rows where the \"year\" is greater than 1968.\n   3. From row 2 to row 7, the \"year\" values are indeed greater than 1968.\n   4. In each of these rows (from row 2 to 7), check if either Billie Jean King or Owen Davidson appears as an opponent in the final.\n   5. In row 2, Margarete Court Marty Rissen is the opponent, not Billie Jean King nor Owen Davidson.\n   6. In row 3, Margaret Court Marty Rissen is also the opponent, again not Billie Jean King nor Owen Davidson.\n   7. In row 4, Billie Jean King Bob Hewitt is the opponent, which partially satisfies the claim as Billie Jean King is involved in the match.\n   8. In row 5, Winnie Shaw Thomas Lejus is the opponent, not Billie Jean King nor Owen Davidson.\n   9. In row 6, Evonne Goolagong Cawley Kim Warwick is the opponent, not Billie Jean King nor Owen Davidson.\n   10. In row 7, Betty St\u00f6ve Patrice Dominguez are the opponents, not Billie Jean King nor Owen Davidson.\n   11. Since there's a match where Billie Jean King is an opponent after 1968 (row 4), the claim is partially true. However, since the claim states that \"in the final after 1968\", it should only refer to matches where both players were in the final, which is not fulfilled here as Bob Hewitt was also a partner for Billie Jean King and they lost the match.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the claim.\\n2. Check table rows for years greater than 1968.\\n3-5. Check if opponent in final is either Billie Jean King or Owen Davidson (for each relevant row).\\n6-10. Evaluate each remaining row based on steps 3-5.\\n11. Since there's a match where Billie Jean King is an opponent after 1968 but the claim doesn't fulfill its requirement of both players being in the final, the answer is 'FALSE'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponents in the final\" }\n  ]\n}",
