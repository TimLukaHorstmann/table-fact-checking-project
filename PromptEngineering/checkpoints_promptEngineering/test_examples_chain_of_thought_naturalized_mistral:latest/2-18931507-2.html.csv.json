    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n   1. First, we need to identify the fights from the table that were part of the Gladiator Challenge and the Pascua Yaqui fights.\n       - From the table, we can see that there are four fights labeled as \"Gladiator Challenge\" (Rows 2, 4, 5).\n       - There is only one fight labeled as \"WFF MMA: Pascua Yaqui Fights\" (Row 1).\n   2. Next, we compare the round and time information for these fights to determine which ones were shorter.\n       - Gladiator Challenge fights: Row 2 has a round of 1 and time of 1:43, Row 4 has a round of 1 and time of 4:55, Row 5 has a round of 1 and time of 1:25.\n       - Pascua Yaqui fight: Row 1 has a round of 1 and time of 5:00.\n   3. Comparing the durations of the fights, we see that all Gladiator Challenge fights had shorter durations than the Pascua Yaqui fight (Row 1).\n\n   Final answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify fights from table that were part of Gladiator Challenge and Pascua Yaqui fights\",\n       \"Compare round and time information for these fights to determine which ones were shorter\",\n       \"Determine if any Gladiator Challenge fight had a duration shorter than the Pascua Yaqui fight\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"event\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\" }\n     ]\n   }",
