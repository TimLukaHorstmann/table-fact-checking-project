Find these 6 countries in the table to check their total medals.

Check if any of the remaining countries are tied for 16th place by comparing their total medals with those already found to be lower than 16th (Row 16-21).\n    - None of the countries from step 2 have a higher total medal count, so they must be tied for 16th place.\n4.

Next, find out the total medals for France (from row 5). The total number of medals is specified in the table as \"total\": 8.\n3. Calculate the ratio between the total medals of Germany and France by dividing the number of medals Germany has by the number of medals France has. In this case, it's 4/8 = 0.5 or 1/2.\n4. To check if Germany would still be in second place with twice as many medals, we compare the new total (2 * 4 = 8) with the current total of other countries.\n5. In the table, find the country with a total of exactly 8 medals or more (since Germany's new total is now 8). The first country found that meets this criterion is Great Britain (row 2, \"total\": 7). Note that there might be other countries with a total of 8 or more medals as well, but we only need to find one to establish that Germany would not still be in second place.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Determine the total medals for Germany and France from the table.
