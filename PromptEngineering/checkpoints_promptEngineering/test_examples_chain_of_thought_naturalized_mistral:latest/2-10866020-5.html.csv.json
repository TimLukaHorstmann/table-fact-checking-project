    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine the answer:\n\n1. First, identify which teams' home stadiums were mentioned in the table. We can see that Sydney FC plays at Sydney Football Stadium (Row 2, Row 9, and Row 20) and Adelaide United plays at Hindmarsh Stadium (all rows except for Row 18).\n\n2. Next, we look for a row where both Sydney FC is the home team and Adelaide Oval is the stadium. However, since Adelaide Oval was not mentioned as any team's home stadium, it cannot be inferred that Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval.\n\n3. The claim is therefore FALSE because there is no evidence in the table to support that Sydney FC plays at Adelaide Oval.\n\nHere is the JSON object with the final answer and relevant cells:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify home stadiums for each team in the table\", \"Check if Sydney FC has a match at Adelaide Oval\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

The 'stadium' column is relevant as it gives us the location of each game.\n2. Check the row where the date matches November 18, 2007, since that's the claimed date for this incident. Row 13 has the date November 18, 2007.\n3. Verify if the home team in that row is Adelaide United. The 'home_team' column shows Adelaide United in row 13.\n4. Check if the crowd size and stadium name given in the claim match with the data from the table for this particular game on November 18, 2007 (row 13).
