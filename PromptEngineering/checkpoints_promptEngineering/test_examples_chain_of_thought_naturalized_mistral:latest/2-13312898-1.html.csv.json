To do this, count the total number of rows from the first round to the end (excluding the first round) and multiply by the number of picks per round (which is assumed to be 1). There are 20 - 1 = 19 rows after the first round, so the total number of picks up to this point would be 19.\n4. Since the table does not contain all rounds, we cannot definitively determine if there are 348 players drafted between their first and 30th round pick based on the given data alone. However, since the table has more than the minimum number of picks required for a full draft (7 rounds x 1 pick per round = 7) and it's likely that more rounds were included after row 30, it is reasonable to assume that there are at least as many players drafted between their first and 30th round pick as the number of picks up to the last row in the table (which is 19).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the number of first-round picks, calculate the total number of picks up to the end of the data, and make an assumption based on the known structure of the draft\"],\n  \"answer\": \"It is reasonable to assume TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"round\"}]\n}",
