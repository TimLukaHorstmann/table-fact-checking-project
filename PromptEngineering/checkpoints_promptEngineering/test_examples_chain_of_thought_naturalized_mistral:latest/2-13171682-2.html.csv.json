    "resp": "1. Identify the game whose record we are interested in, which is the one on January 18th. In the table provided, this game is on row 35, and we can see that the opponent was New York Rangers (column \"Home Team\" or column_name \"Opponent\").\n  2. Find the result of this game. In the table provided, the home team's score (the Chicago Blackhawks) is 5 and the opponent's score (New York Rangers) is 2. The away team won when the home team's score is lower than the opponent's score.\n  3. Determine if this win counts as a loss for the Chicago Blackhawks. Since the game was lost by the Chicago Blackhawks, it will be recorded as a loss in their record (i.e., the record will increase by 1 loss).\n  4. Find out the current number of games played by the Chicago Blackhawks before this match. In the table provided, we can see that there are 35 rows, and the game on row 35 is being examined. Therefore, the number of games played before January 18th is 34 (as each row represents a single game).\n  5. Consider the current record of the Chicago Blackhawks before this match. In the table provided, we can see that there are 3 wins (row 32, 33, and 35), 17 losses (from rows 2 to 31), and 2 ties or draws (rows 4 and 34). However, since a loss is counted as -1 in the win-loss record, the Chicago Blackhawks had a record of 3-17-2 before January 18th.\n  6. Find out how many more losses should be added to the current record after the match on January 18th. As determined earlier, this game resulted in an additional loss for the Chicago Blackhawks. Since there were already 17 losses before this game, adding one more loss brings the total number of losses to 18 (i.e., 17 + 1 = 18).\n  7. Find out how many more wins should be added to the current record after the match on January 18th. No additional wins were gained from this game, so there are still 3 wins as before (rows 32, 33, and 35).\n  8. Calculate the new record for the Chicago Blackhawks. Since we now have 3 wins, 18 losses, and 2 ties or draws, their new record will be 3-18-2.\n  9. Compare this new record with the provided claim. In this case, the claimed record was \"11 - 13 - 2\", which does not match the calculated new record of 3-18-2 (the win count is incorrect).
