In Row 1, Geelong scores 26.16 (172) and North Melbourne scores 15.7 (97), so the difference is 26.16 - 15.7 = 10.4 (105 points).\n4. In Row 2, Fitzroy scores 13.10 (88) and Melbourne scores 15.17 (107), so the difference is 13.10 - 15.17 = -2.07 (-2 points).\n5. In Row 3, South Melbourne scores 13.16 (94) and St Kilda scores 9.15 (69), so the difference is 13.16 - 9.15 = 4.01 (4 points).\n6. In Row 4, Hawthorn scores 12.13 (85) and Footscray scores 14.6 (90), so the difference is 12.13 - 14.6 = -2.47 (-3 points).\n7. In Row 5, Richmond scores 11.14 (80) and Collingwood scores 13.4 (82), so the difference is 11.14 - 13.4 = -2.26 (-3 points).\n8. In Row 6, Essendon scores 11.12 (78) and Carlton scores 22.8 (140), so the difference is 11.12 - 22.8 = -11.68 (-12 points).\n9. Comparing these differences, we see that only Richmond and Collingwood have a difference of more than 4 points, while all other games have differences less than or equal to 4 points. However, the smallest difference is found in Row 2 (Fitzroy vs Melbourne), where the point difference is -2.07 (-2 points).\n10.
