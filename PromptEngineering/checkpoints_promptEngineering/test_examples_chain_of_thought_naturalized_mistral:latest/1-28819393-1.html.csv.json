    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the relevant year for the claim, which is 1987, from the table.\n2. Find the row in the table that corresponds to the identified year.\n3. In that row, look for the \"average votes per candidate\" value, which is 675.\n4. To find out whether this value is less than 1.35%, we need to convert the average votes per candidate to a percentage first by dividing it with the total votes and then finding the result as a percentage of the total vote (i.e., multiplying by 100).\n5. In the same row, locate the \"% of total vote\" value, which is 0.28.\n6. Convert this decimal to a percentage by multiplying it by 100. This gives us 28%, which corresponds to the candidate's share of the total votes in that election year.\n7. Now, we can calculate the average % of vote per candidate by dividing the candidate's share of the total votes (obtained in step 6) by the number of candidates (which is 133, as seen in the row). This gives us approximately 0.214% (rounded down to 0.21 for simplicity, as we want to compare it with 1.35%, which is a higher value).\n8. Since 0.214% is less than 1.35%, the claim \"in 1987, the average vote per candidate be less than 1.35%\" is TRUE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the relevant year for the claim\",\n    \"Find the row in the table that corresponds to the identified year\",\n    \"In that row, look for the 'average votes per candidate' value\",\n    \"Calculate the percentage of the candidate's share of the total votes\",\n    \"Calculate the average % of vote per candidate by dividing the candidate's share of the total votes by the number of candidates\",\n    \"Compare the calculated average % of vote per candidate with the given threshold (1.35%)\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"average votes per candidate\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"% of total vote\" }\n  ]\n}",
