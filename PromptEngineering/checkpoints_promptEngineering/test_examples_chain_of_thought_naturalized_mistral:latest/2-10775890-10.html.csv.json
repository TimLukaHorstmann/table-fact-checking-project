    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to compare the scores of each team in the table. The score is represented as a fraction, with the first number being the number of goals and the second number being the number of behinds. In decimal form, it represents the total points scored by the team.\n\n2. Find Geelong's score from the table: Row 1, home team score column (6.5 or 41 in decimal). This is the value we are comparing against the rest of the teams' scores.\n\n3. Next, check if this score is lower than all other scores in the table. We note down each comparison as follows:\n   - Compare Geelong's score (41) with Carlton's home team score (80). Result: Geelong's score is lower.\n   - Compare Geelong's score (41) with South Melbourne's home team score (73). Result: Geelong's score is lower.\n   - Compare Geelong's score (41) with Fitzroy's home team score (130). Result: Geelong's score is lower.\n   - Compare Geelong's score (41) with Essendon's home team score (76). Result: Geelong's score is lower.\n   - Compare Geelong's score (41) with Richmond's home team score (84). Result: Geelong's score is lower.\n\n4. Since all the scores we compared were lower than Geelong's score, it means that Geelong has the lowest score among all teams in the table.\n\n5. Check if Geelong's score is half of his opponent's score:\n   - Melbourne's away team score (83 in decimal). Half of this would be 41.5, which is slightly higher than Geelong's score (41).\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find out the scores for all teams on June 25th, 1960 (the same date as Geelong's game), as that is when Geelong played. This will give us a reference group to compare Geelong with.\n\n   - From Row 1, we can see that Geelong scored 11.14 (80) on June 25th, 1960.\n   - From Rows 2 and 3, we see scores for Carlton and South Melbourne, but these games were played on a different date. We will exclude them from our comparison group for now.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out the score of the team that Geelong played against (Melbourne) on June 25th, 1960, as this will help us determine whether Geelong's score is half their opponent's score.\n\n   - From Row 1, we can see that Melbourne scored 12.11 (83) on June 25th, 1960.\n\n3. Now, we compare the scores of Geelong and their opponent to determine if Geelong's score is half of their opponent's score.\n\n   - Geelong scored 11.14 (80), which is not half of Melbourne's score of 12.11 (83).\n\n4. However, we also need to check if Geelong has the lowest score among all teams on June 25th, 1960, as claimed in the question. We have already considered all scores from this date except for Carlton and South Melbourne, so let's find their scores now.\n\n   - From Row 2, we see that Carlton scored 11.14 (80) on June 25th, 1960. This score is the same as Geelong's score.\n   - Since we do not have information about South Melbourne's opponent or their score on June 25th, 1960, we cannot definitively say if they scored lower than both Geelong and Carlton.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that \"Geelong with a score of 11.14 (80) be the lowest score of the group\" is FALSE because there was at least one other team (Carlton) that scored the same on June 25th, 1960.
