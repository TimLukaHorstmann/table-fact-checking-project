Filter out the relevant replay matches: Based on the date column, the following matches were played as replays in January 1976:\n   - Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers (Row 6 and Row 7)\n   - Portsmouth vs Charlton Athletic (Row 15 and Row 16)\n   - Newcastle United vs Coventry City (Row 8 and Row 9)\n\n4. Count the number of unique teams involved: Since each replay match involves two teams, we can count the number of unique teams to determine if there are three distinct matches.\n\n5. Check for distinctness: There are 3 unique teams involved in the replays: Ipswich Town, Portsmouth, and Newcastle United.
