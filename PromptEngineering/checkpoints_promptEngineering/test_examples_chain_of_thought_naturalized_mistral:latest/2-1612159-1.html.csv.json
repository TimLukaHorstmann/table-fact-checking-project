    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the table's structure: The table has two main categories - season & division (div) on the left side, and positions (pos), top scorer (league), and head coach on the right side. Each row represents a specific season with its corresponding information.\n\n2. Find the relevant season: Since we are given the year range 2011-2012, I will scan through the table to find the row that matches this timeframe. Rows 20 and 21 seem to fit the criteria as they both have a season ranging from 2011 to 2012 (2011 - 12 in row 20 and 2012 - 13 in row 21).\n\n3. Determine the position: In row 20, the player's position is 13, and there is no mention of a different position for the head coach or any other players.\n\n4. Identify the head coach: The head coach for the season 2011 - 2012 (row 20) is protasov according to the table. However, it also mentions \"lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\". I will check if there are multiple coaches listed for this season or if these names are part of a single coach's name.\n\n5. Combine information: In row 20, the head coach is indeed protasov. The extra names \"lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\" appear to be additional parts of a name rather than multiple coaches, as there are no separate entries for these names in any other rows.\n\n6. Match claim and table data: The table indicates that the 2011 - 2012 season led to position 13 (which we have already confirmed) and the head coach was protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny, so the given claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, let's present the output in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure\", \"Find relevant season (2011-2012)\", \"Determine position (13)\", \"Identify head coach (protasov)\", \"Combine information (protasov is part of a single name with additional parts)\", \"Match claim and table data\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"pos\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"head coach\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the season for which we need to find the position and head coach. In this case, it's the 2011-2012 season (Row 20).\n\n2. Locate the row that corresponds to the given season in the table. The relevant cell is: { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"pos\" }\n\n3. Observe the value of the 'pos' column for this season (Row 20). It states that the position was 13.\n\n4. Compare the positions from other seasons to determine if this is the lowest position. To do this, we compare all other positions in the table with the one found in step 3. By inspecting the table, it can be seen that other positions are lower than 13 (Row 6: 16, Row 7: 12, Row 8: 14, Row 9: 12, and Row 16: 16). The position for the 2011-2012 season is not the lowest.\n\n5. Since we have already confirmed that the position was not the lowest, it means the claim about the 2011-2012 season leading to the lowest position is FALSE.\n\n6. To find out if the head coach was \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\", we will look for this name in the 'head coach' column corresponding to the 2011-2012 season (Row 20). The relevant cell is: { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"head coach\" }\n\n7. Observe the value of the 'head coach' column for this season (Row 20). It states that the head coach was \"protasov\". However, the given name in the claim is \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\", which differs from what's shown in the table. Therefore, we cannot confirm if the head coach was indeed \"protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny\".\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the season for which we need to find the position and head coach.\",\n    \"Locate the row that corresponds to the given season in the table.\",\n    \"Observe the value of the 'pos' column for this season.\",\n    \"Compare the positions from other seasons to determine if this is the lowest position.\",\n    \"Since we have already confirmed that the position was not the lowest, it means the claim about the 2011-2012 season leading to the lowest position is FALSE.\" ,\n    \"To find out if the head coach was 'protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny', we will look for this name in the 'head coach' column corresponding to the 2011-2012 season.\",\n    \"Observe the value of the 'head coach' column for this season.\",\n    \"Since the given name differs from what's shown in the table, we cannot confirm if the head coach was indeed 'protasov lyutyi talalayev balakhnin baidachny'.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"pos\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"head coach\" }\n  ]\n}",
