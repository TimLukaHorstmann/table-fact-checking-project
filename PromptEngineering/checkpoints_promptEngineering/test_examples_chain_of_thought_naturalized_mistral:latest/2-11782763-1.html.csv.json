We then look for the rows where the individual named matches with Robert Curthose. There are two such instances in the table: Row 1 and Row 3.\n\n3. To verify if Robert Curthose was the heir twice, we need to check the \"became heir\" column for each of these rows. In Row 1, it became heir in 1066 and in Row 3, it became heir in 1087.\n\n4. Since the claim states that Robert Curthose was the heir twice, we need to find another instance where he was the heir after the first time (1066). The second instance is found in Row 3 with a date of 1087. Therefore, Robert Curthose indeed was the heir twice: once in 1066 and again in 1087.\n\n5.
