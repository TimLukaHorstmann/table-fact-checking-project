    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the relevant information in the table to determine the current record of the team. The record consists of wins, losses, and ties (W-L-T). In the table, it is represented as 'record'.\n2. Find the row that corresponds to the game where the score was 1 - 4. This happens in Row 14, with the column name being 'score' and the row index being 14.\n3. Check the record before this game by looking at the previous row in the table. In this case, it would be Row 13 (row_index: 13). The relevant cell for the record from this row is also the 'record' column.\n4. Compare the records from step 2 and 3 to see if the claim is true. If the record in step 3 is 29 - x - 4, then the score of 1 - 4 would result in a record of 29 - (x + 1) - 4 after the game.\n5.
