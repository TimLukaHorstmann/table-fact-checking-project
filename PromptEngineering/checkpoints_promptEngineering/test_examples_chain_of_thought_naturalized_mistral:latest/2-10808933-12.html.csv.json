    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. Identify the team we are looking for, which is Hawthorn. However, the given claim doesn't specify whether we are looking for the home or away team score for Hawthorn.\n   2. Since the claim mentions \"Hawthorn's away team opponent score,\" we should be looking for the away team's score of the team that played against Hawthorn on 6 July 1968.\n   3. In the table, we can see that each row represents a match, and the columns indicate the home team, their score, the away team, their score, the venue, the crowd, and the date. We need to find the row where the home team is Hawthorn (indicating that it was an away game for Hawthorn).\n   4. By scanning the table, we can see that in Row 4, the home team is Hawthorn. Since it's the fourth row and all matches are on 6 July 1968, this is the match we are looking for.\n   5. In this row (Row 4), the away team score is listed as 17.10 (112).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team in question (Hawthorn)\",\n    \"Determine that we are looking for the away team's score since it's 'Hawthorn's away team opponent score'\",\n    \"Find the row where the home team is Hawthorn\",\n    \"Check the away team score in the found row\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}",
