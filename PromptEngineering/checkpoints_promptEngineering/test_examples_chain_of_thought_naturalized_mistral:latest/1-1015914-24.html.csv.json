The subjects are 'we two' and 'them two', and the verbs are 'be ngalbeniya' and 'be palamulpa'.\n       Step 2: Check for the given subjects and corresponding locations in the table (naturalized format). For 'we two', the column suffixes are nom, acc, inst, gen, dat, abl, loc. The relevant row for 'be ngalbeniya' is not found but we can assume it should be in the 'nom' column since the verb 'be' in English usually corresponds to the nominative case in this table.\n       Step 3: Similarly, search for 'them two' (the two) and corresponding locations in the table. The relevant row for 'be palamulpa' is not found but we can assume it should be in the 'loc' column since the verb 'be' in English usually corresponds to the locative case in this table.\n       Step 4: Compare the assumed locations of the subjects and verbs (Step 2 & 3) in the table. For 'we two', we find 'ngalbe' in the 'nom' column in Row 1, and for 'them two', we find 'palai (boigu pale)' in the 'loc' column in a different row as the given claim does not specify any particular row.\n       Step 5: Check if both subjects and verbs belong to the same row. Since 'we two' and 'them two' are not in the same row, they do not satisfy this condition. However, we notice that the verb for 'we two' ('be ngalbeniya') is a conjugated form of 'ngalben', which is found in Row 2 (gen column). Similarly, the verb for 'them two' ('be palamulpa') is a conjugated form of 'palamun', which is found in Row 3 (dat column).\n       Step 6: Check if both subjects and verbs belong to the same row when we consider the base forms. The base form of 'ngalbeniya' is 'ngalbe' and it is found in Row 1 (nom column), while the base form of 'palamulpa' is 'palamun' and it is found in Row 3 (dat column). Since both subjects and verbs belong to different rows when considering the base forms, they do not satisfy this condition either.\n       Step 7: Cross-check the conditions by finding corresponding cells for each subject-verb pair that satisfy the condition. The condition states that 'we two' should be in the same row as 'them two' and both should be in the same row as their respective verbs. Since Row 1 (nom column) contains both 'ngalbe' (subject for 'we two') and 'palai (boigu pale)' (subject for 'them two'), and since Row 3 (dat column) contains 'palamun' (verb for 'them two'), the conditions are not met.\n       Step 8: Conclude that the claim is FALSE as 'when we two be ngalbeniya, them two (the two) be palamulpa (boigu palemulpa)' does not hold true according to the given table.\"],\n      \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nom\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"dat\"}]\n    }",
