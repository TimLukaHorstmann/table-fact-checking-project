This information will help us find the relevant row in the table. In this case, we're looking for s07e05.\n   2. Scan through the table to find a row that matches the series and episode number (s07e05). In this table, row 5 has the necessary match.\n   3. Once we've found the relevant row, examine its segment c value. The value for segment c in row 5 is \"sandwich s cookie\".\n\nSince the value for segment c in row 5 (which corresponds to Netflix s07e05) is \"sandwich s cookie\", our final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the series and episode for which we need to check segment c.
