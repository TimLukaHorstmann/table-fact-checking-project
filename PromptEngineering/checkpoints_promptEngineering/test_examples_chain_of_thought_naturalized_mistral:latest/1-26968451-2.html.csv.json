Scan the table to find the row that corresponds to series number 39. The relevant cell for this comparison is in column \"series\" and row 13.\n3. Compare the value in the identified cell with the claim. In our table, the value in the \"series\" column of row 13 is 39.\n4. Since the claim (series number 39) matches the value found in the table (also 39), it follows that series 39 was indeed written by Michael Lembeck.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim (series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck)\",\n    \"Scan the table to find the row that corresponds to series number 39\",\n    \"Compare the value in the identified cell with the claim\",\n    \"Since the claim matches the value found in the table, it follows that series 39 was indeed written by Michael Lembeck\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"series\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
