Look for the total number of losses for each team by counting the 'lost' column for each row where the 'team' matches the given team names. For example, for Netherfield, count the number in row 22.\n3. Count the number of drawn games for Gateshead and Southport by looking at the 'drawn' column for each row where the 'team' matches the given team names. For example, for Gateshead, count the number in row 4.\n4. Identify the team with the highest overall goal score by checking the 'goals for' column for each row and finding the maximum value.\n5.
