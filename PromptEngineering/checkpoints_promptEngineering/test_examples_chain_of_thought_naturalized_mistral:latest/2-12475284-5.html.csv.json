    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the countries involved to compare their scores. In this table, there are three players from Australia (Geoff Ogilvy, Davis Love III, and Tiger Woods) and multiple players from other countries (United States, England, Sweden, and others).\n2. Compare the score of each player from Australia with the scores of all players in the table. To do this, we need to find the minimum score among the Australian players.\n3. Look for rows where the \"country\" column has the value \"Australia\". In this table, the relevant rows are: Row 6 (Geoff Ogilvy), Row 5 (Davis Love III), and Row 7 (Tiger Woods). Their scores are 137, 137, and 137 respectively.\n4. Find the minimum score among these three players. The minimum score is 137 (belonging to Geoff Ogilvy and Tiger Woods).\n5. Compare this minimum score with the scores of all players in the table. To do this, we need to find the maximum score that is less than or equal to 137 among all players.\n6. Look for rows where the \"score\" column has a value less than or equal to 137 and also for any players who did not provide their score yet (indicated by a \"+\"). In this table, the relevant rows are: Row 1 (Billy Andrade and Tim Herron with scores 136), Row 2 (Luke Donald with score 136), Row 3 (Henrik Stenson with score 136), Row 4 (Tim Herron with score 136), Row 5 (Davis Love III with score 137), Row 6 (Geoff Ogilvy with score 137), Row 7 (Tiger Woods with score 137), Row 8, Row 9, and Row 10 have scores greater than 137, but Row 11 (David Toms) has a score of 138.\n7. Since none of the players who have provided their score yet have a score less than or equal to 137, we can conclude that no player from any other country has a lower score than the minimum score of the Australian players (137).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify countries involved\", \"Compare scores among Australian players\", \"Find minimum score among Australians\", \"Compare minimum score with scores of all players in table\", \"Look for rows where score is less than or equal to the minimum and where score has been provided\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
