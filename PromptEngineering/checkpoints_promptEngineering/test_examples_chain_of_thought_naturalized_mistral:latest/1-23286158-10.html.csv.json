All games mention Portland as their team, so they are all games involving Portland.\n3. Now, let's focus on the location of each game from the 'location attendance' column. We observe that the stadium names (Arco Arena, Staples Center, Rose Garden) appear multiple times with different attendance numbers. However, the name \"Rose Garden\" only appears in rows where Portland is the home team.\n4. Since all games involving Portland are being played at the Rose Garden during this time period (April 3 to April 12, 2010), and the Rose Garden is the typical home arena for Portland, it suggests that these games are home games for Portland.\n5.
