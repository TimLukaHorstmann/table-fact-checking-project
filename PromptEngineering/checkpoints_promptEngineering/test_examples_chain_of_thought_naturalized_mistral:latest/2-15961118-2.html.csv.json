    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the team(s) in the table with an `nsr250` machine. The relevant rows are 1, 2 (as both years for Cup Noodle Honda have `nsr250`).\n\n2. Check the points earned by each team in their respective seasons. In row 1, the points are 8. In row 2, the points are 11.\n\n3. Since 11 is greater than 8, Cup Noodle Honda does not have less than 8 points with an `nsr250`.\n\n4. Therefore, the claim \"cup noodle honda be the only team with nsr250 and have less than 8 point\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify teams with an `nsr250` machine\",\n    \"Check points earned by each team\",\n    \"Compare the points to determine if Cup Noodle Honda has less than 8 points with an `nsr250`\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
