To determine if a team had 3 shutouts during the season, we need to find instances where they won with a score of 0 - X (X being any number greater than 0). This indicates that the opponent did not score at all.\n   2. Iterate through each row in the table, focusing on the \"result\" column to identify wins. Look for wins where the points scored by the team (the second number in the result field) is equal to or greater than 1 (since a shutout involves the opposing team not scoring).\n   3. In cases where there's a win and the opponent didn't score, check if the number of points scored by the team was exactly 0. If so, this would be a shutout.\n   4. Relevant cells to consider in our reasoning: Rows with wins (wins are defined as having a positive number as the second value in the \"result\" column) and where the opposing team didn't score (the first value in the \"result\" column should be 0).\n\nAfter examining the table, we can find three instances of shutouts for the Dolphins:\n   - Row 1: week: 1, opponent: buffalo bills, result: w 12 - 0 (shutdown)\n   - Row 6: week: 6, opponent: buffalo bills, result: l 38 - 35 (not a shutout since they lost), but the following game (Row 7: week: 7, opponent: new york jets, result: w 32 - 14) is also a shutout.\n   - Row 12: week: 12, opponent: baltimore colts, result: w 37 - 0 (shutdown)\n\nHowever, the Dolphins' first shutout comes in week 2 against the New England Patriots, and their third shutout is against the Baltimore Colts in week 12. Since there are only 16 weeks in a season, having three shutouts would mean that no games occurred between these two instances (weeks 3-11). But there are games during this period according to the table (e.g., week 5 against New Orleans Saints). This contradicts our assumption that there were only three shutouts throughout the entire season, making the claim false.\n\nIn summary:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify instances of wins where the opposing team did not score (shutdowns).\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the table, focusing on the 'result' column.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1 },\n    { \"row_index\": 7 },\n    { \"row_index\": 12 }\n  ]\n}",

Since the table contains only 16 rows (from weeks 1 to 16), we can conclude that the team played their last 10 games as per the given claim.\n5.
