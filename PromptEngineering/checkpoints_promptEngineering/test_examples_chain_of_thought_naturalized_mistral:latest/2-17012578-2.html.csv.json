    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to go through each row in the table to find out who the third / vice skip and second players are.\n2. I start with Row 1, and notice that the third / vice skip is not mentioned explicitly but since the table format includes this information, it can be implied that Kerry Burtnyk is the skip as per the first column, so Don Walchuk must be the third/vice skip. The second player in this row is Richard Daneault.\n3. I continue to Row 2 and find that Pat Simmons is the skip, Gerry Adam is the third / vice skip, Jeff Sharp is the second player.\n4. In Row 3, I identify Jeff Stoughton as the skip, Kevin Park as the third / vice skip, Rob Fowler as the second player.\n5. Continuing this pattern, I find the players for each row until I reach Row 12 (Jason Gunnlaugson, Justin Richter, Braden Zawada, and Tyler Forrest in that order).\n6. In Row 9, I notice that Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard is the skip, Martin Cr\u00eate is the third / vice skip, and Eric Sylvain is the second player.\n7. Now, I compare the claim with the data from the table: The third/vice skip in row 9 (the row where Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard is the skip) is Martin Cr\u00eate, and the second player in that row is \u00c9ric Sylvain.\n8. Since the claim matches exactly with the data in Row 9 of the table, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n   Here's the JSON output:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare the claim to each row in the table\", \"Identify the third/vice skip and second players for each row\", \"Find the row where the claim matches with the data\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"third / vice skip\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"second\"}]\n   }",
