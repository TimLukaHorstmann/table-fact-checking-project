    "resp": "Here is the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the tournament where the claim is made (miyagi tv cup donlop lady open).\n2. Search for the row that corresponds to this tournament in the table. The relevant row is Row 14 with the date being the closest match to the claimed date (24 sep 2006).\n3. Extract the winning score from the identified row. In this case, it's 70 + 73 + 71 = 214.\n4. Determine the score to par for the identified row. This information is also available in the same row and is - 2.\n5. Compare the calculated winning score with the score to par. In this case, 214 > (-2), which means the winning score is not under par (since negative numbers are less than zero).\n6.
