    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the total number of wins for each team from the table. This can be calculated by summing the number of games won from their respective streak column (since it indicates the last game they won or lost).\n2. We will then compare these win counts for each team in order to determine which team has won the most games.\n3. From the table, we see that the 'south dragons' have a streak of 'won 2'. So, their total wins so far are 8 (from row 1, lost column) + 2 (current streak).\n4. We then compare this with the other teams. For example, the 'melbourne tigers' have a streak of 'lost 1', so their total wins are 10 (from row 2, lost column) - 1 = 9. Similarly, we calculate the total wins for all other teams.\n5. After calculating the total wins for each team, we find that the 'south dragons' have won the most games in the season (10).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find the number of wins for each team by summing the 'lost' and 'streak' values.

The team with the least number of losses would have won the most games since a win is recorded as a loss for the opposing team.\n3. In this table, the team \"gold coast blaze\" has 22 losses which is the highest among all teams.\n4. Since each team plays against every other team twice (home and away), they would have played 9 games each, and with 18 teams, there are a total of 162 games in the season.\n5. If a team loses all its games, it means that team has not won any game. So, to find out how many games each other team has won, we subtract their losses from the total number of games (which is equal to the sum of wins and losses).\n6.
