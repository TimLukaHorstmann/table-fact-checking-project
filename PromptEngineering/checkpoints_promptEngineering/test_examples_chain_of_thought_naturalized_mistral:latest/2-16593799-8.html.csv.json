The score is represented by two numbers separated by a space, where the first number corresponds to team 1 and the second number corresponds to team 2. For example, the score in row 1 is \"0 - 2\".\n\n2. Calculate the points for each game: Points for a team in a game are calculated by subtracting the score of their opponent from their own score. If a team's score is higher, the difference will be positive; if it's lower, the difference will be negative. For example, in row 1, Krung Thai Bank scored 0, and Dalian Shide scored 2. So, the points for Krung Thai Bank would be -2 (-(0-2)).\n\n3. Find the maximum and second-highest point scores for all games in 2008: The claim states that there are two games where the combined points (for both teams) are equal to or greater than 10. To find this, we need to compare the calculated points for each game from rows 13 to 18.\n\n4. Analyze the scores and combine them to check if there is a pair of games with a combined total of 10 points or more: In row 13, Krung Thai Bank scored 1 and Kashima Antlers scored 9, for a combined total of 10. In row 17, Krung Thai Bank scored 1 and Kashima Antlers scored 8, for a combined total of 9.\n\n5. Compare the second-highest score with 10: The second-highest score we found was in row 13 (Krung Thai Bank vs Kashima Antlers), where the combined points were 10. To confirm that there is no pair of games with a higher combined total, we need to compare this score with all other game scores in 2008. However, since we have already found a pair of games with a combined total of exactly 10, it's not necessary to do this comparison.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the scores and calculate points for each game, Find the maximum and second-highest point scores for all games in 2008, Analyze the scores and combine them to check if there is a pair of games with a combined total of 10 or more\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
