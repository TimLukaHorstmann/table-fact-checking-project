Therefore, it can be concluded that each player's total goal count is unique in this dataset.\n\nHere's a summary of the analysis:\n- Compared every pair of players and found no pairs with the same total goal count.\n- Concluded that each player's total goal count is unique in the given dataset.\n\nIn terms of code, it can be written as follows using Python:\n\n```python\ntotal_goals = [666, 600, 451, 438, 331, 302, 281, 269, 268]\nfor i in range(len(total_goals)):\n    for j in range(i+1, len(total_goals)):\n        if total_goals[i] == total_goals[j]:\n            print(\"Found a pair with the same total goal count.\")\n            break\n    else:\n        continue\nelse:\n    print(\"Concluded that each player's total goal count is unique in the given dataset.\")\n```\nThis code calculates the number of unique total goal counts for each player in the provided dataset.",
