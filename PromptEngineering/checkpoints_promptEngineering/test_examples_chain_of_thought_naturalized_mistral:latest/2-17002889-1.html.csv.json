Iterate through each row in the table:\n   - Check if the crew column (column name 'crew') matches '2'. If not, move to the next row as it does not satisfy our first condition.\n   - Check if the comments column (column name 'comments') mentions 'daggerboards'. If not, move to the next row as it does not satisfy our second condition.\n   - Check if there is a design credit in the comments column (column name 'comments'). If there is no design credit, or it doesn't say 'alain comyn', move to the next row as it doesn't satisfy our third condition.\n   - If all three conditions are met for a particular row, that row fulfills the claim and we do not need to check further rows.\n\n3. Based on this reasoning, we can see that Row 8 (model: 5.2, crew: 2, comments: daggerboards) and Rows 17 to 19 all satisfy the conditions but only for Row 8 does the design credit mention 'alain comyn'.\n\n4. Final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim: crew 2 have comment of daggerboard, design : alain comyn\",\n    \"Iterate through each row in the table\",\n    \"Check if crew is exactly 2\",\n    \"Check if comments mention 'daggerboards'\",\n    \"Check for design credit and if it says 'alain comyn'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"crew\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"comments\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
