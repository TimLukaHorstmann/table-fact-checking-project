    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n1. Identify the rows that correspond to matches played on August 30, 1952. There are six rows in total, but only rows 1 through 4 do not match this date. Therefore, we need to focus on rows 5, 6 (Geelong and Carlton).\n2. Compare the crowd size for each of these two matches. The relevant cells for this comparison are: Row 5, \"crowd\" column and Row 6, \"crowd\" column.\n3. Determine which match had the larger crowd size. In this case, the Geelong vs Carlton match (Row 6) has a larger crowd size of 49107 compared to the Richmond vs Essendon match (Row 5) with a crowd size of 28000.\n4. Identify which team won the match with the larger crowd. Since the Geelong vs Carlton match had both a larger crowd and was played at Geelong's home ground (Kardinia Park), we know that it is the \"home team\" in this case.\n5. Verify if the home team scored more points than the away team. To do this, compare the \"home team score\" for Row 6 with the \"away team score\" for Row 6. In this case, Geelong (home team) scored 10.17 (77) while Carlton (away team) scored 3.14 (32).\n6.
