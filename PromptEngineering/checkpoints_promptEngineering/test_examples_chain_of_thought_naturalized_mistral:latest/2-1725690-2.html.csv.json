Identify the claim and scope: The claim states that Brook Robinson, a third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles, was the only one to win the Roberto Clemente Award from 1971 to 2013.\n\n2. Determine the data we are given: We have been provided with a table containing information about various players in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1971 to 2013, including their year, team, league, position, and (for some entries) the award they won. However, the Roberto Clemente Award is not explicitly mentioned for all players, so we can only confirm or disprove the claim based on the information available.\n\n3. Verify the presence of Brook Robinson in the table: We find that Brook Robinson is indeed present in the table (row index 1). He played as a third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles (league: American, position: Third Baseman) and his tenure in MLB coincides with our claim's timeframe.\n\n4. Search for any other third basemen who won the Roberto Clemente Award during the specified period: We will need to search through all rows where the position is \"Third Baseman\" and see if any of them have an award mentioned as the Roberto Clemente Award. Since we don't know what specific columns in the table represent awards, we'll have to go through each row manually.\n\n5.
