    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the first place winner by finding the row where 'place' column value is 1. In our table, there's only one row (row 14) that meets this condition. The artist is jean - claude pascal with 31 points.\n\n2. Find the runner up by looking for the row where 'place' column value is either 2 or (if not available) the second highest 'place' value. In our table, there are two rows with 'place' equal to 2 (row 2 and row 10). Let's assume the points of both these rows. Row 2 has 6 points and row 10 has 16 points. The maximum points for a runner up is 16.\n\n3. Compare the points of the first place winner and the runner up. In our case, jean - claude pascal (first place) achieved 31 points while the maximum runner up points are 16.\n\n4. Based on the comparison, we can say that the difference between the first place winner's points and the runner up points is at least 15 (31 - 16). Since the claim states \"the first place winner of the 1961 eurovision song contest achieve 7 more points than the runner up\", we need to check if this difference is exactly 7.\n\n5. The calculated difference is not 7, it's 15 (31 - 16). Therefore, the claim is FALSE as the first place winner did not achieve 7 more points than the runner up.\n\nFinally, here's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the first place winner by finding the row where 'place' column value is 1\",\n    \"Find the runner up by looking for the row where 'place' column value is either 2 or (if not available) the second highest 'place' value\",\n    \"Compare the points of the first place winner and the runner up\",\n    \"Check if the difference between the first place winner's points and the runner up points is exactly 7 as stated in the claim\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"place\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
