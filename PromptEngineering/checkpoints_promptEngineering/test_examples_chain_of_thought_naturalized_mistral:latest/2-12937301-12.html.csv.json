Extract the value associated with the school from the relevant row for the player: From row 2, we see that Richard Schryer's school is \"university of michigan\".\n\n4. Identify the position of the player mentioned in the claim: In our table, positions are represented by columns labeled 'position'. We cannot directly observe Richard Schryer's position from the provided data, but we can see that he signed a contract ('signed': yes), which implies that he is participating in this event.\n\n5. Check if there is any information about whether or not the university of michigan \"sign yes when [player] is in position of\": We cannot make such direct comparison between signing and position for individual players from the provided data. However, we can observe that Richard Schryer's school (the university of michigan) signed a contract with him ('signed': yes).
