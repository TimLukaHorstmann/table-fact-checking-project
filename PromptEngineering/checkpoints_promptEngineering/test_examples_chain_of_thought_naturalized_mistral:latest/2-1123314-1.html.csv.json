Check each row of the table and count the number of unique drivers (excluding rows where the \"laps\" column is less than 67 or \"retired\" column has a value other than an integer). This step accounts for any drivers who did not complete the race but were still present in the starting grid.\n3. Compare the count from step 2 to the number of cars in each starting row (including all rows, even those with drivers who retired). The difference between these two counts will give us the number of cars that DNFed (Did Not Finish) during the race.\n4. Finally, compare the total count of unique drivers from step 1 with the sum of the starting cars and DNFs from step 3.
