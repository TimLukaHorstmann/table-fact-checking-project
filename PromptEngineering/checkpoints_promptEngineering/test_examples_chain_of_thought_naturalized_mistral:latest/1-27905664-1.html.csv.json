To do this, we will go through each row of the table and check the \"directed by\" column for the name \"Ken Fink\".\n\n2. Next, we will store the rows where the director is Ken Fink in a list to keep track of them. We will use this list later to count how many episodes are directed by him.\n\n3. Once we have gone through all the rows and found the relevant ones, we will then check the length of the list. If the length is 3, it means that there were indeed 3 episodes directed by Ken Fink, and our answer would be \"TRUE\". Otherwise, if the number of episodes directed by Ken Fink is not 3, our answer would be \"FALSE\".\n\n4. To complete the solution, we will then format the JSON object as requested:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find all rows where 'directed by' column contains 'Ken Fink'.\",\n    \"Count the number of these rows to see if it is equal to 3.\",\n    \"If count equals 3, answer is 'TRUE', otherwise 'FALSE'\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": <row_index_of_episode_directed_by_Ken_Fink>, \"column_name\": \"directed by\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that in this example, the relevant cells array only contains one element for simplicity. In practice, it should contain all the rows where the director is Ken Fink. The row indexes of these episodes will depend on the actual data and the order of the table.",
