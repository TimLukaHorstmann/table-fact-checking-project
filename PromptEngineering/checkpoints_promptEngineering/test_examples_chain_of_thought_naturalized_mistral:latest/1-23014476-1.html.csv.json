So, look for the row where the 'county' column has a value of 'elko'. This would be Row 4.\n2. Find the percentage of votes for Bush in Elko County by looking at the cell where the 'county' and 'bush %' columns intersect for the selected row. In this case, it is Row 4, column 'bush %', which has a value of 77.8%.\n3. To determine if Bush had the highest percentage of votes in Elko County, compare the percentage of votes for Bush with the percentages of other candidates. In this case, since the values for 'gore %' and 'others %' are less than 77.8%, it means that Bush indeed had the highest percentage of votes in Elko County.\n4.
