    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the driver (Robert Manzon) and constructor (Maserati) mentioned in the claim. Check the table for rows that match these conditions. Relevant Cells: [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}]\n\n2. Extract the number of laps and grid positions for each matching row. In this case, we find Robert Manzon with 94 laps and a grid position of 18 in Row 9 and Luigi Villoresi with 96 laps but no specified grid position in Row 12. Since our focus is on Robert Manzon, we ignore the information about Luigi Villoresi. Relevant Cells: [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}]\n\n3. Calculate the average grid position for this driver by summing up all grid positions of the driver and dividing it by the number of races they participated in. In this case, Robert Manzon participated in only one race (as per the table). Therefore, his average grid position is the same as his grid position in that particular race, which is 18.\n\n4. Compare the calculated average grid position with the value mentioned in the claim. The claim states that Robert Manzon's average grid was 22 laps. However, our calculation showed that it was 18 laps. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify driver and constructor mentioned in the claim\", \"Extract relevant data for the identified driver\", \"Calculate the average grid position based on the extracted data\", \"Compare the calculated value with the one provided in the claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"grid\"}]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the row that contains Cesare Perdisa's data from the table. We can see that Row 7 is about driver \"cesare perdisa\" and constructor \"maserati\".\n2. Look for the cell labeled \"time / retired\" in Row 7 to find out how many laps he was behind due to retirement. The value here is \"+ 6 laps\".\n3. Look for the cell labeled \"grid\" in Row 7 to find out his starting position. The value here is \"15\".\n\nNow let's check if the claim matches the data in the table:\n- The claim states that \"cesare perdisa of brm have a time / retire of + 6 lap with 18 grid\".\n- From our findings, we know Cesare Perdisa's time/retired is \"+ 6 laps\" and his starting position (grid) was 15.\n- The claim is incorrect since it states that Perdisa drove for \"brm\", but he actually competed in a Maserati car, as indicated by the table.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"grid\"\n  }\n]\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.
