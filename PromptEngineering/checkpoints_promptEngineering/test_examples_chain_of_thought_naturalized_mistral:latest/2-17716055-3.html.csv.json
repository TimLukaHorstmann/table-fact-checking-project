Identify the minimum points required to have a draw and more than 5 losses: The table shows that a draw is worth 1 point, and thus to have a draw with more than 5 losses, a team must have at least 6 points (since 5 points would mean they didn't lose any games).\n\n2. Iterate through the table to find teams that match the conditions: Begin from row 1 (position: 1) and move downwards, comparing the number of points and losses for each team against the condition of at least 6 points and more than 5 losses.\n\n3. Check the number of rows until a team is found that matches the condition or all teams have been checked: In this table, no team has less than 28 points, which means none of them have 5 or fewer games drawn with 1 point. Furthermore, since every team in the table has lost at most 15 games (except for Ashton Athletic with 23 losses), there are no teams that meet the condition of a draw with more than 5 losses.\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify all teams that have drawn games (cells containing the number 0 under the 'drawn' column). From the table, we see that all the teams except for 'ashton athletic' have had draws.\n\n2. For each team, check if they have lost more than 3 games. Teams with fewer losses than 3 can be ignored in this context since they do not meet the condition of the claim. From the table, we see that:\n   - 'colne dynamoes', 'warrington town', 'clitheroe', 'prestwich heys', 'vulcan newton', 'blackpool mechanics', 'bacup borough', 'atherton collieries', 'whitworth valley', and 'nelson' have lost less than 3 games.\n   - 'daisy hill' has 14 losses, 'maghull' has 15 losses, 'ashton town' has 17 losses, 'newton' has 14 losses, 'oldham dew' has 16 losses, and 'bolton st' has 19 losses.\n\n3. Out of the teams that have lost more than 3 games, check if they also have points less than or equal to 49 (since we are looking for no team with this condition). From the table, we see that:\n   - 'ashton athletic' has 14 points and has lost 23 games. This meets the conditions of the claim, but since it is the only team with draws, the answer to the overall claim is not relevant to 'ashton athletic'.\n\n4. Since we have found a team (in this case, 'ashton athletic') that has both lost more than 3 games and has points less than or equal to 49, we can conclude that the claim \"there be no drawn that have point 1 of 49 and a lost larger than 3\" is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify teams with draws. Check if they have more than 3 losses. If yes, check if they also have points less than or equal to 49. If such a team exists, the claim is false.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"points\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"lost\" }\n  ]\n}",
