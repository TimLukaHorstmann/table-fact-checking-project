    "resp": "1. Identify the number associated with the total for each player (excluding play-offs) in the table. These numbers represent the combined total of all other competitions, i.e., FA Cup, FA Trophy.\n2. Compare these numbers to see if there are any players who have scored a 2 in the FA Cup and also have a higher total than 3.0. This comparison will help us eliminate such players from our analysis as they do not meet the conditions stated in the claim.\n3. For the remaining players, check their play-off scoring records (given in the 'play - offs' column of the table) to see if any of them have scored 0 goals. Since the claim only mentions a player who has scored 2 in the FA Cup and 0 in play-offs, we can focus on these players.\n4. If any of the remaining players have not scored in the play-offs but still have a total greater than or equal to 3.0 (after subtracting their play-off goals from their overall total), they could potentially meet the conditions stated in the claim.\n5. If no such player is found, then the claim is false as there is no player who has scored 2 in the FA Cup and 0 in play-offs with a higher total than 3.0.\n6.
