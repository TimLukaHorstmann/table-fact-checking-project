In this case, I can just count the number of rows for \"sco\".\n\n4. To compare the total number of transfers for \"sco\" with the combined total for all other nationalities, I'll need to make a separate tally for each type of transfer (end of contract, loan, or permanent transfer) for each nationality represented in the table.
