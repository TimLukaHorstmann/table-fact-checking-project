Locate the player in row 10 with the name \"bob o'mara\", who indeed has the position of \"rb\".\n4. Since the player picked in round 10 (Bob O'Mara) plays the rb position, we can conclude that there is a player picked in round 22 that plays the rb position as well, because the table only shows the positions and picks up to round 21. However, we cannot definitively say which player it is since we don't have enough information about the entire draft.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'position' column in the table, scan through the table for players with position 'rb', find Bob O'Mara (picked in round 10 and playing as rb), since we don't have information about all rounds, we can't definitively say which player picked in round 22 plays rb position.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"position\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"name\"}]\n}",

The table contains information about different players from various colleges who were drafted by the NFL. Each row represents one player and includes their round, pick number within that round, overall pick number (which is a cumulative count of all picks before this player), name, position, and college.\n\n2. To answer the claim, we need to find if there exists an \"8\" in the 'pick' column for a player with an 'overall' value of 32. If such a player exists, then the claim is FALSE. If no such player exists, then the claim is TRUE.\n\n3. We start by checking the rows one by one, starting from the first row (Row 1).\n\n4. Row 1: The 'overall' value for this player is not 32, it's 8 (from the 'overall' column). So, we move on to the next row.\n\n5. Continuing this process until we reach the last row (Row 20), none of the players have an overall pick number of 32.\n\n6.
