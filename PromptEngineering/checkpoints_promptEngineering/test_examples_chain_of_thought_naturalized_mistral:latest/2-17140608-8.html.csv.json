Identify the game where Indiana was the opponent, as that is the game we need to focus on to determine if Rondo had the most assists in a single game. In this case, it's game 60 (row 12).\n\n2. From each row, find the column \"high assists\" to see how many assists were made by each player during that game. For game 60, Rondo had 17 assists according to the cell with row_index = 12 and column_name = 'high assists'.\n\n3. To determine if Rondo has the most assists in any other game, repeat step 2 for each game (rows 1-11) and compare the number of assists to the number of assists Rondo had against Indiana.\n\n4. After comparing all the games, it is evident that no one else had more assists than Rondo in the game against Indiana.\n\nHere's the output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the game where Indiana was the opponent (game 60)\",\n    \"Find high assists for each player in that game\",\n    \"Compare the number of assists Rondo had against Indiana with the number of assists he had in other games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": 'high assists' }\n  ]\n}",
