First, I will go through the table and count the number of players at each position (defence, left wing, right wing, centre, goaltender) from picks 64 to 84.\n2.

Once I have counted the number of players at each position within the given range, I will compare the count for centre position players with the number 5.\n4. If the count is equal to or greater than 5, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow, let's go through the table and count the number of centre position players in the given range:\n\n- Row 7: Robert Reichel (centre) from pick 70, which is within the given range but not a match for the claim\n- Row 14: Doug Macdonald (centre) from pick 74, which is within the given range but not a match for the claim\n- Row 15: Josef Beranek (centre) from pick 75, which is within the given range but not a match for the claim\n- Row 17: Jackson Penney (right wing) from pick 80, outside of the given range\n\nThere are no more players to check within the given range.
