This will require us to go through each row of the table.\n2. In every row, we can find the leading scorer (column \"leading scorer\") and check if it matches with LeBron James. If it does, then that game counts towards the total number of games where he was the leading scorer for the Cavaliers.\n3. By going through all 16 rows, we can count the number of times LeBron James was the leading scorer.\n4. We find that LeBron James was the leading scorer in the following games: Row 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 16. That's a total of 9 games.\n5.
