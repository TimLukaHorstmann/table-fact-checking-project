Determine if there's any inconsistency in the table regarding the socket information: All processors listed in the table have their sockets specified, and they all share the same socket type (fcbga1088). This suggests that the socket information is consistent throughout the table.\n\n4. Check if there are other columns (like \"release price\") available for each processor without quickassist: We find that all processors have a release price listed, regardless of whether they have quickassist or not.\n\n5. Compare the sockets with and without quickassist to check if there's any difference: There is no difference in the socket types between processors with and without quickassist. All processors share the same socket type (fcbga1088).\n\n6.
