To find out which teams Nathan Ablett played for, we look at the \"team\" column in the table. For each row, if the value of the \"team\" column is \"geelong\", it means that the row represents a season when Nathan Ablett played for Geelong.\n3. To check whether Nathan Ablett played for Geelong for 3 years, we look at the number of seasons he spent with Geelong and compare it to the desired duration of 3 years.\n4. Since there are three rows where the \"team\" column is \"geelong\", which correspond to the seasons 2005, 2006, and 2007, Nathan Ablett played for Geelong for more than 1 year (since the minimum duration required is 3 years).\n5. We then verify whether these three years are consecutive by checking if there is a gap in his playing years at Geelong (i.e., missing seasons) and if so, they cannot be considered as 3 consecutive years. In this case, we don't see any gaps in the seasons he played for Geelong, so the years are consecutive.\n6. Now that we have confirmed Nathan Ablett played for Geelong for 3 consecutive years (2005-2007), we can check whether he later switched to Gold Coast. To do this, we look at the \"team\" column for any rows where the value is \"gold coast\".\n7. We find one row with a \"team\" of \"gold coast\", which corresponds to the season 2011. Since this team change comes after his three consecutive years with Geelong (2005-2007), we can conclude that Nathan Ablett indeed played for Geelong for 3 years before switching to Gold Coast.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the player, Find his seasons with each team, Verify if he played for Geelong for 3 consecutive years, Check for a team change and verify if it comes after the 3-year period\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n  ]\n}",
