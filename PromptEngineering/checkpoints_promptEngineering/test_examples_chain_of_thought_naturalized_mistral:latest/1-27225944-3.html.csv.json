    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the table and claim: The table given lists various football teams, their outgoing managers, the manner of their departure, the date they vacated their position, their replacements, the dates they were appointed, and their position in the table (pre-season or within the season). The claim is that \"rijeka's outgoing manager was nenad gra\u010dan\".\n\n2. Find the row for team rijeka: Scan through the table to find a row where the 'team' column matches \"rijeka\". Row 6 of the table corresponds to team rijeka.\n\n3. Check the outgoing manager for rijeka: In the row found in step 2, check the 'outgoing manager' column to determine who left their position at that team. The outgoing manager for rijeka is \"nenad gra\u010dan\".\n\n4. Compare with the claim: Compare the outgoing manager of rijeka (found in step 3) with the person mentioned in the claim. They match, as both are \"nenad gra\u010dan\".\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table and claim\", \"Find row for team 'rijeka'\", \"Check outgoing manager for rijeka\", \"Compare with the claim\"],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\"}]\n   }",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that \"ivan pudar from team hrvatski dragovoljac be the outgoing manager for mutual consent\".\n\n2. Find relevant data in the table: To verify this claim, we need to check if there is a row in the table that matches the team (hrvatski dragovoljac) and manager (ivan pudar) and shows the manner of departure as \"mutual consent\".\n\n3. Analyze the data: In the table, there are two rows related to hrvatski dragovoljac, one with ivan pudar as the outgoing manager. The first row shows that he was removed from position (not mutual consent), and the second row shows that he left for mutual consent.\n\n4. Conclusion: The claim is TRUE based on the data provided in the table.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n- { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"outgoing manager\" },\n- { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\" }\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the table and claim. The table contains information about different football teams, their managers, and the circumstances of manager changes. The claim states that \"ivan pudar departed team lokomotiva with mutual consent\".\n\n2. Search for a row in the table where the outgoing manager is \"ivan pudar\" and the team name is \"lokomotiva\". This will help us determine if there was a mutual consent departure of ivan pudar from lokomotiva.\n\n3. Inspect the table: We find that Row 4 meets these criteria - the outgoing manager is \"ivan pudar\" and the team name is \"lokomotiva\". The manner of departure is mentioned as \"mutual consent\".\n\n4.
