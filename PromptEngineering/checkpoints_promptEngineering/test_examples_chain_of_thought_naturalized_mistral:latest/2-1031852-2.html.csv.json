    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim is that Kansas City has no post-season record in 2013.\n2. Identify relevant data: To verify the claim, we need to look at the post-season records and the years associated with each team (affiliate).\n3. Search for Kansas City's affiliation in the given table: In this case, Kansas City is not mentioned directly as an MLB affiliate, but there is a manager (Brian Buchanan) who had a 44-42 record with Houston in 2013 and then moved to Kansas City.\n4. Look for Kansas City's post-season record for the year 2013: Since no specific year or post-season record is given for Brian Buchanan after his move, we can conclude that there is no post-season record for Kansas City in 2013.\n\nThe final answer in a valid JSON object format would be as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify relevant data (post-season records and years)\",\n    \"Search for Kansas City's affiliation\",\n    \"Look for Kansas City's post-season record in 2013\",\n    \"Since no post-season record is found, conclude that there is no post-season record for Kansas City in 2013\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
