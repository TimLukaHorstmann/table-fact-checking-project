    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the claim which states that the iv Glover Trophy was one of two races in the Goodwood circuit during the 1956 Formula One season.\n   2. Scan through the table to find the rows where the 'circuit' column equals 'Goodwood'. There are only two such rows: Row 2 and Row 10.\n   3. Determine the year for each of these races by looking at the 'date' column. The date in Row 2 is '2 April', which corresponds to 1956 according to the format given, and the date in Row 10 is '8 September'. Since we are interested in the races happening in April, focus on Row 2 for now.\n   4. Confirm that this race (Row 2) is indeed the iv Glover Trophy by comparing it with the 'race name' column. The race name in Row 2 matches the claim ('iv glover trophy').\n   5.

If a match is found, determine if it occurs in the same row, indicating that the same circuit was used for two different races, which would contradict the claim that \"the Caen circuit _was_ commonly used as the Aintree circuit.\"\n6. If no match is found between the circuit names, conclude that the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence to suggest that the Caen circuit was used as the Aintree circuit during the 1956 Formula One season.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify circuits mentioned in table\", \"Check for identical circuit names\", \"Examine each row for a match between 'Caen' and 'Aintree'\", \"Determine if the match occurs in the same row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
