    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the information needed to evaluate the claim: We need to find a row where the grid position (column \"grid\") is 104, and the laps completed (\"laps\") and time retired (+ retirement time) match the given values (not applicable since 104 is not in the grid positions).\n\n2. Scan the table for relevant rows: Since no row has a grid position of 104, it means that there are no drivers who started with 104 laps and retired after 6.18 minutes (as this is not specified for any driver). Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the information needed to evaluate the claim.\",\n    \"Scan the table for relevant rows and compare them with the given values.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
