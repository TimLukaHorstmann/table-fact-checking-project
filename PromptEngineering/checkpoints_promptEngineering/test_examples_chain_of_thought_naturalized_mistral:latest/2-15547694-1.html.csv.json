Determine which party has the second most number of members. From step 1, we know that Fianna F\u00e1il has the most members with 21 and Independent has 9 members. Comparing these two, it is clear that Independent has fewer members than Fianna F\u00e1il (21 - 9 = 12).\n   3. Since there are only four other parties left in the table, we can check their total number of members: Fine Gael (9), Labour Party (8), Clann na Talmhan (3).\n   4. Comparing the second party (Independent) with these remaining three, it is clear that none of them have more than 9 members.\n   5.
