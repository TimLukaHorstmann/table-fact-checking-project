Next, we need to find out if there is any row where the year (event) matches with 2012. To do this, we will check all rows excluding the first one as it contains identical values for all columns.\n\n3. In this case, row 4 has \"us open\" which took place in New York, United States and the surface was hard. If we look at the score column, it does not match with any specific score like 6-7 (5-7) or 7-6 (7-5), so it seems incomplete.

Since we can't definitively associate the events for these two rows with John Isner, we would need additional context to confirm whether he played in one or multiple events during those years.

In Row 18, the player is \"novak djokovic\", again not John Isner, so we skip this row as well. However, in Row 14, we find that \"player: jo - wilfried tsonga\" is not John Isner but the event is Winston-Salem, United States, not Cincinnati, United States. So we skip this row too. In Row 15, the player is \"tom\u00e1\u0161 berdych\", which again is not John Isner, and the event is Winston-Salem, United States as well, so we skip this row too. Finally, in Row 19, the player is \"juan mart\u00edn del potro\" which is not John Isner, but the event is Cincinnati, United States.\n4. Count the number of remaining rows: There are no more rows to check since we have reached the end of the table and all the skipped rows were accounted for.
