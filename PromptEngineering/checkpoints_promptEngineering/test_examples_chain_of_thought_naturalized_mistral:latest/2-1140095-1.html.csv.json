Compare this calculated difference with other race gaps to find the longest one in the series.\n    - To do this, we need to calculate and compare the differences for all the remaining races in the table.\n\n4. Calculate the gap between the next closest races:\n    - Belgian Grand Prix date: 9th June (Row 4) -> Spanish Grand Prix to Belgian Grand Prix is 34 days (9th June - 12th May)\n    - Dutch Grand Prix date: 23rd June (Row 5) -> Spanish Grand Prix to Dutch Grand Prix is 11 days (23rd June - 12th May)\n    - French Grand Prix date: 7th July (Row 6) -> Spanish Grand Prix to French Grand Prix is 26 days (7th July - 12th May)\n    - British Grand Prix date: 20th July (Row 7) -> Spanish Grand Prix to British Grand Prix is 48 days (20th July - 12th May)\n    - German Grand Prix date: 4th August (Row 8) -> Spanish Grand Prix to German Grand Prix is 67 days (4th August - 12th May)\n    - Italian Grand Prix date: 8th September (Row 9) -> Spanish Grand Prix to Italian Grand Prix is 107 days (8th September - 12th May)\n    - Canadian Grand Prix date: 22nd September (Row 10) -> Spanish Grand Prix to Canadian Grand Prix is 148 days (22nd September - 12th May)\n    - United States Grand Prix date: 6th October (Row 11) -> Spanish Grand Prix to US Grand Prix is 194 days (6th October - 12th May)\n    - Mexican Grand Prix date: 3rd November (Row 12) -> Spanish Grand Prix to Mexican Grand Prix is 258 days (3rd November - 12th May)\n\n5.

However, if the count is greater than or less than 3, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of times Jo Siffert has the pole position.\",\n    \"Compare the count with 3.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"pole position\" }\n  ]\n}",

Compare the fastest lap column with the winning driver column for each row:\n   - For Row 1: Jim Clark (fastest lap) is the same as Jim Clark (winning driver). True for this row.\n   - For Row 2: Jean-Pierre Beltoise (fastest lap) is not the same as Graham Hill (winning driver). False for this row.\n   - For Row 3: Richard Attwood (fastest lap) is not the same as Graham Hill (winning driver). False for this row.\n   - For Row 4: Chris Amon (fastest lap) is not the same as Bruce McLaren (winning driver). False for this row.\n   - For Row 5: Chris Amon (fastest lap) is not the same as Jacky Stewart (winning driver).
