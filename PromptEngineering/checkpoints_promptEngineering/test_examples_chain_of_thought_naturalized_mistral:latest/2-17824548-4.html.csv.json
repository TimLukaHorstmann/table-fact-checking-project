    "resp": "Here are the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be checked: The claim is that the lyrics and music for draw 5 is Hanne S\u00f8rvaag and Harry Sommerdahl.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to the draw number specified in the claim (draw 5). In this case, we look at Row 5 of the table.\n\n3. Extract the artist and music information from the relevant cell(s) for the given row. In this case, the artist and music are listed under the \"artist\" and \"lyrics (l) / music (m)\" columns respectively, so we need to check these values.\n\n4. Compare the extracted values with the claim: Check if Hanne S\u00f8rvaag and Harry Sommerdahl are present in the \"artist\" and \"music (m)\" columns for the selected row.\n\n   Now let's analyze the data from Row 5:\n   - The artist for draw 5 is Foxy, but this doesn't match Hanne S\u00f8rvaag or Harry Sommerdahl. However, we still need to check the \"music (m)\" column.\n   - In the \"music (m)\" column for Row 5, we find the values Hanne S\u00f8rvaag and Harry Sommerdahl as expected.\n\n   Since both artist and music information match the claim for draw 5, the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim: The lyric music for draw 5 be Hanne S\u00f8rvaag Harry Sommerdahl.\", \"Find the row corresponding to the given draw number (draw 5).\", \"Extract artist and music information from the relevant cell(s) for the given row (artist from column 'artist' and music from column 'lyrics (l) / music (m)' ).\", \"Compare the extracted values with the claim: Check if Hanne S\u00f8rvaag and Harry Sommerdahl are present in the 'artist' and 'music (m)' columns for the selected row.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lyrics (l) / music (m)\"}]\n}",
