Since we're checking for race 8 occurring in both 1959 and 1976, compare the \"year\" values in the found rows with 1959 and 1976.\n5. Notice that one of the found instances has a year of 1959 (row 5), which is one of the given years, but the other instance (row 17) has a year of 1973, not 1976.\n6. Conclude that stage 8 was indeed held in 1959, but it wasn't held in 1976.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the columns: year, date, stages, distance, winner, and race (implicitly).\", \"Look for a row where the 'stages' column equals 8 to see if there are any races with 8 stages.\", \"Find that there are two instances of races with 8 stages in rows 5 and 17, happening in 1959 and 1973 respectively.\", \"Compare the 'year' values in the found rows with 1959 and 1976.\", \"Conclude that stage 8 was indeed held in 1959, but it wasn't held in 1976.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stages\"}]\n}",
