Inspect the value in the first episode title cell (\"tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j\"). Note that it does not start with the letter 't', but it has a subtitle containing 't'. Ignore this for now as we are only looking for titles that begin with 't'.\n4. Move to the next row (row 2) and check its episode title cell (\"montell jordan\"). This also does not start with 't'.\n5. Continue checking the rest of the rows: row 3, row 4, row 5, row 6, row 7, row 8, row 9, row 10, row 11, row 12, row 13, row 14, row 15, row 16, and row 17.
