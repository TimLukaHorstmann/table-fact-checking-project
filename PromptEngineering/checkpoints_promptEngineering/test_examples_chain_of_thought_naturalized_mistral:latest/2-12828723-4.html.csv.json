We can find these values by checking the rows where the club column matches \"loughor rfc\" and looking at the columns with names 'try bonus' and 'tries against'. The relevant cells for this step are Row 5, Column 'try bonus' and Row 5, Column 'tries against'.\n\n3. Compare the values found in the previous step to the claim.

We can scan the table for any row where \"played\" column equals 22. In this case, there are multiple teams fulfilling this condition: Kidwelly RFC (row 4), Ammanford RFC (row 6), Waunarlwydd RFC (row 7), Pencoed RFC (row 8), BP RFC (row 9), Mumbles RFC (row 10), Cwmavon RFC (row 11), Penclawdd RFC (row 12) and Gorseinon RFC (row 13).\n\n3. Next, we need to find a team that fulfills not only the 'played' condition but also has \"points for\" equals to 386, \"try bonus\" equals to 3, and \"tries for\" equals to 45. This would mean that we are looking for one specific team among the previously identified teams.\n\n4.

For 'bp rfc', the try bonus is 2, while for 'penclawdd rfc', it is 1. Both numbers are less than 3 (the maximum try bonus points a team can earn).\n   3.

However, it's important to note that there is a mistake in the table where loughor rfc has 43 tries against instead of 38 (as seen in rows 1-4).
