    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the top golfer by finding the row with the lowest place number (1 in this case). The player at this row is Jim Simons with a score of 207.\n\n2. Find the players tied for eighth position by looking for rows where the place number is 8 or higher and find the corresponding scores. In this case, there are three players (Ken Still, Larry Hinson, Bruce Devlin) with a score of 212.\n\n3. Calculate the difference in strokes between the top golfer (Jim Simons) and the tied eighth position players:\n    - Difference for Ken Still: 207 - 212 = 5\n    - Difference for Larry Hinson: 207 - 212 = 5\n    - Difference for Bruce Devlin: 207 - 212 = 5\n\n4.
