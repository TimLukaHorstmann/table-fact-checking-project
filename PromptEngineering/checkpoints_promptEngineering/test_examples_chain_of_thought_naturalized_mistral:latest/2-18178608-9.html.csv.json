Since we cannot find a match between Ireland and England in the table, we need to search for these matches outside of the provided table. Assuming that the table only contains Five Nations and Millennium Trophy matches for this year, we need to check if there were any additional tests or other tournaments involving these teams.\n\n3. Let's assume that Ireland vs England match happened but is not included in the table (it might have taken place earlier or later in 1988). Since the table does include matches between Ireland and England, this assumption means that the provided table is not complete.\n\n4. Now let's focus on the matches we can see in the table.

However, Ireland appears in rows 4 (Five Nations) and 5 (Millennium Trophy match).\n\n2. Next, I need to check if England competes against Ireland during both types of matches for the same year. The Five Nations Championship matches are all in 1988, but there is no row where \"opposing teams\" is \"England\" and \"status\" is \"Five Nations\". This means that England does not compete against Ireland during the Five Nations Championship in 1988.\n\n3. For the Millennium Trophy match, I need to find a row where \"opposing teams\" is \"Ireland\" and \"status\" is either \"Five Nations\" or \"Millennium Trophy match\". Since there is no such row, it means that Ireland does not compete against England in both types of matches during the same year.\n\n4.
