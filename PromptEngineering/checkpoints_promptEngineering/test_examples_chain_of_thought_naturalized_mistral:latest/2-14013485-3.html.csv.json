The \"years\" value should be a pair of years indicating the starting and ending year of coaching, while the claim specifies only the starting year (1909). So, we need to find the row where the starting year is 1909.\n   4. In Row 2, fe schofield's \"years\" value is (1909 - 1910), which indicates that their coaching started in 1909 and ended in 1910. This matches the given claim of starting year 1909.\n   5. To confirm, compare the ending year with the following row's starting year to see if there is no gap in coaching years (i.e., the coach in Row 2 shouldn't have a longer coaching tenure than the one in Row 3). However, since there seems to be no row after fe schofield (the table only goes up to Row 34), this comparison cannot be made directly from the provided data.
