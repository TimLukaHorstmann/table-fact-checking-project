The second column lists players, and the third column lists their countries.\n2. Next, we focus on the fifth column which shows points, and the sixth column that shows events. We will use this information later for comparison purposes.\n3. The seventh column is about reset points, which seem to be constant for all players. However, the table does not specify a value for the player with an unnamed identifier of 56.\n4. Since the table lacks relevant data for the player with an unnamed identifier of 56, we cannot directly compare their reset point with any other player in the table.\n5. To verify the claim, we would need to find a player who has a reset point lower than 99012 and had participated in exactly 56 events. But since no such data exists for the player with an unnamed identifier of 56, we cannot definitively answer the claim.\n\nThe table does not contain enough information to determine if the claim is true or false.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Observe the structure of the table.\",\n    \"Focus on columns containing points, events, and reset points.\",\n    \"Notice that there is no data for the player with an unnamed identifier of 56 regarding their reset point.\",\n    \"Can't compare the claimed lowest reset point with any other player in the table due to missing data.\",\n    \"Conclude that the claim cannot be answered based on the provided information.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
