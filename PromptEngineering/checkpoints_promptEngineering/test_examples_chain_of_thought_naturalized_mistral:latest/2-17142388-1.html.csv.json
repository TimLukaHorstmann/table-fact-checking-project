Determine the corresponding dates for each row with a westpac area: from: 7 june 1962 (row 1), from: 1 august 1963 (row 2).

Identify the key elements in the claim: The tail code should be either `ah - 3xx` or `np - 3xx`, with `ah - 3xx` being used for all sections except one, which is on July 18, 1968, where `np - 3xx` should be used.\n\n2. Compare the tail codes in each row of the table to the pattern described in the claim. In this case, we are looking for rows with `ah - 3xx` except one that has `np - 3xx`.\n\n3. Start checking the rows from the top:\n   - The first row's tail code is `ah - 3xx`, which follows the pattern described in the claim.\n   - The second and third rows' tail codes are also `ah - 3xx`, which further supports the claim.\n   - The fourth, fifth, and sixth rows all have `ah - 3xx` as well.\n\n4. At this point, since we have not found a single row that contradicts the claim, it appears that the tail code is either `ah - 3xx` or `np - 3xx`, with `ah - 3xx` being used for all sections except one (the sixth row) where `np - 3xx` is used, as described in the claim.\n\n5.
