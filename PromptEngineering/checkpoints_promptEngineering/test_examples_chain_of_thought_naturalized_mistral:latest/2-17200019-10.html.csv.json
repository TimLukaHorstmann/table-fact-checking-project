For Jonathan Legear, it is 5 and for Mat\u00edas Su\u00e1rez, it is 1.\n4. Compare the values obtained in step 3 to determine if Jonathan Legear has scored more goals than Matias Suarez. In this case, Jonathan Legear (7) has indeed scored more goals than Matias Suarez (1).\n5. The claim states that the comparison is between the next highest ranked player in the Belgian First Division A league who plays in the Belgian Cup and Jonathan Legear. To verify this, we need to find the next highest ranked player who meets the same criteria.\n6. Find all players who meet the criteria (plays in the Belgian First Division A league and also plays in the Belgian cup) by looking for rows where the 'league' column is greater than 0 and the 'title playoff' and 'super cup' columns are both 0. This applies to all players except Matias Suarez (Row 13), Jonathan Legear (Row 5), and Nemanja Rnic (Row 19) since they have already been considered.\n7. Sort the remaining players by their league value in ascending order, as the claim only refers to the next highest rank player.

Check if the player immediately following Matias Suarez (i.e., Thomas Chatelle in our sorted list) has a lower 'league' value than Jonathan Legear. In this case, Thomas Chatelle (4) has a lower league value than Jonathan Legear (5), which means that he is ranked below Jonathan Legear.\n9.
