Since the table shows unique dates for each tie, it is possible to have multiple ties on the same date but they will not overlap within the table.\n5. If there is no such row, then Portsmouth could not be the away team when Leeds United was the home team (since we've checked all other teams in the table that were playing on 15 February 1997).
