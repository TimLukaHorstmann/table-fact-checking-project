The columns include place (ranking), player, country, score (number of strokes taken), and to par (difference between the number of strokes taken and par).\n\n2. Next, we look for the winning score in the table. In this case, there is no row indicating a single player with a lower score than all others.\n\n3. However, we notice that multiple players have the same score of 71 (to par: + 1) and are tied at 3rd place. No player has a lower score than this.\n\n4. The winning score in golf tournaments is typically the lowest score, but when there is a tie for the lowest score, all tied players are considered joint winners.\n\n5. Since there is no single winner with a lower score and multiple players are tied at 71 (to par: + 1), it means that in this tournament, the winning score was indeed 71 and there were multiple players who tied for the win.\n\n6.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n1. Identify all players for England and United States from the table. This can be done by looking for the column \"country\" and finding rows where the value is either 'England' or 'United States'.\n2. Count the number of English players and US players separately. For England, we find 6 players (Nick Job, Tony Jacklin, David Jagger, Mark James, Howard Clark, and Arnold Palmer). For United States, we also find 6 players (Vicente Fernandez, Johnny Miller, Ben Crenshaw, Hal Sutton (a), Bill Rogers, and Sam Torrance). However, Vicente Fernandez is listed as 'Argentina' in the table but his name suggests he might be of Spanish origin. Since we don't have additional information to confirm this assumption, we will keep him for now.\n3. Check if there are any ties. In this case, we see that there are multiple players tied at the 9th place with a score of 72 and to par: + 2. These include players from both England (David Jagger, Mark James) and United States (Ben Crenshaw, Hal Sutton (a), Bill Rogers, Sam Torrance).\n4. If there are ties, then the number of participants for each country in the top positions can be less than the total count found earlier. In this case, since all tied players are included in the count from step 2, we can subtract the number of tied players from England and United States to get the number of players in the top positions for each country. For England, we have 2 tied players, so 6 - 2 = 4. For United States, we also have 2 tied players, so 6 - 2 = 4.\n5. Compare the adjusted counts from step 4. Since both England and United States have 4 players each in the top positions, the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all players for England and United States from the table.\",\n    \"Count the number of English players and US players separately.\",\n    \"Check if there are any ties.\",\n    \"If there are ties, then adjust the counts for each country.\",\n    \"Compare the adjusted counts for England and United States.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n  ]\n}",
