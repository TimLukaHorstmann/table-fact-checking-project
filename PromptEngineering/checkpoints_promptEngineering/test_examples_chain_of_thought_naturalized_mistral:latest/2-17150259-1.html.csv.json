    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim is that a friendly competition took place at Lugo, Emilia - Romagna on May 26, 1999.\n\n2. Extract relevant information from the table for the given date (May 26, 1999): Find the row in the table where the 'date' column matches the provided date. In this case, Row 10.\n\n3. Check if the venue specified in the claim matches the venue from step 2: Compare the venues specified in the claim (Lugo, Emilia - Romagna) and in row 10 of the table (lugo). If they match, it supports the claim. They do not match, so this does not support the claim.\n\n4. Check if the competition type specified in the claim matches the competition type from step 2: Since there is no \"competition\" column for row 10, we cannot make a comparison here. However, since friendly competitions are not specified with a particular competition name in the table, this lack of information does not contradict the claim.\n\n5. Final answer based on the reasoning steps: The claim states that a friendly competition took place at Lugo, Emilia - Romagna on May 26, 1999. While we could not find direct evidence to support this claim in the provided table, the absence of contradictory information and the vague nature of the claim (as friendly competitions are not specified with a particular competition name) make it plausible that the claim might be true. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to definitively confirm whether the claim is true or false.\n\nOutput:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Extract relevant information from the table for the given date (May 26, 1999)\",\n    \"Check if the venue specified in the claim matches the venue from step 2\",\n    \"Check if the competition type specified in the claim matches the competition type from step 2\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"Plausible but unconfirmed\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"venue\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"competition\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the criteria for verification: The claim mentions two pieces of information - the venue and the competition date (26 May 1999) for a friendly match. We will look for a row in the table that matches these criteria.\n\n2. Search the table: Scan through the table to find a row where the \"venue\" column matches \"lugo, emilia - romagna\" and the \"date\" column matches 26 May 1999 or any close date (considering potential errors in the claim).\n\n3. Evaluate the match: If a match is found with the specified venue and date, compare the \"competition\" column value with the given condition of being a friendly match.\n\n4. Determine the answer: If a match is found that matches the criteria for both the venue and competition type, then the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the criteria (venue & competition date) from the claim. Search the table for a match using these criteria.
