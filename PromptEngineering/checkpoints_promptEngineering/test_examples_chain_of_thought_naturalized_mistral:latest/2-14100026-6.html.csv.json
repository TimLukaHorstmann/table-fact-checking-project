This implies we are looking for the game with the highest 'points' value in row 2 (since row numbers correspond to the game number).\n       2. Check the table: We see that each row has a 'points' column, which represents the total points scored by a team during a series of games.

Verify the conclusion: To find the total points scored during the series of games for both teams in each set of games, we need to calculate the 'points difference' and add it to the 'points' value (since the difference is what the opponent scored). For row 1, we have a points difference of 35 - 9, which gives us a total of 44 points for this team.
