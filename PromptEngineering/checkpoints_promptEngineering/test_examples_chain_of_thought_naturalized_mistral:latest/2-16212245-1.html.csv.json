Count the number of racers per manufacturer:\n   - Racers on Yamaha: Row 1, Row 6, and Row 15 (Valentino Rossi, Colin Edwards, and Anthony West) = 3 racers.\n   - Racers on Honda: Row 2, Row 3, Row 4, Row 8, Row 9, Row 13, and Row 14 (Casey Stoner, Dani Pedrosa, Alex de Angelis, Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden, Tadayuki Okada) = 6 racers.\n   - Racers on Ducati: Row 2, Row 5, Row 7, Row 10, and Row 11 (Casey Stoner, Colin Edwards, Loris Capirossi, Chris Vermeulen, Sylvain Guintoli) = 5 racers.\n   - Racers on Suzuki: Row 10, Row 12, and Row 16 (Chris Vermeulen, Toni Elias, James Toseland) = 3 racers.\n   - Racers on Kawasaki: Row 15, Row 17, and Row 19 (Anthony West, John Hopkins, Marco Melandri) = 3 racers.\n\n3.
