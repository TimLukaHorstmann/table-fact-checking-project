Next, we look for patterns in the number of competitions per year in order to verify the claim that Lauryn Williams never competed in more than 2 races in a single year.\n   3. Examining the table, we find that in 2003, 2004 (twice), 2005 (twice), and 2007, she only participated in 2 competitions per year. In 2002, 2006, and no other years, she competed in more than 2 races.\n   4. As the claim specifically states that the \"most\" number of races Lauryn Williams competed in a year is 2, we need to find evidence that supports this claim rather than cases where she competed in more than 2 races.\n   5.
