The scores are given in the \"home team score\" and \"away team score\" columns respectively.\n2. Compare the scores between games to find a game where both the home team and away team scored the highest.\n3. Inspect the table row by row, starting from the first row (Row 1) and going through the last row (Row 6).\n4. Examine the home team score for Row 1 (12.16 or 88), it is not the highest score among all games.\n5. Examine the away team score for Row 1 (15.15 or 105), it is also not the highest score among all games. So, this game does not satisfy our condition.\n6. Move to Row 2, examine the home team score (13.22 or 90) and away team score (13.11 or 89). Neither of these scores are the highest, so this game does not satisfy our condition either.\n7. Move to Row 3, examine the home team score (15.15 or 105) which is the same as one of the highest scores found earlier, but we need to check if the away team score for this game is also the highest. Examine the away team score (13.13 or 91), it is not the highest score among all games, so this game does not satisfy our condition either.\n8. Move to Row 4, examine the home team score (20.17 or 137) and away team score (24.12 or 156). Neither of these scores are the highest scores found earlier, so this game does not satisfy our condition either.\n9. Move to Row 5, examine the home team score (13.20 or 98), it is not the highest score among all games. But we need to check if the away team score for this game is also the highest. Examine the away team score (14.11 or 95) which is lower than one of the highest scores found earlier, so this game does not satisfy our condition either.\n10. Move to Row 6, examine the home team score (14.9 or 93) and away team score (13.13 or 91). Neither of these scores are the highest scores found earlier, but interestingly, we already found a game where both teams scored higher than these scores (Row 4).\n\nSince Row 6 does not satisfy our condition, let's re-examine Row 4: home team score (20.17 or 137) and away team score (24.12 or 156). Both of these scores are among the highest found earlier. So, this game satisfies our condition: the highest scores for both the home team and the away team were played at Moorabbin Oval on August 16, 1975.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the scores for each game\",\n    \"Compare the scores between games to find a game where both teams scored highest\",\n    \"Inspect the table row by row, starting from the first row and going through the last row\",\n    \"Examine the home team score and away team score for each game\",\n    \"Re-examine any game where both scores are among the highest found earlier\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\" }\n  ]\n}",
