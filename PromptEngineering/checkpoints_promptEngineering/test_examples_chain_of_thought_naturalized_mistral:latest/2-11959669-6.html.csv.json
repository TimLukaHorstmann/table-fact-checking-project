Check if there is a row in the table that matches the team 'charlotte'. The relevant row index for team 'charlotte' is 9 (Row 4).\n3. Examine the value in the 'high points' column for the team 'charlotte'. In Row 9, we can see that the high points for charlotte is 77.\n4. Identify the player who scored this high point. However, it's not explicitly stated in the table who scored 77 points for Charlotte. But since Allen scored 23 points in a different game (Row 8), we can assume that if no other player scored higher in the 'Charlotte' row, then Allen is still the player with the highest score for this team.\n5. Since there are no rows after Row 9 (Row 10 onwards) that belong to the 'charlotte' team, we can conclude that the high point for charlotte was not scored by any other player in the given table.\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column representing high points.\",\n    \"Check if there's a row for team 'charlotte'.\",\n    \"Examine the high points value for team 'charlotte'.\",\n    \"Assume that Allen scored the highest for charlotte since he scored 23 points in another game.\",\n    \"Since there are no more rows for the 'Charlotte' team, conclude that if Allen didn't score higher for another team, he scored the high point for Charlotte.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"high points\" }\n  ]\n}",
