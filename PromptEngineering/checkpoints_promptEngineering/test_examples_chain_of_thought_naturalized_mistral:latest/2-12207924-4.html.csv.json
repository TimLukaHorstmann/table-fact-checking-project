First, I will look for instances where the opponent (column name: 'opponent') is the same as 'Mariners' or 'Angels' since these teams do not appear after June 24 (June 25 onwards).

If there is no game played against either Mariners or Angels between June 25 and June 30, I can safely conclude that the claim is false. However, if I find at least six consecutive games against either Mariners or Angels on these dates, then I will check whether the 'score: column indicates a win for the Blue Jays (a score of less than the opponent's score) in all those matches.\n\n4.
