    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim components to be checked against the table data: highest score, dates, attendance, and home team.\n2. Compare the scores from the table to find instances where Vancouver or Los Angeles scored 7-2, 4-3, 4-7, or 3-5. In this table, there are no such instances with both scores and dates as specified in the claim. However, we do find 7-2 on May 9 and 4-3 on May 11 for Vancouver. Additionally, 4-7 was scored by Los Angeles on May 7 and 3-5 on May 13.\n3. Check the attendance for the matches with these scores as per the claim. For Vancouver (7-2) and Los Angeles (4-3), we find the same attendance (16150 and 16005 respectively, in that order).\n4. Verify that the home team for the matches with these scores aligns with the claim. For the first match, Vancouver is the home team which agrees with the claim since we found a score of 7-2 for Vancouver. For the second match, Los Angeles was the home team, which also agrees with the claim as we found a score of 4-3 for Los Angeles.\n5. Summarize that although there are no instances where both scores (7-2 and 4-3) were played between the same teams on the specified dates, all other conditions mentioned in the claim are fulfilled.\n\nFinally, output the answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify components of the claim to be checked\",\n    \"Compare scores from table with the claim's scores\",\n    \"Check attendance for matches with found scores\",\n    \"Verify home teams for matches with found scores\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
