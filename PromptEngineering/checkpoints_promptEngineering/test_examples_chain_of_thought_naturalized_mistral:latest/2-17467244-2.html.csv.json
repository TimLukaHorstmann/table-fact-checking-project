Check if a higher scoring game took place during the same tournament: The highest scoring game during the World Cup appears to be row 5, with a score of 4-0 (quarter-final), and there is no game on 1995-06-10 in the table.\n\n5.

Divide the number of gold medal matches by the total number of matches. This will give us the fraction of matches that were gold medal matches.\n5. Since we have found exactly one gold medal match, dividing by 16 gives a fraction of 1/16.\n6. A fraction of 1/16 is equivalent to 1/16 * 100% = 6.25%. However, since we are counting the percentage of matches that were gold medal matches, we will multiply this fraction by 100 and subtract it from 100%. This gives us 93.75%.\n7. Since there is only one gold medal match out of 16 total matches, it means that approximately 93.75% of the matches were not gold medal matches.
