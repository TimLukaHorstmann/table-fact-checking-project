By scanning through the table, we can see that attendance of 14489 occurs in Row 9 (week: 9).\n2. Next, we check the record for this game. In the same row, we can see that the record for the game is 4 - 4.\n3. Therefore, since the team's record (4-4) matches the attendance of 14489 (which corresponds to Row 9), the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find row with attendance of 14489, check record for this row\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
