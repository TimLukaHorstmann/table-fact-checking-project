(Note: The first episode has no preceding episodes, so we will start from the second episode.)\n2. For the second episode ('Road to Europe'), the difference is calculated by subtracting its air date (February 7, 2002) from the first episode's air date (May 30, 2000). This gives us a time span of 594 days or approximately 1 year and 8 months.\n3. Continue calculating the differences for the remaining episodes in the same way: 'Road to Rupert' (January 28, 2007 - February 7, 2002) = approximately 5 years and 4 months; 'Road to Germany' (October 19, 2008 - January 28, 2007) = approximately 2 years and 9 months; 'Road to the Multiverse' (September 27, 2009 - October 19, 2008) = approximately 1 year and 28 days; 'Road to the North Pole' (December 12, 2010 - September 27, 2009) = approximately 2 years, 135 days.\n4. Calculate the average time span between episodes by adding up all the differences and dividing by the number of 'road to' episodes (excluding the first episode since it has no preceding episodes).\n   - Average time span = ((594 + 1826 + 730 + 730 + 734) / 4) days. (Note: The total is approximately 4,014 days or slightly less than 11 years.)\n5. Convert the average time span into years by dividing by the number of days in a year (365).
