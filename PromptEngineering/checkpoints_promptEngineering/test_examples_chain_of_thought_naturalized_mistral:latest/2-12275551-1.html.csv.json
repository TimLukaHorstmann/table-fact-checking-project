To do this, calculate the difference between adjacent year values. For example, the gap between 1993 and 1994 is (1994 - 1993 =) 1.\n   3. Find the maximum gap among all the gaps calculated in step 2.

Next, count the number of times each partner appears as a men's doubles player. From the table, we can see that:\n   - Daniel Shirley appears 4 times (rows 1,2,3, and 10).\n   - John Gordon appears 3 times (rows 2, 3, and 10).\n   - All other partners appear only once.\n\n3. Now, compare the count of each partner to determine if Daniel Shirley is the only men's double partner to appear more than one time.

Identify the table's structure and understand that each row represents a year and the columns represent tournament categories (singles, doubles, mixed doubles) for both men and women, with each cell containing the name of the player who won that specific category in that year.\n\n2. Since we are asked to find the longest gap in time between two New Zealand Open events, we need to first identify the years when the winners were from New Zealand, as the table only provides information about New Zealand winners.\n\n3. Examine the rows where a cell under \"men's singles\" or \"women's singles\" contains a name that indicates a New Zealand player won (e.g., Nicholas Hall, Dean Galt, etc.). We find 9 such years: 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2007, and 2008.\n\n4. Calculate the time difference between consecutive New Zealand Open wins. For example, the gap between 1993 and 1994 is 1 year, between 1994 and 1997 is 3 years, and so on.\n\n5. Find the maximum gap in time among all calculated gaps. In this case, the maximum gap we find is 3 years (between 1994 and 1997).\n\n6. Compare the maximum gap found with the claim.
