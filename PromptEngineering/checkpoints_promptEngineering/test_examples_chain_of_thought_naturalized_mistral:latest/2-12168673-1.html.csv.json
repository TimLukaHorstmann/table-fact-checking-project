Extract the relevant data from the table for the year 2012:\n   - Find the row where the 'year' value is equal to 2012. The corresponding row number is Row 1.\n   - Identify the owner's details in this row by looking at the 'owner' column.\n\n3. Compare the extracted data with the claim:\n   - Check if the extracted owner name matches the owners mentioned in the claim. In this case, the owners are \"self / king / morgenson / travis\" and the extracted owner is \"self / king / morgenson / others\". Since \"others\" is not explicitly present in the table, we cannot confirm a perfect match but we can say that the owners partially match.\n   - Verify if the year matches with the claim. In this case, both the table row (2012) and the claim agree.\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning:\n   1. First, identify the owner(s) of the horse that won in 2012 (blueeyesintherin). In row 1, we can see that the owner is \"self / king / morgenson / travis, et al\". This indicates that multiple owners may be listed.\n   2. Next, check if any of these owners are also listed as the owner(s) of any winner after 2009. We need to compare this row's data with rows 4 to 17 (2009-1996) and rows 1, 2, 3, and 5 (2012, 2011, 2010, and 2008) as \"overbrook farm\" might have other horses in those years.\n   3. We notice that in row 4, the owner is \"westrock stables\", not related to our list of potential matches. In row 5, the owner is \"twin creeks racing stable\", not a match either. In rows 1, 2, and 3, there's no information about the owners that can be directly compared with our list.\n   4. However, in row 8, we find an owner named \"gainesway / george bolton\". By examining this owner name, we can see that \"gainesway\" is a part of our potential matches list (from blueeyesintherin's ownership).\n   5. Since we have found a match between one of the owners in 2012 and an owner after 2009, it means that the claim is TRUE: overbrook farm and et al own winner blueeyesintherin after 2009.\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\n       \"Identify the horse's owner in 2012\",\n       \"Check if any of these owners are also listed as the owner(s) of any winner after 2009\",\n       \"Examine each row from 2009 to 1996 and the relevant rows with potential matches (2012, 2011, 2010, and 2008)\",\n       \"Find a match between 'gainesway' in 2008 and our list of potential owners from 2012\"\n     ],\n     \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"owner\"},\n       {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"owner\"}\n     ]\n   }",

Since \"barry l king\", the owner of flashy lassie (2011), does not own any horse after 2009, and there are no combinations or partnerships with owners who owned horses after 2009, it can be concluded that \"self / king / morgenson / travis , et al\" do not own winner flashy lassie after 2009.\n\n   Final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the owner(s) of each horse from the table\",\n    \"Determine if any of the owners own 'flashy lassie' after 2009\",\n    \"Check for combinations or partnerships between owners that include 'barry l king' and another owner who owned a horse after 2009\",\n    \"Conclude based on analysis of the data\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"owner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"owner\" }\n  ]\n}",
