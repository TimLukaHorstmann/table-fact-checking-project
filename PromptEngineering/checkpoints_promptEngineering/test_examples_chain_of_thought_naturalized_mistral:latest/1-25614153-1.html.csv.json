In the table, we do not find any such album explicitly named 'con todo'. However, we know that Darlene Zschech was a worship leader in multiple albums, so we need to check all the albums she appeared in.\n   2. Look for Darlene Zschech's appearances as a worship leader and support vocalist across different albums. We find her in these rows: 2, 6, 7, 9, 12.\n   3. In each of these rows, check if the album name is relevant to our claim. We can see that Darlene Zschech appears as a worship leader for 'This Is Our God' (Row 12) and 'Saviour King' multiple times (Rows 7, 9).\n   4. Since we are checking for support vocalist appearances in the album 'con todo', we need to verify if Darlene Zschech provided support vocals in either 'This Is Our God' or 'Saviour King'.
