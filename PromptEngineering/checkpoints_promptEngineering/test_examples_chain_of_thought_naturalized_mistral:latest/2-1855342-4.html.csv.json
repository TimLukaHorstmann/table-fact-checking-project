    "resp": "Here are the steps in my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim statement: The claim is that 1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George Bush. In this context, \"George Bush\" likely refers to either George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush, since both share the surname \"Bush\". Given the table format, it seems the data pertains to U.S. Presidents.\n\n2. Find the relevant cells in the table: In this case, we need to find the row(s) corresponding to George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as the column named \"no opinion\". However, since the table provides data for multiple presidents, I'll check if the relevant cells have an entry of \"1%\" or close enough to determine if the claim is valid.\n\n3. Examine the values in the table: In Row 6, we find \"no opinion\" for both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush with a value of 1%.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim statement: The claim is that 1 percent of respondents have no opinion on George Bush.\",\n    \"Find relevant cells in table: Check rows for George H.W.
