    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify all the matches played by Chelsea in January 2003 from the table.\n   - The table contains five rows, but only the first two rows (row_index 1 & 2) show dates in January 2003.\n\n2. Check if Chelsea won these matches.\n   - Row 1: The result is recorded as \"1 - 0\", which indicates a win for Chelsea.\n     Row 2: The result is recorded as \"4 - 0\", which also indicates a win for Chelsea.\n\n3. Confirm if all matches were won (no losses or draws).\n   - Since there are no other rows in the table that correspond to matches played by Chelsea in January 2003, and both identified matches were wins, it can be assumed that they indeed won all their matches in January 2003.\n\n4. Determine if they kept a clean sheet (no goals conceded) for every match in January 2003.\n   - For the first match in January (Row 1), the scorers column shows only Chelsea's goal, not any from Middlesbrough. This means that Chelsea didn't concede a goal in this match.\n     For the second match in January (Row 2), there are scores for both teams, indicating that Chelsea conceded at least one goal in this match.\n   Since there was only one instance where Chelsea conceded a goal and no other matches in January 2003 were played by them (according to the provided table), it cannot be said that they kept a clean sheet throughout the month of January 2003.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all matches for Chelsea in January 2003\",\n    \"Check if Chelsea won these matches\",\n    \"Confirm if they won all matches (no losses or draws)\",\n    \"Determine if they kept a clean sheet in each match\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\" (Chelsea won all their matches),\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1},\n    {\"row_index\": 2}\n  ]\n}",
