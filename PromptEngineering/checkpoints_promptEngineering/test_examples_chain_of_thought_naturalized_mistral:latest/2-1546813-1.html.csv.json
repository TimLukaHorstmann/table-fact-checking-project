Count the number of times each captain won: To check if they have won the cup at least two times, we need to count the number of wins for each captain.

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n   1. Identify each captain named in the claim (Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, Kathy Whitworth) in the table.\n       - Patty Sheehan appears as captain in the rows where the winning team is Europe (2003 and 2002).\n       - Judy Rankin appears as captain in the rows where the winning team is the United States (1998, 1996).\n       - Kathy Whitworth appears as captain in the rows where the winning team is the United States (1992 and 1990).\n\n   2. Count the number of times each captain wins the Solheim Cup.\n      - Patty Sheehan wins once, since she captained a winning team in 2003 and 2002.\n      - Judy Rankin also wins once, as she captained a winning team in 1998 and 1996.\n      - Kathy Whitworth wins twice, since she captained a winning team in 1992 and 1990.\n\n   3. Compare the number of Solheim Cup victories by each captain to the claim that \"patty sheehan, judy rankin, and kathy whitworth be all captain that win the solheim cup 1 time\".\n      - The total number of wins matches the claim for Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin.\n      - Kathy Whitworth has a higher count of Solheim Cup victories than what is claimed, but since she captained two winning teams, it still falls under the condition that each captain won the Solheim Cup once while serving as captain (even though one of her victories was with another captain).\n\n   4. Final Answer: The claim is TRUE for Patty Sheehan and Judy Rankin, and partially true for Kathy Whitworth, as she captained two winning teams but the claim only mentions one win per captain.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify each captain named in the claim and their corresponding Solheim Cup wins.\",\n    \"Count the number of times each captain wins the Solheim Cup.\",\n    \"Compare the total number of wins by each captain to the claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"winning team\" }\n  ]\n}",
