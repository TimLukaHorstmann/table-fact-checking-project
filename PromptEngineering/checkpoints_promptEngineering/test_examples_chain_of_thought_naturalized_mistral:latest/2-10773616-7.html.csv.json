We notice that the score of Richmond (145) is greater than Collingwood's (74), which means Richmond beat Collingwood.\n4. Now, we check if Footscray beat Hawthorn by comparing their scores. For this, we look at Row 6 (Hawthorn score: 10.9 or 69) and Row 3 (Footscray score: 11.12 or 78).\n5. We notice that Footscray's score is less than Hawthorn's, which means Hawthorn did not beat Footscray.\n6.

Since we are looking for the second largest crowd, first identify the largest crowd and then find the entry with the second largest crowd.\n3. Starting from the first row, compare the 'crowd' values: 23025 (Row 1), 17500 (Row 2), 34000 (Row 3), 31000 (Row 4), 20500 (Row 5), 26000 (Row 6).\n4. The largest crowd is found in Row 3, and since we are looking for the second largest, we need to find the row with a 'crowd' value less than 34000 but greater than or equal to all other values.\n5. Comparing the remaining rows: 23025 < 34000, 17500 < 34000, 31000 > 34000, 20500 < 34000, 26000 > 34000.\n6. Since only Row 4 (Crowd: 31000) has a 'crowd' value greater than or equal to the remaining rows but less than that of Row 3, we can conclude that Row 4 corresponds to a game with a crowd size second largest in comparison to all other games in the table.\n7. However, since the claim specifically refers to \"collingwood v richmond\", we need to check if this game is represented in Row 3 (Collingwood v Richmond).\n8. Comparing 'home team' names: Melbourne (Row 1), Essendon (Row 2), Collingwood (Row 3), Carlton (Row 4), St Kilda (Row 5), Hawthorn (Row 6).\n9.
