Next, I will identify the column names which are relevant for answering the claim: \"events\", \"cashes\", and \"earnings\". The claim mentions the number of cash events with earnings of 39380.\n3. Then, I will iterate through each row in the table to check if a match is found for the specified conditions (cash event with earnings of 39380).\n4. If a match is found, I will output the answer as TRUE and the relevant cells as the row where the match was found with the column names \"cashes\" and \"earnings\".\n5. If no match is found after iterating through all rows, I will output the answer as FALSE and the relevant cells as an empty array [].\n\n   Final Answer:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": \"I identified the relevant columns for the claim (cashes and earnings), then searched for a row where both conditions in the claim are met (cash event with earnings of 39380).\",\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": []\n   }",

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process step by step:\n   1. Identify the row number corresponding to the 2002-2003 season. In this table, the first row corresponds to season 2002-2003.\n   2. Compare the values in the columns \"cashes\", \"match play\", and \"events\" of the first row with the claim values:\n      - The value for \"cashes\" is 6 which matches the claim value of 6 cash.\n      - The value for \"match play\" is 2, which is smaller than the claim value of 13 (since < 13).\n      - The value for \"events\" is 7, which also matches the claim value of 7 events.\n   3. Since all the claim conditions are met in the first row, it can be concluded that the claim about the 2002-2003 season (6 cashes, a match play smaller than 13 and 7 events) is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the row corresponding to the given season.
