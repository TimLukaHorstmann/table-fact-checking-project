    "resp": "Here are the steps for reasoning:\n   1. Identify the riding we need to focus on, which is Selkirk-Interlake. We find this by scanning the table for the name \"Selkirk-Interlake\".\n   2. Find the candidate associated with this riding. In our table, we look for a row where the 'riding' column matches \"Selkirk-Interlake\". The candidate in this row is Patricia Cordner.\n   3. Determine the number of votes the candidate received. To do so, we find the column named 'votes' in the row associated with Patricia Cordner and check its value.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the riding by scanning the table for 'Selkirk-Interlake'\",\n    \"Find the candidate associated with this riding (Patricia Cordner in our case)\",\n    \"Determine the number of votes the candidate received\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"candidate\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"votes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
