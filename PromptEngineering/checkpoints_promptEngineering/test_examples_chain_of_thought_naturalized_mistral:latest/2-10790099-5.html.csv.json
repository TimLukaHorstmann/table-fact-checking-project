Incrementally update the maximum value as you encounter larger values for different venues.\n5. If at any point, you find a venue with a crowd size equal to or greater than the current maximum value, that venue becomes the candidate for having the largest crowd in the list.\n6. After checking all venues, if only one venue was found with a crowd size equal to or greater than the initial maximum value, then it has the largest crowd among the listed venues.
