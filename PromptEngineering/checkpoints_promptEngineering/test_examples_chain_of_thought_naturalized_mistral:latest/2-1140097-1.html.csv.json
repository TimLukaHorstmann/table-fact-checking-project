Iterate through each row of the table and compare the values of 'winning driver' and 'fastest lap' columns with the drivers from the claim.\n\n3. If a match is found, that means the drivers have both the fastest lap and won the race for that specific event.\n\n4. Repeat step 1-3 for all rows in the table.\n\n5. If no match is found after checking all rows, then the drivers do not have both the fastest lap and win the race for any event.\n\nNow, here's the final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the drivers mentioned in the claim (Jim Clark and Richie Ginther)\",\n    \"Check if they appear as both fastest lap and winning driver for any race in the table\",\n    \"Iterate through each row of the table and compare values\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"winning driver\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
