In this case, we have Forsythe Racing, PKV Racing, Newman/Haas Racing, MI - Jack Conquest Racing, Team Australia, Dale Coyne Racing, Rocketsports Racing, HVM Racing, Rusport.\n2. For each team, check the qual 2 times and best times in the table to see if any of them have a qual 2 time of 58 and a best less than 57.\n3. Check Rocketsports Racing first since that's what the claim focuses on. In this case, Timo Glock has a qual 2 time of 58.385 (Row 11) and a best time of 58.385 (same as qual 2). This satisfies the condition mentioned in the claim for Rocketsports Racing.\n4. Check the remaining teams to see if any of them also meet the condition.
