In this case, the relevant rows are 3 (Season 1), 16 (Season 17) and 18 (Season 8).\n\n3. Check if the claim is true: Compare the episodes found in step 2 with the season numbers mentioned in the claim (1, 8, and 17). Since both Season 1 (episode 3) and Season 17 (episode 16) are present, it is a valid match.

The data shows that there is usually a gap of one week between consecutive episodes.\n\n3. Find episode 9 and 10: Scan through the table to find the episode labeled as number 9 and then find the next episode (number 10).\n\n4. Compare the air dates: Check if the air date of episode 10 is exactly one week after the air date of episode 9. In this case, the air date of episode 9 is April 8, 2010 and the air date of episode 10 is April 15, 2010.\n\n5.

In the table, there are no clear indicators of seasons, so I will assume that each row represents an episode from the same season for the sake of argument.\n\n3. Now, check if there's a pattern in the table that shows episodes airing weekly. In the given table, it appears that new episodes seem to be released every 7 days, with each row incrementing by approximately one million viewers per day (this is a rough estimate and may not be exact).\n\n4. Identify episode 8 in season 2. In the table provided, this corresponds to episode 36 (row 16).\n\n5. Calculate the number of days between episodes 8 and 10 by subtracting their row indices: 21 - 16 = 5 days.
