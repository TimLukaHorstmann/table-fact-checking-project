The columns include details such as the game number, date, team, score, individual statistics (high points, high rebounds, high assists), location and attendance, and record.\n\n2. Find the row that matches the team mentioned in the claim (\"cleveland\"). In this table, there is a row where the \"team\" column has the value \"cleveland\". This row corresponds to game number 71.\n\n3. Compare the identified game number with the one given in the claim. The game number found from the table matches the game number mentioned in the claim (\"71\").\n\n4.
