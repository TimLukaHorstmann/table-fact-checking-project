The names in these rows are 'xi', 'xian' and 'shen' respectively.\n   3. To confirm whether 'xi' or 'xian' was the name when the state was 'jin', we need to check which of these two names corresponds to the ruler of Jin at different times.\n   4. From the table, we can see that 'xi' is the ruler in Row 8 with a from date of 840 BC and 'xian' is the ruler in Row 9 with a from date of 822 BC. This means 'xi' was the ruler before 'xian'.\n   5.
