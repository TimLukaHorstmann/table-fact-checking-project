Check if this fighter is Wanderlei Silva.\n\nChain of thought:\n- We start by identifying all the wins by Wanderlei Silva against fighters who have also fought Chuck Liddell. In our table, we can see that Wanderlei Silva had a decision win against Vitor Belfort (row 18), and Chuck Liddell has a decision loss against Vitor Belfort (row 14).
