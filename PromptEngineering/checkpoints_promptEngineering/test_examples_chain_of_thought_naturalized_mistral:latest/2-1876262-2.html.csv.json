We will compare these values row by row to determine whether the claim is true or false.\n\n3. We start comparing the values from the earliest date (January 2012) to the latest one (December 2012), and if at any point we find a pair of rows where the Safari value is equal to 1.53% and the Firefox value is equal to or greater than 24.66%, then the claim will be considered true.\n\n4.

Identify the given claim: The claim states that in September 2011, Internet Explorer's percentage was 38.85% while Firefox's percentage was 24.98%.\n\n2. Find the relevant data from the table for September 2011: In the table, we find that Row 24 corresponds to September 2011. So, Internet Explorer's percentage is found in Column \"internet explorer\" which has a value of 38.85%. Firefox's percentage is found in Column \"firefox\" which also has a value of 24.98%.\n\n3.

Similarly, Firefox's percentage in September 2011 (from the table) also matches the claimed percentage (24.98%).\n\n4.

We need to find the row where IE's percentage is greater than or equal to 30.27%.\n3. By iterating through the rows from top to bottom, we can see that Row 4 (may 2013) has an Internet Explorer percentage of 23.67%, which is less than 30.27%. We continue iterating down the table and find that Row 19 (february 2012) has an Internet Explorer percentage of 32.70%, which is greater than or equal to 30.27%.\n4. From Row 19, we extract its corresponding \"date\" as \"february 2012\" and the \"Safari\" value as 3.16%.\n5.
