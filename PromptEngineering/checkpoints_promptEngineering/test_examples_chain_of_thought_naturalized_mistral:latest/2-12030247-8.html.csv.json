From the table provided, we see that Hillary Clinton has a cash on hand value of 45226832 (Row 1).\n3. To determine if this is the highest among all candidates, compare it with the other candidates' cash on hand values:\n   - Barack Obama has a cash on hand of 36263689 (Row 2), which is less than Hillary Clinton's.\n   - John Edwards has a cash on hand of 13242954 (Row 3), which is less than Hillary Clinton's.\n   - Bill Richardson has a cash on hand of 7129684 (Row 4), which is less than Hillary Clinton's.\n   - Christopher Dodd has a cash on hand of 6378271 (Row 5), which is less than Hillary Clinton's.\n   - Joe Biden has a cash on hand of 2772442 (Row 6), which is less than Hillary Clinton's.\n   - Dennis Kucinich has a cash on hand of 213269 (Row 7), which is significantly less than Hillary Clinton's.\n   - Mike Gravel has a cash on hand of 31141 (Row 8), which is even less than Dennis Kucinich and significantly less than Hillary Clinton's.\n\n4.
