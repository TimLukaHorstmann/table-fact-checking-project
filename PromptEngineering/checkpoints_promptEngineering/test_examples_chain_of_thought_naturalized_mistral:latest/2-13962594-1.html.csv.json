    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Identify the games played at Shea Stadium by examining the `game site` column. All relevant rows are those with `game site` as 'shea stadium'.\n2. Check the `result` column for each game at Shea Stadium to determine if there is a win (W) or loss (L). Since we are interested in the total points scored, only wins matter since the opponent's score doesn't affect our calculation.\n3. Examine the `opponent` and `attendance` columns as they will not be relevant for this problem.\n4. For each win at Shea Stadium, calculate the score based on the given format (the team's score first then the opponent's score separated by a space). Convert each result string from naturalized format to a numerical value.\n5. Check if any of the calculated scores are less than 30.\n\nBased on this reasoning, let's analyze the table:\n1. Rows with 'w' in the `result` column are relevant: rows 2, 5, 9, 12, and 11 (6 rows).\n2. Calculate scores for each win at Shea Stadium:\n   - Row 2: 34 - 10 = 24\n   - Row 5: 9 - 7 = 2\n   - Row 9: 33 - 13 = 20\n   - Row 11: 28 - 20 = 8\n   - Row 12: 20 - 17 = 3\n3.
