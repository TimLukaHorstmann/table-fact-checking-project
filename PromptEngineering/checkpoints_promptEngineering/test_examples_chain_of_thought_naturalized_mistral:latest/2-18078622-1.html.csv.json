To do this, I will scan the table until I find a row with \"artist: james vincent\" and \"album: waiting for the rain\".\n2. Next, I will look at the 'year' column in that row to determine when the album was released. In Row 22, I see \"james vincent\", \"album: waiting for the rain\", and \"year: 1978\". So, the release year is 1978.\n3. Now, I need to find the release year for The Beach Boys' album 'la (light album)'. To do this, I will scan the table until I find a row with \"artist: the beach boys\" and \"album: la (light album)\".\n4. Next, I will look at the 'year' column in the rows that match those conditions to determine when the album was released. In Row 1 and Row 2, I see two entries for this album but they have different years: 1979 and 1989. Since the claim is asking about 'la (light album)' in relation to 'the beach boys', I will focus on the first entry which is in Row 1 and has a year of 1979.\n5. To compare the release years, I subtract 1978 (the release year for James Vincent's album) from 1979 (the release year for The Beach Boys' album). The result is 1 year.\n6.
