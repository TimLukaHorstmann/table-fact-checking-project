This excludes rows 21 and 22 from our analysis.\n2. Find the first driver (Switzerland - Neel Jani) and record his time as T1. In this case, T1 = 18'20.910.\n3. Find the last driver (Indonesia - Satrio Hermanto) and record his time as T2. In this case, T2 = +44.820. Since times are given in a format of minutes and seconds, we need to convert them both to seconds for comparison. So, T1 = 18*60 + 20.910 = 1080.910 and T2 = 44.820.\n4. Subtract the first driver's time from the last driver's time to get the difference between their times: |T2 - T1| = 44.820 - 1080.910 = -1036.090\n5. Since we cannot have a negative time difference, we realize that there is an error in the provided table where driver Indonesia's time is recorded incorrectly as -44.820 instead of +44.820. To correct this: T2 = 1080.910 - 44.820 = 1036.090\n6. Calculate the difference between the corrected last driver's time and the first driver's time: |T2 - T1| = 1036.090 - 1080.910 = -44.820\n7. Now, calculate the difference in seconds: (44.820 * 60) * (-1) = -2691.2 seconds\n8.
