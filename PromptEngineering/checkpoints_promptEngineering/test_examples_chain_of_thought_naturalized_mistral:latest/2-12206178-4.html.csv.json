Next, we check if there is a sequence of three consecutive losses by the Blue Jays within this month. To do this, we compare each game's result with the next two games (excluding ties since there are no ties in the table).\n\n3. Looking through the data, we find that the Blue Jays lost on June 1 (Row 1), June 2 (Row 2), and June 3 (Row 3) which seems like a sequence of three consecutive losses. However, we should also consider if there are more losses after this sequence.\n\n4. After June 3 (Row 3), the Blue Jays won on June 4 (Row 4), lost on June 5 (Row 5), and won again on June 6 (Row 6).
