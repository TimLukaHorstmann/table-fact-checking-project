    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n   1. First, we need to determine if any episode's original airdate is June 8, 2008.\n   2. We will iterate through the table from row 1 to the last row (row 14 for Sunday episodes and row 15 for Monday episode) and check the \"original airdate\" column.\n   3. If we find an original airdate of June 8, 2008, then we will compare it with the other episodes' airdates to find the earliest episode number.\n\nThe relevant cells in this case would be the ones that contain the \"original airdate\".\n\nNow let's check each row:\n   - Row 1: original airdate is not June 8, 2008\n   - Row 2: original airdate is not June 8, 2008\n   - ... (continue checking until we find a match or exhaust all rows)\n   - Row 4: original airdate is June 8, 2008.\n\nThe claim states that episode 4 is the earliest episode number that originally aired on June 8, 2008. Since we found the relevant data in row 4, we don't need to compare with other episodes.
