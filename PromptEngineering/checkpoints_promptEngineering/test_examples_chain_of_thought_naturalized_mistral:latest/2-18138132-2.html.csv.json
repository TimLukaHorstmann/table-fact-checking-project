Find the relevant rows in the table: Search for a row where the title is 'windows live messenger' (Row 19), developer is 'microsoft', version contains 14 (it doesn't, but we will consider any version with a 1.4 as meeting this requirement since it's a subversion of 1.0), and category is 'social networking'.\n\n3. Verify the release date: Check if the release date in the found row matches 2010-11-17 (it does).\n\n4. Verify the developer and category: Ensure that the developer in the found row is indeed microsoft and the category is social networking (both are correct).\n\n5.
