Each row contains information about the date, opponent, score, pitcher who lost, and save if any (indicated by a special identifier).\n3. To determine whether the Baltimore Orioles played on May 11th, we need to look for a row where the 'opponent' is empty or not equal to 'Baltimore Orioles', and the 'date' is exactly 'May 11'.\n4. Row 17 has a date of 'May 21' and opponent as 'Baltimore Orioles', so it does not meet our criteria.\n5. Row 19 has a date of 'May 24' and opponent as 'Texas Rangers', so it does not meet our criteria.\n6. Row 20 has a date of 'May 25' and opponent as 'Texas Rangers', so it does not meet our criteria.\n7. Row 21 has a date of 'May 26' and opponent as 'Anaheim Angels', so it does not meet our criteria.\n8. Row 22 has a date of 'May 27' and opponent as 'Anaheim Angels', so it does not meet our criteria.\n9.
