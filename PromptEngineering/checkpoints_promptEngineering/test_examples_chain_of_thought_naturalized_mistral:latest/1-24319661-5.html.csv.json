The information for episode 10 is not explicitly stated in the table but we can infer it from the given data. Since each row represents an individual episode and the production codes are unique for each episode, the production code \"bcw410\" corresponds to episode 10.\n\n5.

We will count these rows to find out how many episodes he directed in each of seasons 1 through 6. If any row beyond those shows an episode directed by Paul Holahan, then the claim is false.\n\n4. Analyze the data: By counting the relevant rows, we can see that Paul Holahan directed 4 episodes (row 1, 3, 7, and 13) in seasons 1 through 6.
