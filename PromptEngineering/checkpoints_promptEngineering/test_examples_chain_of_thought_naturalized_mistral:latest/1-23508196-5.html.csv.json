Note that the number of aircraft in both units has a range, but it doesn't affect the comparison as long as we consider the smallest value for each unit (since the crew count would be greater with more aircraft). In this case, let's assume there are 108 aircraft in single-engine fighter group and 108 aircraft in twin-engine fighter group.\n5. Calculate the number of crews for both units based on the formula above: for single-engine fighter group = (994 - 183) / 108 = 6.43 (rounding up to account for integer values, this results in 7 crews considering that we're looking at the smallest number of aircraft, which is 108). Similarly, for twin-engine fighter group = (1081 - 183) / 108 = 6.45 (rounding up to account for integer values, this results in 7 crews considering that we're looking at the smallest number of aircraft, which is 108).\n6. Compare the calculated values: 7 == 7. The number of crews for both single-engine and twin-engine fighter groups are equal (7), so the claim is FALSE.
