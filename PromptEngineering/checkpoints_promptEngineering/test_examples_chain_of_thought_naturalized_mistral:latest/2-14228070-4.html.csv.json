Row 11 has both the outcome as Silver (column: `outcome`) and a score of 0 - 3 (columns: `score` and within that, `year` and `last opponent`) but Liverpool is not mentioned in any of the venue columns for this row. However, it seems there might be a mistake in the table as the year column in this row is also given as \"Amsterdam\" which does not match with the other details indicating Silver and 0-3 score.\n3. If we ignore the inconsistency in the table, then the outcome in row 11 meets both conditions (silver outcome after a score of 0 - 3). But since there's an inconsistency, we cannot be sure if this claim is actually true.\n4.
