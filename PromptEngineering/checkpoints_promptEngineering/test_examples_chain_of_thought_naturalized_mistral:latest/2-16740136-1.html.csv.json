Subtract the number of races won by Ben Spies from the total possible races to find out how many races he lost (difference = 14 - 5 = 9).\n7. Since there are only 19 races in a season, it means that if Ben Spies lost 9 races, he would have lost all but one race.\n8. The claim states that \"ben spies lose the season by only 1 race\". To check if this is true, compare the number of losses calculated (9) with the remaining possible losses (1 - 9 = 8).
