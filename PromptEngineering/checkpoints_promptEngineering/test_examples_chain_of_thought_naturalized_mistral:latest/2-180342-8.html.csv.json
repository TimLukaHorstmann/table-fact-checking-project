Convert all the heights from feet to a common unit (meters, since the table already contains some heights in meters). To do this, multiply the height given in feet by 0.3048 (since 1 meter equals 3.28084 feet approximately).\n3. Compare the heights of the structures that came after 1950 with those that came before 1950 to check if they are at least 200 feet taller.\n4. If all the three most recent tallest structures (from Row 7 to Row 10) are found to be at least 200 feet taller than everything that comes before 1950, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it is FALSE.\n\nNow let us perform these steps:\n1.

Convert all the heights from feet to meters: Battersea power station (06.0 * 0.3048 = 18.288), Crystal palace transmitting station (08.0 * 0.3048 = 24.384), One Canada Square (09.0 * 0.3048 = 27.532), Shard London Bridge (306 / 3.28084 = 93.476).\n3. Compare the heights of the structures that came after 1950 with those that came before 1950: Battersea power station > all previous structures, Crystal palace transmitting station > One Canada Square (24.384 > 27.532), Shard London Bridge > both previous structures (93.476 > 18.288 and 93.476 > 24.384).\n4.
