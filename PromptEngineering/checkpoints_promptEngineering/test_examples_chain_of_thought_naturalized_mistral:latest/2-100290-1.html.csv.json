    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the condition in the claim: The package (PDIP) should be less than 20 when EEPROM is less than 128 on at least one occasion.\n\n2. Iterate through each row in the table to compare the EEPROM and package values:\n   - Row 1: EEPROM = 64, Package = pdip-20 (True for both conditions)\n   - Row 2: EEPROM = 128, Package = pdip-20 (False for the condition that EEPROM < 128)\n   - Row 3: EEPROM = 128, Package = pdip-8 (False for both conditions since EEPROM >= 128)\n   - Row 4: EEPROM = 128, Package = pdip-8 (False for both conditions since EEPROM >= 128)\n   - Row 5: EEPROM = 256, Package = pdip-40 (False for the condition that EEPROM < 128)\n   - Row 6: EEPROM = 256, Package = pdip-40 (False for both conditions since EEPROM >= 128)\n   - Row 7: EEPROM = 512, Package = pdip-40 (False for the condition that EEPROM < 128)\n   - Row 8: EEPROM = 512, Package = pdip-40 (False for both conditions since EEPROM >= 128)\n\n3. The condition is true only if at least one row satisfies it, and in this case, no row does. However, the claim says \"on at least one occasion,\" which is technically incorrect because there are no occurrences where EEPROM < 128 and the package is pdip-20.\n\nThe final answer will be:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the condition in the claim\", \"Iterate through each row to compare the EEPROM and package values\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"EEPROM\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"package\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"EEPROM\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the chips in the table whose frequency is more than 12 MHz. This includes 'at90s1200', 'at90s2313', 'at90s / ls2323', 'at90s / ls2343', 'at90s4414', 'at90s / ls4434', 'at90s8515', and 'at90s / ls8535'.\n\n2. Compare the frequency values of these chips to determine which one has the smallest frequency that is more than 12 MHz.\n\n   - The frequency of 'at90s1200' (12 MHz) is not smaller than itself, so it cannot be the chip with the smallest frequency more than 12 MHz.\n\n   - The frequency of 'at90s2313' is 10 MHz, which is indeed smaller than any other frequencies in this list. However, we are looking for chips with a frequency greater than 12 MHz, and 'at90s2313' does not meet that condition since its frequency is less than 12 MHz.\n\n   - The remaining chips ('at90s / ls2323', 'at90s / ls2343', 'at90s4414', 'at90s / ls4434', 'at90s8515', and 'at90s / ls8535') all have a frequency of 8 MHz, which is greater than 12 MHz.\n\n3. Since no chip in the list meets the condition of having a frequency smaller than itself and greater than 12 MHz, there is no chip that fulfills the given claim.\n\nThe final answer can be represented as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"List the chips with frequencies more than 12 MHz.\",\n    \"Identify the smallest frequency among these chips.\",\n    \"Compare the smallest identified frequency with each chip's own frequency.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"frequency\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
