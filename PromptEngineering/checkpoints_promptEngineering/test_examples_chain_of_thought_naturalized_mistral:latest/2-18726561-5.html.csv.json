Identify the claim's requirement: The claim asks for information about a match happening on 18th February 1976, with Leicester City as the away team scoring 3 goals against Manchester United (who is the home team).\n2. Search the table for matches on 18th February 1976: We don't see any match listed for that date in our table.\n3. Assess the possibility of a missing entry or replay match not being listed: Since the table doesn't provide comprehensive information about all the games happening on that day, it's possible that a replay match (if one took place) wasn't included in the table.\n4. Check if any team matches the given away team and a potential home team for a replay: In our table, we don't see Leicester City as an away team against Manchester United on any date, including 18th February 1976. However, we do have a replay match between these two teams (Row 1 and Row 3).\n5. Evaluate the score of such potential match: The scores for the Leicester City vs. Manchester United matches shown in our table are not 3 - 0 in favor of Leicester City. But since we're considering a possible replay, we should check if any subsequent replays have that result.\n6. Look for any replays with Leicester City as the away team and a score of 3 - 0: Unfortunately, there are no additional matches or replays listed in our table to further evaluate the claim.\n\nGiven these steps, we cannot definitively say whether the claim is true or false since the information required isn't provided in the table presented.
