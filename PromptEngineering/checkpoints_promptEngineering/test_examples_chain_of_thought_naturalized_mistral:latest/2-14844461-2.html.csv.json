Iterate through the table and apply the filter:\n   - Extract the weight and height from each row in the table.\n   - Compare the current player's weight and height against the conditions set in step 2.\n   - If the player meets the condition, add their row index to the relevant_cells list.\n\n5. Check if any players remain after applying the filter:\n   - If there are no remaining players (i.e., the relevant_cells list is empty), then the claim is true.\n   - If there are remaining players (i.e., the relevant_cells list is not empty), then the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the condition in the claim\",\n    \"Create a filter to identify players based on their weight and height\",\n    \"Check if any of the remaining rows after applying the filter are empty\",\n    \"Iterate through the table and apply the filter\",\n    \"Check if any players remain after applying the filter\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
