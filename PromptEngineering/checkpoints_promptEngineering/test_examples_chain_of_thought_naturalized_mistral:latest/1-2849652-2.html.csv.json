In our table, we find two rows with winter gymnastics as the sport (row 5).\n2. Check for the number of divisions in the state tournament for each identified row. In this case, both rows 4 and 5 have the same value for \"of divisions\", which is 1.\n3. The claim states that winter gymnastics have 1 division in the 2011 - 2012 state tournament.
