In this table, there seems to be no such column directly providing the year of establishment for each league/team. However, we know the year when the Negro American League (NAL) was established from Row 6 and 3.\n\n2. From Row 6, we see that the St Louis Stars, a team part of NAL, was established in 1922. But since the table suggests that they played as part of NAL starting from 1931, it implies that NAL might have been formed between 1922 and 1931.\n\n3. From Row 3, we find another team (St Louis Stars) in St Louis playing for the Negro American League, but it only lasted from 1939 to 1931, which contradicts our findings in step 2 that NAL might have been formed between 1922 and 1931.\n\n4. Upon closer inspection, we realize that there seems to be a mix-up in the data as two teams with the same name \"St Louis Stars\" are present in the table. One of them represents the Negro American League (Row 6) and the other does not (Row 3). This confusion has led to our misinterpretation in step 2 and 3.\n\n5.
