    "resp": "1. Identify the scores from week 15 and week 16: The score from Week 15 can be found in Row 15 (date: December 11, 1988) with a result of \"w 22 - 7\". The score from Week 16 can be found in Row 16 (date: December 18, 1988) with a result of \"w 38 - 16\".\n\n2. Compare the scores: To determine if one score is lower than another, we need to find a way to combine them into a single number for comparison purposes. In this case, we can add up the numbers after the \"-\" (for losses) and before the \"-\" (for wins), giving us 22 for Week 15 and 38 + 16 = 54 for Week 16.\n\n3. Make a decision: Since 22 (Week 15) is lower than 54 (Week 16), the total score in week 16 is higher than the total score in week 15.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify scores from Week 15 and Week 16\",\n    \"Combine scores into a single number for comparison purposes\",\n    \"Compare the combined numbers to determine if one is lower than the other\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
