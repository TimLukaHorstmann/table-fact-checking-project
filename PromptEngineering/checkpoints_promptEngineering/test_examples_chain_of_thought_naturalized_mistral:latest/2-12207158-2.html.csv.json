The pattern is as follows: there are 25 rows representing 25 games, each row has a date, opponent, score (home team score - away team score), pitcher with wins and losses, attendance, and record (wins - losses).\n  2. Next, look for the game where the \"record\" is 4-5. To do this, scan through the table and find the row where the \"record\" value is 4-5. The relevant cell in this case would be: { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  3. Once you've found the game where the record is 4-5, identify its opponent. Examine the \"opponent\" column in row 15 to determine the opponent. In this case, the opponent for the game with a record of 4-5 is the Yankees.\n  4. Finally, compare the opponent from step 3 with the given claim. The claim states that the opponent should be the Yankees when the record is 4-5. Since we have confirmed that the opponent in row 15 (where the record is 4-5) is indeed the Yankees, the answer to the claim is TRUE.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify table structure, Find the game where the record is 4 - 5, Identify its opponent, Compare the opponent with the given claim\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [ { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\" } ]\n}",
