There are 28 rows with opponent column equal to 'Rangers' (Texas team).\n\n2. Check for the highest score made by a single team among these games. In order to do this, we will compare the \"score\" values in each game where the Rangers were the home team. Since the Rangers are always listed as the second team in the \"opponent\" column, we know that when they are the home team, the opponent is listed first and the score for them will be the second number (separated by a space or a hyphen).\n\n3.
