    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Compare the total scores for each country mentioned in the claim (France, Spain, and Canada). To do this, we first need to find their respective total scores in the table.\n2. Look up France's total score by finding its row (in this case, row 11) and column \"total\" (column 3). The value is 90.333.\n3. Look up Spain's total score by finding its row (row 2) and column \"total\". The value is 98.334.\n4. Look up Canada's total score by finding its row (not mentioned in the table, so we will need to check each row's \"total\" until we find it). We know it's higher than France and Spain, so we start checking from the first country listed in the table (Russia) and move down. The total score for Russia is 99.251, which is greater than Spain but not Canada. Next, we check Spain's neighbors, Japan (total: 97.167) and China (total: 96.334), both of which are lower than Spain but also lower than France. Continuing down the table, we find that the US (total: 95.5), Canada (not found yet), and other countries all have total scores less than or equal to Spain's total score.\n5. At this point, we know that France's total score is greater than or equal to Spain's total score, and neither is lower than the highest score we've encountered for Canada. This means that both France and Spain score higher than Canada, which contradicts the claim.\n\n   Final answer:\n\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare France, Spain, and Canada's total scores by looking up their respective values in the table\", \"Find France and Spain's total scores (90.333 and 98.334)\", \"Check each country's total score until we find Canada, starting from Russia\", \"Continue down the list until finding all countries with lower or equal total scores\"],\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"total\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}]\n   }",
