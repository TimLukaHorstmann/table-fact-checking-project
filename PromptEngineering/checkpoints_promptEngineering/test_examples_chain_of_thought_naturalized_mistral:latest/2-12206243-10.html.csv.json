Next, we verify whether the score mentioned in the claim (3 - 0) is consistent with the score given for that game (3 - 0).

Next, we need to find out who the opponent was for this game. This information can be found in the \"opponent\" column. From Row 25, we see that the opponent was the Red Sox, not the Orioles. However, since the question asks about the September 25 game and it's specified that the opponent should be the Orioles, this particular match does not meet the conditions given in the claim.\n\n3. Now, let's move on to see if there is another game played on September 25th in the table. If we continue searching from Row 26 towards earlier rows, we don't find any matches for September 25th before Row 26.

Determine the record after the found win: Once we find a row matching the criteria, take the value in the 'record' column from that row as the final record.\n\nBy applying these steps to the table provided:\n1. First row doesn't match the criteria (opponent is Mets and score is a loss).\n2. Second to fourth rows don't match the criteria (all losses against the Mets).\n3. The fifth row has 'rangers' in the opponent column, so it's not the win against Red Sox we are looking for.\n4. Sixth to seventh rows have 'rangers' in the opponent column and a positive score, but they are all losses.\n5. Eighth row has 'angels' in the opponent column, so it's not the win against Red Sox we are looking for.\n6. Ninth to eleventh rows have 'angels' in the opponent column and a negative score, so they don't match the criteria.\n7. Twelfth row has 'yankees' in the opponent column and a loss, so it doesn't match the criteria.\n8. Thirteenth to twenty-first rows have 'yankees' in the opponent column and various scores (wins and losses), but they don't match the win against Red Sox we are looking for since the score is not greater than the opponent's score in these cases.\n9. Twenty-second row has 'oriorles' in the opponent column, so it doesn't match the criteria.\n10. Twenty-third row has 'oriorles' in the opponent column and a win, but it's not against Red Sox, so it's not relevant to our search.\n11. Twenty-fourth row has 'oriorles' in the opponent column and a loss, so it doesn't match the criteria.\n12. Twenty-fifth row has 'oriorles' in the opponent column, so it's not the win against Red Sox we are looking for.\n13.

Determine if they lost the game on September 28.\n   - In row 26, we can see that they played against the Red Sox and the score is 3 - 0 in favor of the Red Sox.
