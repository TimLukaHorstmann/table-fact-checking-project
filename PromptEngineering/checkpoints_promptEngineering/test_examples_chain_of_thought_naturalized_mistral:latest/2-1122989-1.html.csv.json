    "resp": "1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Alex Caffi and Philippe Streiff both have 0 laps because of an electrical issue (in the case of Caffi) and an accident (in the case of Streiff).\n\n2. Find relevant rows in the table: We need to find the rows where the driver's name matches either Alex Caffi or Philippe Streiff. For this, we can scan through the table and compare the driver names with \"Alex Caffi\" and \"Philippe Streiff\".\n\n3. Analyze the data in each relevant row: For each driver, examine the \"laps\", \"time / retired\", and \"grid\" columns to check if they match the information provided by the claim. If a driver's laps are 0 and there is an indication of either electrical issue or accident in the \"time / retired\" column, then it would support the claim for that specific driver.\n\n4. Compare findings: Once we have analyzed both drivers' rows individually, we can compare our findings to determine if they both meet the conditions mentioned in the claim.\n\n5. Final answer: Based on the comparison of both drivers' information, output a JSON object with the final answer and reasoning steps.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find relevant rows in the table for each driver mentioned\",\n    \"Analyze the data in each row to check if it matches the conditions of the claim (laps = 0 and an indication of either electrical issue or accident)\",\n    \"Compare findings between the two drivers\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"laps\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\" }\n  ]\n}",
