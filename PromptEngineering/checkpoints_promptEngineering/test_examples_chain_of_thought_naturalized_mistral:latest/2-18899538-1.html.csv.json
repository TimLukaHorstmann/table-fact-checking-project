In the cell where the OS column intersects with the row of \"coherence\", it is indicated as \"partial\".\n4. A software is said to have a specific operating system if that operating system is marked as either 'yes' or 'full' (which can be inferred from 'yes') in the table. Since 'partial' means the software has limited compatibility, it does not necessarily mean the software lacks the specified OS but only means it may not run smoothly on all versions of that OS.\n5.
