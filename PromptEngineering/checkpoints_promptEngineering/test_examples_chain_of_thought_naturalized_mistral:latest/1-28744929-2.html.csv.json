In this table, there is only one row 7 that fits this condition.\n   3. Check if the head coach of Miami in the table is known. In this case, the head coach of Miami is Randy Shannon and not Butch Davis, as per the table. Therefore, the current record (11 - 13 with 4 years at school) does not belong to Butch Davis.\n   4. To find the record that belongs to Butch Davis, we need to search for rows where both \"team\" and \"head coach\" match North Carolina, which is the team Butch Davis coached according to the table. In this case, there is only one row 8 that fits this condition.\n   5. Check if the record at school (20 - 18) with 4 years at school matches the one in the claim. It does not match, as the claim states a record of 3 years at school, but according to the table, Butch Davis spent 4 years at North Carolina.\n   6. To find the record that Butch Davis had for 3 years at a school, we need to filter out the rows where the number of years at school is less than or equal to 3 (except for the ones already identified as Miami and North Carolina, as those are not in question).
