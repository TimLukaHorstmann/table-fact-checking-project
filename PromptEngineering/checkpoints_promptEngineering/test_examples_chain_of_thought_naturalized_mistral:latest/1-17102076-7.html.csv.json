The relevant cell with the score for game 35 is in the column labeled as 'score'.\n4. Inspect the value of the 'score' column for game 35: The value provided is l 90 - 98 (ot). This format represents a loss by our team, where the first number is the points scored by the opposing team, and the second number is the points scored by our team.\n5. Compare the observed value with the claim's expected value: The claim states that the score of game 35 should be l90 - 98 (ot). However, the actual score in the table for game 35 is l90 - 98 (ot) as well.\n\nBased on the comparison between the observed and expected values, here is the final output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify game number\", \"Find row with matching game number\", \"Check 'score' column value for target game\", \"Compare observed score with claim's expected score\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n}",
