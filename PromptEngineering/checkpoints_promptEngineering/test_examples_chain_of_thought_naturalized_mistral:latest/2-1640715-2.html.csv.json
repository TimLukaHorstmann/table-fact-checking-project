However, since we don't have information about the driver's name, it is not possible to find specific data related to Mike in this table.\n\n2. Alternatively, since the question asks about the improvement in average start time for the same driver between two specific years (2000 and 2001), we can look for any rows where the year column matches both 2000 and 2001. This will give us the data for the same driver in those two years, from which we can compare their average start times.\n\n3. Find the \"avg start\" value for Row 5 (since it is the row where the year column contains 2000) and note down this value as A_start_2000.\n\n4. Find the \"avg start\" value for Row 6 (since it is the row where the year column contains 2001) and note down this value as A_start_2001.\n\n5.

However, if we assume that the rows contain data for the same driver in different years as per their order, then I can help determine whether there was an improvement of 10.7 seconds between 2000 and 2001 for the driver.\n\nIn this case, since the question asks about a specific driver (Mike), but we don't have the data related to him, my final answer has to be based on assumptions. Since the table provides data for different years in order, if the assumption holds that each row contains data for the same driver in a different year, then we can compare data across rows to find out if there was an improvement in average start time between 2000 and 2001.\n\nIn this example, the table does not provide enough information about specific drivers to make a definitive conclusion, so my answer is based on assumptions about the ordering of data for different years belonging to the same driver.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Find rows related to 'Mike' (but no specific info provided about driver names), then find and compare average start times for rows where year column contains 2000 and 2001\"],\n  \"answer\": \"UNDETERMINED\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg start\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"avg start\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
