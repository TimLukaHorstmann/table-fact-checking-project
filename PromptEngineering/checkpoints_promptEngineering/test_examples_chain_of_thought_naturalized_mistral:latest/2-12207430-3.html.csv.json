Find the row where the Toronto Blue Jays won against the Kansas City Royals, as per the given date mentioned in the claim (May 12th).\n3. Look for another row following the win row, as the record at the end of the game would be different from the one before it. This will provide the updated record after the win.\n4. Compare the records of the two relevant rows to see if there is a change in the number of wins (since losses don't matter for this comparison).\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to find the dates on which the Kansas City Royals played against the Toronto Blue Jays. The team named as opponent alternates between Rangers, Royals, Athletics, Angels, and Mariners. Since the table starts with the Royals, it is important to check for every game where the opponent is not the Rangers (since they are mentioned more frequently).\n\n2. Next, we need to find the games where the Kansas City Royals won and their record was 18 - 12 after May 12th. This will help us narrow down the list of games.\n\n3. We can start from the first occurrence of the Royals after the Rangers (row 5) and check every game until we find a win where the record matches 18 - 12 or higher, that occurred after May 12th.\n\n4.
