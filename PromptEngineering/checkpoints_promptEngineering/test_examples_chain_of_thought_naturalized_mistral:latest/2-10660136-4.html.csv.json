    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Count the number of drivers who have a points value equal to 0 in the 'points' column.\n2. Compare the count from step 1 with the total number of drivers in the table. If they are equal, the claim is true; if not, the claim is false.\n\nNow let's count the number of drivers who have a points value equal to 0:\n- Row 13: jason bargwanna, points: 4\n- Row 16: will davison, points: 0\n- Row 17: simon wills, points: 0\n- Row 18: jack perkins, points: 0\n- Row 19: john bowe, points: 0\n- Row 20: shane price, points: 0\n- Row 21: paul morris, points: 0\n- Row 22: greg murphy, points: 0\n- Row 23: shane van gisbergen, points: 0\n- Row 24: mark winterbottom, points: 0\n- Row 25: cameron mcconville, points: 0\n- Row 26: fabian coulthard, points: 0\n- Row 27: mark skaife, points: 0\n- Row 28: alan gurr, points: 0\n- Row 29: dean canto, points: 0\n- Row 30: jason bright, points: 0\n- Row 31: james courtney, points: 0\n\nThere are 18 drivers who have a points value equal to 0.\n\nThe total number of drivers in the table is 31 (since rows 1 to 31 contain data).\n\nComparing both counts, we see that there are indeed 20 drivers that do not score any point during the race.\n\nHere's the final output in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of drivers who have a points value equal to 0.\",\n    \"Compare the count from step 1 with the total number of drivers.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
