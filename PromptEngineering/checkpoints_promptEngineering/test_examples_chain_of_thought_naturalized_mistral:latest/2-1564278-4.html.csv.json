Find the rows that correspond to the French Open, these are rows 3, 4, and 5 as they have \"tournament: french open\" in their first column.\n3. Check the years specified for each row (columns after the first one) to see if any of them match 2006 or 2007.\n4. In the year 2006, the French Open's result is q2 (as found in row 3).\n5. In the year 2007, the French Open's result is also q2 (as found in row 4).\n6. Since both 2006 and 2007 have q2 as their corresponding results for the French Open, the claim is true.\n\nThe final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the tournament to check\", \"Find rows that correspond to the identified tournament\", \"Check years within those rows for matching years\", \"If a year matches, check its corresponding result\", \"Repeat this process for all years in question\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\" }\n  ]\n}",
