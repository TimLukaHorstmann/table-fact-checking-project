Check if there is a stadium that meets all these conditions in the provided table.\n   3. Compare each row of the table against the conditions specified in the claim:\n       - Row 1: The stadium (national stadium) is in Cardiff, Wales and was closed in 1997. However, the capacity at the time of closure is 53000, which exceeds the largest capacity for any former rugby union stadium found so far. Therefore, this row needs to be checked again as a potential match for the claim.\n       - Row 4: The stadium (athletic park) is in Wellington, New Zealand and was closed in 1999, which does not meet the conditions of being closed in 1997 or having a capacity of 53000.\n       - Row 5: The stadium (carisbrook) is in Dunedin, New Zealand and was closed in 2011, which does not meet the condition of being closed in 1997.\n       - Rows 6-8, 10, and 11: These stadiums were closed after 1997 and have a capacity less than 53000.\n       - Row 12: This stadium (firhill) was closed in the same year as the national stadium, but its capacity is not mentioned, so we cannot confirm if it has a capacity of 53000 or not.\n   4.

    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the claim we are verifying: \"athletic park, in wellington, be new zealand's second largest stadium, with a total capacity of 39000\"\n2. Compare the given information in the table to the claim:\n   - Find all stadiums in New Zealand by checking the 'country' column (row 4 and row 5)\n   - Find their capacities and cities (row 4: 39000, city: wellington; row 5: 29000, city: dunedin)\n   - Sort the capacities of New Zealand stadiums from highest to lowest (athletic park > carisbrook)\n   - Find the capacity of the largest stadium in New Zealand by checking the sorted list (carisbrook, with 29000 capacity)\n   - Since athletic park has a larger capacity than carisbrook, it is currently the largest stadium in New Zealand\n   - Compare the capacity of athletic park (39000) with the second-largest capacity listed in the table or any other information. There are no other stadiums in the table to compare against. Thus, the capacity of athletic park matches the claim.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Identify the claim. 2. Find all stadiums in New Zealand by checking the 'country' column and find their capacities and cities. 3. Sort the capacities of New Zealand stadiums from highest to lowest. 4.

Since athletic park has a larger capacity, it is currently the largest stadium. 7. Compare the capacity of athletic park (39000) with the second-largest capacity listed in the table or any other information. There are no other stadiums to compare against.
