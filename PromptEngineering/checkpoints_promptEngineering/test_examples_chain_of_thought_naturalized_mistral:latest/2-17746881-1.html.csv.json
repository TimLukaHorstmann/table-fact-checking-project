Next, check where these teams appear in the table, and locate their respective scores for the 1st round.\n3. For team 1 fc nantes (d1), they did not have a score listed for the 1st round since it was a 2-round match, and the second round score is irrelevant for this comparison.\n4. For team 1 ogc nice (d1), in row 3 of the table, we see that their 1st round score was 1 - 5.\n5. Compare the scores: The score for team 1 fc nantes (d1) is unknown, and the score for team 1 ogc nice (d1) is 1 - 5. Since the score of team 1 fc nantes (d1) is unknown but it cannot be greater than a known, finite score, we can conclude that it is less or equal to the score of team 1 ogc nice (d1).\n6. Finally, since the score of team 1 fc nantes (d1) in the 1st round is not explicitly stated as less than team 1 ogc nice (d1), but we have concluded that it could be equal or less based on the information available, we can say that the claim has some degree of validity.

Find their respective scores from the table by looking at their rows:\n   - Row 4: lille osc (d1) played against team 2 fc mulhouse (d2), with a score of 2 - 3 in their second round, as they are team 2 in this matchup.\n   - No row has team 2 us orl\u00e9ans (d2) in it since the table is organized by the team that is playing at home first. However, we can use the information from the matches they played as team 1 to calculate their score. In Row 7, Paris SG (d1) played against team 1 us orl\u00e9ans (d2), and the score was 3 - 7 in the second round. Since the scores are cumulative and a home team's score is added to its opponent's score, we can find the score for team 2 us orl\u00e9ans (d2) by subtracting their score from the total: 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n3. Compare the overall points of the two teams by looking at their scores: team 2 fc mulhouse (d2) has a score of 3 (from their second round), while team 2 us orl\u00e9ans (d2) has a score of 4.\n\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the teams involved in the claim, i.e., AJ Auxerre (d1) and SM Caen (d1).\n2. Find the rows that correspond to these teams in the table, as they are labeled by their team name (column \"team 1\" or \"team 2\").\n   - For AJ Auxerre: Row 3, Team 1.\n   - For SM Caen: Not directly present in the table because it's team 2 in row 6 (AS Beauvais) but this row is not relevant to our claim as it doesn't provide information about SM Caen.\n3. Extract the scores and rounds from these rows for both teams, since points are calculated based on the score at the end of each round.\n   - AJ Auxerre: 1st round: 1-2, 2nd round: 0-3. Score difference = 1 (win) - 5 (loss) = -4 in the first round + (-3 in the second round) = -7.\n   - Relevant cells for AJ Auxerre: {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"} for both rounds.\n4. Now, we need to find SM Caen's scores in order to compare with AJ Auxerre's scores. Since SM Caen is not directly represented in the table, we will look at AS Beauvais (team 2 in row 6) which played against SM Caen:\n   - 1st round: 1-0. Score difference = 1 (win).\n   - 2nd round: 3-1. Score difference = 2 (win).\n5. Calculate the points for both teams based on their scores in each round:\n   - AJ Auxerre: -7 (negative score means losses) in total.\n   - SM Caen: 1 point (win) in the first round + (-1 in the second round, loss) = 0 points in total.\n6. Compare the total points for both teams:\n   - AJ Auxerre: -7 points.\n   - SM Caen: 0 points.\n7. The claim states that AJ Auxerre have 4 more points than SM Caen overall.

Next, we need to find the number of points scored by both AJ Auxerre (d1) and SM Caen (d1) from the provided table data.\n\n3. To find the number of points for AJ Auxerre, we look at the matches where they are Team 2 (since their points are dependent on their results). In Row 3, AJ Auxerre lost to OGC Nice by 5-1 in D1, and this is a loss so no points are gained. However, the table doesn't show further games for AJ Auxerre. As we don't have enough data, we cannot definitively determine their total points.\n\n4. Similarly, to find the number of points for SM Caen, we look at the matches where they are Team 2 (since their points are dependent on their results). In Row 6, SM Caen lost to AS Beauvais by 4-1 in D2 (as it's mentioned as D2, this match doesn't contribute to SM Caen's total points in D1) and again in Row 7, they lost to Paris Saint Germain by 3-7 in D1. As a result, SM Caen has 0 points in D1.\n\n5. Since we cannot determine the number of points for AJ Auxerre due to the lack of complete data, we cannot compare them with SM Caen's total points and verify the claim correctly.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the claim at this point since the table lacks complete information about AJ Auxerre.\n\nHere's the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify points allocation in the table\",\n    \"Find points scored by AJ Auxerre and SM Caen\",\n    \"Analyze matches involving AJ Auxerre and SM Caen to determine their points\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
