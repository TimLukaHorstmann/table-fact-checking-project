This includes Steve Stricker (Row 1), Jim Furyk (Row 5), Phil Mickelson (Row 9), and Arron Oberholser (Row 10).\n\n2. For each player, find their respective scores by looking for rows with the same country as each player. In this table, score is calculated as 'score: X + Y = Z' where X and Y are individual round scores and Z is the total score. For example, Steve Stricker's total score (Z) is 70 (X, first-round score) + 69 (Y, second-round score).\n\n3. Compare the total scores of each player from the United States to find the lowest score, which represents the best score. To do this, compare the Z values for Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, and Arron Oberholser. The lowest score is 139 (Steve Stricker).\n\n4. Since the claim is \"Steve Stricker has the best score out of all players from the United States\", we need to verify that Steve Stricker's score is lower than or equal to the scores of Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, and Arron Oberholser.
