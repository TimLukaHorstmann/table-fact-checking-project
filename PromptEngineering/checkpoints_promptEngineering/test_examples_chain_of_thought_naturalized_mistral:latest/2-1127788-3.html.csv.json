First, understand the claim: The claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score a goal in international competition in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\n2. Next, identify the relevant data from the table: We need to find rows where both the 'date' is in the years mentioned (2001, 2009, 2012) and 'competition' column contains an international competition.\n\n3. Check each row that meets the criteria:\n   - Row 1 (5 February 1999): Since the date is not in the relevant years, we can skip this row.\n   - Row 2 (13 February 2000): The date is within the relevant years, but the competition is not an international one (Concacaf Gold Cup is a regional competition). So, we can skip this row as well.\n   - ... and so on for each subsequent row, checking if the date falls within the specified years and whether the competition is an international one.\n\n4. The last step is to determine whether there's any match found: After checking all rows, if no matches are found, then it confirms that Rafael M\u00e1rquez did not score a goal in international competition during 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\n5.
