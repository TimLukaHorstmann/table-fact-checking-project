Compare their respective sales values by referring to the \"sales (billion)\" column in the table. In this case, General Electric's sales value is 152.36 billion, while Citigroup's sales value is 108.28 billion.\n3. Compare their respective profits values by referring to the \"profits (billion)\" column in the table. In this case, Citigroup's profits value is 17.05 billion, while General Electric's profits value is 16.59 billion.\n4. Determine whether Citigroup has less sale than General Electric: Yes, since 108.28 billion < 152.36 billion.\n5. Determine whether Citigroup has higher profit: No, since 17.05 billion > 16.59 billion is not true.\n6.
