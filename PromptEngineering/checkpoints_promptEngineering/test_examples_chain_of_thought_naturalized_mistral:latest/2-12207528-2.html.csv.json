Note that there are no exact matches as the table lists the opponents as Mariners, Angels, Rangers, Athletics, and Orioles. However, we know that the Royals were playing against the Blue Jays based on the score and loss information (since the Blue Jays had a loss by pitcher Gubicza).\n3. Since the Toronto Blue Jays played against the Royals once, we need to check if they have faced them more than 3 times as per the claim. To do this, we will look at the number of rows where the opponent is either the Royals or the Blue Jays (since they are playing each other).\n4. Since there is only one row with the opponent as the Royals and no rows with the opponent as the Blue Jays, we can assume that the Blue Jays played against them once (which was confirmed in step 3) and did not play them more than three times.\n5.
