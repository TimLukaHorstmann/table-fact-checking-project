    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson are the writers for production code 3t7458.\n2. Find the relevant rows in the table based on the production code mentioned in the claim (3t7458). In this case, the row number is not present in the given data but the title and other details suggest that Row 19 (\"abysse\") could be the one with the required production code.\n3. If we can find a match between the name of the writers (Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson) in this row, then it would confirm the claim. However, since the table does not provide column names for the individual writers, we cannot definitively say whether Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson are the writers for production code 3t7458 or not.\n4. Final answer: Due to the lack of specific data about individual writer names in the given table, it is not possible to determine with certainty if the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows based on production code mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"If we can find a match between the name of the writers (Don Whitehead & Holly Henderson) in this row, then it would confirm the claim.\",\n    \"Since the table does not provide column names for individual writer names, we cannot definitively say if the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"title\" }\n  ]\n}",
