Check if there are any overlaps between the found rows based on location and pilot: If there are multiple rows with the same location and pilot, it implies that more than one record might have been set at Coniston Water by Malcolm Campbell. However, since we're looking for a single record, we can only consider the row with the earliest date as the potential candidate for the record-setting attempt.\n4. Evaluate if the speed is provided in the table: In order to confirm whether a record was set or not, we need to check if there is a value for the \"speed\" column in the matching row.\n5. Compare the found row's speed with the current known record for water-based boats (record is around 763 mph / 1227 km/h): If the found row's speed is greater than the current known record, then it can be concluded that Malcolm Campbell set a new record at Coniston Water.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find rows where location = 'coniston water'\",\n    \"Find rows where pilot's name = 'Malcolm Campbell'\",\n    \"Check if there are overlaps between the found rows based on location and pilot\",\n    \"Evaluate if the speed is provided in the table for the matching row\",\n    \"Compare the found row's speed with the current known record for water-based boats\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"speed\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"speed\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
