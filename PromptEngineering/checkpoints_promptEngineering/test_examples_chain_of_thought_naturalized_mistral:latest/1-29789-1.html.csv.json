Compare the claim with the table data: The value in the relevant cell (row_index=9, column_name=\"international tourist arrivals (2012)\") is 25.7 million, which matches the given claim.\n\n4.

There are no such countries in the provided table.\n2. Check if any of the given countries have their UNWTO region as \"asia\". Since there are no countries with this UNWTO region, it means that none of the countries in the table match the claim's requirements.\n3.
