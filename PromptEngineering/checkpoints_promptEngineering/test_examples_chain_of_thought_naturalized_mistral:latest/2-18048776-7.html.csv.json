For each player, find their scores from the table by looking up their row indices. The score for a player can be found in the 'score' column.\n   - For Frank Lickliter: `276` (Row 4)\n   - For Mark O'Meara: `276` (Row 5)\n3. Confirm that both players have the same score, which is a requirement for a tie. In this case, they do have the same score of `276`.\n4. Determine the par scores for each player by looking up their 'to par' column. It should be noted that the table provides the par as a difference from the actual score, so we need to calculate the opposite (actual score - par) to determine the score relative to par.\n   - For Frank Lickliter: `276` (Row 4) - `4` (Row 1, 'to par' for Vijay Singh) = `-2` (under par by 2)\n   - For Mark O'Meara: `276` (Row 5) - `4` (Row 3, 'to par' for Steve Elkington) = `-2` (under par by 2)\n5. Confirm that both players are under par at the same level. In this case, they both are 2 under par.\n6. Finally, verify the placement of each player by looking up their 'place' column.

Next, check if the score given for the player is two strokes ahead of any other competitor. In our table, Steve Elkington (Row 3) comes closest with a score of 274, which is 3 strokes behind Vijay Singh's score. Therefore, Vijay Singh has a lead of more than 2 strokes over his nearest competitor.\n\n3. Now, check if the score given for the player indicates that they finished under par. In this table, each player's total score is provided, and we can see that the number of strokes over or under par is indicated in the \"to par\" column. Vijay Singh's score of 271 corresponds to a score 9 under par (since 271 - 280 = 9).\n\n4.

In this tournament, it appears the par is 72 (implied by Tiger Woods' to par: 1 in cell [row_index=12, column_name=to par]). We subtract the score from the par for each player and find that both Lickliter and O'Meara are 4 under par (since 276 - 72 = 198 and 72 is the number of strokes taken).\n5. The claim states that they tie for fifth place, so we also need to verify their placing from the table. We can see that in rows 3, 4, and 5, Lickliter, O'Meara, and Elkington are all tied for fourth place (place: t4).
