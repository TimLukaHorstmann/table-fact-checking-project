Find out if any other teams have played in Boston Garden (according to the table) by checking every opponent's name except for the Chicago Bulls.\n3. If there are no other teams that have played in Boston Garden, it means that the only team who could have won a game there is the home team \u2013 in this case, the Boston Celtics.\n4. Check if the Chicago Bulls have a win against the Boston Celtics by looking for a row with opponent = \"Chicago Bulls\" and a score where the Celtics' score is lower than the Bulls' score.\n5.
