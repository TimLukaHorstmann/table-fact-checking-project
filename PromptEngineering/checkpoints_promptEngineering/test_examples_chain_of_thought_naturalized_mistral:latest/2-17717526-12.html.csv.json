To determine if 2010 and 2011 were the years where Polona had the most Grand Slam match wins, we need to find out how many Grand Slam match wins she had in each year and compare them.\n2. In the provided data, there is no specific column for 'Grand Slam match wins'. However, we can calculate this by summing up her match wins at Grand Slam tournaments (Wimbledon, US Open, Australian Open, French Open) in each year.\n3. I will assume that a player's Grand Slam match win is only counted if she reaches the main draw and plays at least one match there.\n4. Let's calculate Polona's Grand Slam match wins for 2010 and 2011:\n   - In 2010, Polona played in all four Grand Slams (R32-QF at Australian Open, R64 at French Open, R64 at Wimbledon, SF at US Open). Therefore, her total Grand Slam match wins in 2010 would be 9 (7 from Australian Open + 1 from French Open + 1 from Wimbledon)\n   - In 2011, Polona played in all four Grand Slams (R64 at Australian Open, R32-SF at French Open, R32 at Wimbledon, QF at US Open). Therefore, her total Grand Slam match wins in 2011 would be 9 (5 from French Open + 2 from US Open)\n   - Both years have the same number of Grand Slam match wins (9).\n5. To determine if there were more Grand Slam match wins in other years, we can look for rows where Polona reached the main draw at all four Grand Slams and compare their total match wins with 2010 and 2011.\n6. In the provided data, it is not clear whether Polona reached the main draw of all four Grand Slams in any other year, as we don't have specific details about each tournament she played. However, from her overall win-loss records, we can observe that she had at least 4 Grand Slam match wins in 2010 and 2011, which is the maximum number of Grand Slam match wins she had in any year according to the data provided.\n7. Since we cannot confirm or deny if Polona had more Grand Slam match wins in other years, our final answer will be based on the information provided.\n\nanswer: TRUE\nrelevant_cells: [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"tour level win - loss\"}, {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"tour level win - loss\"}]",
