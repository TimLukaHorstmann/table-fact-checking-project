This satisfies our first condition - a game with a 0-0 score during regular time.\n\n3. Check if there's another row for the same home or away team where the goal column is no longer 0-0: Since the claim only requires either the home or away team, we can look for rows with Southend United (away team in Row 6) or Cheltenham Town (home team in Row 6).
