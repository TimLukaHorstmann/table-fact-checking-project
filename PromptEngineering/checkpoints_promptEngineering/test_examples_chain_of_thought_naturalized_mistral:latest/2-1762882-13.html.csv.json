The 2003-04 Scottish football season would have a specific competition name, and all matches should have the same competition name.\n    - From the table, there are two competitions mentioned: \"ecqg5\" and \"ecqpo\". We'll check if all matches belong to either of these competitions.\n\n2. Check if all matches belong to the same competition. If there is a mix of different competitions, it means that not all matches are from the same season.\n    - All matches except row 1, 3, 7, and 8 belong to \"ecqg5\" or \"ecqpo\". Since these four rows have different competitions, it suggests that they are not part of the same season as the others.\n\n3. Check the dates for each match to confirm if they belong to the same year (2003 or 2004). If there is a mix of different years, it means that not all matches are from the same season.\n    - All dates in the table range from August 2003 to May 2004, which confirms they belong to the same year (2003-04).\n\n4. Since the matches belong to the same competition and year, we can now check if Scotland scored 0 points three times during this season.\n    - To determine if Scotland scored 0 points in a match, we'll look for rows where the score column has a value of \"0 - x\" (with \"x\" being any positive integer). We're interested in finding three such rows to confirm the claim.\n\n5. Count the number of rows where Scotland scored 0 points. If the count is equal to or greater than 3, it confirms that the claim is true.\n    - In the table, there are four rows with a score of \"0 - x\". However, since row 1, 7 and 8 have different competitions compared to the rest of the matches, we'll discard them. This leaves us with only one match where Scotland scored 0 points (row 3).\n    - Since we found fewer than three matches where Scotland scored 0 points, it means that the claim is false.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the competition column to check if all matches are from the same season.\",\n    \"Check if all matches belong to the same competition.\",\n    \"Check the dates for each match to confirm if they belong to the same year (2003 or 2004).\",\n    \"Check if Scotland scored 0 points three times during this season.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
