Identify which beers belong to West Berkshire Brewery: The beer's name \"dr hexter's healer\" appears multiple times in the table, so it belongs to West Berkshire Brewery.\n\n2. Check when the beer won gold medals: Search for rows where the \"beer name\" is \"dr hexter's healer\" and the \"prize\" is \"gold medal\". We find that the beer won gold medals in 1997, 2008, 2009.\n\n3. Verify if the years are between 1995 and 2009: The earliest year is 1995 (from Row 1) and the latest year is 2009 (from the last row). All the gold medal years for dr hexter's healer (1997, 2008, 2009) fall within this range.\n\n4.

Filter the table to only include rows that contain West Berkshire Brewery beers: We have identified three beers from this brewery; hence, all the rows in the table will potentially be relevant for counting their awards. However, we may also need to consider the type of award (e.g., overall winner, gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal, or runner-up) and competition category (e.g., beer of the festival, best bitter, mild, light bitters, etc.) to ensure that we are counting unique awards.\n\n3. Count the number of unique awards won by West Berkshire Brewery beers: To do this, we need to iterate through the rows in the table and check if a beer has already received an award (of the same type) at another competition or festival. Since there is no information about repeated awards for the same competition, we assume that unique awards are given when a brewery wins different prizes (e.g., overall winner, gold medal, silver medal, bronze medal) in separate competitions.\n\n4.

Check each row of the table to see if it matches the required criteria (brewed by West Berkshire Brewery, participating in Siba National Beer Competition and receiving a bronze award between 1995 and 2005).\n3. Review rows with 'maggs magnificent mild' as the beer name.\n4. Filter those rows to only consider the ones where the competition is 'Siba National Beer Competition'.\n5. Further filter those rows to only consider the ones where the prize is a bronze award.\n6. Look for the intersection between steps 3, 4 and 5 to find potential matches.\n7. If no match is found, the claim is FALSE. If at least one match is found, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the beer 'maggs magnificent mild' brewed by West Berkshire Brewery\", \"Check each row of the table for matches\", \"Filter rows with 'Siba National Beer Competition'\", \"Filter rows with a bronze award\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve this problem:\n\n1. Identify the beer we're interested in, which is Maggs Magnificent Mild from West Berkshire Brewery.\n2. List all the instances where this beer wins a prize between 1995 and 2009.\n3. Check if all these winning instances result in a gold medal for the beer.\n4. If all the instances where the beer won a prize resulted in a gold medal, then the claim is true.
