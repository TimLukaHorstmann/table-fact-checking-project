Iterate through the table row by row, comparing the 'year' column with 2001.\n3. If the 'year' matches 2001, then check the 'dnf' column for that row.\n4. If the value in the 'dnf' column is a positive number, it means the driver had a DNF (Did Not Finish). In this case, we can see that there are multiple rows with year 2001, so we need to check each one.\n5. Out of the rows with year 2001, the fourth row (index 3) shows 'dnf' as 6, which means Shane Hall had DNF in 6 out of his races in the year 2001.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the year for which we need to check if a DNF occurred: 2001\", \"Iterate through the table row by row, comparing the 'year' column with 2001.\", \"If the 'year' matches 2001, then check the 'dnf' column for that row.\", \"If the value in the 'dnf' column is a positive number, it means the driver had a DNF.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"dnf\"}]\n}",
