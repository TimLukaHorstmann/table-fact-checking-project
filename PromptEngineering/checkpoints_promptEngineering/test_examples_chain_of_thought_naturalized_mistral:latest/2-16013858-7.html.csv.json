If it represents the entire 2001 season, then we can proceed with our analysis; otherwise, we cannot definitively answer the question.\n\n2.

From the data provided, there are only two instances where both teams scored more than 100 points: row 2 and row 7. However, it's important to note that these matches occurred on Jun 3 and Jun 8, respectively.\n\n4. To determine whether the match on Jun 25 is the only match where both teams score more than 100 points, we need to check if there are any other instances of such matches in the remaining rows of the dataset (if it represents the entire season).
