Identify the claim: The claim is that Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranks 3rd with a total cargo load of 2939157 metric tonnes.\n\n2. Locate the relevant data in the table: To find the rank, we need to compare the total cargo loads of all airports listed in the table. To find the total cargo load for Shanghai Pudong International Airport, we search the table for the airport with \"Shanghai Pudong\" or \"Pudong\" in the 'Airport' column and find the corresponding value in the 'Total Cargo (Metric Tonnes)' column.\n\n3. Analyze the data: After finding the total cargo load for Shanghai Pudong International Airport, we compare it to other airports listed in the table, starting from the top of the list (highest ranks) to determine its position or rank.\n\n4. Output the result: If the cargo load of Shanghai Pudong International Airport is less than the cargo loads for the first and second-ranked airports, then it does not meet the claim's criteria; otherwise, it does.\n\nRelevant Cells:\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Airport\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Total Cargo (Metric Tonnes)\"}\n]\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Locate the relevant data in the table\", \"Analyze the data\", \"Output the result\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\"\n}",
