Check if there is more than one row where the \"winner\" is the same and the stage number is less than or equal to 20 (since the table only has 23 rows). This is because we are looking for a rider who won at least 4 stages out of the first 20 stages.\n3. Check if any row exists where the \"winner\" is \"final\". Since the stage number for the final stage is not provided, I will assume that it does not affect the win count in the previous stages. This assumption can be validated by checking if any other rows have a different winner, but this is not necessary since there are no other rows with a different winner.\n4. Check if the general classification for any of the rows where the \"winner\" is the same (excluding the final row) matches the general classification for the next row. If it does, we can infer that the stage win was not a solo victory and should not be counted as a separate win.\n5. Count the number of unique winners among the rows with the same winner as step 2. If the count is greater than or equal to 4, then the claim is true. Otherwise, it is false.\n\nAfter checking the table, I found that there are multiple rows where the \"winner\" is the same (Tony Rominger), but the general classification does not change for consecutive rows.
