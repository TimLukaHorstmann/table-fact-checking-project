In this case, it is Row 5.\n\n3. Examine the data in the identified row: From the information in Row 5, we see that the participant is \"rita\", the episode summary states that \"rita is made into an actress\", and there is no explicit mention of a title for this episode.\n\n4. Compare the claim with the findings: The statement in the table matches the claim since both state that \"rita is made into an actress\".

Based on the scan, we found that Katie Kansas is indeed the coach in Row 11, but her episode premiered on October 11, 2012 (which is correct), and there is no external link provided for this episode.\n\n4. The claim states that \"Katie Kansas be the coach in episode 10 premier on October 11, 2012 and have full episode external link\".

Since we have found a match, we can now confirm whether this is the coach of the first episode in season 13.\n4. Since the order seems to be chronological based on the premiere date, the coach of the first episode should be the one whose row has the smallest premiere date among all rows with Brian Patacca as the coach.\n5.
