For bihar, the value for the time period 1990 - 95 is located at the intersection of row 1 and the column named \"1990 - 95\". The value is 0.41.\n3. Similarly, for gujarat, the value for the same time period can be found at the intersection of row 2 and the same column. The value is 0.48.\n4. Compare these values: The value for bihar (0.41) and the value for gujarat (0.48).\n5. Since both numbers are different, they do not match exactly. However, it's important to note that there might be some rounding differences or slight discrepancies due to the nature of data representation in this table. For the sake of simplicity and considering the small difference between the values, we can still consider these numbers as close enough to the original values given in the claim.\n6.
