To check if the score point can be no greater than 129 and no less than 72, we compare these two values with the minimum and maximum scores found in the table for the Pacers' games during their 41st season.

In this table, the Pacers are the home team in Rows 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 16 (the other rows are away games for the Pacers).\n\n3. Cross-check the conditions: To meet the claim that Danny Granger was the lead scorer in 5 games, with 3 of them being home games, we need to find 5 instances where Danny Granger is the leading scorer and the game is a home game for the Pacers. From our analysis in steps 1 and 2, we find that Danny Granger was the leading scorer in the following home games: Rows 2, 4, 7, and 9. This accounts for 4 out of the 5 required instances. The remaining instance where he is the lead scorer in a home game cannot be found in this table because it does not meet the condition that Danny Granger was the leading scorer in only 5 games.\n\n4.

First, we need to determine the total number of games played by the Indiana Pacers in their 41st season (as per the table, it seems like this is the data provided for us).\n\n2.

Now, let's look at the scores of these games to find the minimum and maximum points scored by the Pacers (as the claim is about the point score of the Pacers, not their opponents). However, we can't directly infer the lowest score from the table because there might be games where the Pacers scored less than 80 points but lost. Similarly, we can't determine the highest score without checking all games.\n\n4. To find the highest score, we need to check each game and find the maximum value among them. Similarly, to find the lowest score, we need to assume that there might have been a few games where the Pacers scored less than 80 points but won (in which case their score wouldn't be recorded in the table).
