Locate the relevant row in the table based on the event name matching with the claim: In this case, we are looking for a row where the \"event\" column equals \"brighton hotel bombing\".\n\n3. Extract the location from the found row: If a match is found, read the value in the \"location\" column from that specific row.\n\n4. Compare the extracted location with the expected location mentioned in the claim: In this case, compare the extracted location from step 3 with \"brighton, uk\".\n\n5. Output the final answer based on the comparison made in step 4: If the two locations match, output { \"answer\": \"TRUE\" } and list the relevant cells as [{\"row_index\": X, \"column_name\": \"event\"}, {\"row_index\": X, \"column_name\": \"location\"}]. Here, X is the row number where the \"event\" column matches with \"brighton hotel bombing\". If the two locations do not match, output { \"answer\": \"FALSE\" } and provide no relevant cells since there was no relevant cell found in the table.\n\nAfter following these steps, we find that the Brighton hotel bombing happened in Brighton, UK as indicated by row 44 in the provided table.
