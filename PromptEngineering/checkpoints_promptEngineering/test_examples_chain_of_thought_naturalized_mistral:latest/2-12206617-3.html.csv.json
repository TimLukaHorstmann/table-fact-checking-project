Identify the team names involved in the claim, which are Toronto Blue Jays (not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred since all teams they played against are their opponents) and Angels.\n2. Browse through each row of the table to find instances where either team is an opponent for a match on the same day. Since we're looking for May matches, we only focus on rows 1-31 (the months are not explicitly stated but can be inferred as May because all dates are within this range).\n3. Check each row to see if both teams are involved:\n   - Rows 1-6 and 7-12 involve the Rangers, which is not the Angels. So we discard these rows.\n   - Row 9 involves the White Sox, but it doesn't matter for this particular claim since we're looking for an Angel matchup. Discard row 9.\n   - Rows 15-18, 20, and 24-27 involve the White Sox again, which is not the Angels. So we discard these rows as well.\n   - Row 21, 22, 23, 25-29, and 31 all involve the Angels but not on the same day with any other team. Since we're looking for multiple matches between both teams, we discard these rows since they only have a single Angel match each.\n   - Row 20 has the Athletics as the opponent for the Blue Jays and the Angels for the opponent of another team (the Athletics). This row is also irrelevant to our claim because we are looking for matches where both teams are opponents on the same day.\n4. The only remaining rows that haven't been discarded yet are rows 1, 28, and 29. All these rows involve the Angels, but not on the same day with the Blue Jays. Since our claim mentions \"3 times,\" having multiple instances of Angel matches within May does not prove that they played each other three times in May.\n5. Since there is no clear evidence to support the claim that Toronto Blue Jays play the Angels 3 times in May during the 1991 season, we conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells:\n- { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n- { \"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" },\n- { \"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"opponent\" }",

The Toronto Blue Jays play their last game on May 31, 1991.\n2. Going backwards from this game, we find the following games:\n   - Row 27: opponent=angels, score=5-1, loss=langston (6-2)\n   - Row 26: opponent=athletics, score=8-6, loss=ward (0-2)\n   - Row 25: opponent=athletics, score=8-3, loss=slusarski (1-2)\n\nThese three games represent the last three games played by the Toronto Blue Jays in May 1991.\n\n1. Checking the scores of these games, we can see that they lost two out of the last three games:\n   - Row 27: win (5-1)\n   - Row 26: loss (8-6)\n   - Row 25: loss (8-3)\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays lost 2 out of the last 3 games they played in May 1991.\n\nNow, let's output the final answer in a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the time frame (May 1991) and find the last three games played by the Toronto Blue Jays within that month.\", \"Check the scores of these games to determine if the Blue Jays lost 2 out of the last 3 games they played in May 1991.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 27,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Compare each row in the table to see if it matches the specified opponent (Athletics).\n3. Filter out all rows where the opponent does not match 'Athletics'. This will leave us with a subset of rows that are relevant to our claim.\n4. Check the attendance values for these remaining rows and find the minimum value.

Scan through the table, focusing on the dates within the specified range (rows 24, 25, 26, and 27).\n3. Check if there are any instances where the opponent for two consecutive games is the same team. In this case, from May 25 to May 28, the opponent remains \"athletics\" for three games (rows 24-26) and then changes to \"angels\" on row 27.\n4. Check if there are any losses in those consecutive games. Each of the games between May 25 and May 28 has a loss listed in the table (loss column).\n5.
