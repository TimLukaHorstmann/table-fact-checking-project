Define the criteria for a team having multiple wins: a team has multiple wins if it has more than one row where the column \"wins\" is greater than zero.\n2. Iterate through all the rows in the table.\n3. Check if the current row's value under the \"wins\" column is greater than zero (1, 4, or 3 for Rows 1, 3, and 8 respectively).\n4. If the condition in step 3 is true, store this row's index for future reference.\n5. Repeat steps 3 to 4 for all rows.\n6. If there are multiple rows with a \"wins\" value greater than zero, the claim is TRUE. Otherwise, the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Define criteria for 'every team have several wins'\",\n    \"Iterate through all the rows in the table\",\n    \"Check if the current row's value under the 'wins' column is greater than zero\",\n    \"Store this row's index for future reference if condition is true\",\n    \"Repeat steps 3 to 4 for all rows\",\n    \"If there are multiple rows with a 'wins' value greater than zero, the claim is TRUE.
