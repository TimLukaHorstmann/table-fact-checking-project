Go through the table and find rows where the home team is Montreal - There are 4 such rows (Row 5, Row 9, Row 10, and Row 14).\n3. Check the scores for these rows to see if any match the one stated in the claim (\"4 - 2\") - In Row 5, the score is \"4 - 1\" which doesn't match; in Row 9, the score is \"4 - 2\", which matches the claim.\n4.

Relevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}]\n2. For each game where Montreal played at home, note down the score in the 'score' column and compare them to find the highest score.

The highest score among the games where Montreal played at home was 6-5 (Row 12), which occurred on November 24th. We will now check if there are any other scores in the table that were also 6-5 to ensure that the highest score of the month belongs to a Montreal home game.\n4. To find out if there are any other games with the same score, compare all the 'score' columns in the table (except for the rows where Montreal played at home) to the highest score found (6-5). Relevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]\n5.
