Now, verify if Nottingham Forest FC has played these specific competitions 15 times (combining appearances in both). By adding up the appearances for each competition, we find that the European Cup appearances are 3 (Row 1) and UEFA Cup appearances are also 3 (Row 2), totaling 6 appearances. Since there are other competitions not included in the table, it is not possible to confirm or deny if Nottingham Forest FC played these specific competitions 15 times based on the provided information.\n4.

In this case, Nottingham Forest has a higher win percentage (25%) compared to the other UEFA Cup appearances (20%).
