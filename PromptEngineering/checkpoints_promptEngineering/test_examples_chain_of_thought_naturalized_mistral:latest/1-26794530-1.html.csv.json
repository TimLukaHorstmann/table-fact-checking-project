    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to compare the number of poles for each team across all seasons.\n2. In the table provided, we see multiple rows corresponding to different teams in different series for the same years (e.g., carlin and giles motorsport competing in both the Toyota Racing Series and British Formula Three in 2010). To properly compare the poles between these teams, we will focus on the number of poles for each team within a single series per year.\n3. We then iterate through each row to find the maximum number of poles obtained by a team in a single series.\n4. Upon inspecting the rows, we notice that only one team, Ces\u00e1rio F\u00f3rmula, has secured more than one pole position in a single series across different years (2009 Formula 3 Sudamericana and 2011 Formula 3 Brazil Open).\n5. Within the same year, 2009, Ces\u00e1rio F\u00f3rmula achieved the maximum number of poles (1) in the Formula 3 Sudamericana series.\n6. In subsequent years (2010-2011), Ces\u00e1rio F\u00f3rmula also secured multiple pole positions but not more than one per year or series.\n7. Therefore, the highest number of poles is indeed 1, achieved by Ces\u00e1rio F\u00f3rmula in 2009 Formula 3 Sudamericana.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Compare the number of pole positions for each team across all seasons.\\n1.
