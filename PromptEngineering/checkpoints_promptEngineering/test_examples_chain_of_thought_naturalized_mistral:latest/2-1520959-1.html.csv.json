    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all roller coasters at Drayton Manor by checking the themed areas mentioned in the table. From the table, there are two parks mentioned - Action Park and Aerial Park, which are assumed to be the parks at Drayton Manor since they are the only ones provided.\n\n2. Then, we need to filter out all roller coasters from the table by identifying the rows that have 'roller coaster' as their style. In this case, the relevant rows are 1, 3, and 4.\n\n3. Next, we compare each unique manufacturer of these filtered roller coasters to check if they are identical or not. In this case, the manufacturers for these roller coasters are Intamin (for Row 1), Vekoma (for Row 3), Zamperla (for Row 4). These three manufacturers are different from each other.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the parks by checking the themed areas mentioned in the table.\",\n    \"Filter out all roller coasters from the table.\",\n    \"Compare each unique manufacturer of these filtered roller coasters to check if they are identical or not.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"manufacturer\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"manufacturer\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"manufacturer\" }\n  ]\n}",
