In our table, the rows are sorted by seasons from oldest to newest. We can observe that the seventh row corresponds to this season based on the year range.\n2. Next, we check for the number of games won in this particular season (row 7). The cell with column name \"won\" has a value of 25.\n3. Now, we need to find out the association of the league standing with the number of wins in each season. From observing the table, it seems that the lower the number of wins, the lower the league standing (e.g., the team with 6th position has fewer wins than the one with 5th).\n4. Since the number of games won in this particular season is not the lowest among all the seasons (as we found out in step 2), it is reasonable to assume that the final standing in the season 1956 - 57 will not be the lowest, meaning it will be higher than the 6th position.\n5. We cannot definitively say whether the final standing in this season would be exactly the 4th position based on our analysis so far since we don't have enough information about the other teams and their win counts in that specific year. However, we can establish that the final standing will be higher than 6th position but may or may not be 4th.\n\nSince it is not possible to accurately determine whether the final standing is exactly 4th without additional information, our output should reflect this uncertainty:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find the row corresponding to the season mentioned in the claim (1956 - 57)\",\n    \"Check for the number of games won in this particular season\",\n    \"Analyze the association between league standing and number of wins in each season\",\n    \"Determine that the number of games won is not the lowest among all seasons, so the final standing will be higher than 6th position\",\n    \"Cannot definitively say whether the final standing will be exactly 4th due to lack of information about other teams and their win counts in that specific year\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"won\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"standing\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"standing\" }\n  ]\n}",
