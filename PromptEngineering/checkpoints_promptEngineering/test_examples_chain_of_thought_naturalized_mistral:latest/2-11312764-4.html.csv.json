Determine Natalia Strelkova's rank in the championship:\n    - To find her rank, sort all skaters by their total points in descending order.\n    - Compare each skater's total points to Natalia Strelkova's points and determine their respective ranks.\n    - Since there is only one skater with more total points than Natalia Strelkova (deborah cottrill, row 14), we can see that Natalia Strelkova has the 134th rank in the championship.\n\n4. Determine if Natalia Strelkova lost the skating championship:\n    - The champion of a competition is typically the skater with the highest number of points.\n    - In this case, since there are skaters with higher points than Natalia Strelkova, it can be concluded that she did not win (lose) the skating championship.
