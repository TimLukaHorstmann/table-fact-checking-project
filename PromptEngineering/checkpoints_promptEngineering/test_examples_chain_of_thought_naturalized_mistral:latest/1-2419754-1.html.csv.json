From the timeline provided, we can assume that only institutions which joined the conference between 1991 and 1995 are relevant as they were active during this time period. The relevant institutions from our table are: University of Cincinnati, University of Dayton, DePaul University, Marquette University, and Saint Louis University.\n\n2. Check the founded date of each institution. This is to determine if more than half of the member institutions of the GMC were established before 1860. The relevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}].\n\n3. Analyze the founded dates to find out if more than half of the institutions were established before 1860. From our table, only two institutions (University of Cincinnati and Saint Louis University) were founded before 1860. Since there are a total of 5 institutions in this case, having 2/5 or 40% of them established before 1860 does not meet the criteria that \"more than half\" were established before 1860.\n\n4.
