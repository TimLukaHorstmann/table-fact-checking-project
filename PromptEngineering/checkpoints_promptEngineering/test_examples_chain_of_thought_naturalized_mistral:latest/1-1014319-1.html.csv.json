    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the dance and song that corresponds to the claim, which in this case is tango and hung up.\n2. Check if the table contains a row with the same dance and song combination.\n3. If yes, then check the individual judge scores for Goodman and Tonioli.\n4. If the score from Goodman is 10 and the score from Tonioli is 9 (or higher), then the claim is true.\n\nBy following these steps, I can find the relevant row by checking the \"dance/song\" column for the value 'tango / hung up'. The relevant cells are:\n\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"dance / song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"goodman\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"tonioli\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nBy inspecting the table and referring to the relevant cells, I find that the scores for Goodman and Tonioli (9 and 10 respectively) in row 12 match the claim's conditions.
