    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. First, we need to determine how many times the Vancouver team scored 5 goals or more in a game.\n   2. We will go through each row of the table where the 'visitor' value is 'vancouver'. The score column shows the number of goals scored by the visiting team, so we care about rows where the score column is greater than or equal to 5. From the table, there are 3 such instances (row 1, 3, and 8).\n   3. Next, we need to find out how many unique games these instances represent since a game involves both home and visitor teams. We can do this by looking at the 'home' column in those rows. In our example, there are only two different homes: Tampa Bay (row 1), Ottawa (row 3), and Los Angeles (row 8). However, since the game between Vancouver and Ottawa has already been accounted for, we know that the game against Los Angeles is a new one. So, there are two unique games where Vancouver scored 5 goals or more.\n   4. Now, we need to find out if there are any other instances where Vancouver scored less than 5 goals in a game. Since Vancouver scored 1 goal in row 2, 3 goals in row 3, 1 goal in row 5, and 1 goal in row 9, it is clear that they scored less than 5 goals in at least one additional game (row 2).\n   5. Finally, we compare the number of instances where Vancouver scored less than 5 goals with the number of instances where they scored 5 goals or more. Since there are two instances where Vancouver scored less than 5 goals and only one instance where they scored 5 goals or more, it follows that Vancouver scored less than 5 goals in at least 2 different games.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find instances of Vancouver scoring 5 goals or more\",\n    \"Identify unique games\",\n    \"Find instances where Vancouver scores less than 5 goals\",\n    \"Compare the number of instances for each scenario\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
