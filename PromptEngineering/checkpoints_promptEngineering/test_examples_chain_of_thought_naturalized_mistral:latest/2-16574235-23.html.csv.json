    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n   1. First, we need to identify all players who were part of Olympiacos in 2008. To do this, we will look for rows where the \"club\" column contains the value \"olympiacos\".\n   2. In our table, there are two such players: boyan yordanov (row 4) and krasimir gaydarski (row 5).\n   3. To confirm whether they both were part of the Olympiacos team in 2008, we check if either player's name appears more than once with the same club in different years.\n   4. Upon checking, neither boyan yordanov nor krasimir gaydarski appear to have played for any other clubs listed in our table.\n   5. Since both players (boyan yordanov and krasimir gaydarski) were part of the same club \"olympiacos\" in 2008, they were teammates on that team.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify players in Olympiacos (2008), Check if they played for other clubs listed, Confirm if they were teammates by ensuring no repetition of the same player with the same club\"],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"club\"}\n  ]\n}",
