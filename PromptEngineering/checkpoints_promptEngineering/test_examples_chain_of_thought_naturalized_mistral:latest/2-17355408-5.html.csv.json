    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the claim: The game against Philadelphia should be played at the Pepsi Center, with 19155 people in attendance.\n   2. Identify the games played at the Pepsi Center: By observing the location column (column_name: \"location attendance\"), we can see that all the games were played either at the Pepsi center or the Air Canada centre. However, the relevant game for our claim is the one with Philadelphia as the opponent.\n   3. Find the game against Philadelphia: By searching through the table, we find the row where the \"team\" column has the value \"philadelphia\". This occurs in Row 12.\n   4. Check if the location is the Pepsi Center: In row 12, under the \"location attendance\" column, it says \"pepsi center 19155\", which matches our claim's location requirement.\n   5. Verify if the attendance matches: Since the attendance in Row 12 (19155) is equal to the attendance in the claim, there is no reason to doubt this information.\n\nWith all these points considered, here's the final answer in the requested JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim\",\n    \"Identify games played at Pepsi Center\",\n    \"Find game against Philadelphia\",\n    \"Check if location is Pepsi Center\",\n    \"Verify attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"\n    ]\n}",
