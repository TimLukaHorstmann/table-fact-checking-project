The competition column contains 8 unique entries: world cross country championships, african championships in athletics, world road running championships, world championships in athletics, and all-africa games.\n2. Next, we check each unique competition to determine their respective years.

Since the claim specifies that the event takes place between the years of 2006 and 2013, it is enough to find any competition that took place within this time frame, as all competitions listed occurred at least once during this period.
