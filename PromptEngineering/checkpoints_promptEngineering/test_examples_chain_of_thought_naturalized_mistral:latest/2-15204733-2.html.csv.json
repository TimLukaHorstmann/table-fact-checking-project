    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the song we are looking for, which is \"le clip, music video i\". We don't have a specific version mentioned, but since the claim only mentions 1986, we will consider the versions from that year first.\n   2. Scan through the table to find the rows with \"year: 1986\". There are multiple entries for \"remixed by: laurent boutonnat\" and different lengths and titles (not just \"le clip, music video i\"). However, there is one entry with an album named \"les clips , music videos i\".\n   3. Since the instrumental version is not explicitly mentioned but the claim mentions a duration of 3:31, we need to find if any version in this row matches this length. The only version from this row with a matching length (3:31) is the fourth row, which corresponds to the \"version\" column and doesn't have an exact match for \"le clip, music video i\".\n   4. As a possible explanation, we can infer that the instrumental version of \"le clip, music video i\" may not be distinctly labeled but could be part of the \"les clips , music videos i\" album. However, to confirm this, more context or information about the songs in this album would be required.\n   5. Since we cannot definitively prove that it is the instrumental version of \"le clip, music video i\", I'll output a semi-qualified answer.\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the song 'le clip, music video i'.\",\n    \"Find all entries from 1986.\",\n    \"Look for versions within the 1986 entries.\",\n    \"Check if any version has a matching length (3:31).\",\n    \"Infer that the instrumental version might not be distinctly labeled but could be part of the 'les clips , music videos i' album.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"version\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"length\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\" }\n  ]\n}",
