The relevant cells are:\n   - Row 4: { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"agg\" } (Paris Saint-Germain vs Braga)\n   - Rows 1 through 8 (all other matches): { \"row_index\": index, \"column_name\": \"agg\" }, where index ranges from 1 to 8 excluding 4 (the Paris Saint-Germain vs Braga row)\n\nThe combined aggregate scores are:\n\n   - Paris Saint-Germain vs Braga: 1 - 0 + 0 - 0 = 1\n   - Werder Bremen vs Saint-\u00c9tienne: 3 - 2 = 1 (aggregate score is not the total of the two legs, but the result of the match)\n   - CSKA Moscow vs Shakhtar Donetsk: 1 - 2 = -1\n   - Udinese vs Zenit St. Petersburg: 2 - 1 + 0 - 1 = 0\n   - Dynamo Kyiv vs Metalist Kharkiv: 3 - 3 (a) = 0 (due to the tie, no aggregate score can be calculated)\n   - Manchester City vs Aalborg BK: 2 - 2 (4 - 3 p) = 0 (since the match ended in a draw after extra time, the aggregate score is still 2 - 2)\n   - Marseille vs Ajax: 4 - 3 (aet) = 1 (since the away goals rule applies and Marseille scored more away goals, the final score for this leg is taken as the aggregate score)\n   - Hamburg vs Galatasaray: 4 - 3 = 1\n\nThe lowest combined aggregate score can be found in the Paris Saint-Germain vs Braga match (1).

We can do this by adding the goals from both legs for each team (Column \"agg\").\n2. Next, we want to find out how many teams have scored more than 4 goals in total. To do that, we will compare the goal totals for each team with the value of 4.\n3. Finally, we will count the number of teams that meet the condition (scored more than 4 goals).\n\n   Now, let's find out which teams scored more than 4 goals:\n   - Werder Bremen: 3 + 2 = 5 goals\n   - Saint-\u00c9tienne: 1 + 2 = 3 goals\n   - CSKA Moscow: 1 + 2 = 3 goals\n   - Udinese: 2 + 1 = 3 goals\n   - Zenit St. Petersburg: 2 + 0 = 2 goals\n   - Paris Saint-Germain: 1 + 0 = 1 goal\n   - Dynamo Kyiv: 3 (a) + 3 (a) = 6 goals (note that in this case, the team scored more than 4 goals in a single leg, but the condition is for the total across both legs, so it does not count towards the final result)\n   - Manchester City: 2 + 2 (p) = 4 goals (note that in this case, the team scored exactly 4 goals across both legs, but the condition is for teams scoring more than 4 goals, so it does not count towards the final result)\n   - Marseille: 4 + 3 = 7 goals\n   - Hamburg: 4 + 3 = 7 goals\n   - Galatasaray: 1 + 2 = 3 goals\n\n   As we can see, only Marseille and Hamburg scored more than 4 goals.
