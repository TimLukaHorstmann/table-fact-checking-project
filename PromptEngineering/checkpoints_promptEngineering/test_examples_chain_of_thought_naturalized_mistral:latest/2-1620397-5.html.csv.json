Count the episodes featuring Tegan: To find out if Tegan features in 3 episodes of Doctor Who, we need to check the number of rows where she is listed as a cast member.\n\n3. Check each row for Tegan: We see that Tegan appears in three different series sorted under the column \"series sorted\". These are rows 1, 2, and 3 (6eb/a, 6eb/b, and 6eb/c).\n\n4. Verify if the number of episodes is equal to 3: Since we have found Tegan in three different series, it means that she features in at least 3 episodes of Doctor Who.

In this case, that would be 35/8 = 4.375 months per release.\n5. Compare the calculated average with the claim. The claim states \"the release date average is 1 every 2 months\". Comparing the decimal representation of the average (4.375) to the ratio mentioned in the claim (1/2 = 0.5), we see that the two are not equal, which means the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify release dates from 'released' column.\",\n    \"Calculate number of release dates (8).\",\n    \"Find total months between first and last release date (35 months).\",\n    \"Calculate average release date interval (4.375 months per release).\",\n    \"Compare calculated average with claim, find that they are not equal.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"released\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"released\"}\n  ]\n}",
