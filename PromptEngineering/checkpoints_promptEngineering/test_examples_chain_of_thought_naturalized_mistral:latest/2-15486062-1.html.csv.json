I will traverse through the rows and check the \"result\" column to determine if it corresponds to a win or loss.\n3. For each row with a win, I will increment a counter variable 'wins' by 1.

If wins is equal to or greater than losses + 1 (because there is an extra game which determines the final record), then the team finished with a losing season, otherwise they finished with a winning season.\n5. In this case, after traversing the table, I observe that the value of 'wins' is 7 and 'losses' is 9 (which includes one more game).

We can do this by finding the difference between the Cowboys' score (home team) and their opponents' score (away team). In the provided table, the column 'result' gives the home team's score first followed by a space then the away team's score. For example, in row 5, the result is \"9 - 7\", so the difference is 9-7=2.\n\n2. After calculating the score differences for each game, we need to find the smallest difference among them, as the claim states that the closest games were ties. Since a tie would have a score difference of 0, if we find a smaller difference than 0, it means those games were not the closest.\n\n3. We'll then search through the table for any game with a score difference of 0, which indicates a tie. In this case, there are no games marked as ties in the provided table.\n\n4. Since we didn't find any tie games and we found smaller score differences than 0 in the calculated differences, it means that the closest game was not a tie against the Washington Redskins or the Denver Broncos.
