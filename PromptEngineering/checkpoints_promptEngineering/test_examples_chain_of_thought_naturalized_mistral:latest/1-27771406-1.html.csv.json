Next, I count the number of players whose test careers started before 1960 and after 1960. This will give me an idea of how many players had their careers during the 1960s.\n3. If more players had their test careers starting before 1960 or having no clear start year, then it's unlikely that most of the careers were in the 1960s. On the other hand, if more players had their test career starting after 1960, then some portion of those careers could have been during the 1960s, but it's still not guaranteed that most of them were.

    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will look for every player listed in the table to check if they have any 'stumpings'.\n2. If a player has no 'stumpings', then it means that they did not make at least 1 stump during their test career according to the provided table.\n3. If all players have 'stumpings' in their records, then the claim \"every player makes at least 1 stump\" would be true for this data set.\n4. I will iterate through each row of the table (starting from Row 1) and check if the value under the column 'stumpings' is greater than zero.\n5. If any of the values are equal to or greater than one, then the claim is true.\n6. If even a single value is less than one, then the claim is false for this data set.\n\nNow let's check if the players have any 'stumpings':\n\n1. Errol Hunte - stumpings: 0\n2. Ivan Barrow - stumpings: 5\n3. Cyril Christiani - stumpings: 1\n4. Alfred Binns - stumpings: 3\n5. Ralph Legall - stumpings: 1\n6. Clifford Mcwatt - stumpings: 1\n7. Clairmonte Depeiaza - stumpings: 4\n8. Gerry Alexander - stumpings: 5\n9. Jackie Hendriks - stumpings: 5\n10. Ivor Mendonca - stumpings: 2\n11. David Allan - stumpings: 3\n12. Mike Findlay - stumpings: 2\n\nSince all players have 'stumpings' in their records, the claim \"every player makes at least 1 stump\" is true for this data set.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"First, we checked if every player listed in the table has any 'stumpings'. If a player has no 'stumpings', then the claim would be false. Since all players have stumpings in their records, we determined that the claim is true for this data set.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"stumpings\"}\n  ]\n}",
