    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim, which states that Lionel Messi ranked 2 and scored 73 goals during the 2011/12 season.\n\n2. Check the table for rows containing Lionel Messi's name and the year 2011/12 in the season column. There are two such rows, but only one of them mentions a goal count of 73 (Row 1 and Row 6).\n\n3. Examine the ranking provided in the claim. The rankings in the table range from 1 to 15, with Messi appearing twice in the list (Ranks 2 and 5). If we assume that the ranks are ordered by goal count in descending order, then Row 1 should have a higher ranking than Row 6 since it contains a higher number of goals.\n\n4. Compare the goal counts from Rows 1 and 6, which both contain Lionel Messi's name and the year 2011/12. The goal count in Row 1 is 73, while in Row 6 it is 53. Since 73 > 53, the goal count in Row 1 corresponds to a higher ranking.\n\n5. Now compare the rankings from Rows 1 and 6 with the one provided in the claim (Rank 2). Since the ranking in Row 1 is 1, which is higher than Rank 2, and there is no other row containing Lionel Messi's name with a goal count of 73 during the 2011/12 season, we can conclude that Messi ranked 2 but scored 73 goals during the 2010/11 season instead (since Row 6 contains his 2010/11 data).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify claim\",\n    \"Search table for relevant rows with Messi's name and the year 2011/12\",\n    \"Check if the goal count matches the one in the claim\",\n    \"Compare rankings from found rows to the ranking provided in the claim\",\n    \"If a match is found, check the year again\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"season\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\" }\n  ]\n}",
