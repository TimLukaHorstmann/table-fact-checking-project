Scan through the table to find a row where the 'country' value matches 'New Zealand'. We see that this happens in Row 5, with player 'bob charles'.\n3. Identify the score and to par for the player from New Zealand. These are found in the columns labeled 'score' (140) and 'to par' (-2).\n4. Compare the scores of all players to find out if the player from New Zealand is in last place. To do this, we need to look at the scores of all other players. We see that:\n   - The players tied for 3rd place (Rows 3-5) have a score of 140, which is equal to the score of the player from New Zealand. Since they are tied, we cannot say that the player from New Zealand is in last place among this group.\n   - Gene Borek (Row 6), Julius Boros (Row 7), Tom Weiskopf (Row 8), Arnold Palmer (Row 9), and Lee Trevino (Row 10) all have scores greater than or equal to 142, which is higher than the score of the player from New Zealand.\n5.
