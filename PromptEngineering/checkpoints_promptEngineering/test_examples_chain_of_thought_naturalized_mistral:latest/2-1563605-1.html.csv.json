Next, we will check each row of the table to find matches involving Adnan al Talyani (there is no information about the players in the table). We can do this by looking for rows where the competition matches with any of the competitions that had a result of 2-0 or 2-1, as these were the only results where Adnan's team won, and it is possible for the score to repeat.\n\n3. We find three rows where the competition matches one of the specified: Row 1 (1984 gulf cup), Row 3 (1984 Asian cup), and Row 9 (1986 gulf cup). In row 1, there is only one match involving Adnan al Talyani. In rows 3 and 9, we can see that the scores are not repeated within each competition (row 3: 1-0 and 2-0, row 9: 2-0 and 2-3).\n\n4.
