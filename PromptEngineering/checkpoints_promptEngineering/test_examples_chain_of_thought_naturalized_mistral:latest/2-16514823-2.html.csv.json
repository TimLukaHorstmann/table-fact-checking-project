    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the claim to be evaluated: The given claim is about a match-up between \"g\u00f6teborg\" and \"ullevi\" on September 19th, 2015.\n\n2. Determine the relevant table data: To evaluate this claim, we need to look for any row in the table that matches the conditions of having \"g\u00f6teborg\" as the home team (opponents) and \"ullevi\" as the venue or away team (venue). Additionally, we need to check if the date is September 19th, 2015.\n\n3. Check the table for relevant data: We find no row in the table that matches all three conditions (home team = \"g\u00f6teborg\", away team = \"ullevi\" or \"g\u00f6teborg\" = opponents and venue = \"ullevi\", date = September 19th, 2015).\n\n4. Conclusion: Since there is no match between \"g\u00f6teborg\" and \"ullevi\" on September 19th, 2015 in the provided table, we can conclude that the given claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the final JSON output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: g\u00f6teborg vs ullevi on September 19th, 2015\",\n    \"Determine relevant table data: home team = g\u00f6teborg, away team = ullevi or vice versa, date = September 19th, 2015\",\n    \"Check the table for relevant data\",\n    \"No match between g\u00f6teborg and ullevi on September 19th, 2015 found in the provided table\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
