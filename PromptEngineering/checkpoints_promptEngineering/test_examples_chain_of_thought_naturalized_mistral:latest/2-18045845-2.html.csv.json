    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the requested dates: 23 January 2010 and 22 August 2012.\n2. Search for rows corresponding to these dates in the table. For example, the row with \"Result Date\" of \"23 January 2010\" would be row number 5 (index starts at 0), and the row with \"Result Date\" of \"22 August 2012\" would be row number 26 (index starts at 0).\n3. Check the column named \"Competition\" for each of these rows. The competition name gives context to the result in the same row, which is under the \"Result\" column.\n4. For the date on 23 January 2010 (row 5), check the value in the \"Competition\" column. The competition for this date is \"2010 Asian Football Championship qualification\".\n5. Check the value in the \"Result\" column for row 5. The result for this date is \"W\". Since the claim does not match the result, move on to the next date.\n6. For the date on 22 August 2012 (row 26), check the value in the \"Competition\" column. The competition for this date is \"2012 Nehru Cup\".\n7. Check the value in the \"Result\" column for row 26. The result for this date is \"D\". Since this matches the claim, we can conclude that the claim is true for this specific case.\n8.
