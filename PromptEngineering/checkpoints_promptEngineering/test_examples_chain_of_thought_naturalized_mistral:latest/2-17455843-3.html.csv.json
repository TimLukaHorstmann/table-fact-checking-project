Next, we need to determine how many times the home team won among these ties. To do this, we check each tie where there is a home team specified (ignoring replays). We find that there are 7 regular ties where a home team appears: nelson (replay loss), york city (replay win), watford, walsall, gillingham, crewe alexandra, and gainsborough trinity. Out of these 7 games, the home team won in 3 instances: york City (replay), Watford, and Walsall.\n\n3. Since there are 11 ties in total, and the home team won 3 out of those 7 regular ties, we can calculate the percentage of times the home team wins by dividing the number of victories by the total number of ties (regular + replays). In this case, that would be (3 / 11) * 100 = 27.27%\n\n4.
