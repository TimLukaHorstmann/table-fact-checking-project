    "resp": "Here's my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the table's structure: The table contains 24 rows, each representing a different day of the race with columns for date, course, distance, winner, and race leader.\n\n2. Find the row corresponding to the claimed winning day (May 26): Row 21 corresponds to May 26 as it has the \"date\" column value of \"26 may\". The \"winner\" column in this row is \"gerard loncke ( bel )\", which matches our claim about the winner.\n\n3. Identify the race leader on the claimed winning day: The \"race leader\" column in the corresponding row is empty, with a value of \"rest day\". This indicates that there was no race leader on May 26. However, since there's no specific rule mentioning who should be the race leader on the day of the final stage, we can move forward and check if our claim about Alfredo Binda still holds.\n\n4. Find the total row (24th row) to get the overall winner: The \"total\" row (Row 24) does not contain a winner, but it mentions that Alfredo Binda is the race leader on this day, with the \"race leader\" column value of \"alfredo binda ( ita )\".\n\n5. Compare the overall winner and the claimed winner: Since both the overall winner and the claimed winner are different, we now have to see if our claim that Alfredo Binda was still the race leader on May 26 is valid or not.\n\n6. Check for instances where Alfredo Binda is the race leader after May 26: If there's a day where Alfredo Binda is the race leader after May 26, then our claim about Gerard Loncke winning the race on May 26 without being the race leader would be false.\n\n7. Find rows where Alfredo Binda is the race leader after May 26: Starting from row 21 (May 26), we check through the remaining rows. However, no such instances are found.\n\n8. Final answer: Since there's no evidence that contradicts the claim and Gerard Loncke was indeed the winner on May 26 (as per the table data), our final answer is \"TRUE\".\n\nHere's the JSON object for the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify table structure\",\n    \"Find row corresponding to May 26\",\n    \"Check if winner matches claim\",\n    \"Identify race leader on May 26\",\n    \"Find total row for overall winner\",\n    \"Compare overall winner and claimed winner\",\n    \"Check for instances where Alfredo Binda is the race leader after May 26\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"winner\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"race leader\" }\n  ]\n}",

Check if there is another row where the winner column again has Ettore Meini's name immediately after the current row. To do this, compare each subsequent row with our found rows to see if they meet the condition.\n3. In Row 19, the next race day is on Row 20 (date: 25 May), so there's no next row to compare.
