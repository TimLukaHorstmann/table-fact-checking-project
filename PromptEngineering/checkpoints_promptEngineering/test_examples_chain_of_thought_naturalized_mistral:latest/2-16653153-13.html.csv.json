    "resp": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's verify if the table contains a row for the game with the score of 103 - 101.\n2. To do that, we need to scan through each row in the table and compare its 'score' column with the given score (103 - 101).\n3. If there is a match, then we need to check if the corresponding 'box score' for this row is not empty (i.e., it contains the string '-').\n4. Since the 'date' for each row is consistent with the given date (22 october or any other date mentioned in the claim), we don't have to consider that while comparing rows.\n5. After verifying all the rows, if there is a match where both conditions are met (matching score and non-empty 'box score'), then the claim is TRUE.\n6. If no such match is found or any row with an empty 'box score' for the matching score is found, then the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Check if there exists a row with the given score (103 - 101)\",\n    \"Step 2: For each row, compare its 'score' column with the given score\",\n    \"Step 3: If there is a match, check if the corresponding 'box score' for this row is not empty\",\n    \"Step 4: Since the 'date' in all rows is consistent with the given date, we don't need to consider that while comparing rows\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"box score\" }\n  ]\n}",

Identify the key components of the claim:\n    - The match occurs on October 26th (date)\n    - The box score type is not specified but we know it should be \"box score\" for any valid game (box_score)\n    - The home team is \"south dragons\" (home_team)\n    - The score should be a format where the first number represents the home team's points and the second number represents the away team's points. However, no specific score is mentioned in the claim, so we will compare scores for every match on October 26th.\n\n2. Compare each row of the table that contains matches from October 26th:\n    - Row 8: sydney spirit vs wollongong hawks (home team and score do not match the claim)\n\nNo other rows contain a match on October 26th, so there are no more games to compare.\n\n3.
