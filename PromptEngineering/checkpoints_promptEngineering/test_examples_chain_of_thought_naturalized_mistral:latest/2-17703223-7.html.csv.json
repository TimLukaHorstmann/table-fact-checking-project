    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify all rows where the snatch value equals 153.0, which there are none (as seen in Row 4).\n2. In the case there were any such rows, we would then check if their bodyweight matches the value of 104.70 from the claim. Since there are no rows with a snatch of 153.0, this step is not relevant in this scenario.\n3. Confirm that there are no missing or incorrect data points (empty cells or invalid values) that could skew the result. In our table, all required fields have valid entries except for a few clean & jerk and total values where \"dnf\" and \"dsq\" are used to denote disqualification and disqualified squat respectively.\n4. Compare the number of athletes with a snatch of 153.0 and bodyweight equal to 104.70, which is zero in this case, matching the claim.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify rows where snatch equals 153.0, find any matches with bodyweight of 104.70\", \"Confirm there are no missing or incorrect data points\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
