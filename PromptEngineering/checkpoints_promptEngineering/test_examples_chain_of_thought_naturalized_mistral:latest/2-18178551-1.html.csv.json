Determine the duration in months: Since there are approximately 30-31 days in a month, we can calculate the number of full months and any remaining days. In this case, it's around 5 full months (153 days / ~30 days per month = 5.09 months) and some remaining days which don't affect our decision since the claim doesn't specify the exact number of days.\n5.

So, there's a gap from 3rd December 2000 to 16th June 2000 without any match for England.\n2. Then, identify the dates where England does have a match. From the table, we can see that South Africa played against England on the 17th of June 2000 (Row 6). After this, there are no more matches listed for England in the given date range from 24th June to 30th June 2000.\n3. Lastly, compare the identified gaps and check if there is a gap that fits the specified date range of 24th June to 30th June 2000.
