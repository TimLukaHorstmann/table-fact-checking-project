This information can be found by looking for the date \"November 28\" and the opponent \"orlando\".

Find out the record of the team against Orlando by looking for the number of wins and losses when playing against Orlando. This information can be found in the \"record\" column, which indicates that the team had 7 wins and 8 losses (7 - 8) when playing against Orlando at the time specified.\n\n3. Compare the record found with the given claim to determine if it is true or false.
