Check for repeated entries: Since the claim states that there should only be one occurrence of Universal City with a rank of 9, we need to look for any other rows where the 'location' matches \"Universal City, California, USA\" and the 'rank' is 9 or greater (since lower ranks imply higher positions).\n\n4.

Identify the claim: The claim states that the number 1 rank amusement park was located in Orlando, Florida, USA with a value of 14721000 in 2009.\n2. Find the relevant entries in the table for locations 'Orlando, Florida, USA' and 'Anaheim, California, USA'. These are the potential candidates for the number 1 rank amusement park.\n3. Check the years specified in the claim (2008 and 2009) for both Orlando and Anaheim. No year matches exactly the years given in the table. However, we can compare the values for these locations in each year to determine if there was a change in rank between them during those years.\n4. Compare the values for Orlando and Anaheim in 2009. The value for 'Orlando' is 6095000, and the value for 'Anaheim' is 15900000 (rank 2). Since the number for Orlando is smaller than that of Anaheim, it's reasonable to conclude that Anaheim was ranked higher in 2009.\n5. To find the location with a rank of 1, we must check previous years since the ranks can change over time.\n6. Compare the values for Orlando and Anaheim in 2008. The value for 'Orlando' is 5297000, and the value for 'Anaheim' is 14721000 (rank 1).

The value is 15900000.\n   - For Lake Buena Vista (assuming all locations refer to this as it has the most entries): We cannot directly find the visitor count for 2009 because there are multiple rows with the same location name. However, we can compare the values across years and determine if any other location had a higher visitor count in 2009.\n\n4. Compare the visitor counts: Look at the visitor counts for each location in the table.\n   - In 2009, Anaheim has 15900000 visitors, while the highest visitor count for Lake Buena Vista is 17536000 (in row 2). This means that in 2009, Anaheim had a lower number of visitors compared to one of the locations labeled as Lake Buena Vista.\n\n5.
