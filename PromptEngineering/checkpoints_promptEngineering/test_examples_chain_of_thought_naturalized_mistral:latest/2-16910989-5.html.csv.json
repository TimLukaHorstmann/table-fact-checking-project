In Row 2, it's shown that Kristofer Martin received an honorable mention for best supporting actor at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo for his role in 'oros'.\n\n4.

Unfortunately, the table doesn't contain such information.\n\nAs the table does not show that Kristofer Martin won a second honorable mention for best supporting actor in 'oros' in 2013 (as claimed), we cannot confirm this claim with absolute certainty.

    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify all the awards won by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 from the table. The relevant rows are: Row 6 (Famas Awards), Row 7 (1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards).\n\n2. Check if these awards were based on a specific nomination for a show. In Row 6, the award was the \"German Moreno Youth Achievement Award\" and there was no nominated for column. In Row 7, the award was for \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching\" and there was no nominated for column as well.\n\n3. Since both awards won by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were not based on a specific nomination for a show, we cannot conclude that all of the awards won by him during this period were based on nominations for a specific show.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify awards won by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013. Check if these awards were based on a specific nomination for a show.\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n  ]\n}",
