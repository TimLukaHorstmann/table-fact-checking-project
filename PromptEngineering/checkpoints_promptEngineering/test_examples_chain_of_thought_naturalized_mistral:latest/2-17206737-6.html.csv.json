    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Examine the table for columns that contain information about the visiting team. In our table, there is no column explicitly listing the visiting teams. However, we can determine the visiting team by looking at the \"home\" column, as it lists the Montreal Canadiens when they were playing at home and other teams when they were away.\n\n2. Check each row to see if the \"home\" team is Montreal Canadiens. If it's not, then the match was played as a visit by Montreal.\n\n3. In rows 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13, the home team is Montreal Canadiens. This means that they were playing at home for these games.\n\n4. In rows 2, 3, 5, 9, and 12, the home team is not Montreal Canadiens. Since we have already checked the home games, this means that Montreal was indeed the visiting team in these matches (row 2 on December 4, row 3 on December 6, row 5 on December 11, row 9 on December 20, and row 12 on December 29).\n\n5. Row 7 (December 16) is a home game for Montreal Canadiens but it's not listed in the claim as a visiting game. Since we have already found matches where Montreal was the visitor, it is not necessary to check this particular match.\n\n6. To confirm that they were also the visitors on December 27, 29, and 30, we can examine the rows where Montreal is not the home team. In our table, only rows 2, 3, 5, 9, and 12 do not have Montreal as the home team. Since December 27, 29, and 30 are beyond the dates in the provided table, it suggests that Montreal Canadiens were indeed the visitors on these days based on the pattern observed (though we cannot be certain without more information).\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"1. Check for a column listing visiting teams; use the 'home' column to infer visiting teams when necessary. \\n2. Examine each row to see if Montreal Canadiens were playing at home. \\n3. If they weren't, they must have been the visiting team on that date. \\n4.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for this problem:\n\n1. First, we identify the total points obtained by Montreal Canadiens from the table.

Next, we need to determine how many games resulted in a total of over 40 points. In this table, only overtime (OT) games are counted as having more than 40 points (since the score is 4 - 3 or 5 - 2). We find that there were two OT games: Row 10 (Montreal Canadiens vs Carolina Hurricanes, with a score of 3 - 2 OT) and Row 9 (Montreal Canadiens vs Buffalo Sabres, with a score of 3 - 4 OT).\n\n3.
