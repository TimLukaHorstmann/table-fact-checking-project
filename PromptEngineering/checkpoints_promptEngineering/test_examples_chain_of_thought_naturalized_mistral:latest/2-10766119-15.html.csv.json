    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the teams mentioned in the claim: Essendon.\n2. Check each row of the table to find a match with the identified team (Essendon). The venue column is also relevant as we need to ensure that the game took place at Glenferrie oval.\n3. In Row 4, the home team is Geelong and not Essendon.\n4. In Row 5, the away team is Collingwood and not Essendon (however, this row should be considered since it mentions Glenferrie Oval).\n5. In Row 6, there's no mention of Essendon as a team but it mentions that St Kilda played at Junction Oval which is irrelevant for our claim.\n6. Since we didn't find any match with the identified team (Essendon) and venue (Glenferrie Oval), we can conclude that there's no game recorded in the table on 4 August 1928 at Glenferrie oval with a crowd of 10,000 attending an Essendon game.\n7.
