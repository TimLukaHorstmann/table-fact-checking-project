Parse the table for relevant information: Extract the row_index, column_name pairs for each instance where Detroit is the home team (Rows 2 through 14) and the score column contains a value greater than zero (the losing scores).

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column that represents the \"record\" for each team. This column contains a string in the format of wins - losses - ties - overtime losses, which represent the points gained by the team.\n2. To determine if there was a tie for the largest point gap twice during the season, we need to find two instances where the difference between teams' points (i.e., the number of wins minus the number of losses) is the same but the teams are not the same.\n3. Check each row in the table and compare the \"record\" values for different games. Since there are only 14 unique home teams and Detroit visits every team twice, we know that any ties in point gap must involve either a home team or Detroit.\n4. Look for pairs of rows where the difference between points is the same but the teams are not the same. In this case, the differences in points are as follows:\n   - Detroit's point gap changes from 24 to 25, then 26, and so on until it reaches 30 before increasing to 31. This means that the largest point gap for Detroit is 8 points (from 24 to 32).\n   - Among the home teams, Carolina's point gap changes from 12 to 13, then 15, and so on until it reaches 18 before increasing to 19. This means that the largest point gap for a home team is also 8 points (from 12 to 20).\n   - However, both Detroit's and Carolina's largest point gaps occur only once, not twice. Therefore, there is no tie for the largest point gap two times during the season.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the column that represents the team's record.\",\n    \"Check for pairs of rows where the difference in points is the same but the teams are not the same.\",\n    \"Look for this pattern among home teams and Detroit.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\" }\n  ]\n}",
