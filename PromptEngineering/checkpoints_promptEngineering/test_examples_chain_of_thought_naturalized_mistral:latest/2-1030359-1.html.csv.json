From the table, there are two such payments made to 'infotalent' and 'naviga capital'. Both have different amounts.\n3. Compare the amounts received by both these payees (infotalent and naviga capital) to determine which one is smaller. In this case, infotalent received EUR 59.7 and naviga capital received EUR 26.6.\n4. Since the amount received by infotalent is greater than the amount received by naviga capital, we know that naviga capital received a smaller payout in Euros.\n5.
