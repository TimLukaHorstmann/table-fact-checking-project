    "resp": "Here is the reasoning step-by-step:\n   1. Identify the person we are looking for, which is Luce Maced, from French Guiana. This information can be found by scanning the table for the name \"Luce Maced\" and the territory \"French Guiana\".\n   2. Once we have identified the correct row, we can find the birth date in that row. In this case, the birth date is listed as \"5-May-1886\", which corresponds to the 5th of May.\n   3. Compare the claimed birth date with the actual birth date found in step 2. The claimed birth date was \"2 May 1901\". Comparing this with the found birth date (5-May-1886), we can see that they are not equal, meaning the claim is FALSE.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify Luce Maced from French Guiana in the table\",\n    \"Find the birth date of Luce Maced in the identified row\",\n    \"Compare the claimed birth date with the found birth date\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"birth date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"claim\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
