Compare the equity shareholding percentage of MA Catering Sarawak Sdn Bhd with the equity shareholding percentages of all other subsidiaries found in step 2. In this case, the relevant cells are only row 11 and 9 (since these are the only subsidiary's equity shareholdings in MA Catering Sarawak Sdn Bhd).\n4. Determine if the percentage in row 11 is lower than any other percentages found in step 3. In this case, the equity shareholding percentage of MA Catering Sarawak Sdn Bhd (60%) is higher than the one found in Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (80%).\n5.
