First, observe that the claim involves two different variables: live births (which can be found in the 'live births' column) and migration (which can be found in the 'migration' column).\n   2. Check each row to find if there is a row where the value under the 'live births' column matches the number in the claim (43243), and also verify that the value under the 'migration' column of that row equals -14873.\n\n   The relevant cells for this task would be:\n   [\n     { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live births\" },\n     { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"migration\" }\n   ]\n\n   Final answer in JSON format:\n   {\n     \"chain_of_thought\": \"Check if there is a row where 'live births' matches the number in the claim (43243), and also verify that the 'migration' value of that row equals -14873.\",\n     \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n     \"relevant_cells\": [\n       { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"live births\" },\n       { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"migration\" }\n     ]\n   }",
