However, the table does not specify the conference of these teams. Since none of the teams belong to the Big Ten Conference, the question cannot be answered directly from this table.\n\n2. Note that the table only includes teams from the ACC Conference. Therefore, we will check whether there are any teams in the ACC Conference without any wins in the Big Ten Challenge.\n\n3. To do this, let's first find out which ACC teams have participated in the Big Ten Challenge based on their records against Big Ten opponents (as those games would be considered as part of the challenge).\n\n4. From the table, we can observe that:\n   - Clemson has lost 5 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - Florida State has lost 8 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - Georgia Tech has lost 9 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - Maryland has lost 4 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - North Carolina has lost 3 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - NC State has lost 8 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - Virginia has lost 5 games to Big Ten teams.\n   - Virginia Tech has lost 5 games to Big Ten teams.\n\n5.
