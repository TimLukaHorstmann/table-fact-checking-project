In row 6 and 7 of the table, the region is Australia which is not the United States, but they share the same date (June 7, 2008) as row 2 where the region is the United States UK. Since we are looking for the first release in the United States, it makes sense to compare these entries.\n4. We check if there's a difference in the label or format between rows 6 and 7 (Australia) and row 2 (United States UK). If so, that would indicate which one came first. However, both rows 2, 6, and 7 have the same label (Epic Records) and different formats (CD, Paid Download, CD respectively).

In this case, we have Sony Music Japan (Row 1), Epic Records (Row 2, Row 3 for US/UK), Sony BMG (Row 4 for Argentina, Row 8 for Indonesia, and Row 9 for Indonesia as a cassette release).\n\n2. Next, I will count the number of unique regions each label appears in:\n   - Sony Music Japan is only present in Japan (1 region)\n   - Epic Records is present in US/UK (2 regions) but not considered here since it's not Sony BMG\n   - Sony BMG is present in Argentina, Indonesia (CD release), and Indonesia (Cassette release). This means Sony BMG appears in 3 different regions. However, we don't have information about the cassette release region, so we can only confirm that it's at least 3 regions if considering only CD releases.\n\n3. The claim is \"sony bmg be the only label to appear in 4 different regions.\" Since we can see that Sony BMG appears in at least 3 different regions, this means that if another release for Sony BMG appeared in a different region (which we don't know from our table), it would contradict the claim. However, since there's no information about additional releases or regions for Sony BMG in our table, we can only confirm that it appears in 3 different regions according to the available data.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided data, the claim is FALSE because Sony BMG does not appear in 4 different regions.
