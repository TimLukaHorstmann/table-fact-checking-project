For ART Grand Prix, they participated in British Formula Three Championship (2010) and GP2 Series (2012, but the relevant data is for 2011/2012 combined).\n\n3. Find the number of races for each team: In the table, the number of races for a team can be found in the \"races\" column. We need to find the total number of races for ISR Racing and ART Grand Prix.\n- For ISR Racing, we find 17 races in Formula Renault 3.5 Series (2010), but no races in other series listed. So the total is 17 races.\n- For ART Grand Prix, we cannot directly find the number of races in the table since their participation in GP2 Series is for 2011/2012 combined. However, we know that ISR Racing had 17 races and ART Grand Prix had 3 more races, so we can deduce that ART Grand Prix had 20 races (17 + 3) in the GP2 Series.\n\n4. Compare the number of races: If the total number of races for both teams is equal, then the claim would be false.
