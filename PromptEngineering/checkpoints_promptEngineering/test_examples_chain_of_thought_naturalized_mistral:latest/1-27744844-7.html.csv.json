However, no player named \"the king\" is mentioned in the table. We should assume \"the king\" refers to LeBron James, as he is often referred to this way in popular culture.\n\n2.

Determine the metric of comparison: The claim is about the number of points scored by Beno Udrih in 3 games.\n3. Check the table for the total points scored by Beno Udrih: To find this out, we need to identify the rows where Beno Udrih is mentioned as the high points scorer. We can see that his highest number of points was 29 (game 38), 25 (game 5), and 20 on multiple occasions (games 11, 19, and 41).\n4. Find other instances where Beno Udrih played in the last 3 games: To do this, we need to find the most recent 3 games from the table. We can see that game 44 is the most recent one, so we will compare Beno Udrih's points from game 41 (the third most recent) and earlier with the possible high scores in the last 3 games.\n5. Compare the total points scored by Beno Udrih in the last 3 games with any other player's highest score in those same 3 games: To find this out, we need to identify if there are any instances where a King player scored more points than Beno Udrih in the games 41, 42, and 43 (the last 3 games).\n6. Check for higher scores from other Kings players in the last 3 games: In game 42, Tyreke Evans scored 35 points, which is higher than Beno Udrih's highest score of 29 (game 38). However, we need to check if any other player outscored Beno Udrih in the last two games (41 and 43). In game 41, no player scored more points than Beno Udrih. In game 43, Demarcus Cousins scored 27 points, which is less than Beno Udrih's highest score of 25 (game 5).\n7.
