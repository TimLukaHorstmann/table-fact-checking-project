    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the teams involved in the matches played on 29 November. From the table, we can see that Melbourne Tigers, Perth Wildcats, Adelaide 36ers, Gold Coast Blaze, Sydney Spirit, South Dragons, Cairns Taipans, and Wollongong Hawks all had matches on this date.\n\n2. Next, we need to find a match where Melbourne Tigers are the away team and Perth Wildcats are the home team. From the table, it is not immediately clear that such a match occurred on 29 November since the \"home\" and \"away\" team labels are not explicitly stated for each team in every row (only for South Dragons in Row 1).\n\n3. To find out whether Melbourne Tigers played as the away team against Perth Wildcats, we need to compare their respective scores on 29 November. If a team with higher score is listed as the home team and a team with lower score is listed as the away team in a row for 29 November, then they must have played each other with the former being the home team and the latter being the away team.\n\n4. We start by looking for rows where Melbourne Tigers scored less than their opponent (indicating they were not the home team). In Row 2, Townsville Crocodiles scored 113, which is higher than Melbourne Tigers' 105. In Row 6, Gold Coast Blaze scored 110, which is also higher than Melbourne Tigers' 88. Since neither of these matches involved Perth Wildcats, we can rule out those matches.\n\n5. In Row 7, Perth Wildcats score 95, which is lower than Melbourne Tigers' 103 (in Row 8). However, this means that Melbourne Tigers were the home team in this match, not the away team.\n\n6. At this point, we have not found a clear example where Melbourne Tigers played as the away team against Perth Wildcats on 29 November. Therefore, it appears that the claim is FALSE based on the provided data.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify all teams playing on 29 November\",\n    \"Find matches where Melbourne Tigers are the away team and Perth Wildcats are the home team\",\n    \"Compare scores to determine the home and away teams\",\n    \"Examine each match on 29 November for potential evidence\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\" }\n  ]\n}",
