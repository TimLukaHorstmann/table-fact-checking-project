In our table, the 'int 's' column contains the number of interceptions thrown by Sherdrick during each season.\n\n3. In row 12, corresponding to year 2005, the value for 'int 's' is 7 (cell with \"column_name\": \"int 's\", \"row_index\": 12).\n\n4. In row 13, corresponding to year 2006, the value for 'int 's' is 16 (cell with \"column_name\": \"int 's\", \"row_index\": 13).\n\n5. Comparing the values we found, it is clear that in the year 2005, Sherdrick had 7 interceptions and in the year 2006 he had 16 interceptions.
