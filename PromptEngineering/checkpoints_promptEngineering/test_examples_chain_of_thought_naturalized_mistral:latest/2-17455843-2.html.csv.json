From the table, we can see their match details as follows:\n   - Gateshead's game is against Halifax town (row 32) and Mansfield town (row 33). The first game ended in a draw (Halifax 2, Gateshead 2) and there was a replay (Mansfield 1, Gateshead 2).\n   - Newport county's game is against Dulwich hamlet (row 35) and they had a replay as well (Dulwich hamlet 4, newport county 1).\n\n2. The claim states that both teams have replayed their games and won.\n\n3. By looking at the details of their games, we can see that:\n   - Gateshead indeed had a replay and won their game (Mansfield 1, Gateshead 2).
