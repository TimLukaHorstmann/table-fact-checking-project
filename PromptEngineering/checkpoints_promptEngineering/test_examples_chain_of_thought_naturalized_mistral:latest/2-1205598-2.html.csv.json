The column \"media market ranking\" provides these values.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out the length of the streak for each city in the table, which can be inferred from the \"since\" column. Since all entries in the table indicate a consistent presence of both an MLB and an NBA team since 1996 or later, the streak length for each city is at least 25 years (as of 2021).\n\n3. Now, we compare the media market rankings of the cities and check if Denver has the smallest market rank among the four cities that have a streak length of at least 25 years.\n\n4. From the table, we can see that Denver has a media market ranking of 16, while New York has a ranking of 1, Chicago has a ranking of 3, and Philadelphia has a ranking of 4. Therefore, Denver has the smallest market rank among these four cities.\n\n5.

We need to find the smallest market rank to compare with the other cities.\n   - From the table, we can see that Philadelphia has a media market ranking of 4.\n\n2. Identify the teams (MLB and NBA) in each metropolitan area from the table. We need to check if all these teams have been active since 1996 or earlier, which is the earliest year provided in the table. This will help us determine the \"streak\" for each city.\n   - From the table, we can see that Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Denver, New York, San Francisco Bay Area, and Washington DC all have teams active since 1996 or earlier (except Philadelphia which started in 2010). However, Washington DC's NBA team, the Wizards, started in 2005. So, only six cities have a streak of at least 1996 (Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Denver, New York, and San Francisco Bay Area).\n\n3. Compare the smallest market rank (Philadelphia with ranking 4) with the other cities in our list to see if Philadelphia has the smallest market rank among the six cities that have a streak since 1996 or earlier.\n   - Yes, Philadelphia has the smallest market rank (4) compared to the other five cities (all have a market rank lower than 4).\n\n4. Finally, check if Philadelphia is among the four team markets with the longest streak with a team from the four major sports.\n   - Since we found that only six cities have a streak since 1996 or earlier, and Philadelphia has a smaller market rank than all of them, it means Philadelphia is one of the cities with the longest streak (and actually has the shortest market rank among this group).
