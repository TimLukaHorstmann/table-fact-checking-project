    "resp": "Here is my reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the NHL team associated with the Toronto Maple Leafs: The relevant cells for this step are Row 9 (player: dale smedsmo, nhl team: toronto maple leafs) and Row 3 (player: bill green, nhl team: university of notre dame (ncaa)).\n\n2. Check if any player from the United States attended Bemidji State University (wcha): The relevant cells for this step are Rows 9 (dale smedsmo) and 13 (jean - denis royal). Neither of these players have a college/junior/club team that matches Bemidji State University.\n\n3. Verify if there is any other player drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs who attended an American university: Since we have already checked all the players drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs, and none of them are from the United States (as they all play for Canadian universities or colleges), this implies that no player from the United States was drafted by Bemidji State University (wcha).\n\n4. Based on our findings, we can conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE: Since it is determined that no player from the United States was drafted by Bemidji State University (wcha), the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the NHL team associated with the Toronto Maple Leafs\",\n    \"Check if any player from the United States attended Bemidji State University (wcha)\",\n    \"Verify if there is any other player drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs who attended an American university\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nhl team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"college / junior / club team\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Find all rows in the table with college/junior/club team as Bemidji State University: There is only one such row (Row 9).\n3. Check if the nationality in this row is Canada: Yes, it is (Row 9: player: dale smedsmo, nationality: United States). This doesn't match the claim.\n4. Check if any other rows with Bemidji State University as college/junior/club team have Canadian nationality: None of the other rows with this university as their team are of Canadian nationality (Rows 5-8, 10-13).\n5. Since none of the players from Bemidji State University are Canadian, and none of them were drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs, it can be concluded that the claim is false.\n\n   Final answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim\", \"Find all rows with college/junior/club team as Bemidji State University\", \"Check if the nationality in this row is Canada\", \"Check if any other rows with this university as their team have Canadian nationality\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}]\n}",

Identify the claim to be verified: The claim is that a player drafted by the New York Rangers played for the team \"saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes\" in college / junior / club level.\n\n2. Locate the relevant rows in the table: We are looking for players who are defensemen, drafted by the New York Rangers and played for a team that matches \"saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes\".\n\n3. Examine each relevant row's data: In the table, we find one player (Jean-Denis Royal) whose team in the college / junior / club level is listed as \"saint - j\u00e9r\u00f4me alouettes\" and who was drafted by the New York Rangers (Row 13).\n\n4. Compare the claim with the table data: The claim matches the information found in the table for Jean-Denis Royal.\n\n5.
