    "resp": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to go through each row in the table to find the instances where a team scores 12.11 (83).\n2. In row 5, we see that the home team is St Kilda and their score is 10.14 (74), which is not equal to 12.11 (83).\n3. Now, let's check if this score appears as an away team score in the table. To do this, we look for rows where the away team score matches 12.11 (83) and compare it with the home teams listed in the table.\n4. In row 6, we see that the away team score is 14.14 (98), not equal to 12.11 (83).\n5. Now, let's look at the remaining rows where we haven't yet identified a match for the home team or away team score of 12.11 (83). We have only four teams left: geelong, essendon, collingwood, and Carlton.\n6. In row 1, we see that the home team is Geelong and their score is not 12.11 (83), so this can be eliminated as a possibility for the away team scoring 12.11 (83).\n7. In row 2, we see that the home team is Essendon and their opponent's score (Footscray) is not 12.11 (83), so this can also be eliminated as a possibility for the away team scoring 12.11 (83).\n8. In row 4, we see that the home team is Carlton and their opponent's score (South Melbourne) is not 12.11 (83), so this can also be eliminated as a possibility for the away team scoring 12.11 (83).\n9. Now only one team remains: Collingwood (row 3). Their opponents are Hawthorn, and we have not seen their score in the table yet. Let's check the next row (row 7) to see if it contains the score of North Melbourne, which is the opponent of St Kilda mentioned in the claim.\n10. In row 7, we find that the home team is Hawthorn and their opponents are Richmond, and their scores are not relevant for determining whether the claim is true or false. So, let's proceed to the next row (row 8).\n11. In row 8, we find that the home team is North Melbourne, but their score is not 12.11 (83), which is the score mentioned in the claim for the away team.\n12. Since we have checked every instance of a team scoring 12.11 (83) in the table and none of them match the given claim about St Kilda being the away team, our final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify instances where a team scores 12.11 (83)\",\n    \"Eliminate instances where this score appears as a home team score\",\n    \"Check if the remaining instances match the away team mentioned in the claim\",\n    \"If no matches are found, continue to check for the opponent of the claimed away team\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home_team_score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home_team_score\" }\n  ]\n}",
