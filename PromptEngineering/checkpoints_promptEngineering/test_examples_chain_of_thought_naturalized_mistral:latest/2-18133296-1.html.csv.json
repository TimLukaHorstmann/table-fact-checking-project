Find the relevant rows of the table: The numbers in the \"governments\" column correspond to the governments, so we need to find a row with a \"governments\" value equal to 31.\n3. Check the \"party\" column for the corresponding row: If the value in the \"party\" column for the row with \"governments\" equals 31 is \"kadima\", then the claim is true. Otherwise, it's false.\n\nNow, let's find the relevant row:\n- Since government 1 to 20 are listed and they don't match our claim of 31, we skip those rows.\n- Government 21 belongs to Benjamin Netanyahu from the Likud party (not kadima). So, we skip that row as well.\n- Government 22 belongs to Silvan Shalom from the Likud party (not kadima). We continue skipping rows.\n- Government 23 belongs to Tzipi Livni from the Kadima party. This is our relevant row!\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 23,\n    \"column_name\": \"party\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 23,\n    \"column_name\": \"governments\"\n  }\n]\n\nSince the value in the \"party\" column for row 23 is \"kadima\", the claim is true.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the claim: 'government 31 have the kadima party'.\",\n    \"Find the relevant rows of the table.\",\n    \"Check the 'party' column for the corresponding row.\",\n    \"Row 23 has 'governments': 31 and 'party': kadima.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"party\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"governments\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
