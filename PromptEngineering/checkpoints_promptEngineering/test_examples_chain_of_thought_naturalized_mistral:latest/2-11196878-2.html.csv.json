Identify Tony Mendoza in the table based on the information provided (record: 4 - 0, opponent: tony mendoza).\n2. Check the details of the event where Tony Mendoza was an opponent. The row with \"opponent: tony mendoza\" has the event name as \"wfc : rumble in the rockies\".\n3. Check if there's another event with the same fighter and a different time for that event. Since no other event matches with Tony Mendoza, we only need to consider the details of the first event he was an opponent (row 11).\n4. Verify the event time for Tony Mendoza by checking the \"time\" column in the row where \"opponent: tony mendoza\". The value is 2:41 which does not match with the claim's time of 2:49.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify Tony Mendoza in the table\", \"Check the details of his events\", \"Verify the event time for Tony Mendoza\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"time\"}]\n}",
