    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the claim which states that when M. Night Shyamalan is the director, the rank will be 7.\n2. Examine the table to find a row where the \"director (s)\" column matches \"M. Night Shyamalan\". The relevant row in this case is Row 7: { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\" }\n3. Check the rank of the movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan in the table. In this case, the rank for the movie \"Signs\" is 7, which matches the claim. The relevant row in this case is Row 7: { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"rank\" }\n4. Since both the director and the rank match the given claim, it follows that when M. Night Shyamalan is the director, the rank will be 7.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim. Find a row where the 'director (s)' column matches 'M. Night Shyamalan'.
