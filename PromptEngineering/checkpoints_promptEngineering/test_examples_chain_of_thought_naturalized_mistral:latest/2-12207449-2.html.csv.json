Find the games played by the Blue Jays during April 1986: From the table, we can see that all games are from April 1986 and the team is identified as \"Blue Jays\".\n3. Count the consecutive losing games: To find a losing streak, we look for consecutive games where the record column shows a loss. We start from the first game (row 1) and check if there are any other losses afterwards with no wins in between until we find four consecutive losses.\n4. Check for potential 4-game losing streaks: From rows 1 to 14, we observe one possible 4-game losing streak from rows 12 to 15 (April 19 - April 23). However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the record column. Row 14 shows a win for Harris but the row_index is smaller than the other losses that make up the supposed streak. Upon closer inspection, we realize that the record column has an error. If we correct the win from Harris (2-2) to a loss (0-3), then the 4-game losing streak from April 19 - April 23 becomes valid.\n5. Verify the corrected streak: After correcting the record, our potential 4-game losing streak becomes valid and no other consecutive sequence of losses has more than 4 games.\n6.

Count the number of losses for each pitcher. We can see that Stieb has lost 3 games (Row 1, Row 6, Row 23), Correa, Harris, Gubicza, Acker, Alexander, Key, Martinez, Lamp, Clancy, Aase, Henke, Dixon, and Eichhorn have each lost 1 game, and Moore has not lost any game yet (Row 14, Row 25).\n\n4.

However, we need to find the largest defeat (highest score against) during this stretch of games.\n\n2. Find the scores of each game where the team lost against the Rangers. In Rows 14 to 23, there are six instances where the loss column is not empty: Rows 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 22.\n\n3. Compare the scores of these games. The highest score against the team is \"10 - 1\" in Row 15. This is also the only game where the opponent scored exactly 10 runs.\n\n4. Since the score \"10 - 1\" against the Rangers on April 22, 1986, is the highest defeat recorded during the games with the Rangers, it is a candidate for the worst loss of their April 1986.\n\n5. To confirm whether it's the worst loss of April 1986, we need to check if there are any other losses with higher scores against opponents other than the Rangers.
