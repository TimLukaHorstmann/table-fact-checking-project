Next, we need to determine if this college has ever been a part of the AAC (NAIA) conference. To do this, we look for instances where this college is listed as a current member of any conference, and check if that conference is the AAC (NAIA).\n   4. In our table, there's no information about the past conferences of lenoir-ryne university before 1930. However, we know that it is currently part of the Sacramento Conference (SAC), which suggests that it might have been in other conferences before without being listed here.\n   5.
