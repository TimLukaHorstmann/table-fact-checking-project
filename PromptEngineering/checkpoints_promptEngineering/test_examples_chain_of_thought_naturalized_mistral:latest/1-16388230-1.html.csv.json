    "resp": "Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Count the number of times each ground is used. In this case, Football Park appears once and Waverley Park appears five times.\n2. Compare the count of each ground with the total number of games played. Since there are 7 games in February 1997, we compare 5 (Waverley Park) with 7.\n3. Determine if the ground used most often is more than half of the total number of games. In this case, since 5 (Waverley Park) is greater than 3.5 (half of 7), it means that Waverley Park was used more than half of the time for the games in February 1997.\n\nThe final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Count the number of times each ground is used\",\n    \"Compare the count of each ground with the total number of games played\",\n    \"Determine if the ground used most often is more than half of the total number of games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ground\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ground\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ground\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ground\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ground\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"ground\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
