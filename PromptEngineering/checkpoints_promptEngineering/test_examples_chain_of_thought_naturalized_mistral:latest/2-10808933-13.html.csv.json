Identify the game we are looking for in the table by comparing the teams involved, as the claim refers to \"South Melbourne (home team)\" and \"Hawthorn\" (away team).\n   2. Check each row of the table to find the matching game. In this case, Row 6 corresponds to South Melbourne vs Hawthorn as it lists them both as home and away teams respectively.\n   3.
