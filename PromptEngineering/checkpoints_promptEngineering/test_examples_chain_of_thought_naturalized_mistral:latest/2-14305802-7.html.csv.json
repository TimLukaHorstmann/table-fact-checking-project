    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the column name that contains the opponent for each game (in this case, it's 'opponent').\n2. Look for the row where 'march 24' is present in the 'march' column (since we know that this is the date for which we want to find the opponent). In this table, there are no rows with 'march 24'. However, the closest dates are 'march 15', 'march 16', 'march 18', and 'march 31'.\n3. Check if any of these close dates have the opponent's name in the 'opponent' column. In this table, the opponent for 'march 15', 'march 16', and 'march 31' are 'new york rangers', 'buffalo sabres', and 'vancouver canucks' respectively.\n4. None of these opponents match 'colorado rockies'. However, there is no game on 'march 24', so we cannot find the opponent for that date from this table. Since there's no exact match, it implies that the opponent present on March 24 is not listed in this table.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the 'opponent' column\", \"Look for rows with 'march 24' in the 'march' column\", \"Check if any of the close dates have 'colorado rockies' as the opponent\"],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"march\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}]\n}",
