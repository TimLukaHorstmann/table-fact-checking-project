Understand the claim to be checked: The claim is that \"vfl game 9 was held in New Guinea\". However, it's important to note that this question asks for information about the location where a VFL game was played, not the location where a player died.\n\n3. Search for any relevant rows with VFL games equal to 9: In order to determine if a VFL game was held in New Guinea, we need to find players who played 9 VFL games and check their information.\n\n4. Check if the \"location\" column of any row with 9 VFL games indicates \"New Guinea\": By checking each relevant row, we can determine whether there is a match that shows a VFL game was held in New Guinea.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, I found that there are no players with 9 VFL games, and their location of death is New Guinea.

We find 8 rows (rows 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16) with New Guinea as the location of death.\n\n4. Check if any of these players have played a VFL game by examining their 'VFL games' column. If they have played a game, that means New Guinea hosted a VFL game because someone who died in New Guinea has previously played a VFL game.\n\n5. Among the 8 rows with New Guinea as the location of death, players Alf Giblett (row 6), Jack Atkins (row 2), Tom Corrigan (row 4), Bill Cosgrove (row 5), Jim Knight (row 11), Alex Nash (row 12), Norm Oliver (row 13), Archie Roberts (row 15), and Jack Shelton (row 16) have played VFL games.\n\n6.
