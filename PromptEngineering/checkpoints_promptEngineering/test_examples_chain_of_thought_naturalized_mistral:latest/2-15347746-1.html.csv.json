Loop through the table row by row:\n    - For each row, compare the player name in the \"player\" column with the target player's name (Landon Cohen).\n\n3. Analyze the results of the loop:\n    - If a match is found, we can check the position and team columns to verify if they align with our claim (defensive tackle from Colorado).\n\n4. Finalize the answer based on the results:\n    - If the player name match exists and the position and team are both \"defensive tackle\" and \"Colorado,\" respectively, then the claim is TRUE.\n    - Otherwise, if no match is found or the position/team does not align with our claim, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells: [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"}]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the target player: Landon Cohen\",\n    \"Loop through the table row by row to find matches\",\n    \"Analyze the results of the loop and compare position and team columns with our claim\",\n    \"Finalize the answer based on the results\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team\"}]\n}",
