In the first row, the make is consolidation which is more than 1, so it doesn't match the criteria.\n4. From rows 2 to 7, the makes are schenectady and rhode island, both of which have more than 1 instance in the table. Also, none of these instances have a fleet number of 406. So, they don't match the criteria.\n5. In row 8, the make is alco - schenectady, but there are multiple instances of this make in the table. Also, it doesn't have a fleet number of 406. So, it doesn't match the criteria.\n6. From rows 9 to 12, the makes are all alco - schenectady, but again, they don't have a fleet number of 406 and there are multiple instances for each make.

In row 15, the make is alco - schenectady which is more than 1 instance in the table. Also, it doesn't have a fleet number of 406. So, it doesn't match the criteria.\n10.
