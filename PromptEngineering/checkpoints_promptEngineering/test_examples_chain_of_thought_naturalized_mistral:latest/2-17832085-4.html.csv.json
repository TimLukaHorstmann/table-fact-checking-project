To do so, we will calculate the total number of draws for all teams and divide it by the total number of games played by all teams (30 games per team * 16 teams = 480 games in total).\n3. After finding the average number of draws, we will compare it to the average number of wins. If the average number of wins is greater than or equal to the average number of draws, then it's more likely to win a game than to draw it.\n\nLet's calculate the number of draws for each team:\n- Teams with 6, 7, or 13 draws: cd constancia (row 13), cf calvo sotelo (row 7), c\u00e1diz cf (row 12)\n- Teams with 5, 8, or 9 draws: rayo vallecano (row 9), cd tenerife (row 8), real murcia (row 10), recreativo de huelva (row 11)\n- Teams with 3, 4, or 16 draws: atl\u00e9tico ceuta (row 14), melilla cf (row 15), cd badajoz (row 16)\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of draws and wins for all teams:\n- Total draws: (6 + 7 + 9 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 16 + 0) = 46\n- Total games played: 16 * 30 = 480\n- Average number of draws: 46 / 480 = 0.095833333333\n\nNext, let's compare the average number of wins to the average number of draws:\n- Number of teams with more wins than draws: 12 teams (all teams except for cd constancia, cf calvo sotelo, c\u00e1diz cf, rayo vallecano, cd tenerife, real murcia, recreativo de huelva, atl\u00e9tico ceuta, melilla cf, cd badajoz)\n- Total wins: 16 (H\u00e9rcules CF) + 14 (Algeciras CF) + 13 (Real Valladolid and Levante UD twice each) + 12 (for the remaining 9 teams) = 88 wins\n\nThe average number of wins is 88 / 480 = 0.183333333333, which is greater than the average number of draws (0.095833333333).
