The games are listed in chronological order by their dates.\n2. We start from the first row and go through the table until the row that has a date before December 18.

For simplicity, let's represent a win with \"W\" and a loss with \"L\". The results are as follows: L, W, L, W, W, L, L, L, W, W, W, W, L, W, L\n4. The question asks for a loss of 37-30 before week 16. Looking at the results, we can see that there is no instance of a loss with a score of 37-30 in the games from weeks 1 to 15.\n5.
