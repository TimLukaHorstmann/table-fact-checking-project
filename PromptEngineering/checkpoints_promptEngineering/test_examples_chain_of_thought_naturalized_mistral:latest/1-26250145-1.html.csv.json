However, we can infer that if she advanced to the Top 24 (12 women), then she was one of the performers in that round.\n\n2. Find out the order of her performance during the Top 24 (12 women). In this case, Didi Benami's song choice is 'The Way I Am', and her order number is 9 (in week: top 24 (12 women), theme: billboard hot 100 hits).\n\n3. Check if Didi Benami performed during the Top 20 (10 women). Since we know she advanced to the Top 24, and there are no explicit mentions that she was eliminated between Top 24 and Top 20, we can infer that she also participated in the Top 20 round. However, the table does not provide information about her order in the Top 20 round.\n\n4. Compare her order in the Top 24 with her order in the Top 16. If both orders were equal or less than 5, then it would mean that she performed at the same position or earlier in the Top 20 and Top 16 rounds. However, since her order in the Top 24 is 9, which is greater than 5, we can conclude that her order in the Top 20 round was more than 5.\n\n5.
