Check the table for any matches that have this exact score and can provide information about the surface. No such specific score is present in the table, so we cannot find an exact match based on this criterion alone. However, we can still make an educated guess by looking at the context of the matches with similar scores and surfaces.\n3. Notice that several matches have a three-set result, but they are not all identical to the claim's score. For instance, some have 6-0, 6-1 or 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 scores, which may suggest different surface conditions.\n4. Look for the closest matches in terms of sets and games won/lost. The matches with the most games won (6-4, 2-6, 3-6) are from tournaments with hard surfaces, but they do not have exactly the same score as the claim.\n5. Considering that the table only contains results for one particular player, it's possible that the surface can influence the player's performance in different ways on various court surfaces. However, since we don't have any matches with the exact score (6-4, 2-6, 3-6) on clay or other surfaces, we cannot definitively say whether this specific score occurs on a hard surface.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\"Identify the claim's score, Check for exact match in the table, Look for similar matches and their surfaces, Consider the possibility of different court influences on the player's performance.\",],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
