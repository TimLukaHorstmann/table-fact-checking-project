    "resp": "Here are the reasoning steps:\n\n1. Identify the constructors: From the table, there are 9 unique constructors - mclaren-mercedes, benetton-playlife, ferrari, arrows, williams-mecachrome, minardi-ford, sauber-petronas, tyrrell-ford, and jordan-mugen-honda.\n\n2. Find the cars that finished the race: A car is considered to have \"finished the race\" if it has completed its designated number of laps and has not retired due to any technical issue or incident. In this case, since all drivers have completed 78 laps (the race length), we can consider all cars as having finished the race.\n\n3. Count the number of constructors with more than one car finishing the race: To do this, we need to check if any constructor has two or more cars in the top 10 positions at the end of the race. From the grid positions, only Ferrari (with drivers Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine) and McLaren-Mercedes (with Mika H\u00e4kkinen and David Coulthard) have drivers in the top 10 grid positions. Since both cars from these constructors finished the race (as indicated by their completion of 78 laps), they each count as having one tow car to finish the race.\n\n4. Count the number of constructors with only one car finishing the race: Now, we need to find the remaining constructors that have only one car finishing the race. To do this, we compare the total number of cars from each constructor and subtract the number of cars that finished the race for that constructor. Since all constructors have more than one car in the table (except Tyrrell-Ford), all constructors should have at least two cars finishing the race if they had two or more cars participating. However, Ferrari and McLaren-Mercedes each have only one additional car beyond the ones that finished the race, so all other constructors must have both of their cars failing to finish the race.\n\n5. Conclude: Only 2 constructors (Ferrari and McLaren-Mercedes) had one car finishing the race each, while all other constructors had no cars finishing the race. Therefore, the claim is TRUE that only 1 constructor has a tow car to finish the race (in this case, it means that they had exactly one car finishing the race).\n\nRelevant cells:\n[\n  { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n  { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" }\n]\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify constructors\",\n    \"Find cars that finished the race\",\n    \"Count the number of constructors with more than one car finishing the race\",\n    \"Count the number of constructors with only one car finishing the race\",\n    \"Conclude\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"constructor\" }\n  ]\n}",
