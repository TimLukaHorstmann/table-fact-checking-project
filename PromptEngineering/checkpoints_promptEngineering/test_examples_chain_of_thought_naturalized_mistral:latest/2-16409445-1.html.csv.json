In this case, it is the dates from the table, as we are looking for the date when the New Orleans Saints had the least attendance of the season.\n2. Compare the attendance numbers for each row where the opponent is the New Orleans Saints.\n3. The lowest attendance number among these rows can be found in Row 10, which corresponds to November 9, 1997.\n4. Check if there are any other dates with lower attendance that do not involve the New Orleans Saints as opponents. No such dates were found in the table.\n5. Since we have identified the date (November 9, 1997) and match where the New Orleans Saints had the least attendance of the season, our final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify relevant dates for this season.\",\n    \"Compare attendance numbers for each row where opponent is New Orleans Saints.\",\n    \"Find the lowest attendance number in these rows.\",\n    \"Check if there are any other dates with lower attendance that do not involve the New Orleans Saints as opponents.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}\n```",
