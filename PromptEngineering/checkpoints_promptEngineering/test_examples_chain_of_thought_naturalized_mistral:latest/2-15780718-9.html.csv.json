    "resp": "1. Identify the team against which Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy played their highest rebound game. From the table, we can see that they both had their highest number of rebounds (14) in a game against Miami (Row 5: game 77, Row 9: game 81).\n\n2. Compare their individual numbers from this specific game. In Row 5, Michael Bradley has 8 rebounds and Jelani McCoy has 8 rebounds as well, but we are looking for the highest number of rebounds between these two players. Since they both have the same number of rebounds in the game against Miami, it means that neither of them has a higher rebound count than the other in this specific game.\n\n3. Evaluate the claim based on the comparison made above. The claim states that \"Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy (14) have the highest rebound against Miami\". Since we found out that both players have the same number of rebounds (14) in a game against Miami, but neither has a higher number than the other, it is incorrect to say that either one of them has the highest rebound against Miami.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the team against which Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy played their highest rebound game.\",\n    \"Compare their individual numbers from this specific game.\",\n    \"Evaluate the claim based on the comparison made above.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\" }\n  ]\n}",
