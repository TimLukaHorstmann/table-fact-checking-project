The players who appear more than once as having high points or high rebounds are Deron Williams, Brook Lopez, Jordan Farmar, Travis Outlaw, and Dan Gadzuric.\n2. Check if Travis Outlaw has ever led the team in both points and rebounds in a single game. This means we need to find games where Outlaw had the highest number of points and also the highest number of rebounds.\n3. Examine each row in the table to determine if Outlaw led in both categories for that particular game. From rows 2, 4, and 7, it is clear that Deron Williams, Brook Lopez, and Jordan Farmar had higher points than Outlaw in those games, so he did not lead in points.\n4. From row 7, we can see that Travis Outlaw had the highest number of rebounds (8) for that game. However, we need to find if there is a game where he also led in points.\n5. We cannot definitively say that Outlaw has ever led the team in both categories in a single game based on the given information because we don't have enough data about the other statistics (points and rebounds) of each player for all games.\n6.
