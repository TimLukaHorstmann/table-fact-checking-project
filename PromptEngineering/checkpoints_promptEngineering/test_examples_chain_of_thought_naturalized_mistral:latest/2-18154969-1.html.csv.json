Identify the key information we are looking for: We need to find out if there are any teams in the 2000 Macedonian Cup where the aggregate score is tied after two legs.\n\n2. Examine the table: The table represents various matches of the 2000 Macedonian Cup, showing the team names, the aggregated scores (agg), and the individual leg scores (1st leg and 2nd leg).\n\n3. Analyze the aggregated scores: In order to check if any two teams have a tied aggregate score, we need to find matches where the sum of the scores from both legs is equal for both teams.\n\n4. Find relevant cases: In rows 2, 5, and 7, we can see that some teams do not have an aggregated win or loss but instead have an 'a' notation. This usually indicates that the match ended in a draw after extra time (AEt) or penalty shootout (p). However, since we are only concerned with the aggregate score, we will disregard these cases for now and focus on rows 1, 3, 4, and 6 where the aggregated score is clearly displayed.\n\n5. Analyze the found cases: In row 4, Belasica (team 1) has a 7 - 1 aggregate against Bregalnica \u0160tip (team 2). This does not meet our requirement of a tie in the aggregate score. Similarly, in row 6, Vardar (team 1) has a 7 - 1 aggregate against Napredok (team 2), which is also not a tie.\n\n6. Draw conclusion: After analyzing all relevant cases, we found no examples of teams with a tied aggregate score in the provided table. However, we did find instances where the aggregated scores were not clearly displayed due to an 'a' notation.

Look for ties by examining games where both teams have the same score in the aggregate (Column: \"agg\") after two legs, as denoted by the \"(a)\" notation. Since ties are neither wins nor losses, we need to exclude these games from our count.\n3. Count the number of rows that do not have a tie and the team scored exactly 1 goal in the 2nd leg (Column: \"agg\"). This will help us determine if there are 6 teams with a score of 1 or not.\n4. Check each row to see if the team's score is 1 or not, and if it isn't a tie (since we excluded those games earlier).\n\nExplanation:\n- Row 1: Team 1 scored 0 goals, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n- Row 2: Team 1 scored 5 goals, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n- Row 3: Team 1 scored 3 goals, and the game ended in a penalty shootout, which is not a specific score, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n- Row 4: Team 1 scored 7 goals, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n- Row 5: Team 1 scored 4 goals, and the game was tied after two legs, so we exclude this game.\n- Row 6: Team 1 scored 7 goals, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n- Row 7: Team 1 scored 2 goals in the first leg but 1 goal in the second leg, which matches our criteria.\n- Row 8: Team 1 scored 8 goals, so it doesn't match our criteria.\n\nThere is only one team (Row 7) that meets our criteria, with 5 teams not meeting the criteria and one tie game being excluded.
