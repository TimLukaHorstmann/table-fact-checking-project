The earliest air date mentioned here is September 24, 2008.

Next, we sort the table by air dates in ascending order to easily identify the episodes in season 1.\n\n3.

Check if there is a consistent timeslot for the episodes of 'Gary Unmarried' throughout the given table. In this case, all episodes are listed with a timeslot of 'wednesday 8:30 pm', suggesting that it is a consistent timeslot for the show.\n3. To verify whether all new episodes air at the specified timeslot, we need to check if there are any gaps or inconsistencies in the timeslot across the table. In this case, every row has the same timeslot, so there are no gaps or inconsistencies.\n4. The claim states that \"all new episode of gary unmarried season 1 air on wednesday at 8:30 pm\". Since every row in the table represents an episode of 'Gary Unmarried' (from the show name) and all rows have the same timeslot ('wednesday 8:30 pm'), it implies that all episodes in the table are new episodes for season 1. As there is no indication in the table that any of these episodes are not from season 1, we can assume that they are all new episodes for season 1.\n5.
