Search for Speedsource's fastest lap: To find the first round where Speedsource has the fastest lap, we need to compare their fastest laps with other teams in each round.\n4.

Find the row corresponding to round 10 in the provided data: In the provided data, rows are indexed from 36 to 45, so row_index = 37.\n3. Identify the column names for pole position, fastest lap, and winner: The pole position is in the column labeled \"pole\", the fastest lap is in the column labeled \"fastest_lap\", and the winner is in the column labeled \"winner\".\n4. Extract the data for round 10 (row 37) based on the identified column names: From row 37, we find that the pole position is 99 gainsco / bob stallings racing, the fastest lap is also 99 gainsco / bob stallings racing, and the winner is 57 stevenson motorsports.\n5. Compare the claim with the extracted data: The provided claim states that 99 gainsco / bob stalling racing should be in both pole position and fastest lap but 70 speedsource should be the winner. However, from the extracted data, we see that 99 gainsco / bob stallings racing is indeed in both the pole position and the fastest lap, but the winner was actually 57 stevenson motorsports, not 70 speedsource.\n6.
