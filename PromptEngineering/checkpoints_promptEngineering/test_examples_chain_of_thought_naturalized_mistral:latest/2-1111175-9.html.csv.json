Identify the key information required to validate the claim: We need to check if Magdalena Maleeva's matches were only played in the \"world group i\" editions, as suggested by the claim.\n2.

Check for matches outside the \"world group i\" editions: From row 26, we can see a match played in the \"world group ii play-offs,\" which suggests that Magdalena Maleeva may have participated in an edition other than \"world group i.\"\n4. Verify if there are any additional instances of matches outside the \"world group i\" editions: Upon further examination, it appears that row 26 is the only instance where Magdalena Maleeva played in a different group (i.e., \"world group ii play-offs\").\n5. Compare the total number of instances in both groups: There are 7 instances of matches labeled as \"world group i\" for Magdalena Maleeva, while there is only 1 instance outside this group (\"world group ii play-offs\").\n6. Evaluate the claim based on the gathered information: The claim states that Magdalena Maleeva always plays in the world group i edition.
