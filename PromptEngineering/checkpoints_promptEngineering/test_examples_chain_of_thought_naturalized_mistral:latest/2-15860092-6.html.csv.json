Find the row numbers corresponding to these teams in the table. For CSK, it is row 1; for DD, it is row 2.\n3. From the given data, calculate the win percentage for each team against their respective opponents:\n   - For CSK (against Delhi Daredevils), lost = 8, tied = 0, win = 0, so win % = wins / (wins + losses) = 0 / (0 + 8) = 0%.\n   - For CSK (against all opponents except Delhi Daredevils), lost = 8, tied = 0, win = 40, so win % = wins / (wins + losses) = 40 / (40 + 8) = 0.8 or 80%.\n   - For DD (against all opponents except Chennai Super Kings), lost = 4, tied = 0, win = 60, so win % = wins / (wins + losses) = 60 / (60 + 4) = 0.9 or 90%.\n\n4. Since we are asked to find the average win percentage against both CSK and DD, calculate the weighted average using the number of matches as weights:\n   - Number of matches between CSK and DD is 1 (since there's only one match in our table).\n   - Number of matches for CSK against other opponents is 7 (CSK vs. KXIP, MI, RR, RCB, SRH, DC, and KTK).\n   - Number of matches for DD against other opponents is 6 (DD vs. KXIP, MI, RR, RCB, SRH, and DC).\n   - Calculate the weighted average: [0*1 + 80*7 + 90*1] / [1+7+1] = (0+560+90) / 9 \u2248 63.33 or 63.33%\n\n5.
