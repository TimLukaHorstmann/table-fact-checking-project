    "resp": "Here's the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the structure of the table provided. It lists the drafted players with their relevant details such as round, player name, position, nationality, and college/junior/club team (league).\n2. We are tasked with determining if 2 players were drafted in each round of rounds 3 and 9. To do this, we will count the number of players drafted in each round within these specified ranges.\n3. We scan the table row-wise and start counting the players in each respective round (3 and 9). For simplicity, let's categorize them as \"Round 3 Players\" and \"Round 9 Players\".\n4. Looking at Round 3, we find 2 players: Rob Bellamy and R.J. Anderson. Therefore, there are 2 players drafted in round 3.\n5. Moving on to Round 9, we count 3 players: Triston Grant, John Carter, and [empty]. Since the table does not list a player for row 10, it is unclear if there were actually 3 or 4 players drafted in this round (considering there are only 3 visible). However, given that we have found 2 players in Round 9 (Triston Grant and John Carter), the claim would be considered true as long as at least one more player was drafted in this round.\n6. Since the table does not provide all the information about each round, it is difficult to definitively say if the claim is strictly TRUE or FALSE based on the available data. However, we can confirm that 2 players were drafted in Round 3 and at least 2 players (potentially more) were drafted in Round 9.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Understand table structure\",\n    \"Count players in each round of interest (Rounds 3 & 9)\",\n    \"Find 2 players in Round 3 and 2 players visible in Round 9\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"Partially true\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"round\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\" }\n  ]\n}",
