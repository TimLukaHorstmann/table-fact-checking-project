Compare the claim (\"although michele alboreto have the fastest lap in the Italian grand prix, alain prost win the race\") with the findings from steps 3 and 4.\n\nThe claim states that Alain Prost won the race despite Michele Alboreto having the fastest lap. However, our analysis found that Gerhard Berger, not Alain Prost, was the winner of the Italian Grand Prix. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify race in question\",\n    \"Search table for identified race\",\n    \"Check fastest lap for identified race\",\n    \"Check winner of identified race\",\n    \"Compare claim and findings\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"winning driver\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"fastest lap\" }\n  ]\n}",
