    "resp": "Here's my reasoning process:\n\n1. Identify the region of interest, which in this case is 'lambayeque'.\n2. Examine the table column 'Percentage of country's population (%)', to check for the change in percentage since 1993 for the given region.\n3. In row 14, observe that the value in the column 'Percentage of country's population (%)' is '3.4'. This represents the percentage of the country's population that lambayeque region had at an unspecified time prior to 1993.\n4. Look for another row corresponding to lambayeque with data related to the change in percentage since 1993. However, note that there are no such rows in the table provided.\n5. Since there is no data available for the change in percentage of lambayeque region's population since 1993, it is not possible to directly compare the given value with another one from a later time period. Thus, we cannot conclusively determine if the claim \"lambayeque region have a 0.0 change in % of the country's population since 1993\" is true or false based on the provided information.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the region of interest (lambayeque)\",\n    \"Check for the change in percentage since 1993 for the given region\",\n    \"Find the initial percentage value (3.4) prior to 1993\",\n    \"Search for a row with data on the change since 1993, but no such row is found\",\n    \"Conclude that it is not possible to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"INSUFFICIENT_DATA\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"% of country's population\" },\n    // No other relevant cells since there is no data available for the change in percentage since 1993\n  ]\n}",
