    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game.\" So I need to check if there are four games where the opponents scored zero points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The relevant columns here are \"opponents\" and \"result\", but more specifically, I think the key is the \"opponent's points\". Wait, no, looking again, the columns are:\n\n- game\n- date\n- opponent\n- result\n- wildcats points\n- opponents\n\nSo the \"opponents\" column shows the opposing team's score. So for each row, if the value in \"opponents\" is 0, that means they scored zero.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Opponents scored 14 \u2192 not zero.\n2. Game 2: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 yes, one game.\n3. Game 3: Opponents scored 7 \u2192 no.\n4. Game 4: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 second game.\n5. Game 5: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 third game.\n6. Game 6: Opponents scored 6 \u2192 no.\n7. Game 7: Opponents scored 13 \u2192 no.\n8. Game 8: Opponents scored 6 \u2192 no.\n9. Game 9: Opponents scored 0 \u2192 fourth game.\n10. Game 10: Opponents scored 13 \u2192 no.\n\nSo the opponents' scores were zero in games 2,4,5, and 9. That's four games where the opposing team didn't score any points. \n\nNow, let me list the relevant cells:\n\n- Game 2 (row index 1): opponents column.\n- Game 4 (row index 3): opponents column.\n- Game 5 (row index 4): opponents column.\n- Game 9 (row index 8): opponents column.\n\nSo these are four instances where opponents scored zero.

The relevant columns here seem to be \"result\" and \"wildcats points\". For each row where the result is a loss, I should check how many points the Wildcats scored.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 1: Result is loss, Wildcats points are 7. That's exactly 7, which fits within the claim since it says \"more than 7\" isn't allowed in losses.\n\nRow 2: They won, so no issue here. We only care about games they lost.\n\nRow 3: Another win, so skip.\n\nRow 4: Win again.\n\nRow 5: Still a win.\n\nRow 6: Win as well.\n\nRow 7: This is another loss.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the wildcat lose 1 game in september and 2 game in november.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We're checking two things here:\n\n1. How many games did the Wildcats lose in September?\n2. How many games did they lose in November?\n\nI'll start by going through each row of the table to identify the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column, September is mentioned in rows 0 and 1. Let's check those first.\n\nRow 0: The game was on sept 20 against ole miss. The result was a loss. So that's one loss in September.\n\nRow 1: The next game is on sept 27 against cincinnati. The result here is a win, so no loss here.\n\nSo, for September, there's only 1 loss as per the claim.\n\nNext, let's look at November games. The dates in November are rows 6 through 9 and then row 10.\n\nRow 6: nov 1 against 18 alabama. Result is a loss.\nRow 7: nov 8 vs west virginia. Win.\nRow 8: nov 15 vs evansville. Win.\nRow 9: nov 22 vs tennessee. Loss.\n\nSo, in November, there are two losses: one on Nov 1 and another on Nov 22. That matches the claim's statement of losing 2 games in November.\n\nNow, let me make sure I didn't miss any other games in September or November that could affect this count.\n\nLooking again:\n\nSeptember (sept) has only two entries, both in row 0 and 1. Only one loss there.\nNovember has four games: rows 6 to 9 and 10? Wait, wait\u2014row 10 is on nov 22. So that's four November games, but looking at the results:\n\n- Row 6: Loss\n- Row 7: Win\n- Row 8: Win\n- Row 9: Loss\n\nSo two losses in November.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct: 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table represents. It lists games played by the Wildcats, with each row representing a game. The columns include the game number, date, opponent, result, points scored by Wildcats and opponents, and their record after that game.\n\nThe claim states that there are 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November. To verify this, I need to count how many games fall into each of these months.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n\n1. Game 1: sept 20 \u2192 September\n2. Game 2: sept 27 \u2192 September\n3. Game 3: oct 4 \u2192 October\n4. Game 4: oct 11 \u2192 October\n5. Game 5: oct 18 \u2192 October\n6. Game 6: oct 25 \u2192 October\n7. Game 7: nov 1 \u2192 November\n8. Game 8: nov 8 \u2192 November\n9. Game 9: nov 15 \u2192 November\n10.

Each month has the number of games as stated. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo identify the relevant cells, I'll look at each game's date to determine the month:\n\n- September: Row indices 0 (sept 20) and 1 (sept 27).\n- October: Rows 2 (oct 4), 3 (oct 11), 4 (oct 18), 5 (oct 25).\n- November: Rows 6 (nov 1), 7 (nov 8), 8 (nov 15), 9 (nov 22).\n\nEach of these rows has the 'date' column, which is how we determined the month.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 36 point\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions that the Wildcats outscored their opponents by 36 points in a game. I need to check if there's any row in the table where the difference between the Wildcats' points and their opponents' points is exactly 36 or more, because \"outscore\" would imply they scored significantly higher than the opponent.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has two relevant columns: \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\". I'll calculate the difference for each game by subtracting the opponents' score from the Wildcats' score. If any of these differences are 36 or higher, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Wildcats scored 7, Opponents scored 14. Difference = 7 - 14 = -7. That's a loss and not relevant since we're looking for when they outscored.\n2. Game 2: Wildcats 20, Opponents 0. Difference = 20. Not 36 yet.\n3. Game 3: Wildcats 20, Opponents 7. Difference = 13.\n4. Game 4: Wildcats 26, Opponents 0. Difference = 26.\n5. Game 5: Wildcats 14, Opponents 0. Difference = 14.\n6. Game 6: Wildcats 7, Opponents 6. Difference = 1.\n7. Game 7: Wildcats 0, Opponents 13. That's a loss, so difference is negative (-13).\n8. Game 8: Wildcats 15, Opponents 6. Difference = 9.\n9. Game 9: Wildcats 36, Opponents 0. Here, the difference is 36 points. This matches exactly what the claim states.\n10. Game 10: Wildcats 6, Opponents 13. Another loss with a negative difference (-7).\n\nSo in game 9, the Wildcats scored 36 points while their opponents scored 0, making the difference 36 points. That directly supports the claim.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion. The relevant columns are \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\". In row 8 (since rows start at 0 in the table provided), those two columns have the values that give us the difference of 36.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because in game 9, the Wildcats outscored their opponents by 36 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that the Wildcats kept the opposing teams' scores at zero in 10 games. So, I'm looking for any instance where the opponents scored points. If even one game has a non-zero opponent score, the claim would be false.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column is \"opponents\" which shows the points each opposing team scored in each game. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Opponents scored 14\n2. Game 2: Opponents scored 0\n3. Game 3: Opponents scored 7\n4. Game 4: Opponents scored 0\n5. Game 5: Opponents scored 0\n6. Game 6: Opponents scored 6\n7. Game 7: Opponents scored 13\n8. Game 8: Opponents scored 6\n9. Game 9: Opponents scored 0\n10.

This seems like a problem for the claim.\nRow 2: Game 3 - Win again with 20 points. Another instance above 7.\nRow 3: Game 4 - They won and scored 26 points. That's much higher than 7.\nRow 4: Game 5 - Another win, but they only scored 14 points. Still more than 7.\nRow 5: Game 6 - Win with 7 points exactly.

Let me double-check each row's date:\n\nRow 1: sept 20\nRow 2: sept 27\nRow 3: oct 4\nRow 4: oct 11\nRow 5: oct 18\nRow 6: oct 25\nRow 7: nov 1\nRow 8: nov 8\nRow 9: nov 15\nRow 10: nov 22\n\nSo, September has two games (rows 1 and 2), October has four games (rows 3-6), and November has four games (rows 7-10). The claim says September had four, which is wrong. So the entire statement is false.\n\nI think I got it now. The relevant cells are the dates in each row to count the number of games per month. Therefore, all rows have their 'date' column checked for the months.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were 4 games in September, which is incorrect as only two games occurred then. Similarly, October had four games and November had four games, contradicting the claim's assertion of two each.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It mentions two parts: one about a loss in November and another about losses in September. The claim says there was 1 loss in November and 2 losses in September.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, points, etc. My focus is on the 'date' and 'result' columns to verify the number of losses in each month.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Date is Sept 20, Result is loss. So that's one loss in September.\nRow 2: Sept 27, result is win. Not a loss.\nRow 3: Oct 4, result is win. Irrelevant for this claim.\nRow 4: Oct 11, result is win. Also irrelevant.\nRows 5-7: October and November games, mostly wins except row 7 which is Nov 1 with a loss. So that's one loss in November so far.\n\nWait, the claim says two losses in September. Let me double-check if there are more losses in September. Rows 1 and 2 are the only September games (Sept 20 and Sept 27). Only row 1 is a loss, row 2 is a win. So that's just one loss in September.\n\nBut the claim says two losses in September. That doesn't match; there's only one. \n\nLooking again at November: row 7 is Nov 1 (loss), and row 10 is Nov 22 (loss). Wait, I initially thought row 7 was the only November loss, but actually, looking closely, row 10 also shows a loss on Nov 22 against Tennessee. So that's two losses in November.\n\nWait, this contradicts my initial analysis. Let me recount:\n\n- September: Only one game resulted in a loss (row 1).\n- November: Two games resulted in losses (rows 7 and 10).\n\nBut the claim states \"loss 1 game in november\" which is correct because there are two losses in November, but the claim says 1. Hmm, no\u2014wait, the claim says \"1 game in november\", meaning one loss? No, actually, the wording is a bit unclear. The exact claim is: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" So it's saying 1 loss in November and 2 losses in September.\n\nBut from the table:\n\nSeptember (rows 1 and 2):\n\n- Row 1: Sept 20, loss\n- Row 2: Sept 27, win\n\nSo only one loss in September. Therefore, the claim of two losses in September is false.\n\nNovember (rows 7,8,9,10):\n\n- Row 7: Nov 1, loss\n- Row 10: Nov 22, loss\n\nSo two losses in November. The claim says 1 loss in November, which is incorrect because there are actually two.\n\nWait a minute, the user's initial response considered only one November loss but actually, row 10 is another loss. So perhaps I made an error earlier.\n\nLet me correct that:\n\nSeptember: One loss (row 1)\nNovember: Two losses (rows 7 and 10)\n\nThe claim says \"loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september\". Wait, no\u2014the wording seems off. Let's parse it again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant to say they lost one game in November and two games in September. But according to the table:\n\nSeptember: Only one loss.\nNovember: Two losses.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because September has 1 loss, not 2, and November has 2 losses instead of 1 as per the claim.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"loss 1 game in november\" (so 1 loss) and \"2 game in september\" which I think means two losses. But in reality:\n\nSeptember: 1 loss\nNovember: 2 losses\n\nSo the claim is incorrect on both counts because it's reversed. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Let me read it again: \"the wildcat loss 1 game in november and 2 game in september.\" So it says they lost one game in November and two games in September. According to the table, that's not accurate because they only lost once in September but twice in November.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there was 1 loss in November and 2 losses in September. However, the table shows 2 losses in November (rows 7 and 10) and only 1 loss in September (row 1). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the most the wildcat outscore an opponent be by 26 point\". \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about the largest margin of victory for the Wildcats. So they want to know if there was a game where the Wildcats scored 26 points more than their opponents.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, result, and both teams' scores. The columns are: game number, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents points, and record.\n\nTo find out the maximum margin, I'll calculate the difference between Wildcats points and opponents points for each game where the Wildcats won. Because if they lost, they couldn't have outscored by a large margin.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 1: Result is loss. So no need to consider.\n2. Game 2: Wildcats scored 20, Opponent 0. Margin = 20 - 0 = 20 points.\n3. Game 3: Wildcats 20 vs Opponent 7. Margin is 13 points.\n4. Game 4: Wildcats 26 vs Opponent 0. That's a 26-point difference. So this looks promising.\n5. Game 5: Wildcats 14, Opponent 0. 14 points.\n6. Game 6: Wildcats 7 vs 6. Only a 1-point win.\n7. Game 7: Loss, so skip.\n8. Game 8: 15-6, margin is 9.\n9. Game 9: 36-0, which is a 36-point margin. That's higher than the previous ones.\n10. Game 10: Loss, so no.\n\nWait, so in game 4, the Wildcats scored 26 points and opponents had 0, making a 26-point win. But then in game 9, they scored 36 against an opponent that also scored 0, which is a 36-point margin. So the claim says the most was 26, but actually it's higher.\n\nSo the maximum margin isn't 26; it's 36 in game 9. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the Wildcats outscored an opponent by more than 26 points in another game.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The key data points are the wildcats' points and opponents' points for each game where they won. Specifically, looking at games 4 and 9:\n\n- Game 4: row index 3 (since it's zero-based), columns \"wildcats points\" and \"opponents\".\n- Game 9: row index 8, same columns.\n\nThese cells show the margins of 26 and 36 respectively, which are crucial for evaluating the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the maximum margin was 26, but in game 9 (row 8), the Wildcats outscored by 36 points. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"wildcats points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponents\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
