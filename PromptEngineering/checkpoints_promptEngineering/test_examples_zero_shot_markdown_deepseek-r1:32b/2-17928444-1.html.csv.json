    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season, the team lose 5 more times than they win.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. The Broncos' losses are 5 more than their wins. So if we let W be the number of wins and L be the number of losses, then according to the claim, L = W + 5.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week in the season with details like opponent, result, etc. The 'result' column shows either a win (w) or loss (l). Also, there's a 'record' column that updates after each game, showing wins-losses.\n\nI should go through each row and count how many wins and losses there are. Let me check each week:\n\nWeek 1: Result is L. So that's one loss.\nWeek 2: Result is W. That's one win.\nWeek 10: Result is L. Another loss, total now two losses.\nWeek 11: Result is L. Now three losses.\nWeek 12: Result is L. Four losses.\nWeek 13: Result is W. Two wins now.\nWeek 14: Result is L. Five losses.\nWeek 15: Result is L. Six losses.\nWeek 16: Result is L. Seven losses.\n\nSo, from the results, I count a total of two wins and seven losses. Let me check the 'record' column as well to confirm. The last row has a record of 2-7, which aligns with my counts.\n\nNow, according to the claim, losses should be five more than wins. So if W is 2, then L should be 2 +5 =7. That's exactly what we have here: two wins and seven losses. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the Broncos lost seven times and won twice, which is indeed five more losses than wins.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Denver Broncos had 2 wins and 7 losses during the 1982 season. The difference between losses and wins is exactly 5, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim about the Denver Broncos in the 1982 season is true or false. The claim says they played at Mile High Stadium four more times than at the Kingdome. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table provided and count how many games were played at Mile High Stadium and how many were at the Kingdome. \n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Week 1: Played at Mile High Stadium.\n- Week 2: Also Mile High Stadium.\n- Week 10: Again Mile High Stadium.\n- Week 11: This one is at Jack Murphy Stadium, so not relevant here.\n- Week 12: Back to Mile High Stadium.\n- Week 13: Anaheim Stadium, so no.\n- Week 14: Mile High again.\n- Week 15: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, so that's a different place.\n- Week 16: Kingdome is the game site.\n\nSo, counting up Mile High Stadium games: Weeks 1,2,10,12,14. That's five games. The only game at Kingdome is Week 16, which is one game.\n\nNow, checking if they played four more times at Mile High than at Kingdome. If Mile High was used five times and Kingdome once, then the difference is four. So that makes the claim true because 5 (Mile High) minus 1 (Kingdome) equals 4.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm not missing any other games at Kingdome or Mile High. Let me go through each row again quickly:\n\n- Week 1: Mile High\n- Week 2: Mile High\n- Week 10: Mile High\n- Week 12: Mile High\n- Week 14: Mile High\n- Week 16: Kingdome\n\nNo other games at either location. So yes, Mile High was used five times and Kingdome once. The difference is four. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI think I've covered all relevant cells. Each game site in each row is important for counting how many times they played at each stadium.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Broncos played 5 games at Mile High Stadium and 1 at the Kingdome during the 1982 season.

The claim says: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season, week 12 and 14 both play at the mile high stadium.\" \n\nFirst, let me check what each part of the claim refers to. It mentions weeks 12 and 14, so I need to look into those rows in the table. The table has a column called \"game site\" which should tell me where each game was played.\n\nLooking at week 12: according to the table, that's row index 5 (since counting starts from 0). The \"game site\" for week 12 is mile high stadium. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, week 14 is in row index 7. Checking the \"game site\" column there, it also says mile high stadium. Both weeks are indeed played at mile high stadium as per the table. \n\nSo, both conditions of the claim are satisfied: both week 12 and week 14 were games at mile high stadium. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. The rows in question are row index 5 (week 12) and row index 7 (week 14).

The claim says: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season, week 1, 2 and 10 be play at the mile high stadium.\" \n\nFirst, I should parse the claim carefully. It's stating that in weeks 1, 2, and 10 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season, all these games were played at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details about the game, including the date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance, etc. I need to check for weeks 1, 2, and 10 whether the \"game site\" column says \"mile high stadium.\"\n\nStarting with Week 1: The first row (row index 0) shows that week 1 was on September 12 against the San Diego Chargers. The result is a loss, but more importantly, the game site is listed as \"mile high stadium.\" So that checks out.\n\nNext, Week 2: This is the second row (row index 1). It's against the San Francisco 49ers on September 19, and again, the game site is \"mile high stadium.\" So week 2 also meets the condition.\n\nNow, checking Week 10. The table has a row for week 10 (row index 3), which is November 21 against the Seattle Seahawks. The game site here is also listed as \"mile high stadium.\" That means week 10 was indeed played there.\n\nSo all three weeks mentioned in the claim (weeks 1, 2, and 10) had their games at Mile High Stadium according to the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo structure this into the required JSON format, I need to list each relevant cell that supports the conclusion.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with details about the Denver Broncos' games during the 1982 season and a specific claim they want me to verify. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season, the team lose 5 more times than they win in dec.\" So, the key points here are:\n\n1. The Denver Broncos' 1982 season.\n2. In December (abbreviated as \"dec\"), the team lost 5 more games than they won.\n\nI need to verify if this claim holds true by examining the provided table. Let's look at the table structure and the data it contains.\n\nThe table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific game in the season. I notice that the dates range from September 12 to January 2, so this spans across multiple months including December.\n\nMy first step is to identify which games took place in December. Looking at the 'date' column:\n\n- Week 10: November 21\n- Week 11: November 28\n- Week 12: December 5\n- Week 13: December 12\n- Week 14: December 19\n- Week 15: December 26\n- Week 16: January 2\n\nSo, games in December are weeks 12 to 15. Weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15 correspond to dates in December (December 5, 12, 19, and 26 respectively). Wait, actually, looking back:\n\n- Week 12: Dec 5\n- Week 13: Dec 12\n- Week 14: Dec 19\n- Week 15: Dec 26\n\nSo that's four games in December.\n\nNow, I'll check the results of these games to count the number of wins and losses. The 'result' column shows each game outcome as either a win (W) or loss (L).\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Week 12: Result is L 27-34. That's a loss.\n- Week 13: Result is W 27-24. That's a win.\n- Week 14: Result is L 16-37. Another loss.\n- Week 15: Result is L 10-27. Yet another loss.\n\nSo, in December (weeks 12 to 15), the Broncos played four games:\n\nLosses: Weeks 12, 14, 15 \u2192 3 losses\nWins: Week 13 \u2192 1 win\n\nWait a minute, that's three losses and one win. The claim states they lost five more times than they won in December. Let me calculate the difference.\n\nNumber of losses: 3\nNumber of wins: 1\nDifference: 3 - 1 = 2\n\nSo, they lost two more games than they won in December, not five. Therefore, the claim that they lost five more times than they won is incorrect based on this data.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other games. Are there any other games in December beyond weeks 12-15? The table includes up to week 16 (January 2), so no, only four games in December as listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they lost two more games than they won, not five.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that during December, the Denver Broncos lost five more times than they won. Based on the table, there were three losses and one win in December, resulting in a difference of two, not five. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"during the 1982 denver bronco season, week 16 have the least amount in attendance of all 9 game.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is about. It's stating that in week 16 of the 1982 Denver Broncos season, they had the lowest attendance among all their games that season. The table provided has 9 rows, each representing a different week from week 1 to week 16, but not all weeks are present here\u2014weeks 3 through 9 are missing. However, the claim is about week 16 having the least attendance.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check the attendance numbers for each week listed and see if week 16 indeed has the lowest attendance. \n\nLet me list out the attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 11: 47,629 (this is a lower number than week 1 and 2)\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 13: 48,112\n- Week 14: 74,192\n- Week 15: 44,160 (this is lower than weeks 11 and 13)\n- Week 16: 43,145 (the lowest number so far)\n\nWait a minute, the table only has 9 rows, but they span from week 1 to week 16. So, does that mean there are only 9 games in total for the season? That seems odd because an NFL season typically has 16 games. Maybe this table is incomplete or perhaps it's just showing a portion of the season.\n\nBut according to the claim, it mentions \"all 9 game,\" which suggests that they're considering all 9 games listed here as the entire season for Denver Broncos in 1982. So I'll proceed with that assumption since that's what the claim is referring to.\n\nNow, looking at each attendance figure:\n\n- Week 1: 73,564\n- Week 2: 73,899\n- Week 10: 73,996\n- Week 11: 47,629 (lower than weeks 1, 2, and 10)\n- Week 12: 73,984\n- Week 13: 48,112 (slightly higher than week 11 but lower than earlier weeks)\n- Week 14: 74,192\n- Week 15: 44,160 (lower than weeks 11 and 13)\n- Week 16: 43,145 (the lowest so far)\n\nSo week 16 has the attendance of 43,145. Comparing this with all other attendances in the table:\n\nWeeks 1,2,10,12,14 have higher attendances than week 16.\n\nWeeks 11 and 13: Week 11 is 47k, which is higher than week 16. Week 13 is 48k, also higher.\n\nWeek 15: 44,160\u2014this is lower than weeks 11 and 13 but still higher than week 16.\n\nSo week 16 has the least attendance in the provided table with 43,145. Therefore, the claim that week 16 had the least attendance of all 9 games seems to be TRUE.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Is there any other week with a lower attendance than week 16? The attendances are:\n\n73564, 73899, 73996, 47629, 73984, 48112, 74192, 44160, 43145.\n\nYes, week 16 is the lowest. So the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that week 16 had the least attendance in all 9 games of the season. Reviewing the table, week 16 has the smallest attendance number (43,145). Comparing this with other weeks' attendances confirms it's the lowest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has rows for weeks 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\n\nLooking at each row's \"game site\":\n- Week1: Mile High (Row 0)\n- Week2: Mile High (Row1)\n- Week10: Mile High (Row2) Wait no\u2014original table rows are from week1 to week16 in order. Let me recount correctly:\n\nWait, the table starts at week1, then week2, up to week16.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: week1 - Mile High\nRow1: week2 - Mile High\nRow2: week10 - Mile High\nRow3: week11 - Jack Murphy Stadium (San Diego)\nRow4: week12 - Mile High\nRow5: week13 - Anaheim Stadium\nRow6: week14 - Mile High\nRow7: week15 - Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\nRow8: week16 - Kingdome\n\nWait, no. Wait the table has weeks 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.\n\nSo Mile High Stadium is in rows where game site is \"mile high stadium\":\n\nRows:\n- week1: row0\n- week2: row1\n- week10: row2\n- week12: row4\n- week14: row6\n\nWait, that's five times? Let me count:\n\nRow0 (week1): Mile High\nRow1 (week2): Mile High\nRow2 (week10): Mile High\nRow4 (week12): Mile High\nRow6 (week14): Mile High\n\nThat's 5 games at Mile High.\n\nNow, the Kingdome is mentioned only once in row8 (week16), as \"kingdome\".\n\nSo, Mile High: 5 times.\nKingdome: 1 time.\n\nThe claim says they played 4 more times at Mile High than at the Kingdome. Since 5 - 1 = 4, this part is correct.\n\nNext part of the claim: \"2 times more than at Anaheim Stadium.\"\n\nAnaheim Stadium appears once in row5 (week13).\n\nSo, Mile High was used 5 times, Anaheim once. The difference is 4, not 2. Therefore, the claim that Mile High was used 2 times more than Anaheim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is false because while the first part about the Kingdome holds, the second part regarding Anaheim does not.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two conditions: Mile High Stadium was used 4 more times than the Kingdome and 2 more times than Anaheim. The table shows Mile High was used 5 times, Kingdome once (difference of 4), which is correct. However, Mile High was used 5 times vs. Anaheim's once, a difference of 4, not 2. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"During the 1982 Denver Broncos season, week 1, 2, and 10 were played with the lowest attendance at the Mile High Stadium.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. So, the key points here are:\n\n1. The team in question is the Denver Broncos.\n2. These games took place during the 1982 season.\n3. Weeks 1, 2, and 10 had the lowest attendance at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to list various weeks of the season with details like opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"week,\" \"attendance,\" and \"game site.\"\n\nI need to check each week mentioned (1, 2, 10) and see their attendances. Also, I should verify that all these games were indeed played at Mile High Stadium because the claim specifies that.\n\nStarting with Week 1: The attendance is 73564 at Mile High Stadium. That's a high number, so it might not be the lowest. Let me check other weeks to see which ones have lower attendances.\n\nLooking through all weeks:\n\n- Week 1: 73564\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 3 isn't listed here.\nWait, actually, in the table provided, there are only some weeks. Let me list all attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 73564\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 10: 73996\n- Week 11: 47629 (played at Jack Murphy Stadium)\n- Week 12: 73984\n- Week 13: 48112 (Anaheim Stadium)\n- Week 14: 74192\n- Week 15: 44160 (Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum)\n- Week 16: 43145 (Kingdome)\n\nWait, the claim is about games at Mile High Stadium. So I should only consider attendances from games played there.\n\nSo, let's filter the table to include only rows where \"game site\" is Mile High Stadium:\n\n- Week 1: 73564\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 10: 73996\n- Week 12: 73984\n- Week 14: 74192\n\nNow, the attendances at Mile High Stadium are:\n\nWeek 1: 73564\nWeek 2: 73899\nWeek 10: 73996\nWeek 12: 73984\nWeek 14: 74192\n\nLooking at these numbers, the lowest attendance is Week 1 with 73564. Then Week 2 has a slightly higher number (73899), followed by Week 12 (73984), then Week 10 (73996), and finally Week 14 as the highest at 74192.\n\nSo, among these, the lowest attendance is in Week 1. Weeks 2, 10, and 12 are higher than Week 1 but close to each other. The claim says that weeks 1, 2, and 10 had the \"lowest\" attendances at Mile High Stadium.\n\nWait a minute\u2014Weeks 2 (73899) and 10 (73996) are not lower than Week 1; they're higher. So if we're talking about the three lowest attendances, then Weeks 1 is indeed the lowest, followed by Week 2 and Week 12, but Week 10 isn't among the lowest\u2014it's actually higher than Week 2.\n\nBut wait, looking at all Mile High Stadium games:\n\n- Week 1: 73564 (lowest)\n- Week 2: 73899\n- Week 12: 73984\n- Week 10: 73996\n- Week 14: 74192\n\nSo, the order from lowest to highest is:\n\nWeek 1 < Week 2 < Week 12 < Week 10 < Week 14.\n\nThus, the three lowest attendances at Mile High are Weeks 1 (lowest), then 2, and then 12. So weeks 1,2, and 12 have the three lowest attendances. The claim mentions weeks 1,2, and 10. But Week 10 is actually higher than both weeks 12 and 2 in terms of attendance.\n\nTherefore, including week 10 as one of the lowest is incorrect because its attendance (73996) is higher than that of weeks 2 and 12. So the claim incorrectly includes week 10 as having low attendance when it's actually not among the lower ones at Mile High Stadium.\n\nHence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while Weeks 1 and 2 had lower attendances at Mile High Stadium, Week 10 did not; its attendance was higher than both. Therefore, all three weeks mentioned (1, 2, and 10) do not represent the lowest attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is about the 1982 Denver Broncos season, specifically week 16 having the least attendance of 74,192 in all 9 games. I need to check if this is true or false using the provided table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, there are 16 weeks listed, each with different dates, opponents, results, game sites, records, and attendances. The claim mentions week 16, so I'll start by checking row index 15 (since rows are zero-indexed in this context) because week 1 is row 0.\n\nIn the attendance column for week 16 (row 15), it's 43,145. Wait, that doesn't match the claim which says 74,192. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check: Week 16 is row 15, and attendance is indeed 43,145. That seems lower than some other weeks.\n\nNow, checking all other rows to find the lowest attendance. Let's list out the attendances:\n- Week 1 (row 0): 73,564\n- Week 2 (row 1): 73,899\n- Week 10 (row 2): 73,996\n- Week 11 (row 3): 47,629\n- Week 12 (row 4): 73,984\n- Week 13 (row 5): 48,112\n- Week 14 (row 6): 74,192\n- Week 15 (row 7): 44,160\n- Week 16 (row 8): 43,145\n\nLooking through these numbers, the smallest attendance is 43,145 in week 16. So the claim says week 16 had the least with 74,192, which doesn't match. Wait a second, maybe I misread the table? Let me check again.\n\nWait, row 8 (week 16) has an attendance of 43,145. The highest attendance in the table is actually 74,192 in week 14 (row 6). So the claim incorrectly states that week 16 had the least with 74,192, which isn't correct because it was much lower and week 14 had higher attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. The relevant cells include all the attendance figures to compare them and confirm the lowest was in week 16 (row 8) with 43,145.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that week 16 had the least attendance of 74,192, but according to the table, week 16's attendance is actually 43,145.
