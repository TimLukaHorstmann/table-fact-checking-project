    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"at kansas city chief be the opponent in week 14 with an attendance of 74524\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the Kansas City Chiefs were the opponents in week 14, and that the attendance for that game was 74,524. I need to check both parts of this statement against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a different week from 1 to 17, except there's no week 15, which might be an error or perhaps a bye week.\n\nI'll start by locating week 14 in the table. Scanning through the \"week\" column, I see that week 14 is listed on row index 13 (since counting starts at 0). The opponent for week 14 is indeed the Kansas City Chiefs. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the attendance figure for that same game. In the same row as week 14, under the \"attendance\" column, the number listed is 77,778. The claim states an attendance of 74,524. Hmm, these numbers don't match. \n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check. Week 14's opponent is the Chiefs, correct, and the attendance is 77,778. So the claim says 74,524, which doesn't align with what's in the table.\n\nHold on, perhaps there was another game against the Kansas City Chiefs earlier in the season? Let me check other weeks just to be thorough. Looking through the opponent column:\n\n- Week 1: New York Giants\n- Week 2: Arizona Cardinals\n- Week 3: Baltimore Ravens\n- Week 4: Kansas City Chiefs (attendance here is 75,037)\n- Week 5: Seattle Seahawks\n- Week 6: San Diego Chargers\n- Week 7: New England Patriots\n- Week 8: Oakland Raiders\n- Week 9: San Diego Chargers\n- Week 10: Washington Redskins\n- Week 11: Dallas Cowboys\n- Week 12: Miami Dolphins\n- Week 13: Seattle Seahawks (attendance 74,524)\n- Week 14: Kansas City Chiefs (attendance 77,778)\n- Week 16: Oakland Raiders\n- Week 17: Indianapolis Colts\n\nAh! I see that in week 13, the opponent was the Seattle Seahawks with an attendance of 74,524. But the claim mentions the Kansas City Chiefs as the opponent for week 14. So there's a mix-up here.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Week 14 opponent: Kansas City Chiefs (matches the claim)\n- Attendance for that game: 77,778 (doesn't match the claim of 74,524)\n\nAdditionally, while week 13 had an attendance of 74,524 against Seattle, not the Chiefs.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because although the opponent in week 14 was indeed the Kansas City Chiefs, the attendance figure does not match. The correct attendance for that game was higher.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states two facts: opponent and attendance for week 14. While the opponent is correct, the attendance doesn't align with the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
