    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"john brill be the only player on the list who play 2 position\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that John Brill is the only player in the list who plays two positions. So, I should check each player's position and see if anyone else besides John Brill has multiple positions listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with various details. The \"position\" column is where the relevant information will be found. Let me go through each player one by one to see their positions.\n\nStarting from pick 43, Stephane Morin plays center. That's just one position. Next, Jason Zent is a left wing\u2014again, only one position. Rob Zamuner is also a left wing. Moving on, Jason Cirone is a centre, another single position. Scott Pellerin is a left wing, same as before.\n\nBob Kellogg is listed as defence, which is singular. Louie DeBrusk plays left wing. Veli-Pekka Kautonen is a defence. Pierre Sevigny is a left wing. Blair Atcheynum plays right wing. Nicklas Lidstrom is defence. John Tanner is a goaltender, so that's one position.\n\nDenny Felsner is a left wing. Scott Thomas is a right wing. Wes Walz is centre. Now we come to John Brill at pick 58. His position is listed as \"left / right wing.\" That clearly indicates he can play two positions: left and right wing. So, John Brill does have two positions.\n\nContinuing down the list to check if anyone else has multiple positions. Jim Mathieson is defence. Murray Garbutt is centre. Jason Woolley is defence. Kris Draper is also defence. Corey Lyons plays right wing. \n\nGoing through all 20 players (picks 43-62), only John Brill's position entry includes a slash, indicating he has two positions: left and right wing. All other players have single positions listed without any indication of multiple roles.\n\nTherefore, the claim that John Brill is the only player on the list who plays two positions holds true based on the information in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"blair atcheynum be the first right wing to be draft 43 - 63\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says Blair Atcheynum was the first right wing drafted between picks 43 and 63. So I need to check two things: 1) Is Blair Atcheynum a right wing? And 2) Was he the first right wing in that pick range?\n\nLooking at the table, let's find Blair Atcheynum. Scanning the \"player\" column, I see his name at row index 51 (since rows start from 0). The position for Blair is listed as \"right wing\", so that part checks out.\n\nNow, I need to check all the picks from 43 to 63 and see if there are any right wings before him. Let's go through each pick in order:\n\nPick 43: Stephane Morin - center\nPick 44: Jason Zent - left wing\nPick 45: Rob Zamuner - left wing\nPick 46: Jason Cirone - centre (same as center)\nPick 47: Scott Pellerin - left wing\nPick 48: Bob Kellogg - defence\nPick 49: Louie DeBrusk - left wing\nPick 50: Veli-Pekka Kautonen - defence\nPick 51: Pierre Sevigny - left wing\nPick 52: Blair Atcheynum - right wing\n\nWait, that's pick 52. So before pick 52, from 43 to 51, were there any right wings? Let me check each position again:\n\nLooking back:\n- Pick 43: center\n- Pick 44: left wing\n- Pick 45: left wing\n- Pick 46: centre\n- Pick 47: left wing\n- Pick 48: defence\n- Pick 49: left wing\n- Pick 50: defence\n- Pick 51: left wing\n\nNone of these are right wings. So the first right wing in this range is Blair Atcheynum at pick 52. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are Blair's row (index 51) for position and all rows from 43 to 63 checking their positions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Blair Atcheynum was the first right wing drafted between picks 43 and 63.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"14 / 20 of the player pick 43 - 63 be of canadian nationality\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that out of players picked from numbers 43 to 63 (inclusive), 14 are Canadian nationals. So, my task is to count how many of these players have Canadian nationality and see if it matches 14 out of 20.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there are multiple rows with player picks ranging from 43 to 63. Each row includes details about the player's pick number, name, position, nationality, NHL team, and their college/junior/club team. The relevant columns here are \"pick\" and \"nationality.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying all players within the pick range of 43-63. Counting them:\n\nPicks 43 to 63 inclusive: that's 21 picks (since 63 - 43 + 1 = 21). Wait, the claim says 20 players, so perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the table rows provided:\n\n- Pick 43\n- Pick 44\n- ...\n- Up to Pick 63\n\nCounting each pick: from 43 (row 1) up to 63 (row 21). So, that's actually 21 players. But the claim mentions \"14 / 20,\" which suggests the user might have intended picks 43-62, as 62 -43 +1 = 20. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be 14/21. However, I'll proceed with the given range of 43-63 (21 players) but note that the claim states 20, which is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the table provided in the markdown, let me count the number of rows:\n\nRows from pick 43 to 63: Let's see. The first row after headers is pick 43 (row index 1), and it goes up to pick 63 (row index 21). So that's 21 picks total.\n\nBut the claim says \"14 / 20 of the player pick 43 - 63.\" That suggests perhaps a mistake, as there are 21 players in this range. Alternatively, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, looking at the table structure: Each row is a separate entry, starting from pick 43 up to 63. So that's 21 rows (picks 43-63 inclusive). Therefore, there are 21 players in this range, not 20 as stated in the claim.\n\nThis discrepancy might affect whether the answer is TRUE or FALSE because if the denominator is incorrect, even if 14 are Canadian, it's over 21, not 20. So, perhaps I need to check both interpretations: maybe the user meant picks 43-62 (which would be 20) or they made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table in reality has only 20 players between 43-62, but the provided data includes pick 63 as well. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here because according to the markdown table given, there are picks from 43 to 63, which is 21 players.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all the picks:\n\nPick numbers in the table: 43,44,... up to 63. So that's 21 picks (since 63-43=20; 20+1=21). Therefore, there are 21 players in this range.\n\nBut the claim is about 14 out of 20. That suggests either a mistake in the claim or perhaps I need to adjust my counting.\n\nWait, maybe I should proceed by considering both scenarios:\n\n1. Check how many Canadians there are among picks 43-63 (21 players) and see if it's 14.\n2. Alternatively, check if the intended range is 43-62, which would be 20 picks.\n\nBut since the claim explicitly says \"pick 43 - 63,\" I think I should go with that as 21 players.\n\nSo, moving forward: Count how many of these 21 players are Canadian.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1 (Pick 43): Nationality is Canada\nRow 2 (Pick 44): Canada\nRow 3 (45): US\nRow 4 (46): Sweden\nRow 5 (47): Canada\nRow 6 (48): Czech Republic\nRow 7 (49): Finland\nRow 8 (50): Canada\nRow 9 (51): Slovakia\nRow 10 (52): Canada\nRow 11 (53): Switzerland\nRow 12 (54): Sweden\nRow 13 (55): Canada\nRow 14 (56): Czech Republic\nRow 15 (57): Finland\nRow 16 (58): US\nRow 17 (59): Canada\nRow 18 (60): Russia\nRow 19 (61): Sweden\nRow 20 (62): Canada\nRow 21 (63): Canada\n\nNow, let's count the number of Canadians:\n\nPick 43: Yes\n44: Yes\n45: No\n46: No\n47: Yes\n48: No\n49: No\n50: Yes\n51: No\n52: Yes\n53: No\n54: No\n55: Yes\n56: No\n57: No\n58: No\n59: Yes\n60: No\n61: No\n62: Yes\n63: Yes\n\nCounting the \"Yes\"es:\n\nPicks 43,44,47,50,52,55,59,62,63. Wait, that's 9? Hmm, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, let me recount from the list above:\n\nRow 1: Yes (43)\nRow 2: Yes (44)\nRow 5: Yes (47)\nRow 8: Yes (50)\nRow 10: Yes (52)\nRow 13: Yes (55)\nRow 17: Yes (59)\nRow 20: Yes (62)\nRow 21: Yes (63)\n\nSo that's 9 Canadian players out of 21.\n\nBut the claim is 14/20. So, even if we consider picks 43-62 (20 players), let me check:\n\nPicks 43 to 62 (rows 1-20):\n\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 8: Yes\nRow 10: Yes\nRow 13: Yes\nRow 17: Yes\nRow 20: Yes\n\nThat's 8 Canadians out of 20.\n\nWait, that doesn't match either. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me list all the nationalities again:\n\nPick 43: Canada (Yes)\n44: Canada (Yes)\n45: US\n46: Sweden\n47: Canada (Yes)\n48: Czech Republic\n49: Finland\n50: Canada (Yes)\n51: Slovakia\n52: Canada (Yes)\n53: Switzerland\n54: Sweden\n55: Canada (Yes)\n56: Czech Republic\n57: Finland\n58: US\n59: Canada (Yes)\n60: Russia\n61: Sweden\n62: Canada (Yes)\n\nSo from 43 to 62, that's 20 picks. Number of Canadians:\n\n43,44,47,50,52,55,59,62 => 8.\n\nWait, that's only 8, not 14.\n\nBut the claim says 14/20 are Canadian. That would mean a majority, but in reality, it's 8 out of 20.\n\nSo, unless I made a mistake in counting, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the nationalities. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 1: Pick 43 - Nationality: Canada (Yes)\nRow 2: 44 - Canada (Yes)\nRow 3: 45 - US\nRow 4:46 - Sweden\nRow 5:47 - Canada (Yes)\nRow6:48- Czech Republic\nRow7:49- Finland\nRow8:50-Canada (Yes)\nRow9:51-Slovakia\nRow10:52-Canada (Yes)\nRow11:53-Switzerland\nRow12:54-Sweden\nRow13:55-Canada (Yes)\nRow14:56-Czech Republic\nRow15:57-Finland\nRow16:58-US\nRow17:59-Canada (Yes)\nRow18:60-Russia\nRow19:61-Sweden\nRow20:62-Canada (Yes)\n\nSo, from 43 to 62 (rows1-20):\n\nCanadians at rows1,2,5,8,10,13,17,20 => 8.\n\nHence, 8/20 are Canadian. So the claim of 14/20 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that 14 out of 20 players from picks 43 to 63 are Canadian is false. Upon examining each pick, only 8 out of these 20 selections are Canadian. Therefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

Scanning through each player's position:\n\n- Row 0: center\n- Row 1: left wing\n- Row 2: left wing\n- Row 3: centre\n- Row 4: left wing\n- Row 5: defence\n- Row 6: left wing\n- Row 7: defence\n- Row 8: left wing\n- Row 9: right wing\n- Row 10: defence\n- Row 11: goaltender\n- Row 12: left wing\n- Row 13: centre\n- Row 14: left wing\n- Row 15: right wing\n- Row 16: centre\n- Row 17: left / right wing (John Brill)\n- Row 18: defence\n- Row 19: centre\n- Row 20: defence\n\nIt looks like most players have a single position, except for John Brill who has two positions. None of the other players list three or more positions.\n\nTherefore, since John Brill is the only player with multiple positions (two), and no one else has three positions, the claim that he's the only one playing three positions is incorrect. The correct answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 57, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"14 / 20 of the player pick 43 - 63 be of swedish nationality\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It's stating that out of 20 players picked from number 43 to 63, 14 are Swedish nationals.\n\nWait, but looking at the table, the picks start at 43 and go up to 63. Let me count how many rows there are between pick 43 and 63 inclusive. The table starts at row index 0 with pick 43 (Stephane Morin) and ends at row 19 with pick 62 (Kris Draper). Then, the next pick is 63 (Corey Lyons) at row 20. So from pick 43 to 63, there are 21 players in total, not 20 as the claim suggests.\n\nHmm, maybe I miscounted. Let's list out the picks: 43 to 63 inclusive is 63 - 43 + 1 = 21 picks. So the claim mentions 20 players, but there are actually 21. That might be a discrepancy, but perhaps the user made a typo or miscounted.\n\nNow, I'll proceed by checking each player's nationality from pick 43 (row index 0) to pick 63 (row index 20). Let me go through each row and note their nationalities:\n\n1. Row 0: Stephane Morin - Canada\n2. Row 1: Jason Zent - United States\n3. Row 2: Rob Zamuner - Canada\n4. Row 3: Jason Cirone - Canada\n5. Row 4: Scott Pellerin - Canada\n6. Row 5: Bob Kellogg - United States\n7. Row 6: Louie DeBrusk - Canada\n8. Row 7: Veli-Pekka Kautonen - Finland\n9. Row 8: Pierre Sevigny - Canada\n10. Row 9: Blair Atcheynum - Canada\n11. Row 10: Nicklas Lidstrom - Sweden (this is one)\n12. Row 11: John Tanner - Canada\n13. Row 12: Denny Felsner - United States\n14. Row 13: Scott Thomas - United States\n15. Row 14: Wes Walz - Canada\n16. Row 15: John Brill - United States\n17. Row 16: Jim Mathieson - Canada\n18. Row 17: Murray Garbutt - Canada\n19. Row 18: Jason Woolley - Canada\n20. Row 19: Kris Draper - Canada\nWait, row index 20 is actually pick 63, which is Corey Lyons, right? So I think I might have missed that last one.\n\nLet me recount properly:\n\nRows 0 to 20 (inclusive) correspond to picks 43-63. Let's list all of them:\n\nRow 0: Canada\nRow 1: United States\nRow 2: Canada\nRow 3: Canada\nRow 4: Canada\nRow 5: United States\nRow 6: Canada\nRow 7: Finland\nRow 8: Canada\nRow 9: Canada\nRow 10: Sweden (Nicklas Lidstrom)\nRow 11: Canada\nRow 12: United States\nRow 13: United States\nRow 14: Canada\nRow 15: United States\nRow 16: Canada\nRow 17: Canada\nRow 18: Canada\nRow 19: Canada\nRow 20: Canada (Corey Lyons)\n\nWait, in the original table provided, row index 20 is pick 63: Corey Lyons, nationality Canada.\n\nSo from all these rows, only Row 10 has a Swedish nationality. So that's just one player, Nicklas Lidstrom.\n\nThe claim says 14 out of 20 are Swedish, but actually, there's only 1 out of 21 (or 1 out of 20 if considering the first 20 picks). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nI need to collect the relevant cells where nationality is checked. Each row from 0 to 20 has a \"nationality\" column, so each of those rows is relevant because we had to check each one's nationality to count how many are Swedish.\n\nSo the answer is FALSE, and all rows 0-20 in the \"Nationality\" column were examined.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that 14 out of 20 players from picks 43 to 63 are Swedish is incorrect. Only Nicklas Lidstrom (row index 10) is Swedish among these 21 players.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Nationality\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like pick number, player name, position, nationality, NHL team, and college/junior/club team. The claim mentions Blair Atcheynum being the first centre drafted between picks 43 to 63. So my main focus should be on the 'position' column for players in that range.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row from pick 43 up to 63. Let's list out the positions of these players:\n\n- Pick 43: Stephane Morin, position is center.\n- Pick 44: Jason Zent, left wing.\n- Pick 45: Rob Zamuner, left wing.\n- Pick 46: Jason Cirone, centre (same as center).\n- Pick 47: Scott Pellerin, left wing.\n- Pick 48: Bob Kellogg, defence.\n- Pick 49: Louie DeBrusk, left wing.\n- Pick 50: Veli-Pekka Kautonen, defence.\n- Pick 51: Pierre Sevigny, left wing.\n- Pick 52: Blair Atcheynum, right wing.\n- Pick 53: Nicklas Lidstrom, defence.\n- Pick 54: John Tanner, goaltender.\n- Pick 55: Denny Felsner, left wing.\n- Pick 56: Scott Thomas, right wing.\n- Pick 57: Wes Walz, centre.\n- Pick 58: John Brill, left/right wing.\n- Pick 59: Jim Mathieson, defence.\n- Pick 60: Murray Garbutt, centre.\n- Pick 61: Jason Woolley, defence.\n- Pick 62: Kris Draper, defence.\n- Pick 63: Corey Lyons, right wing.\n\nNow, the claim says Blair Atcheynum is the first center in picks 43-63. From the list above, I see that Stephane Morin at pick 43 is a center. Since 43 is within the range and he's a center, he would be the first one before Blair Atcheynum. Then, there are other centers like Jason Cirone (46), Wes Walz (57), and Murray Garbutt (60).\n\nBlair Atcheynum is at pick 52, position right wing, so he's not a center. Therefore, the first center in this range isn't Blair; it's Stephane Morin. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nLooking back, relevant cells are Stephane Morin's row (row index 0), his position as center, and Blair Atcheynum's row (row index 9) where his position is right wing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"50% of the player draft 43 - 63 in 1989 be male\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions a percentage (50%) of players drafted from pick numbers 43 to 63 in 1989 being male. So, my first task is to identify how many players are in this range and then determine their genders.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's sorted by 'pick' number, starting at 43 and going up to 63. That means all these entries fall within the specified draft picks. The table has rows from pick 43 (Stephane Morin) to pick 63 (Corey Lyons). Let me count how many players there are here.\n\nCounting each row, starting at 43 and ending at 63: that's a total of 21 players because 63 minus 43 plus 1 equals 21. So, 21 players in total.\n\nNow, the claim is about whether 50% are male. Well, all human beings listed here would be male unless otherwise specified. But looking through the names and nationalities, I don't see any female names or indicators of gender beyond typical first names. For example, names like Jason, Rob, Scott, etc., are typically male names.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let me check each player's name in the 'player' column:\n\n1. Stephane Morin - Male\n2. Jason Zent - Male\n3. Rob Zamuner - Male\n4. Jason Cirone - Male\n5. Scott Pellerin - Male\n6. Bob Kellogg - Male\n7. Louie DeBrusk - Male\n8. Veli-Pekka Kautonen - Male\n9. Pierre Sevigny - Male\n10. Blair Atcheynum - Male\n11. Nicklas Lidstrom - Male\n12. John Tanner - Male\n13. Denny Felsner - Male\n14. Scott Thomas - Male\n15. Wes Walz - Male\n16. John Brill - Male\n17. Jim Mathieson - Male\n18. Murray Garbutt - Male\n19. Jason Woolley - Male\n20. Kris Draper - Male\n21. Corey Lyons - Male\n\nAll 21 players listed are male. So, the percentage of males is 100%, not 50%. The claim states that 50% should be male, but in reality, all are male.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because it's incorrect to say only half are male when, in fact, all are.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells. To verify the claim, I needed two pieces of information for each player: their pick number and gender (though gender isn't explicitly listed). Since gender isn't directly provided, I inferred it from the names. However, based on the table's structure, the 'player' column contains the names, which are indicative of gender. So, the relevant cells would be all the rows under the 'player' column because each player is male.\n\nBut wait, the claim refers to draft picks 43-63, so I also need to confirm that we're looking at the correct range. The 'pick' column provides this information, but since all entries are within 43-63 and we've established they're all male, perhaps focusing on the 'player' column suffices.\n\nHowever, the instruction says to check each condition against the table. So I need to identify which cells were relevant in determining the answer. For each player from pick 43 to 63, their gender is inferred from their names, which are in the 'player' column of each row. Therefore, all rows (each player's 'player' cell) are relevant because they confirm that each is male.\n\nSo, compiling this, the relevant cells would be every row from 0 to 20 (since pick 43 is row 0 and pick 63 is row 20), each under the 'player' column.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we examine the players drafted between picks 43 and 63. There are 21 players in total, all male based on their names. Since the claim states that 50% should be male, but all are male, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
