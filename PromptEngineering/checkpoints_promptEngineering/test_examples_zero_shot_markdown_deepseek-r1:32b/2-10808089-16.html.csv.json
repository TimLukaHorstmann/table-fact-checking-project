    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"on august 13th, 1966, the away team be north melbourne, while the home team be collingwood.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like 'home team', 'away team', 'date', and others. My focus is on these three: home team, away team, and date.\n\nI need to check each row for the date \"13 august 1966\" because that's when the claim states the event occurred. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Home team is St Kilda, away team is South Melbourne, date is 13 August 1966.\nRow 1: Essendon vs Fitzroy on the same date.\nRow 2: Collingwood as home team against North Melbourne on 13 August 1966. This looks relevant because Collingwood is the home team and North Melbourne is the away team, which matches the claim.\nRow 3: Carlton vs Melbourne on the same date.\nRow 4: Richmond vs Geelong, also on that date.\nRow 5: Hawthorn vs Footscray.\n\nSo in row index 2, Collingwood is indeed the home team and North Melbourne is the away team on August 13th, 1966. \n\nNow, I need to make sure there's no other row with the same combination but different details. Scanning through, all other rows have different teams, so this seems unique.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are in row index 2 for both 'home team' and 'away team', as well as the date column to confirm it's August 13th.\n</think>\n\nThe claim matches the data in the table where Collingwood is the home team and North Melbourne is the away team on August 13, 1966.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
