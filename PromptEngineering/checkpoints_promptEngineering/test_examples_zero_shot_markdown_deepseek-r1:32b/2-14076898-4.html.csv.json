    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"there be only 2 occasions when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 - 25 and 36 - 29.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is asserting. The claim mentions two conditions:\n1. Teams that drew (so looking at the 'drawn' column).\n2. These teams have specific goal differences: 34-25 and 36-29.\n\nSo, my approach will be:\n- Identify all rows where a team drew.\n- Check how many such rows there are.\n- For each of these rows, look at their goal difference.\n- Verify if the goal differences mentioned in the claim (34-25 and 36-29) exactly match two of these.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nThe table has eight rows. Each row represents a team's performance with various metrics like games played, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. The columns are: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, points.\n\nLet me go through each row to see where 'drawn' is greater than zero because the claim mentions teams that drew. Wait, actually, in the table, the 'drawn' column shows how many games were drawn by the team. So a value of 1 means they drew one game, and so on.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data:\n- The first row has drawn=0.\n- Second row: drawn=0.\n- Third row: drawn=0.\n- Fourth row: drawn=1.\n- Fifth row: drawn=1.\n- Sixth row: drawn=0.\n- Seventh row: drawn=0.\n- Eighth row: drawn=0.\n\nSo only rows 3 and 4 (assuming indexing starts at 0) have a value of 1 in the 'drawn' column. So there are exactly two occasions where a team drew, which aligns with the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, for these two rows, let's check their goal differences:\n- Row index 3: Goal difference is 34 - 25.\n- Row index 4: Goal difference is 36 - 29.\n\nSo both of these match exactly what the claim states. The claim mentions that there are only two such occasions with those specific goal differences, which is precisely what we have in rows 3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because:\n- There are exactly two instances where a team drew (rows 3 and 4).\n- Both of these instances have the specified goal differences (34-25 and 36-29).\n\nI should also note that no other rows in the table meet both conditions. All other rows either didn't draw any games or, if they did draw, their goal differences don't match those mentioned.\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n- The answer is \"TRUE\".\n- The relevant cells are the 'drawn' and 'goal difference' columns for rows 3 and 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the user is asking here. They've provided a table in markdown format and a claim they want me to verify as TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"when the goal difference be 11 - 71 the point be 0\". I need to check if this claim holds true by looking at the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. There are eight rows of data. Each row represents a different team's performance with various statistics.\n\nThe claim is about a specific condition: when the goal difference is 11-71, what are the points? So I need to find the row where the goal difference is exactly 11 - 71 and check if the corresponding points column has 0.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Goal difference is 51-10. That's not 11-71.\nRow 1: 40-13, nope.\nRow 2: 41-19, still not matching.\nRow 3: 34-25. Not it either.\nRow 4: 36-29. Nope again.\nRow 5: 32-27. Still not the one.\nRow 6: 17-68. Close, but not exactly 11-71.\nRow 7: Ah, here we go. The goal difference is 11 - 71. Now, what are the points in this row? Looking at the points column, it's 0.\n\nSo, yes, when the goal difference is 11-71, the points are indeed 0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to note which cells were checked. The goal difference cell in row 7 and the points cell in the same row are the ones that support this conclusion. So the relevant cells are at row_index 7 under \"goal difference\" and \"points\".\n\nI'll structure my JSON response accordingly, ensuring it only includes these relevant parts as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It looks like it's saying that for teams with 12 points, their goal differences are either 51-10 or 40-13.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two rows where the points column is 12. Let me check those rows.\n\nRow 0: Points = 12, Goal difference = 51 -10.\nRow 1: Points = 12, Goal difference =40 -13.\n\nSo both goal differences mentioned in the claim are present when points are 12.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"there be only 2 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the columns in the table: games, drawn, lost, goal difference, points. The relevant parts here are the 'points' column and the 'lost' (which I assume refers to losses) column.\n\nThe claim mentions two conditions:\n1. Points equal 7.\n2. Number of losses equal 3.\n\nIt also says this happens only twice.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row one by one to check for these conditions.\n\nRow 0: points = 12, lost = 1 \u2192 Doesn't meet either condition.\nRow 1: points = 12, lost = 1 \u2192 Same as above.\nRow 2: points = 10, lost = 2 \u2192 Points don't match, losses are close but not exactly 3.\nRow 3: points = 7, lost = 3 \u2192 Both conditions met. This is one instance.\nRow 4: points = 7, lost = 3 \u2192 Again, both conditions met.

That's two instances exactly as the claim says. There are no other rows that satisfy points=7 and lost=3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two times when the points are 7 and losses are 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"there be never a time when point be greater than 12 and only 1 occasion when the point be less than 2.\"\n\nFirst part of the claim: \"never a time when point > 12.\" So I should check all the points in the table to see if any are above 12.\n\nLooking at the 'points' column:\nRow indices (0-7):\n- Row 0: 12\n- Row 1: 12\n- Row 2: 10\n- Row 3: 7\n- Row 4: 7\n- Row 5: 6\n- Row 6: 2\n- Row 7: 0\n\nAll points are <=12. So the first part is satisfied.\n\nSecond part: \"only 1 occasion when point < 2.\" Points less than 2 would be less than or equal to 1.\n\nLooking at 'points' column:\n- Any points below 2? The lowest is 0 in row 7. Are there others?\n\nChecking all rows:\n- Row 6 has 2, which is not less than 2.\n- Only row 7 has 0, which is <2.\n\nSo only one occasion where points are less than 2. That's correct per the claim.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim hold true based on the table data.\n\nNow, to identify relevant cells:\n\nFor the first part (points >12), all 'points' need to be checked:\nRelevant rows: 0-7 in column 'points'.\n\nBut since we're only checking if any are greater than 12, and none are, but it's still necessary to check each cell.\n\nFor the second part, points less than 2. Only row 7 has 0. So relevant cell is row 7, 'points' column.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I need to list all cells that were checked for each condition.\n\nSo for \"never a time when point be greater than 12,\" we look at every 'points' value in each row. Therefore, rows 0-7, column points.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the instruction is just to find which cells are relevant for verifying the claim, meaning that if any cell violates the condition, it's marked as relevant. Since none have point >12, all points are <=12, but we still need to check each one. So all 'points' cells are relevant.\n\nBut in terms of JSON structure, perhaps only the cells that are either greater than 12 or less than 2 are included. But actually, for verifying \"never a time when point >12,\" we have to ensure no points exceed 12. Hence, checking each cell is necessary. So all 'points' cells (0-7) are relevant.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim's first part is satisfied because none of them are greater than 12, so any row where points could be >12 would violate it. Since none do, but we still checked all.\n\nWait, perhaps for efficiency, only check if there exists a point above 12. So if in any row the 'points' >12, that's relevant. But since none are, maybe only rows with max points (like 12) might be considered? Hmm.\n\nBut to accurately represent the cells checked, I think all 'points' cells were looked at because we have to confirm that no point exceeds 12. So each row's 'points' is relevant for the first condition.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part, only one cell (row 7) has points <2, so it's relevant.\n\nSo compiling the relevant_cells:\n\nAll rows (0-7) in 'points' column and row 7 again for the same column. But since some may be duplicates, but per instructions, each occurrence is listed as a separate object.\n\nWait no, actually, the first part checks all points to ensure none are >12, so all points cells are relevant. The second part checks if only one cell has <2, which is row 7.\n\nSo combining both conditions:\n\nRelevant cells would include every 'points' cell (0-7) for checking if any exceed 12 and the specific cell in row 7 where point is less than 2.\n\nThus, relevant_cells includes each of the points columns from all rows, plus perhaps an additional one? Or maybe just list all points cells as they were all checked.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to structure it is:\n\nFor the first condition (no points >12), check all 'points' cells. So 8 entries in total for column 'points' across all 8 rows.\n\nBut looking at the table given, there are 8 rows (indices 0-7). Each has a 'points' value. Therefore, each row's 'points' cell is relevant to confirm that none exceed 12.\n\nAdditionally, for the second condition (only one occasion where points <2), which occurs in row 7, so that specific cell is also included.\n\nWait, but perhaps all the cells are already covered by checking if any have point >12 and whether only one has point <2. So the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For first part: each 'points' cell (all rows)\n- For second part: the cell where points <2 (row 7)\n\nBut in terms of JSON, each relevant cell is listed as a separate object with row index and column name.\n\nSo the list will have 8 entries for the 'points' column across all rows, plus one more for row 7? Wait no, because row 7's 'points' was already included in the first check. So perhaps it's just all 8 points cells, as they were all checked to ensure that none are >12 and only one is <2.\n\nSo in total, relevant_cells will have 8 objects, each with \"row_index\" from 0-7 and \"column_name\": \"points\".\n\nBut wait, the second part requires us to check for points less than 2. So we must also include any cell where that condition is met or not. But since only row 7 meets it, but all cells were checked.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when checking if there's exactly one occasion of point <2, I have to look at every 'points' cell. So all points cells are relevant for both conditions. Hence, including all rows in the 'points' column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells list will include:\n\n[\n  {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n  {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"points\"}\n]\n\nBecause all these cells were checked to ensure no points exceed 12 and that only one point is less than 2.\n\nBut wait, in the JSON example provided earlier, it's structured with \"columns\" and specific values. Maybe not necessary here. Just listing each cell as per row index and column name.\n\nSo compiling all this, the relevant_cells include every 'points' entry across all rows to confirm both conditions.\n</think>\n\nTo verify the claim that no points exceed 12 and only one point is less than 2, we examine every 'points' value in each row of the table. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check for Points Exceeding 12:**\n   - We need to ensure that none of the rows have a 'points' value greater than 12.\n   - This requires inspecting each 'points' cell across all 8 rows.\n\n2. **Identify Occasions with Points Less Than 2:**\n   - We must confirm that exactly one row has a 'points' value less than 2.\n   - This involves reviewing the 'points' column to locate such instances.\n\n3. **Result of Inspections:**\n   - After examining all rows, none have points exceeding 12.\n   - Only one row (row index 7) has a points value below 2.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe relevant cells that were checked include every entry in the 'points' column across all rows to ensure compliance with both conditions. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":0,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Let me first understand the claim: \"there be 3 occasion when a team drew and it have a goal difference of 34 -25 and 36-29\". \n\nWait, actually, reading it again, it seems like the claim is stating that there were three occasions where teams drew with goal differences of 34-25 and 36-29. Hmm, but looking at the table, each row represents a team's performance over 7 games.\n\nSo first, I should check how many times a team drew (drawn column). Looking at the 'drawn' column: \n\nRow indices are from 0 to 7. The drawn counts are as follows:\n\n- Row 0: 0 draws\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 0\n- Row 3: 1 draw\n- Row 4: 1 draw\n- Row 5: 0\n- Row 6: 0\n- Row 7: 0\n\nSo only rows 3 and 4 have drawn games, each with 1 draw. That means there are two occasions where a team drew, not three as the claim says.\n\nNext, checking the goal differences for these rows:\n\nRow 3 has \"34 -25\" and Row 4 has \"36-29\".

The columns are games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. Each row represents a different record with these stats.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific values: a goal difference of \"11 -71\" and points being 1. My task is to see if any row in the table has both these conditions met.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row's goal difference:\n\n- Row 0: 51 -10 \u2192 Not matching\n- Row 1: 40 -13 \u2192 No match\n- Row 2: 41 -19 \u2192 Doesn't fit\n- Row 3: 34 -25 \u2192 Still no\n- Row 4: 36 -29 \u2192 Nope\n- Row 5: 32 -27 \u2192 Not matching\n- Row 6: 17 -68 \u2192 Close, but not exactly \"11 -71\"\n- Row 7: 11 -71 \u2192 Yes, this matches the goal difference mentioned in the claim.\n\nNow that I've found the row with goal difference 11 -71 (row 7), I'll check the points for this row. Looking at the 'points' column, it's listed as 0.\n\nThe claim states that when the goal difference is 11 -71, the points should be 1. However, in reality, points are 0. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold true based on the data provided.\n\nAdditionally, since only row 7 has the specified goal difference, it's the only relevant cell to consider for this claim.

So I need to look through each row's 'points' value and count how many are above 12. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Points = 12\nRow 1: Points = 12\nRow 2: Points = 10\nRow 3: Points = 7\nRow 4: Points = 7\nRow 5: Points = 6\nRow 6: Points = 2\nRow 7: Points = 0\n\nLooking at these, none of the points are greater than 12. The highest is 12 in rows 0 and 1. So there's actually zero instances where points exceed 12. Therefore, the first part of the claim isn't met.\n\nThe second part says there's no time when the points are less than 2. Let's check for that:\n\nLooking at the 'points' column again, row 7 has 0 points, which is definitely less than 2. So this part of the claim is also false because there is a case where points are below 2.\n\nPutting it all together: The first condition isn't satisfied (no points above 12), and the second condition is violated (there is an instance with points less than 2). Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not have any rows where points exceed 12. Additionally, there is one row where points are 0, which is less than 2.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the point be 13, the goal difference be 51 - 10 and 40 - 13.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It seems to state that when points are 13, there should be two corresponding goal differences: 51-10 and 40-13.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nI'll check each row where points might be close to or exactly 13. The points column shows values like 12, 12, 10, etc., but I don't see any rows with 13 points. So immediately, it seems there's no entry where points are 13.\n\nBut wait, the claim mentions two goal differences: 51-10 and 40-13. Let me check if these goal differences exist in the table regardless of the points.\n\nLooking at the goal difference column:\n\nRow 0: 51 - 10\nRow 1: 40 - 13\n\nYes, both of these goal differences are present. Now, their corresponding points are both 12 for row 0 and row 1.\n\nSo, according to the claim, when points are 13, these goal differences should be there. But since in the table, these goal differences occur with 12 points, not 13, the claim is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no row where points equal 13, and the existing rows have lower points for those goal differences.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that when points are 13, specific goal differences exist. However, the table doesn't have any entries with 13 points. The relevant cells show that the goal differences mentioned (51-10 and 40-13) occur at 12 points, not 13.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 3 times when the point be 7 and the number of loss be 3 each time.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the columns represent. Looking at the table headers, we have games, drawn, lost, goal difference, and points. So, for each row, the 'lost' column shows how many games were lost, and 'points' show the total points accumulated.\n\nThe claim is about two conditions: points being 7 and losses being 3. I need to check how many rows meet both these criteria. \n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Points are 12, losses are 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n2. Row 1: Points are 12, losses are 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n3. Row 2: Points are 10, losses are 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n4. Row 3: Points are 7, losses are 3 \u2192 Matches both conditions. So this is one instance.\n5. Row 4: Points are 7, losses are 3 \u2192 Another match. Now two instances.\n6. Row 5: Points are 6, losses are 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n7. Row 6: Points are 2, losses are 6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n8. Row 7: Points are 0, losses are 7 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, I only found two rows (rows 3 and 4) where points are 7 and losses are 3 each. The claim says there should be three such instances. \n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Rows 0-1: no; row 2: points 10, not 7; rows 5-8 don't have points 7 or the correct losses. So yes, only two rows meet both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are only two times, not three, where points equal 7 and losses equal 3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are three instances where points are 7 and losses are 3. Upon examining each row of the table, we find exactly two rows (rows 3 and 4) meeting both conditions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
