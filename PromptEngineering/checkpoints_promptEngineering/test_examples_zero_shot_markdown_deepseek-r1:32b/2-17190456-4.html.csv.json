    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me read the claim again: \"on december 26, the score be st louis 3, pittsburgh 2, with 20 point accumulate.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim and check against the relevant data in the table.\n\nThe claim mentions December 26, so I should look for a row where the date is December 26. Let me scan the 'date' column:\n\nLooking at the dates: december 1, 4,7,8,11,14,15,17,21,22,25,26,28,31. So December 26 is present in row index 12 (since indexing starts from 0). \n\nNext, I need to check the score. The claim says \"st louis 3, pittsburgh 2.\" In the table, for December 26, the 'score' column shows \"2 - 3.\" Wait, that's reversed. So, it's actually Pittsburgh 2 and St. Louis 3. But the claim states St. Louis 3 and Pittsburgh 2, which matches this. Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me double-check: the score is listed as visitor vs home? Or is it in a different order?\n\nWait, the table structure has 'visitor' and 'home' columns. So for each row, the first number in 'score' is the visitor's score, and the second is the home team's. On December 26, the visitor is St. Louis (from column 'visitor'), and home is Pittsburgh. The score is \"2 - 3,\" so visitor (St. Louis) scored 2, home (Pittsburgh) scored 3? Wait no, that can't be right because the claim says St. Louis has 3 points.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in the 'score' column, is it visitor score first or home score first? The table doesn't specify, but usually, in sports scores, it's visitor vs home. So for row 12 (December 26), the score is \"2 - 3.\" Visitor is St. Louis, so their score would be 2, and home is Pittsburgh with 3.\n\nBut the claim says \"st louis 3, pittsburgh 2,\" which contradicts that because according to the table, St. Louis scored 2 and Pittsburgh scored 3. Therefore, the scores don't match the claim. Wait, but maybe I misread the table's structure.\n\nWait no, in row 12: date is december 26, visitor is st louis (since 'visitor' column), home is pittsburgh (home column). The score is \"2 -3\" which would mean visitor scored 2, home scored 3. So St. Louis (visitor) has 2 points, Pittsburgh (home) has 3.\n\nBut the claim says \"st louis 3, pittsburgh 2,\" so that's not matching. Therefore, the score part is incorrect in the claim. That would make the claim FALSE because one of its conditions isn't met.\n\nWait, but let me check again to be sure. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the 'score' column formatting. The table shows \"2 -3\" for December 26. So visitor (St. Louis) scored 2, home (Pittsburgh) scored 3. The claim says St. Louis 3 and Pittsburgh 2, which is the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the score in the claim is incorrect based on the table.\n\nAdditionally, let's check the 'points' column for that date. For December 26, points are 20. So that part matches the claim. But since the score doesn't match, the overall claim isn't fully supported.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- row index 12 (December 26) in columns: 'date', 'visitor', 'score', and 'points'.\n\nBut since the score in the table is \"2 -3\" whereas the claim says \"st louis 3, pittsburgh 2,\" it's incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake with the visitor and home scores. Let me think again: the 'score' column for December 26 is listed as \"2 -3.\" If the visitor is St. Louis, then their score is first, so 2. The home team (Pittsburgh) scored 3. So in the claim, it's stated as \"st louis 3, pittsburgh 2,\" which is opposite of what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim's score is wrong. Hence, the overall statement isn't correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on December 26, St. Louis scored 3 and Pittsburgh scored 2, but according to the table, St. Louis (visitor) scored 2 and Pittsburgh (home) scored 3. The points accumulated are correctly stated as 20. However, since the score is incorrect, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": {\n        \"result\": \"FALSE\",\n        \"relevant_cells\": [\n            {\"row\": 12, \"column\": \"date\"},\n            {\"row\": 12, \"column\": \"visitor\"},\n            {\"row\": 12, \"column\": \"score\"},\n            {\"row\": 12, \"column\": \"points\"}\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```",

Let me carefully go through each part of the claim and check it against the data.\n\nThe claim states: \"18 point be accumulate on december 21 when pittsburgh host minnesota in front of a crowd of 5307.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key points to verify:\n1. The date is December 21.\n2. Pittsburgh is hosting Minnesota.\n3. Points accumulated are 18.\n4. Attendance is 5307.\n\nI'll start by looking for the row with December 21 in the 'date' column. Scanning through the table, I find that the row on December 21 has:\n- date: december 21\n- visitor: minnesota\n- home: pittsburgh\n- attendance: 5307\n\nSo, the date and teams involved (Pittsburgh hosting Minnesota) match. Next, I need to check if the points accumulated that day were 18.\n\nLooking at the 'points' column for that row, it shows 18. That matches the claim's point accumulation of 18.\n\nLastly, verifying the attendance: The table lists 5307 attendees on December 21, which aligns with the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the point be 18 when the home team be boston\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Points**: This likely refers to the \"points\" column in the table.\n2. **Home team**: This would be the \"home\" column, indicating which team is playing at home.\n3. **Boston**: We're looking for a row where the home team is Boston.\n\nThe claim is stating that when the home team is Boston, the points should be 18. So I need to check if there's any row where both conditions are met: home team is Boston and points equal 18.\n\nNow, let me go through each row of the table one by one to see if such a row exists.\n\n- **Row 0**: Home team is Oakland. Points are 15. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 1**: Home team is Pittsburgh. Points are 15. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 2**: Home team is St. Louis. Points are 16. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 3**: Home team is Pittsburgh. Points are 16. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 4**: Home team is Minnesota. Points are 18. But the home team isn't Boston, so not relevant.\n- **Row 5**: Home team is Pittsburgh. Points are 18. Again, not Boston.\n- **Row 6**: Here, the home team is Boston. Let's check the points: it says 18. This matches both conditions!\n  \nWait, no, looking back at row 6: The \"home\" column actually shows \"boston\". So in this case, the home team is Boston, and the points are indeed 18. That means when Boston was the home team, their points were 18.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes there might be multiple entries or I could have misread a row.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- **Row 7**: Home team is Philadelphia. Points are 18. Not relevant.\n- **Row 8**: Home team is Pittsburgh. Points are 18. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 9**: Home team is Chicago. Points are 18. No.\n- **Row 10**: Home team is Detroit. Points are 20. No.\n- **Row 11**: Home team is St. Louis again, points 20.\n- **Row 12**: Home team is Oakland, points 20.\n- **Row 13**: Home team is Montreal, points 20.\n\nSo the only row where the home team was Boston (row 6) does have points equal to 18. Therefore, the claim holds true for that specific instance.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows with Boston as the home team, but from a quick scan, it seems there's only one such entry. Since all conditions in the claim are met in row 6, I can confidently say the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 - 3 be score, when visitor be pittsburgh, and when point be less than 20\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each condition means:\n\n1. **Score is \"2 - 3\":** I'm looking for any row where the score column shows \"2 - 3\".\n2. **Visitor is Pittsburgh:** The visitor column should indicate \"pittsburgh\" in those rows.\n3. **Points are less than 20:** The points column should have a value that's less than 20.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row of the table to check these conditions.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is \"4 - 4\", so it doesn't match. Points are 15 which is less than 20, but since the score isn't correct, this row isn't relevant.\n\nSecond row:\n- Visitor is Detroit, not Pittsburgh, so we skip.\n\nThird row:\n- Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is \"1 - 1\". Doesn't match the required score. Points are 16 <20, but again, score doesn't fit.\n\nFourth row:\n- Visitor is Toronto, so no.\n\nFifth row:\n- Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is \"4 - 2\". No match for the score.\n\nSixth row:\n- Visitor is Los Angeles, not Pittsburgh.\n\nSeventh row:\n- Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is \"3 -5\", which doesn't fit. Points are 18 <20, but since the score isn't matching, this isn't relevant.\n\nEighth row:\n- Visitor is Philadelphia, so no.\n\nNinth row:\n- Visitor is Minnesota, not Pittsburgh.\n\nTenth row:\n- Visitor is Chicago, not relevant.\n\nEleventh row:\n- Visitor is Detroit, not Pittsburgh.\n\nTwelfth row (December 26):\n- Visitor is Pittsburgh. Let's check the score: \"2 - 3\". That matches the required score. Now, checking points: it's 20, which is equal to but not less than 20. So this doesn't satisfy all conditions because points must be less than 20.\n\nThirteenth row:\n- Visitor is Oakland, so no.\n\nFourteenth row (December 31):\n- Visitor is Montreal, irrelevant.\n\nWait a second, I think I might have missed something. Let me go through the rows again to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nLooking back at December 26: The points are exactly 20, which doesn't meet the \"less than 20\" condition. So this row isn't relevant because although the score and visitor match, the points don't satisfy being less than 20.\n\nIs there another row where all three conditions meet? Let's check each row carefully:\n\n- December 1: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score doesn't match.\n- December 4: Visitor isn't Pittsburgh.\n- December 7: Visitor is Pittsburgh, but score is \"1 -1\".\n- December 8: Visitor is Toronto.\n- December 11: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score doesn't match.\n- December 14: Visitor isn't.\n- December 15: Visitor is Pittsburgh, score is \"3-5\".\n- December 17: Visitor isn't.\n- December 21: Visitor is Minnesota.\n- December 22: Visitor is Chicago.\n- December 25: Visitor is Detroit.\n- December 26: Score and visitor match, but points are exactly 20.\n- December 28: Visitor is Oakland.\n- December 31: Visitor is Montreal.\n\nSo it seems that the only row where the score is \"2 -3\" and the visitor is Pittsburgh is on December 26. However, the points there are exactly 20, not less than 20. Therefore, this doesn't satisfy all three conditions.\n\nWait a minute, did I make a mistake? Let me check again for any other rows where the score is \"2 -3\". Looking through each row:\n\n- The only occurrence of \"2 -3\" in the score column is on December 26. All others have different scores. So, there's no row that has both visitor as Pittsburgh and score as \"2 -3\" with points less than 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any row in the table because either one of the conditions isn't met wherever two are met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. There is no instance where all three conditions (score being \"2-3\", visitor being Pittsburgh, and points less than 20) are satisfied.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_rows\": []\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that when the \"home\" team is Boston, the \"lowest point\" should be 10. So, my task is to check if any row in the table has Boston as the home team and whether the points for that row are 10 or not.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row contains columns: date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record, and points. The relevant columns here are \"home\" and \"points.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to find instances where the \"home\" is Boston. Scanning the \"home\" column:\n\n- December 1: Oakland\n- December 4: Pittsburgh\n- December 7: St Louis\n- December 8: Toronto\n- December 11: Minnesota\n- December 14: Los Angeles\n- December 15: Boston \u2014 Ah, here's a row where home is Boston.\n- December 17: Philadelphia\n- December 21: Pittsburgh (visitor vs. home is not relevant here)\n- December 22: Chicago\n- December 25: Detroit\n- December 26: St Louis\n- December 28: Oakland\n- December 31: Montreal\n\nSo, only the row with December 15 has Boston as the home team.\n\nNow, looking at the \"points\" column for that specific row. The points value is 18. \n\nThe claim states that when home is Boston, the lowest point should be 10. However, in reality, it's 18.
