    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"on october 20 the stampeders play at the skydome , win 34 - 27 and improve their record to 11 win , 5 loss.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the date mentioned in the table. The date is October 20, so I need to find a row where the 'date' column is October 20. Scanning through the rows, I see that week 15 corresponds to the date October 20.\n\nNext, checking the opponent for that week: it's the stampeders, which matches the claim. The location should be skydome. Looking at the 'location' column for week 15, it says skydome, so that part is correct.\n\nNow, verifying the final score. The claim mentions a win with a score of 34-27. In the table, under 'final score' for week 15, it's listed as w 34 - 27, which stands for a win with those exact points. So the score matches.\n\nFinally, checking the record after this game. The claim states that their record improves to 11 wins and 5 losses. In the table, under 'record' for week 15, it shows 11 - 5, which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nEach part of the claim is accurately reflected in the corresponding row of the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"on october 5 the blue bomber win their game at the skydome 22 - 21\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the date mentioned in the claim, which is October 5. Scanning through the \"date\" column, I see that row index 13 has the date \"october 5\". That seems relevant.\n\nNext, checking the opponent for this date: the opponent is listed as \"blue bombers\" under the \"opponent\" column in row 13. The claim mentions \"blue bomber\", which matches except for the pluralization. I think that's a minor discrepancy but likely refers to the same team.\n\nNow, looking at the location: the claim says it was at \"skydome\". In row 13, the location is indeed \"skydome\" under the \"location\" column. So that checks out.\n\nFor the result of the game, the final score in row 13 shows \"w 22  - 21\", where 'w' stands for a win. The claim states it was a win with a score of 22-21. That's an exact match, so this part is correct.\n\nThe attendance and other columns don't directly affect the claim's validity since the focus is on the date, location, opponent, and result. Therefore, those are covered by rows 13 in \"date\", \"opponent\", \"location\", and \"final score\".\n\nSince all parts of the claim align with the information in row 13, I can confidently say the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"final score\"}\n   ]\n}",

Scanning the 'date' column, I see that the last row has the date \"october 27.\" \n\nNext, I need to check the opponent in that row. The opponent is listed as \"tiger- cats,\" which matches the claim.\n\nLooking at the location, the cell under 'location' for this row is \"ivor wynne stadium,\" so that part of the claim also checks out.\n\nNow, examining the final score: the claim says the tiger-cats won 39-34. In the table, the 'final score' column shows \"w 39 - 34.\" The 'w' indicates a win for the team listed first, which is our team (since the opponent is tiger-cats).

Scanning down, I see two rows for week 8: one on August 27 and another on September 2. The August 27 entry has the opponent as 'lions' and location 'skydome'. \n\nNow checking the final score: it's listed as w 34 -25, which means the team won with that score. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNext, the record after this game is shown as 6-2 in the table. The claim says the record improved to 6-2, so that also aligns perfectly.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.

The 'l' indicates a loss. So their team scored 41, opponent scored 52. That matches.\n\nCheck if it was over time:\n- Yes, \"(ot)\" is mentioned, so it was an overtime game.\n\nFinally, the record after this game:\n- Record column shows \"3 - 1\" which is correct.\n\nAll parts of the claim are accurately reflected in row index 3 (since rows start at 0).

Looking through the 'date' column, I find that there's a row with \"october 27\". That's relevant.\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: The opponent is said to be the stampeders. In the same row as october 27, the opponent listed is \"tiger - cats\", not stampeders. So this part doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake? Let me double-check. Scanning all rows for October 27: yes, it's against tiger - cats. Therefore, the claim incorrectly states the opponent as stampeders instead of tiger - cats.\n\n3. **Location Check**: The claim says they played at skydome. In the 'location' column for october 27, it's \"ivor wynne stadium\". So this is incorrect; they didn't play at skydome that day.\n\n4. **Score Check**: The final score in the claim is a loss with 27-34 (I assume team's score first). Looking at the 'final score' for october 27, it's \"w 39 - 34\". Wait, no, actually, let me check again. No, the row for october 27 shows \"tiger - cats\" as the opponent and the final score is \"w 39 - 34\", which means they won, not lost. So the team (I assume it's the same team each week) scored 39, opponent 34, resulting in a win.\n\n5. **Record Check**: The claim says their record changes to 10-6 after this game. Looking at the 'record' column for october 27, it shows \"12 - 5\". So the team's record is actually 12 wins and 5 losses after that week, not 10-6.\n\nPutting all together: The claim incorrectly states the opponent as stampeders instead of tiger - cats. It also mentions playing at skydome when they were at ivor wynne stadium. Furthermore, it claims a loss with score 27-34 but the team actually won 39-34.

Win with 39-34. This is the correct date but wrong opponent and location.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again for October 27. Looking back at row indices:\n\nRow 16: Date is October 27, opponent Tiger-Cats, location Ivor Wynne Stadium, score W 39-34. So the claim says Blue Bombers won at Skydome with a score of 22-21 on that date. But according to row 16, the game was against Tiger-Cats, not Blue Bombers.\n\nLooking again for Blue Bombers in October: Row 13 is October 5 vs Blue Bombers at Skydome, which was a win with score 22-21. So the claim has the correct score but incorrect date and possibly opponent? Wait, no\u2014the claim says Blue Bombers on October 27, but row 16 is against Tiger-Cats.\n\nSo there's no entry for Blue Bombers on October 27.

Result: Loss with a score of 34-39\n4. Location: Ivor Wynne Stadium\n\nNow, I need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 16 rows (weeks 1 through 16).

Wait, let me recount. The table starts with week 1 and goes up to week 16.\n\nWait, looking back, the rows are from week 1 (July 11) through week 16 (October 27).

Let me check that:\n\nRow 14: october 11\nRow 15: october 20\n\nYes, so row index 14 corresponds to october 11, and row 15 is october 20.\n\nNow, checking the opponent in row 15. It says \"stampeders.\" So that's different from Tiger-Cats. Therefore, on October 20, the opponent was the Stampeders, not the Tiger-Cats. \n\nNext, looking at the result for that game: final score is w 34 - 27. The team won (w) with a score of 34-27, so it's a win, not a loss.\n\nThe location for row 15 is skydome, not Ivor Wynne Stadium. \n\nSo the claim mentions Tiger-Cats losing at Ivor Wynne on October 20. But according to the table:\n- Date: correct (October 20)\n- Opponent: wrong (Stampeders instead of Tiger-Cats)\n- Result: it was a win, not a loss\n- Location: Skydome instead of Ivor Wynne\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, looking at row index 15 in the table, which is October 20.

No, Skydome)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rows again.\n\nWait, in row index 15: week 16 is october 27 at ivor wynne stadium against tiger-cats. So that's row index 15?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the table has 16 weeks, from 1 to 16.

The opponent there was Stampeders, and it's a win with score 34-27 at skydome.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells for checking are:\n\nIn row index 14 (october 20):\n- opponent: \"stampeders\" vs claim of Tiger-Cats\n- final score: \"w 34 - 27\" vs claim of loss 34-39\n- location: \"skydome\" vs claim of ivor wynne\n\nSo the relevant cells would be these three columns in row index 14.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE because none of the components match.

Let me break down each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"on august 27 the lion lose at skydome stadium with a score of 34 - 25 , change their record to 5 - 3\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the date August 27 in the 'date' column. Scanning through the table rows:\n\n- Row index 8 has the date \"august 27\". Let me check that row.\n\nLooking at this row:\n- Week: 8\n- Date: august 27\n- Opponent: lions\n- Location: skydome\n- Final score: w 34 - 25 (so the team won)\n- Attendance: 39508\n- Record: 6 - 2\n\nWait, the claim says that the lions lost. But in this row, it's a win because the final score is \"w 34 - 25\". So the opponent was the lions, and our team (the one with the record) won. Therefore, the lions didn't lose here; they were defeated.\n\nNext, let me check if there's another August 27 date elsewhere in the table to avoid confusion. Looking through all rows, I only find one entry for august 27 at row index 8.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that after this game, their record changed to 5-3. However, according to the table, after this win on august 27 (row index 8), the record became 6-2, not 5-3. So both the outcome and the resulting record don't match the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the team actually won against the lions on August 27, and their record after that game was 6-2, not 5-3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states a loss when there was a win and an incorrect post-game record. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"On August 1, the Lion play at Ivor Wynne Stadium and lose 41-52 in overtime, putting their record at 3-3.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to August 1. Scanning through the table:\n\nWeek 4 is on August 1, opponent is Lions, location is BC Place Stadium, final score is L 52 - 41 (OT), attendance 53527, record 3-1.\n\nSo, checking each part of the claim against this row:\n\n1. **Date**: The date in the table is August 1, which matches the claim.\n2. **Opponent**: The opponent is listed as \"lions,\" so that's correct.\n3. **Location**: The location here is BC Place Stadium, not Ivor Wynne Stadium. This is a discrepancy.\n4. **Score and Outcome**: The score is L 52-41 (OT), which means the team lost in overtime. That matches the claim's loss description.\n5. **Record**: After this game, the record is 3-1, not 3-3 as claimed.\n\nSo two parts of the claim don't align with the table: the location and the resulting record. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells to check are:\n\n- The week (week index)\n- The date\n- Opponent\n- Location\n- Final score\n- Record\n\nThese details help verify each component of the claim against the actual data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the location and final record for August 1.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"final score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
