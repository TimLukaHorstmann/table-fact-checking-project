I need to carefully analyze each part of the claim and cross-reference it with the information in the table provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. It has five columns: position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. Each row corresponds to different positions in a team, listing the players who held those positions along with additional details about their schools and hall of fame status.\n\nThe claim states: \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully both play the end position and ed weir ralph chase play the tackle position.\" \n\nBreaking this down:\n1. Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully are claimed to play the end position.\n2. Ed Weir and Ralph Chase are claimed to play the tackle position.\n\nI need to verify each part of this claim against the table.\n\nLooking at the first row, which is under the \"ends\" position, the names listed are \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully.\" This confirms that both Bennie Oosterbaan and Mike Tully do indeed play the end position. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, examining the second row, which is under the \"tackles\" position, the names listed are \"ed weir ralph chase.\" This matches the second part of the claim, confirming that both Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position.\n\nSince both parts of the claim align perfectly with the information provided in the table, the entire claim is supported by the data. \n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells for each verification:\n- For the first part (ends position), the cell is found at row index 0 under the \"name\" column.\n- For the second part (tackles position), the cell is found at row index 1 under the \"name\" column.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are accurate based on the table provided.

The claim states: \"benny friedman of michigan play the quarterback position while edward l mcmillan of princeton play center.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Benny Friedman from Michigan plays the quarterback position.\n2. Edward L. McMillan from Princeton plays the center position.\n\nI'll start by looking at each part separately in the table.\n\nLooking at the \"position\" column for Benny Friedman:\n- Scanning through the rows, I find the row where the position is \"quarterback.\" In that row, under the \"name\" column, it says \"benny friedman,\" and the \"school\" column lists \"michigan.\" This matches the claim exactly. So, Benny Friedman does play quarterback for Michigan.\n\nNext, checking Edward L. McMillan:\n- I look for the row where the position is \"center.\" In that row, under the \"name\" column, it's listed as \"edward l mcmillan,\" and the \"school\" is \"princeton.\" This also aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. There are no discrepancies here.\n\nNow, I'll note down the relevant cells that were used to verify each part of the claim:\n- For Benny Friedman: The row index for quarterback is 4 (assuming rows start from 0). The columns checked were \"position,\" \"name,\" and \"school.\"\n- For Edward L. McMillan: The row index for center is 3.

The claim states: \"carl diehl ed hess both play the guard position and ed weir ralph chase play the tackle position.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts for easier verification:\n\n1. Carl Diehl and Ed Hess both play the guard position.\n2. Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play the tackle position.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different position with multiple players listed under that position. The columns are \"position,\" \"name,\" \"school,\" \"unanimous,\" and \"college hall of fame.\"\n\nStarting with the first part: Are Carl Diehl and Ed Hess guards? Let's check the row where the position is \"guards.\" In that row, under the \"name\" column, it says \"carl diehl ed hess.\" So both names are listed together under the guard position. This supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNow for the second part: Do Ed Weir and Ralph Chase play tackle? Checking the \"tackles\" row in the table, the \"name\" column lists \"ed weir ralph chase.\" That means both players are indeed tackles. \n\nSince both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the table data, the overall claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as both Carl Diehl and Ed Hess are guards, and Ed Weir and Ralph Chase are tackles according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So Ed Weir is from Nebraska, and Ralph Chase is from Pittsburgh. That matches the first part of the claim exactly.\n\nNext, for Benny Friedman, we look at the row with position \"quarterback\".

The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"ernie big dog nevers from stanford play the fullback position and andy swede oberlander red grange play the halfback position.\" So, there are two parts here that need verification.\n\nLooking at the table provided in markdown format, it has columns for position, name, school, unanimous, and college hall of fame. There are seven rows corresponding to different positions: ends, tackles, guards, center, quarterback, halfbacks, and fullback.\n\nFor the first part of the claim: \"ernie big dog nevers from stanford play the fullback position.\" I'll scan the table for the name \"ernie big dog nevers.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- Ends: names are bennie oosterbaan mike tully, school is michigan dartmouth.\n- Tackles: ed weir ralph chase, schools nebraska pittsburgh.\n- Guards: carl diehl ed hess, schools dartmouth ohio state.\n- Center: edward l mcmillan, princeton.\n- Quarterback: benny friedman, michigan.\n- Halfbacks: andy swede oberlander red grange, schools dartmouth illinois.\n- Fullback: ernie big dog nevers, school stanford.\n\nSo, the fullback row has ernie big dog nevers from stanford. That matches the first part of the claim exactly. So that's correct.\n\nNow, for the second part: \"andy swede oberlander red grange play the halfback position.\" Checking the halfbacks row in the table: the names listed are andy swede oberlander red grange, which includes all three mentioned in the claim. Their school is dartmouth illinois. So this also matches.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n1. For ernie big dog nevers: \n   - The row index for fullback is 6 (since rows start at 0).\n   - Columns involved: position (to confirm it's fullback), name (to match ernie big dog nevers), school (stanford).\n\n2. For andy swede oberlander red grange:\n   - The row index for halfbacks is 5.\n   - Again, position to confirm halfback, names to match all three individuals.\n\nSo the relevant cells are in rows 5 and 6, checking their respective columns for position, name, and school.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies ernie big dog nevers as the fullback from stanford and andy swede oberlander red grange as halfbacks. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"school\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

They want to know if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"oosterbaan tully both played tackle, and weir and chase play halfback.\" Okay, so two parts here. The first part says that Oosterbaan and Tully were tackles. The second part claims that Weir and Chase were halfbacks.\n\nNow, let's check the table to see if these are accurate. I'll go row by row.\n\nLooking at the first row under \"position\" it says \"ends\", with names \"bennie oosterbaan mike tully\". So Oosterbaan and Tully are listed under ends, not tackles. That seems important because the claim states they were tackles, which would make that part false.\n\nNext, looking for Weir and Chase. The second row is for \"tackles\", listing \"ed weir ralph chase\". Wait, so according to this, Weir and Chase are tackles as well. But the claim says they play halfback, which isn't correct based on the table.
