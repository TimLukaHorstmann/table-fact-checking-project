The claim states: \"the game at arden street oval have a smaller crowd than the game at junction oval.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant rows in the table where the venues are Arden Street Oval and Junction Oval.

For Junction Oval (row 5), the crowd is 22413. Comparing these two numbers, 8733 is indeed smaller than 22413. Therefore, the claim that the game at Arden Street Oval had a smaller crowd than the one at Junction Oval is true.\n\nI also need to identify which cells are relevant for this conclusion.

So, the task is to determine if the claim \"the crowd at moorabbin oval be bigger than the crowd at arden street oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim compares two venues: Moorabbin Oval and Arden Street Oval. Specifically, it's about which venue had a larger crowd on that date.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows, each representing a different match with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd number, and date. The relevant columns for this claim are \"venue\" and \"crowd\".\n\nI'll start by identifying the rows where the venue is Moorabbin Oval and Arden Street Oval. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Venue is Moorabbin Oval. The crowd here is 16,205.\n2. **Row 1**: Venue is MCG. Not relevant.\n3. **Row 2**: Venue is Victoria Park. Also not relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Venue is Kardinia Park. Not relevant.\n5. **Row 4**: Venue is Arden Street Oval. The crowd here is 8,733.\n6. **Row 5**: Venue is Junction Oval. Not relevant.\n\nSo, the two relevant rows are row 0 (Moorabbin Oval) and row 4 (Arden Street Oval). Their respective crowd numbers are 16,205 and 8,733.\n\nNow, comparing these two numbers: 16,205 is greater than 8,733. Therefore, the crowd at Moorabbin Oval was indeed bigger than that at Arden Street Oval on the given date.\n\nI should also make sure I'm not mixing up any other rows or columns. The venues are correctly identified, and the crowd numbers are clearly provided. There's no ambiguity in the data presented here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Moorabbin Oval had a larger crowd than Arden Street Oval on 21 August 1971 based on the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the game at victoria park have a larger crowd than the combined crowd of kardinia park and mcg.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part means. I need to find three specific games: one at Victoria Park, another at Kardinia Park, and the third at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground). For each of these venues, I'll look up their crowd numbers from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, let's scan through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about St Kilda vs South Melbourne at Moorabbin Oval with a crowd of 16,205.\n2. The second row is Melbourne vs Richmond at MCG with a crowd of 37,732.\n3. The third row is Collingwood vs Hawthorn at Victoria Park with a crowd of 41,312.\n4. The fourth row is Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park with a crowd of 17,864.\n5. The fifth and sixth rows are about North Melbourne vs Essendon and Fitzroy vs Carlton, but these aren't relevant because their venues aren't part of the claim.\n\nSo, from this, I can extract the necessary data:\n\n- Victoria Park: 41,312\n- Kardinia Park: 17,864\n- MCG: 37,732\n\nThe next step is to calculate the combined crowd for Kardinia Park and MCG. That would be 17,864 (Kardinia) plus 37,732 (MCG). Let me add those numbers:\n\n17,864 + 37,732 = 55,596.\n\nNow, I compare this combined number to the crowd at Victoria Park. The crowd at Victoria Park is 41,312, and the combined total of Kardinia Park and MCG is 55,596.\n\nWait a minute, that means 41,312 (Victoria Park) is less than 55,596 (Kardinia + MCG). So, the claim says that Victoria Park's crowd is larger than the combined crowds of Kardinia Park and MCG.

It says that the crowd size at Junction Oval is two times larger than at Kardinia Park. That means I need to compare the crowd numbers for both venues.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows with different venues and their corresponding crowd numbers. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has \"moorabbin oval\" with a crowd of 16205.\n2. The second row is \"mcg\" with 37732 people.\n3.

The sixth row is about \"junction oval\" where the crowd was 22413.\n\nSo, I need to focus on the two venues mentioned in the claim: Junction Oval and Kardinia Park. From the table:\n\n- Junction Oval had a crowd of 22,413.\n- Kardinia Park had a crowd of 17,864.\n\nNow, let's calculate if 22,413 is two times larger than 17,864. To check this, I'll multiply the Kardinia Park crowd by 2 and see if it equals or is less than the Junction Oval number.\n\nCalculating: 17,864 * 2 = 35,728.\n\nBut wait, Junction Oval's crowd was only 22,413, which is much less than 35,728. So actually, 22,413 is not two times larger than 17,864; in fact, it's about 25% more.
