    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"didi benami sing the song choice angel before lean on me\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim suggests that Didi Benami sang the song \"angel\" before she sang \"lean on me.\" So, I'm looking for two things: whether both songs are present in the table and if \"angel\" appears before \"lean on me.\"\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row to find these songs. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few rows are about auditions and Hollywood weeks, but none of them have the song choices I'm looking for.\n- In week 5 (Top 24), the song is \"the way i am.\"\n- Week 6 (Top 20) has \"lean on me.\" So that's one song in question here.\n- Week 7 (Top 16) features \"rhiannon,\" which isn't relevant.\n- Week 8 (Top 12) has \"play with fire.\"\n- Finally, week 9 (Top 11) lists \"you're no good.\"\n\nWait a minute, I don't see \"angel\" anywhere in the table. The claim mentions that Didi Benami sang \"angel,\" but according to this table, \"angel\" isn't listed under any of the weeks or song choices. \n\nLet me double-check. Scanning through each row again: audition, Hollywood rounds, Top 24, Top 20, Top 16, Top 12, Top 11. None of these have \"angel\" as a song choice. The closest is week 3's group performance with \"no one,\" but that's not it either.\n\nSince the table doesn't include any entry for the song \"angel,\" I can't confirm whether Didi Benami sang it before or after \"lean on me.\" Without both songs being present, especially since one isn't listed at all, the claim can't be verified as TRUE. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be supported because \"angel\" is not found in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

So, the task is to determine if the claim \"no one be not the last song choice for didi benami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems a bit unclear because of possible typos or grammatical issues. Maybe it's meant to say something like \"No One was not the last song choice for Didi Benami.\" So perhaps the user intended to ask whether \"no one\" was not the last song that Didi Benami chose.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several entries with the song \"no one\" by Alicia Keys in the Hollywood week. The row index for that entry is 2 (since indexing starts at 0). But wait, the claim mentions \"didi benami.\" Is there any mention of Didi Benami in the table? Let me check all rows.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Week: audition, hollywood, etc.\n- Themes include auditioner's choice, first solo, group performance, etc.\n- Song choices are Hey Jude, terrified, no one, angel, the way I am, lean on me, rhiannon, play with fire, you're no good.\n\nWait, none of these song choices mention Didi Benami. The original artists listed include The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, and Betty Everett. No Didi Benami there either.\n\nSo the table doesn't have any information about someone named Didi Benami. Without that data, I can't verify if \"no one\" was her last song choice or not because she's not present in the data provided. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the given table.\n\nThe relevant cells would include any mentions of Didi Benami, but since there are none, perhaps the columns related to song choices and artists where such a name might appear. But in this case, there's nothing relevant because she isn't listed at all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Didi Benami, who is not present in the table, making it impossible to verify.

It seems like there's a typo and some missing words. The intended meaning might be that \"the way I am\" is one of three songs chosen under the theme \"Billboard Hot 100 hits.\" So, I should check how many song choices fall under that specific theme.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"theme\" column. Let's go through each row and see which ones have the theme as \"billboard hot 100 hits.\"\n\nRow indices start from 0, so let me list them out:\n\n- Row 4: Theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\", song choice is \"the way i am.\"\n- Row 5: Theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\", song choice is \"lean on me.\"\n- Row 6: Theme is \"billboard hot 100 hits\", song choice is \"rhiannon.\"\n\nSo, that's three songs under the same theme.

The claim is: \"didi benami be number 5 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women).\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked here. It seems like the claim is saying that Didi Benami was number 5 in order during two specific weeks: \"top 20 (10 women)\" and \"top 16 (8 women)\". So I need to check if in both of these weeks, the order column shows 5 for her.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nThe table has several rows with different weeks. Let me scan through each row to see which ones correspond to \"top 20 (10 women)\" and \"top 16 (8 women)\". \n\nI start from the top:\n- The first few rows are about auditions and Hollywood weeks, so I can skip those as they don't match the claim's weeks.\n- Then there's a row for \"top 24 (12 women)\", which is not relevant here.\n- Next is \"top 20 (10 women)\" with order number 5. The song choice here is \"lean on me\" by Bill Withers, and the result was safe.\n- After that, there's a row for \"top 16 (8 women)\" where the order is also 5. The song chosen here is \"rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac, and the result was safe.\n\nNow, looking at these two rows, both have an order of 5. But wait, does that mean Didi Benami was in both? Or are these entries for different artists?\n\nWait a second, I don't see any mention of Didi Benami in the table. The original artists listed are The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac, and Betty Everett. There's no row that mentions Didi Benami as either a song choice or an artist.\n\nSo if the claim is about her being number 5 in both weeks, but she isn't present in any of these rows, then the claim must be false because there's no evidence supporting it in the table.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the relevant cells are those two order columns where the value is 5.

It seems like it's saying that \"Terrified\" was one of the songs she sang during the week with a Hollywood theme.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where the 'theme' is 'hollywood'. Let me check each row:\n\n1. The first row is about audition week, so not relevant.\n2. The second row has 'hollywood' as the week and 'first solo' as the theme. The song here is 'terrified', performed by Katharine McPhee.\n3. The third row is also hollywood themed with a group performance of 'no one'.\n4. The fourth row again is hollywood, second solo, singing 'angel'.\n\nSo in the Hollywood week(s), there are multiple songs: terrified, no one, and angel. The claim specifically mentions 'terrified', which is indeed one of them.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that this song was sung by her (assuming 'she' refers to the singer).

It seems like there might be a typo in the name, possibly referring to \"Demi Benami,\" but since that's not mentioned in the table, I'll focus on identifying any relevant information about the songs \"No One\" and \"Hey Jude.\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents different weeks of auditions or performances with details like theme, song choice, original artist, order, and result. My task is to check if \"No One\" was performed before \"Hey Jude\" as per the claim.\n\nI'll go through the rows one by one:\n\n1. **Audition Week**: The song is \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles.\n2. **Hollywood Week (First Solo)**: The song is \"Terrified.\"\n3. **Hollywood Week (Group Performance)**: Here, the song is \"No One\" by Alicia Keys.\n\nFrom this, I can see that \"No One\" was performed during the group performance in Hollywood week, which comes after the audition round where \"Hey Jude\" was sung. Therefore, according to the table, \"No One\" was actually performed after \"Hey Jude,\" not before.\n\nAdditionally, there's no mention of \"Demi Benami\" or any indication that she sang either song.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear at first glance. The phrase \"no one be the last song choice\" might mean that \"No One\" was chosen as a song, and it wasn't the last song for someone named Didi Benami. Alternatively, maybe it's stating that \"No One\" isn't the last song associated with her. I think the intended meaning is to check if the song \"No One\" by Alicia Keys (from the table) is not the last song choice for Didi Benami.\n\nLooking at the table, let's see which rows are relevant. The claim mentions a specific song, \"no one,\" so I should look for that in the 'song choice' column. Scanning through, I find it in row 2: \"no one\" by Alicia Keys, under the Hollywood week with a group performance.\n\nNow, does this relate to Didi Benami? The table doesn't have any mention of her name at all. All the original artists are listed as The Beatles, Katharine McPhee, Alicia Keys, Sarah McLachlan, etc., but none of them is Didi Benami. So, the song \"No One\" by Alicia Keys isn't associated with Didi Benami in this table.\n\nThe claim states that \"no one be the last song choice for didi benami.\" Since there's no entry for Didi Benami in the table, and her name doesn't appear anywhere, it seems that the claim is pointing out a fact not present. Therefore, the statement holds true because there's no evidence contradicting it; in other words, since she isn't listed, \"no one\" can't be her last song choice as per the data here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The relevant cell is row 2 where the song is \"No One.\" Since Didi Benami isn't mentioned anywhere else, and that's the only occurrence of \"No One,\" the claim is TRUE because there's no indication she chose or was associated with this song as her last choice.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not mention Didi Benami at all.

The task is to determine if the claim \"didi benami be number 4 in order for both week top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women)\" is true or false using the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents a different week with various details. The columns include 'week', 'theme', 'song choice', 'original artist', 'order', and 'result'. \n\nThe claim mentions \"didi benami\" being number 4 in order for two specific weeks: top 20 (10 women) and top 16 (8 women). I need to check if these weeks exist in the table and what their corresponding order values are.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first few rows are about auditions and Hollywood weeks, which don't seem relevant here.\n2. Then there's a row for top 24 (12 women) with an order of 9.\n3.

Also, I don't see any mention of \"didi benami\" in the table at all. The names listed under 'original artist' are different artists like Ingrid Michaelson, Bill Withers, etc.\n\nSo, putting this together: the claim is about didi benami being number 4 in two specific weeks, but the table shows order 5 for both of those weeks and doesn't mention didi benami anywhere. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nI should structure my response with \"answer\": \"FALSE\" since the claim is not supported.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the way i am be one of 5 song choice with the theme billboard hot 100 hit\". So, there are two main points here:\n\n1. The song \"The Way I Am\" is a song choice.\n2. It is one of five such songs under the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\".\n\nI'll start by looking at the table to find where \"The Way I Am\" appears. Scanning through the 'song choice' column, I see that it's listed in row index 4 (since we start counting from 0). The corresponding 'theme' for this row is indeed \"billboard hot 100 hits\".\n\nNext, I need to check how many song choices fall under the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\". Looking through each row:\n\n- Row 4: Theme is billboard hot 100 hits.\n- Row 5: Same theme, with \"lean on me\".\n- Row 6: Also same theme, featuring \"rhiannon\".\n\nWait, that's only three entries. Hmm, the claim says five songs. Maybe I missed some rows? Let me go through each row again.\n\nLooking at all rows:\n\n1. Audition week: theme is auditioner's choice.\n2. Hollywood week: first solo, group performance, second solo \u2013 none are billboard hot 100 hits.\n3. Top 24 (row 4): billboard hot 100 hits.\n4. Top 20 (row 5): same theme.\n5. Top 16 (row 6): same theme.\n6. Top 12: theme is the rolling stones, so different.\n7. Top 11: billboard 1 hits, which might be a typo for hot 100 but not exactly matching.\n\nSo only three rows have the theme \"billboard hot 100 hits\". Therefore, there are three song choices under that theme, not five as the claim suggests.

So, I need to determine whether the claim \"terrified be one of the song she sing in the week with a bollywood theme\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two main things: the song \"terrified\" and a specific week theme related to Bollywood. \n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are several weeks listed with their corresponding themes, song choices, original artists, order numbers, and results. My goal is to check if \"terrified\" was sung in the week where the theme was Bollywood.\n\nLet me go through each row of the table:\n\n1. The first row is the audition week. The theme here is \"auditioner's choice,\" and the song is \"hey jude.\" This doesn't match our criteria, so I can skip this one.\n\n2. Moving on to the second row: it's the Hollywood week with a theme of \"first solo\" and the song \"terrified\" by Katharine McPhee. The result here is \"advanced,\" but I'm more interested in the theme. Wait a minute, the theme here is \"first solo,\" not Bollywood.\n\n3. Next is another Hollywood week, this time for a group performance with the song \"no one\" by Alicia Keys. Again, the theme isn't Bollywood.\n\n4. The fourth row is also Hollywood week, second solo with \"angel\" by Sarah McLachlan. Still no mention of a Bollywood theme here.\n\nNow, looking at the subsequent rows: top 24, top 20, top 16, top 12, and top 11 weeks all have themes related to Billboard hits or The Rolling Stones. None of these are associated with a Bollywood theme either.\n\nWait, but I just realized that there's a \"hollywood\" week mentioned twice. Let me double-check if any of those had a Bollywood theme. No, both Hollywood entries have themes like first solo and group performance, not Bollywood.\n\nSo, from the table, I can see that \"terrified\" was sung in the Hollywood week with the theme \"first solo,\" but there's no row where the theme is Bollywood. Therefore, the song \"terrified\" wasn't performed during a week with a Bollywood theme as per the data provided.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because while \"terrified\" was indeed a song choice (as seen in row index 1), it wasn't associated with a Bollywood-themed week.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"theme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song choice\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
