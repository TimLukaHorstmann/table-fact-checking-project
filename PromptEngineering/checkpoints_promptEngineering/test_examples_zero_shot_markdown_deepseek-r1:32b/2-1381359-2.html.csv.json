    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"at the national stadium tokyo venue , during season 1995 - 6 detail , the title be 32nd and the runner up be waseda.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the components of the claim. There are a few key points here:\n\n1. The venue is the National Stadium in Tokyo.\n2. The season is 1995-6 details.\n3. The title (which I assume refers to the event or competition) is the 32nd.\n4. The runner-up is Waseda.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I see that it's organized with rows for each season and columns including 'title', 'season', 'winner', 'score', 'runner - up', 'venue', and 'attendance'. \n\nI need to find the row where the season matches \"1995 - 6 details.\" Scanning through the 'season' column, I see that in row index 2 (assuming rows are zero-indexed), the season is listed as \"1995-6 details\". Let me check: the table starts at the 30th title in 1993-4 details. So row 0 is 30th, row 1 is 31st, and row 2 is 32nd with season 1995-6. Wait, no, actually looking again:\n\nWait, let me recount the rows properly. The first data row after the header is 30th title (row 0), then 31st (row 1), up to row 49 for the 49th title. So the 32nd title would be in row index 2.\n\nIn row index 2, checking the season: yes, it's \"1995 - 6 details.\" The venue is indeed \"national stadium , tokyo  , tokyo\" which matches the claim's venue. \n\nThe claim says the title is 32nd. Looking at the 'title' column in row 2, it's listed as 32nd, so that checks out.\n\nNext, the runner-up should be Waseda. In the same row, under 'runner - up', it says \"waseda\". So that matches too.\n\nSo all parts of the claim are supported by this specific row in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let's break down the claim: \"the season 2010-11 detail have a title of 47th and the runner-up be waseda.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row that corresponds to the season 2010-11 details. Scanning through the table rows, each has a 'season' column. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 0: 30th, 1993-4\nRow 1: 31st, 1994-5\n...\nRow 21: 47th, 2010-11. Yes, that's the one.\n\nSo, row index 21 (since counting starts at 0). Now, check two things here:\n\n1. The title should be 47th.\n2. Runner-up should be waseda.\n\nLooking at the 'title' column in row 21: it's 47th. That matches.\n\nNext, the 'runner-up' column: it says \"waseda.\" So that also matches.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are satisfied.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully:\n\"During season 2000-1, kanto gakuin university be the winner, the title be 37th and the attendance be not available.\"\n\nI need to check each part of this claim against the data in the table. Let's list out the components:\n\n1. Season: 2000-1\n2. Winner: Kanto Gakuin University\n3. Title: 37th\n4. Attendance: Not Available (n/a)\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to find the row that corresponds to the season 2000-1.\n\nLooking at the \"season\" column:\n- The rows have seasons listed as numbers with years and details in parentheses.\n- For example, row 7 has \"35th | 1998-9 details\".\n- Scanning further down, I find that row 6 is labeled as \"36th\", which corresponds to the season 1999-0. Then, row 7 is \"37th\" with the season 2000-1 details.\n\nSo, the relevant row for the claim is row 7 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or one-indexed? Wait, in the table provided, it's presented as markdown without explicit indices. Let me recount: the first row after headers is row 0 if we consider index starting at 0. So, counting from 0 to how many rows there are:\n\nThe table starts with 30th season (row 0) and goes up to 49th (row 18). The claim refers to 37th, which should be row 6 if starting from 0.\n\nWait, let me recount:\nRow 0: 30th\nRow 1:31st\n...\nSo, for the 37th title, that would be row index 7? Wait no. Let's count:\n\nFrom the table as given, each row is a season starting from 30th up to 49th.\n\nThe first row is 30th (index 0), next 31st (index1), ..., so 37th would be at index 7.\n\nWait no: let's list them out:\n\nRow Index | Title\n0        |30th\n1        |31st\n2        |32nd\n3        |33rd\n4        |34th\n5        |35th\n6        |36th\n7        |37th\n\nYes, row index 7 is the 37th title.\n\nNow, checking that row:\n\nSeason: 2000-1 details. Correct as per the claim.\n\nWinner: Kanto Gakuin University? Let me check column \"winner\". For row 7 (index 6 if starting at zero?), wait no\u2014no, the table's rows are in order from 30th to 49th, so each row is one season. So, row 7 would be 37th.\n\nLooking at the data for row 7:\n\n- Title:37th\n- Season:2000-1 details.\n- Winner: Kanto Gakuin University\n- Attendance: n/a\n\nSo all parts of the claim are correct based on this row.\n\nNow, to map which cells correspond to each part:\n\nFor the season \"2000-1\", we look at column \"season\" in row 7 (index 6? Wait, no\u2014if the first data row is index 0 as 30th, then 37th would be row index 7. So row_index=7.\n\nBut let me verify:\n\nLooking back: the table's headers are the columns: Title, Season, Winner, Runner-up, Attendance.\n\nThe rows start at 30th season (row 0), so 31st is row1, ..., 37th is row6? Wait no\u2014if 30th is index0, then:\n\nRow 0:30th\n\nRow1:31st\n\n...\n\nSo 30 + n = title number. So for 37th, it's 37-30=7 rows down. Therefore, row_index=7.\n\nWait no: because from 30 to 37 is 8 entries (including both), so the index would be 7. For example:\n\nRow 0:30\n\nRow1:31\n\n...\n\nRow6:36\n\nRow7:37\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo row_index=7.\n\nNow, for each part of the claim:\n\n- Season:2000-1 \u2014 column \"Season\" in row7.\n- Winner: Kanto Gakuin University \u2014 column \"Winner\" in row7.\n- Title:37th \u2014 column \"Title\" in row7.\n- Attendance:n/a \u2014 column \"Attendance\" in row7.\n\nThus, all relevant cells are in row7 across the four columns mentioned.\n\nSo each of these four aspects is checked against that row. Since all match, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant_cells:\n\nEach cell corresponds to a check:\n\n1. Season: row7, column \"Season\"\n2. Winner: row7, column \"Winner\"\n3. Title: row7, column \"Title\"\n4. Attendance: row7, column \"Attendance\"\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are four in total.\n\nSo the JSON response will have answer \"TRUE\" and list all these cells.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}",

I need to determine if the claim \"meiji win the 32nd title, while waseda be the runner-up\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: title, season, winner, score, runner-up, venue, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific edition of what seems to be a sports competition, likely the Koshien baseball tournament given the context of Japanese universities.\n\nThe claim mentions two key points:\n1. Meiji won the 32nd title.\n2. Waseda was the runner-up in that same edition.\n\nTo verify these points, I need to locate the row corresponding to the \"32nd\" title. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The rows start from the 30th title and go up to the 49th. So, looking for the row where the 'title' column is \"32nd\".\n\nLooking at the third row (index starting at 0), I see:\n| 32nd     | 1995  - 6 details   | meiji                    | 43  - 9   | waseda                   | national stadium, tokyo, tokyo | n / a         |\n\nSo, for row index 2 (since the first row is index 0), the 'title' is \"32nd\", 'winner' is \"meiji\", and 'runner-up' is \"waseda\". \n\nThis directly supports both parts of the claim: Meiji did win the 32nd title, and Waseda was indeed the runner-up.\n\nNo discrepancies are found between the claim and the data in the table.

The claim states: \"2010 - 11 detail season have a runner-up of tokai, and a title of 47th.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific details about a particular season:\n1. The runner-up is \"tokai.\"\n2. The title is \"47th.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for \"title,\" \"season,\" \"runner-up,\" and others. Each row represents a different season with corresponding details.\n\nI'll start by locating the season that corresponds to \"2010 - 11 details.\" Scanning through the \"season\" column, I see entries like \"30th: 1993-4 details,\" \"31st: 1994-5 details,\" and so on. The pattern seems to be that each season entry starts with a number followed by the years it covers.\n\nLooking for \"2010 - 11 details,\" I find it in row 47th (which is index 26 if we start counting from 0). So, this row should have all the relevant information needed to verify the claim.\n\nNow, let's check the two parts of the claim against this specific row.\n\nFirst part: Runner-up is tokai. Looking at the \"runner-up\" column for that row, it says \"tokai.\" That matches the claim exactly, so that condition is satisfied.\n\nSecond part: Title is 47th. The title column in that same row shows \"47th,\" which directly corresponds to the claim's statement about the title. This also checks out.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table under the correct season, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"runner - up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

For example, the 30th season was in 1993-4.\n\nI need to find which row corresponds to the 2010-11 details. Scanning through:\n\n- Row 37: Season is \"2000 - 1 details\" (title is 37th)\nWait, that's not matching 2010-11. Let me check further.\n\nLooking at row indices 36 to 48:\n- The seasons go from 2000 onwards. Let's find the one with \"2010 - 11 details\".\n\nChecking each row:\n\nRow index 47: Season is \"2010 - 11 details\". That matches the season part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the details for this row:\n- Winner: teikyo\n- Attendance: 25458 (not n/a)\n- Title: 47th\n\nWait a second. The claim says \"title of 37th\", but the row with \"2010 - 11 details\" is actually the 47th title. That's a discrepancy.\n\nSo, let me double-check if there's another entry for the 37th title:\n\nLooking back to earlier rows:\n\nRow index 3: Season \"2000 - 1 details\", title 37th? Wait no, row indices start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. The table is from row 0 (30th) up to row 49 (49th). So the 37th title would be in row index 37 - 30 = 7? Wait no, because the first row is 30th.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 30th\nRow 1: 31st\n...\nRow 7: 37th\n\nYes, so row index 7 corresponds to the 37th title. Checking that row:\n\nSeason is \"2000 - 1 details\", winner is Kanto Gakuin University, attendance n/a.\n\nSo for the claim:\n\n- Season should be 2010-11: but in row 47, season is 2010-11, title is 47th.\n- The 37th title (row 7) has season \"2000 - 1 details\", which is different from the claim's 2010-11.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that in the 2010-11 season, Kanto Gakuin won with n/a attendance and title 37th. However, the data shows that in 2010-11 (row 47), the winner was Teikyo, attendance was 25458, and it's the 47th title.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because all the details do not match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the 37th season in 2010-11 had Kanto Gakuin as winner with n/a attendance. However, checking row 47 shows a different season and details. The correct 37th title is in row 7 with season \"2000 - 1\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 47, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"tenri be the winner in the game that have teikyo as the runner-up.\" So, I need to check if there's a row where the winner is tenri and the runner-up is teikyo.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table one by one. Starting from the top:\n\n- The first few rows (30th to 49th) have various winners like meiji, daito bunka university, keio, etc., but none of them are tenri or teikyo as runner-up in those early rows.\n  \nAs I go further down:\n  \nLooking at the later rows, around row index 20 onwards. Let's see:\n\nRow index 35: 46th season, winner is teikyo, runner-up is tokai. Not relevant.\n\nRow index 36 (47th): Winner is teikyo, runner-up is waseda. Still not tenri as a winner with teikyo as runner-up.\n\nRow index 37 (48th): Winner is teikyo again, runner-up is tenri. Wait, that's interesting because here the runner-up is tenri, but the winner is still teikyo. So in this case, the claim would be if tenri was the winner when teikyo was runner-up. But in this row, it's the opposite.\n\nThen, looking at row index 38 (49th): Winner is teikyo, runner-up is tsukuba. Still not matching the claim.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something earlier. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back from the start. The table starts with rows where the winner and runner-up are different universities. It's only around row index 28 (40th season) that we see waseda as a winner against kanto gakuin university.\n\nContinuing, looking for any instance where tenri is the winner and teikyo is the runner-up.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow index 35: 46th season, winner is teikyo, runner-up tokai. Not relevant.\n\nRow index 36: 47th, winner teikyo, runner-up waseda.\n\nRow index 37: 48th, winner teikyo, runner-up tenri.\n\nWait a minute! In row index 37 (48th season), the runner-up is tenri, but the winner is teikyo. So that's not what we're looking for. We need a row where tenri is the winner and teikyo is the runner-up.\n\nContinuing further:\n\nRow index 38: 49th season, winner teikyo again.\n\nHmm, I don't see any row in the table where tenri is listed as the winner with teikyo as the runner-up. The closest is when tenri is the runner-up to teikyo in row 37 (48th). But that's the opposite of what the claim says.\n\nSo based on this, there's no instance where tenri wins against teikyo as runner-up. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_ cells\": [{\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"}, {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"winner\"}]}",

Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Title of 32nd**: This means we're looking for the row where the \"title\" column says \"32nd\".\n2. **Runner-up is Hosei**: In that specific row, the runner-up should be Hosei.\n3. **Meiji is the loser**: The claim states Meiji lost this game, so we need to check if Meiji is either the winner or the runner-up.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The \"title\" column has entries from 30th to 49th, so I'll scan for the row where title is 32nd.\n- Found it: Row index 2 (since counting starts at 0). Let me check that row:\n   - Title: 32nd\n   - Winner: Meiji\n   - Runner-up: Waseda\n\nWait a minute, according to this row, the winner is Meiji and the runner-up is Waseda. The claim says Hosei was the runner-up in the 32nd title game. But according to the table, it's Waseda who was the runner-up.\n\nSo, the runner-up isn't Hosei as claimed; instead, it's Waseda. That means Meiji won this game, not lost. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because both conditions (Meiji being the loser and Hosei as runner-up) aren't met in the table.\n\nSo, I need to mark this claim as FALSE. The relevant cells are from row 2 where title is 32nd, checking for winner and runner-up.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Meiji lost a game with the title of 32nd and Hosei as the runner-up. However, in the table, the 32nd title's runner-up is Waseda, not Hosei, and Meiji was the winner.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runner-up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
