Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two main things: the episode title \"the fallen star\" and its corresponding series number being 20. So I need to check if in the table, the episode titled \"the fallen star\" has a series number of 20.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's organized with columns for episode, series, episode title, original air date, and production code. Each row represents an episode with its details.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find where the episode title is \"the fallen star.\" Let me go through them one by one:\n\nRow 0: Return to Genesis\nRow 1: The Suspension\nRow 2: A team reinvented\n...\nContinuing down, I reach row 25 (since counting starts from 0). Row 24 has episode number 49 and series 23 with title \"destiny\". Then row 25 is episode 50, series 24 titled \"final preparations\". Wait, that doesn't seem right because the claim is about \"the fallen star.\"\n\nWait a second, I think I might have missed it. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Episode 27\nRow 1: 28\n...\nRow 24: Episode 50 (series 24)\nRow 25: Episode 51 (series 25, title \"a team unravels\")\n\nWait, I'm not seeing \"the fallen star\" in the table. Let me check again. Oh, wait, looking back at the table, maybe I overlooked it.\n\nLooking at row 20: episode 46, series 20, titled \"the fallen star\". Yes, that's the one. So row index 20 (since rows start from 0) is where the episode title is \"the fallen star\".\n\nNow, checking the series number for that row. The series column in that row has the value 20. So yes, the series number of \"the fallen star\" is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"series number 8 have a production code of 208\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: episode, series, episode title, original air date, and production code. Each row represents an individual episode with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions two pieces of information: series number 8 and a production code of 208. My goal is to verify if these two match in the table.\n\nI'll start by locating all rows where the \"series\" column has the value 8. Scanning through the \"series\" numbers, I notice that they increment from 1 upwards. Each series number corresponds to an episode, so for each row, I check if the \"series\" value is 8.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row indices go from 0 (the first data row after headers) up to 23.\n- The series numbers increase by 1 with each subsequent row.\n\nI find that in row index 7, the \"series\" column has the value 8. Let me confirm: \n\nRow index 7 corresponds to episode number 34, series number 8. The production code for this row is listed as 208. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check if there are any other rows with series number 8. Scanning through, it appears that each series number corresponds to a single episode, so there's only one entry where series is 8. Therefore, there's no ambiguity here.\n\nSince the claim states that series 8 has production code 208 and we've verified that in row index 7, this information aligns perfectly. There are no discrepancies or other entries with conflicting data that could cause confusion.\n\nIn summary, after carefully reviewing the relevant cells in the table, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"production code\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nThe claim mentions two pieces of information: the episode number (28) and its title (\"the suspension\"). So, I need to check if in the table, the row where \"episode\" is 28 has an \"episode title\" of \"the suspension\".\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: episode, series, episode title, original air date, production code. Each row corresponds to a specific episode.\n\nI'll go through each row and find the one where the \"episode\" number is 28. Scanning down:\n\n- The first few rows have episodes 27, 28, 29... So, episode 28 should be in the second row (row index starts at 0? Or does it start at 1? Wait, let me check how the table is presented.\n\nWait, looking back, the table has row indices as per markdown. Let me recount:\n\nThe first data row after the header is episode 27, which would be row index 0. Then the next row is episode 28, so that's row index 1. Yes, because in programming, indexes often start at 0.\n\nSo, checking row index 1: The \"episode\" column has value 28, and the \"episode title\" is \"the suspension\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. Now, I need to identify the relevant cells that were checked. These are the two columns in that specific row: \"episode\" (to confirm it's episode 28) and \"episode title\" (to verify the title).\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be:\n- For the \"episode\" column at row index 1\n- For the \"episode title\" column at the same row.\n\nPutting this together, I should structure my JSON response accordingly.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because episode 28 in the table has the title \"the suspension\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: episode, series, episode title, original air date, and production code. Each row represents a specific episode with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions three pieces of information: episode number 40, series number 14, and the title \"new order.\" My task is to check if these three elements align correctly in any single row of the table.\n\nI'll start by searching for episode 40. Scanning through the 'episode' column, I find that episode 40 is listed in row index 16 (since counting starts at 0). Let me confirm: rows go from 0 to 25 because there are 26 entries (episodes 27 to 51). So, row 16 would be the 17th entry. Wait, actually, let me recount: starting from row 0 as episode 27, each subsequent row increases by one. So episode 40 should be at row index 40 - 27 = 13? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because if I count:\n\nRow 0: Episode 27\nRow 1: 28\n...\nRow 13 would be Episode 27 + 13 = 40. Yes, so row index 13 is where episode 40 is.\n\nNow, looking at that row (index 13), the series number is listed as 14 under the 'series' column. That matches the claim's series number of 14. \n\nNext, I check the 'episode title.' In row 13, the title is \"new order,\" which exactly matches the claim.\n\nSince all three pieces of information\u2014episode number, series number, and episode title\u2014are correctly aligned in row index 13, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode 40, part of series 14, is titled \"new order.\" Checking the table:\n\n- Episode 40 corresponds to row index 13.\n- In this row, the series number is indeed 14 and the title matches.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like 'episode', 'series', 'episode title', 'original air date', and 'production code'. The claim is about episode 31, specifically whether it aired originally on April 19, 2008.\n\nI should start by locating episode 31 in the table. Scanning through the 'episode' column, I find that episode 31 is listed there. Now, for each row, I need to check if the 'episode' number matches 31 and then look at its corresponding 'original air date'.\n\nLooking at the rows, the first few entries are episodes 27 to 30. Then, the next entry is episode 31 in row index 4 (since counting starts from 0). Let me confirm: row 4 has episode number 31, series 5, title \"the homecoming\", original air date \"19 april 2008\", and production code 205.\n\nSo the claim states that episode 31 aired on April 19, 2008. From the table, the 'original air date' for episode 31 is indeed April 19, 2008. Therefore, the information in the table supports the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any discrepancies or other episodes with the same number to ensure accuracy.

The table has information about episodes of a series, including episode numbers, series numbers, titles, air dates, and production codes.\n\nThe claim is: \"the title of the episode with series number 14 be new rule.\" So, I need to check two things here: first, find the episode that corresponds to series number 14. Then, verify if its title is \"new rule.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like 'episode', 'series', 'episode title', etc. The rows are numbered from 27 to 51. So, each row represents an individual episode with specific details.\n\nI'll start by scanning through the 'series' column to find where series number 14 is located. Going down the list:\n\n- Series numbers go up incrementally from 1 to 25 as the episodes progress. \n- Episode 40 has a series number of 14, which I can see in row index 13 (since counting starts at 0 for the first row after the header).\n\nNow that I've identified the correct episode (row index 13), I'll check its 'episode title'.

The claim says: \"208.0 be the production code of the episode with series 9.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's stating that the production code 208 corresponds to the episode in series 9.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan for the row where 'series' is 9. Scanning down the 'series' column, I see that when series number is 9, the corresponding row has episode number 35 and the title \"the all- stars.\" The production code listed there is 209.\n\nWait a minute, that's not matching. So according to the table, series 9 has production code 209, not 208. Now I should check where production code 208 is located. Looking at the 'production code' column, 208 appears in row 34, which corresponds to series 8.\n\nTherefore, the claim that production code 208 belongs to series 9 is incorrect because it actually belongs to series 8. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo gather relevant cells: \n- The cell for series 9 and its production code (row 35, columns 'series' and 'production code').\n- The cell where production code 208 is found (row 34, column 'production code') and its corresponding series (column 'series').\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 35, 'series' and 'production code'\n- Row 34, 'series' and 'production code'\n\nBut since each object in the list can only have one row index and column name, I'll list all four cells: for series 9 (row 35), production code of series 9 (209), and the series where production code 208 is found (series 8) along with its production code.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that production code 208 corresponds to series 9, but the table shows it belongs to series 8.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: episode, series, episode title, original air date, and production code. Each row represents a specific episode with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"episode 7,\" so I need to find which row corresponds to episode number 7. Looking through the 'episode' column:\n\n- Episode 27 is series 1\n- Episode 28 is series 2\n- ...\n- Episode 33 is series 7\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing because the episodes are numbered from 27 onwards, but series numbers go up to 25. So each row corresponds to an individual episode, with 'series' as another identifier.\n\nSo, for \"episode 7,\" I think it refers to the seventh entry in the table, not necessarily the episode number being 7. Let me check the rows:\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\nRow 0: Episode 27 (series 1)\nRow 1: Episode 28 (series 2)\nRow 2: Episode 29 (series 3)\nRow 3: Episode 30 (series 4)\nRow 4: Episode 31 (series 5)\nRow 5: Episode 32 (series 6)\nRow 6: Episode 33 (series 7)\n\nWait, so row 6 is series 7. So the claim refers to episode number 7 in the table? Or is it referring to an episode titled 'episode 7'? Hmm, perhaps I should clarify.\n\nBut the claim says \"episode 7,\" which probably means the seventh episode in the sequence of episodes listed. The first row (row index 0) is episode 27, then each subsequent row increments by one. So row index 6 would be episode 33, series 7.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: perhaps \"episode 7\" refers to the seventh entry in the table, which is row index 6 (since counting starts at 0). Let me check that row:\n\nRow 6:\nEpisode number: 33\nSeries: 7\nTitle: Doubts within\nOriginal air date: 26 April 2008\n\nWait, but the claim says the original air date is 19 April 2008. So according to this, it's incorrect because row 6 has 26 April.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"episode 7\" refers to series 7. Let me check that:\n\nLooking for series 7: that would be episode 33 (row index 6), same as above.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the user is referring to the seventh episode in the overall numbering of episodes beyond what's shown here? But given the table starts at episode 27, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps \"episode 7\" refers to the seventh row in the table (index 6).\n\nWait, but looking back at the claim: \"the original airdate of episode 7 be 19 april 2008\". So perhaps they are referring to an episode that is the 7th in some sequence. Let me check all rows for any occurrence where the original air date is 19 April 2008.\n\nLooking through the 'original air date' column:\n\n- Row 4: 19 April 2008 (episode 31, series 5)\n\nSo episode 31 has an air date of 19 April. Now, what's episode number in terms of the table? It's row index 4.\n\nWait, but the claim is about \"episode 7.\" So if row 4 is episode 31 (series 5), that doesn't align with being episode 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant series 5 instead of 7. Because in that case, row index 4 has the air date of 19 April 2008, which matches the claim's date but not the episode number.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table lists episodes starting from 27 and going up. Each row is a separate episode. The 'episode' column is the actual episode number, so if someone refers to \"episode 7,\" that would imply looking for an episode with number 7. But in the given table, all episodes start at 27 and go higher.\n\nTherefore, there's no episode numbered 7 in this table. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because such an episode doesn't exist here. Alternatively, maybe \"episode 7\" refers to series 7, which is row index 6 (air date 26 April), not 19 April.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\n- Row 4: Episode 31, series 5, air date 19 April.\nSo if someone mistakenly referred to episode 31 as \"episode 7,\" that would be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to series 7 (row 6), but the air date there is 26 April.\n\nTherefore, the claim's original air date of 19 April doesn't match any episode numbered 7 in this table because such an episode isn't present. The closest is row 4, which has the correct date but is for series 5 (episode 31).\n\nSo since there's no episode numbered 7 with that air date, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if \"episode 7\" refers to the seventh entry in the table, which is row index 6 (air date 26 April), then it doesn't match either. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode 7 aired on 19 April 2008. Checking the table, there's no episode numbered 7. The seventh entry in the table (row index 6) is episode 33 with an air date of 26 April. The date 19 April appears for episode 31 (row index 4). Since the claim doesn't match any relevant data, it's FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
