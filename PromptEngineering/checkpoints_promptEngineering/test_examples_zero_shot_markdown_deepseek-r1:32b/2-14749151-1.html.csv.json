    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim that needs to be verified as TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than belshina.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table contains. It looks like it's about different sports teams with their respective locations, venues, capacities, and positions from 2003. Each row represents a team with details under each column.\n\nThe key here is to find the positions of \"neman\" and \"belshina\" in 2003 and compare them. The claim states that neman's position is higher than belshina's. In sports rankings, a lower numerical position typically means a better or higher rank (e.g., position 1 is higher than position 2). So if neman has a lower number in the \"position in 2003\" column compared to belshina, the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For \"neman,\" I'll scan through each row until I find the team name. Scanning down, under the \"team\" column, I see \"neman\" in row 7 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). The corresponding \"position in 2003\" is listed as 7.\n\n- Next, looking for \"belshina,\" I continue scanning and find it in row 9. Its position in 2003 is 10.\n\nNow, comparing the two positions: neman is at position 7 and belshina is at position 10. Since 7 is lower than 10, neman indeed has a higher position (i.e., better rank) than belshina in 2003. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll double-check the rows:\n\n- Row 7: team \"neman\", position 7.\n- Row 9: team \"belshina\", position 10.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the ones containing their positions in 2003 from their respective rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"torpedo - ska be 1 of 4 team with location in minsk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that \"torpedo - ska\" is one of four teams located in Minsk. So, two parts: checking if torpedo-ska is indeed a team and then counting how many teams are in Minsk.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row to find all teams with location as Minsk.\n\nRow 2: Dinamo minsk - location is Minsk.\nRow 3: Torpedo - ska - location is Minsk. So that's two so far.\nWait, row index starts from 0? Let me confirm:\n\n- Row 0: Gomel\n- Row 1: BATE Borisov\n- Row 2: Dinamo minsk (location Minsk)\n- Row 3: Torpedo - ska (location Minsk)\n- Row 4: Shakhtyor Soligorsk\n- Row 5: Torpedo Zhodino\n- Row 6: Neman Grodno\n- Row 7: Naftan Novopolotsk\n- Row 8: Dnepr Transmash Mogilev\n- Row 9: Belshina Bobruisk\n- Row 10: Dinamo Brest (Brest)\n- Row 11: Zvezda VA-BGU, location Minsk.

That's four.\n\nSo the teams in Minsk are:\nDinamo minsk (row2), Torpedo - ska (row3), Zvezda VA-BGU (row11), and MTZ-Ripo (row15). That makes four teams located in Minsk. And \"torpedo - ska\" is indeed one of them, being row 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"torpedo - ska\" is one of four teams with a location in Minsk.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"gomel have a higher capacity than belshina\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate both teams in the table. Looking through the list, I see two teams: gomel and belshina. \n\nFor gomel, the relevant information is in row 0. The capacity is listed as 11800. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext, looking for belshina. Scanning down the table, I find belshina in row 9. Their capacity is given as 3550.\n\nNow, comparing these two capacities: gomel has 11800 and belshina has 3550. Clearly, 11800 is larger than 3550. Therefore, the claim that gomel has a higher capacity than belshina holds true.\n\nI should also make sure I'm looking at the right columns. The 'capacity' column is where the numbers are, so that's correct. No other rows or columns seem relevant here since we only need the capacities of these two teams to verify the claim.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should be TRUE because 11800 > 3550.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that gomel has a higher capacity than belshina. From the table, gomel's capacity is 11800 and belshina's is 3550. Since 11800 is greater than 3550, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"capacity\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that mtz-ripo is one of two teams that have the venue 'traktor'. So, I need to check how many teams in the table have their venue as 'traktor' and see if mtz-ripo is among them.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each team's venue. \n\nStarting from the top:\n1. Gomel - Central, Gomel.\n2. Bate - City Stadium, Borisov.\n3. Dinamo Minsk - Dinamo, Minsk.\n4. Torpedo-Ska - Torpedo, Minsk.\n5. Shakhtyor - Stroitel.\n6. Torpedo - Torpedo, Zhodino.\n7. Neman - Neman.\n8. Naftan - Atlant.\n9. Dnepr-Transmash - Spartak, Mogilev.\n10. Belshina - Spartak, Bobruisk.\n11. Dinamo Brest - Osk Brestskiy.\n12. Zvezda-VA-BGU - Traktor, Minsk.\n13. Darida - Darida.\n14. Slavia - Yunost.\n15. Lokomotiv - Central, Vitebsk.\n16. MTZ-Ripo - Traktor, Minsk.\n\nSo, the teams with venue 'traktor' are Zvezda-VA-BGU and MTZ-Ripo. That's two teams. The claim says that mtz-ripo is one of these two, which is accurate because there are exactly two teams with that venue.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table to support this conclusion. \n\nFor Zvezda-VA-BGU:\n- Row index 12 (assuming rows start at 0), column 'venue' has 'traktor'.\n\nFor MTZ-Ripo:\n- Row index 15, column 'venue' is also 'traktor'.\n\nSo both these cells confirm that there are two teams with the venue 'traktor', and mtz-ripo is indeed one of them. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that MTZ-Ripo is one of two teams with the venue \"traktor.\" Checking the table, we find that both Zvezda-VA-BGU (row 12) and MTZ-Ripo (row 15) have their venues listed as \"traktor,\" confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"bate finish with a higher position than slavia in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The term \"finish with a higher position\" refers to having a better (i.e., numerically lower) rank at the end of the season. So, if bate's position in 2003 is lower than slavia's, then the claim would be TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that there are columns for each team's location, venue, capacity, and their position in 2003. The key column here is \"position in 2003,\" which indicates how well each team performed that year.\n\nNext, I'll locate the rows corresponding to bate and slavia. Scanning through the table:\n\n- For bate: It's located in Borisov, plays at City Stadium, has a capacity of 5500, and its position in 2003 is listed as 2.\n- For slavia: The team is based in Mozyr, plays at Yunost stadium, has a capacity of 5500, and their position in 2003 is 14.\n\nNow, comparing the two positions: bate is ranked 2nd, while slavia is ranked 14th. Since 2 is lower than 14, this means bate finished higher in the standings than slavia. Therefore, the claim that \"bate finish with a higher position than slavia in 2003\" holds true.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll double-check the relevant cells:\n- For bate: The row index is 1 (assuming rows start at 0), and the column is \"position in 2003.\"\n- For slavia: The row index is 13 (since it's the last entry before Locomotiv, which is row 14 but part of first league), again looking at \"position in 2003.\"\n\nYes, both positions are correctly noted as 2 and 14 respectively. There's no ambiguity here since each team has a unique position listed.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is supported by the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than lokomotiv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is comparing the positions of two teams: neman and lokomotiv in the year 2003. So, I should look at their respective \"position in 2003\" values from the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are:\n- team\n- location\n- venue\n- capacity\n- position in 2003\n\nSo, for each team, the relevant information is under the column \"position in 2003\".\n\nNext, I'll find the rows where the team is neman and lokomotiv.\n\nStarting with neman:\nI scan through the table until I find the row where team is neman. It's located at row index 6 (assuming counting starts at 0). The position in 2003 for neman is listed as 7.\n\nNow, looking for lokomotiv:\nLooking further down the table, I find that lokomotiv is at row index 14. Their position in 2003 is stated as \"first league, 1\". Wait, this seems a bit different from the other entries which are just numbers. I need to figure out what \"first league, 1\" means.\n\nIn football leagues, usually higher positions mean better rankings. So if neman has position 7 and lokomotiv is in first league with position 1, does that make their positions comparable?\n\nI think in some contexts, the first division or first league might be considered a higher tier than the second. So, \"first league\" might refer to the top division, whereas teams listed with numbers like 1-14 are in the same division as well.\n\nBut looking back at the table, most teams have numerical positions from 1 to 13 and then there's lokomotiv and mtz-ripo who are in the first league. Maybe in this context, the \"position in 2003\" for these two is indicating their placement within that first league division.\n\nSo, if neman has a position of 7, which is higher (worse) than position 1 in the same division, but lokomotiv's position is 1 in the first league. But wait, does \"first league\" mean they are in a higher league? Or is it just another way of denoting their placement within the same structure?\n\nLooking at the table again, teams like gomel have position 1, which is likely the highest position (i.e., best rank). Then lokomotiv and mtz-ripo are listed as \"first league, 1\" and \"first league, 2\". This might mean that they were in a different competition or division but within the first league.\n\nWait, perhaps all teams except lokomotiv and mtz-ripo are in the same division, while the latter two are in another. But if that's the case, comparing their positions might not be straightforward because they could be in different leagues. However, the claim is simply about their positions in 2003 without specifying the league.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"first league\" indicates a lower division. For example, in some systems, teams can be promoted or relegated between leagues. So, if lokomotiv and mtz-ripo are in the first league, maybe that's the top tier, making their position 1 better than neman's 7.\n\nWait, but \"position in 2003\" for neman is 7, which would be worse than 1. So if the claim says that neman has a higher position (i.e., lower number) than lokomotiv, then this would not be true because neman's position is 7 and lokomotiv's is first league, 1.\n\nBut I'm confused about how to interpret \"first league\". Is it better or worse? Let me think. Typically, a higher league (like Premier League in England) is more prestigious than lower leagues. So if \"first league\" is the top tier, then being in first position there would be better than being 7th in another division.\n\nBut according to the table, most teams have numerical positions, and only two teams are listed as being in the first league with their positions. It's possible that these two teams were promoted or placed higher overall compared to others.\n\nWait, looking again: The last two rows show lokomotiv at position \"first league, 1\" and mtz-ripo at \"first league, 2\". So perhaps they are the top two in their division. Meanwhile, neman is at position 7 in another division.\n\nSo, if the claim is that neman has a higher (better) position than lokomotiv, but according to this, neman's position is worse thanlok omotiv's. Because 1 is better than 7.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim says \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than lokomotiv.\" So if \"higher\" means a lower number (better rank), then neman being at 7 and lokomotiv at 1, the claim would be false because 7 is not higher (better) than 1.\n\nWait no\u2014wait, let me clarify. In sports rankings, a lower position number usually indicates a better rank. So position 1 is first place, which is better than position 2, and so on.\n\nSo if neman has a position of 7, that's worse than position 1. Therefore, the claim that neman have a higher (better) position than lokomotiv would be false because 7 > 1 in terms of rank. So neman is ranked lower.\n\nBut wait\u2014the way the claim is phrased: \"neman have a higher position in 2003 than lokomotiv.\" If by higher, they mean better rank (lower number), then no, neman's position is worse. But if higher means numerically larger, which would be a lower rank, that would complicate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The standard interpretation of \"higher\" in position is a better rank, i.e., lower numerical value.\n\nSo if neman is 7 and lokomotiv is 1 (in first league), then neman does not have a higher position than lokomotiv\u2014they have a lower position. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because \"first league\" might refer to a different competition. So perhaps the comparison isn't straightforward. For example, if neman is in one division andlok omotiv is in another, we can't directly compare their positions as higher or lower without knowing how the leagues are structured.\n\nBut given that the table lists both, I think it's safe to assume they're all part of the same league structure with some teams in different divisions. So, perhaps \"first league\" is a division where the top two teams are listed with their respective positions.\n\nIn any case, regardless of the division, if neman is at position 7 and lokomotiv is at 1 (in first league), then neman does not have a higher position thanlok omotiv. So the claim would be false.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Maybe \"first league\" is the top tier, so being in first league, position 1 is better than being in another division with position 7. Therefore, lokomotiv's overall ranking is higher (better) than neman's, making the claim that neman have a higher position thanlok omotiv false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the claim is incorrect\u2014neman does not have a higher position thanlok omotiv in 2003.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Neman had a higher (better) position than Lokomotiv in 2003 is incorrect. According to the table, Neman was ranked 7th, while Lokomotiv was in first place within the first league. Therefore, Lokomotiv's position was better than Neman's.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; Neman did not have a higher position than Lokomotiv in 2003.",

I need to determine whether the claim \"torpedo - ska be 1 of 4 team with location in vitebsk\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. The table lists various football teams along with their locations and other details. My goal is to check two things: \n\n1. How many teams are located in Vitebsk?\n2. Is \"torpedo - ska\" one of those teams?\n\nLooking at the 'location' column, I'll go through each row to count how many times 'vitebsk' appears.\n\n- The first team is Gomel located in Gomel.\n- BATE is in Borisov.\n- Dinamo Minsk is in Minsk.\n- Torpedo-SKA is in Minsk as well. Wait, no\u2014the table shows Torpedo-SKA's location as Minsk? Let me double-check that.\n\nWait a second, looking back: \n\nRow 3 (index starting at 0) has team \"torpedo - ska\" with location \"minsk\". So it's located in Minsk, not Vitebsk. That means Torpedo-SKA isn't in Vitebsk.\n\nContinuing through the table:\n\n- Shakhtyor is in Soligorsk.\n- Torpedo (Zhodino) is in Zhodino.\n- Neman is in Grodno.\n- Naftan is in Novopolotsk.\n- Dnepr-Transmash is in Mogilev.\n- Belshina is in Bobruisk.\n- Dinamo Brest is in Brest.\n- Zvezda-VA-BGU is in Minsk.\n- Darida is in Minsk Raion.\n- Slavia is in Mozyr.\n- Lokomotiv is in Vitebsk. So that's one team in Vitebsk.\n- MTZ-Ripo is in Minsk.\n\nSo only Lokomotiv is listed as being from Vitebsk. That means there's only 1 team located in Vitebsk, not four. Therefore, the claim that Torpedo-SKA is \"1 of 4 teams\" with location in Vitebsk is incorrect on two counts: Torpedo-SKA isn't in Vitebsk, and there aren't four such teams.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells:\n\n- For Lokomotiv (row index 15), checking the 'location' column shows it's in Vitebsk.\n- For Torpedo-SKA (row index 3), its location is Minsk, not Vitebsk.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.

It says mtz-ripo is one of two teams that have the venue 'atlant'. So I'm looking for all teams whose venue is 'atlant' and see if there are exactly two of them, including mtz-ripo.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team with details about their location, venue, capacity, etc. The column names are: team, location, venue, capacity, position in 2003.\n\nI'll go through each row to check where the venue is 'atlant'.\n\n1. The first row is Gomel. Venue is central, gomel. Not atlant.\n2. Bate's venue is city stadium, borisov. No match.\n3. Dinamo Minsk has dinamo, minsk as venue. Not atlant.\n4. Torpedo-ska's venue is torpedo, minsk. Nope.\n5. Shakhtyor plays at stroitel. Not matching.\n6. Torpedo in zhodino uses torpedo, zhodino. Not the case.\n7. Neman's venue is neman. Doesn't match.\n8. Naftan is located in novopolotsk with venue atlant. So this is one team: Naftan.\n9. Dnepr-transmash's venue is spartak, mogilev. No.\n10. Belshina uses spartak, bobruisk. Not relevant.\n11. Dinamo Brest plays at osk brestskiy. Doesn't match.\n12. Zvezda-va-bgu's venue is traktor. So nope.\n13. Darida has darida as venue. Not atlant.\n14. Slavia uses yunost. No.\n15. Lokomotiv plays at central, vitebsk. Doesn't match.\n16. Mtz-ripo's venue is traktor according to the last row.\n\nWait a minute. The last two rows are 'lokomotiv' and 'mtz-ripo'. Lokomotiv has venue 'central, vitebsk', and mtz-ripo is at 'traktor'. \n\nSo in the entire table, only Naftan's venue is 'atlant'. There's no other team with that venue. Therefore, there isn't a second team besides Naftan that plays at atlant.\n\nThe claim says mtz-ripo is one of two teams with venue 'atlant', but according to the data, only Naftan has that venue. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mtz - ripo\" is one of two teams with the venue \"atlant\". However, examining the table reveals only one team (Naftan) uses the venue \"atlant\", and mtz-ripo does not play there.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with various details about football teams in 2003 and is asking whether the claim \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv in 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table represents. Looking at the columns: team, location, venue, capacity, and position in 2003. The key here is the \"position in 2003\" column because that's what determines whether bate finished higher than lokomotiv.\n\nSo, I'll search for both teams in the table. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- For bate: It's located in Borisov, plays at city stadium, has a capacity of 5500, and its position is listed as 2.\n- For lokomotiv: It's in Vitebsk, venue is central, with a capacity of 8300. Its position is given as \"first league, 1\".\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. The position for bate is just 2, while lokomotiv has \"first league, 1\". I need to figure out what this means. In many football leagues, teams are ranked from highest to lowest position. So, position 1 would be higher than position 2.\n\nBut looking at the table structure, it's possible that the positions are listed numerically for most teams, but for some, they're grouped into different leagues. For instance, lokomotiv is in \"first league\" with a position of 1, which might mean it's the top team in the first division or something similar.\n\nComparing their positions: bate has position 2, and lokomotiv has position 1. In sports rankings, lower numbers are better. So, if bate is at position 2 and lokomotiv is at position 1, that would mean lokomotiv finished higher than bate.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says \"bate finish with a higher position than lokomotiv\". If higher position means a lower numerical value (like first place is higher), then the claim would be FALSE because bate is in position 2 and lokomotiv is in position 1. However, if \"higher\" refers to being in a better league, like first league vs. second league, but in this case, both are in the same table, so it's more about their numerical positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the table. Let me double-check: bate is at row index 1 with position 2; lokomotiv is at row index 14, and under \"position in 2003\" it's listed as \"first league, 1\". The word \"higher\" can be ambiguous. If higher means better ranking (lower number), then bate didn't finish higher because 2 > 1.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because lokomotiv finished in a higher position (position 1) than bate (position 2).\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"position in 2003\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
