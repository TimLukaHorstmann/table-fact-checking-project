    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be 2 institution locate within the state of ohio that be member of the great midwest conference.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what needs to be checked. The key points are:\n\n1. Institutions located in Ohio.\n2. They were members of the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six institutions with their details. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting from row 0: University of Cincinnati is located in Cincinnati, Ohio. That fits the location criteria. Now, checking if it was part of the conference. The columns \"joined\" and \"left\" indicate when they were members. Cincinnati joined in 1991 and left in 1995, so yes, they were members.\n\nNext, row 1: University of Dayton is also in Ohio (Dayton, Ohio). It joined in 1993 and left in 1995, so it was a member as well. That's the second institution from Ohio that was part of the conference.\n\nRow 2: DePaul University is in Chicago, Illinois, which is not Ohio, so I can skip this one.\n\nRow 3: Marquette University is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2014also not Ohio. Moving on.\n\nRow 4: University of Memphis is located in Tennessee, so that's out.\n\nRow 5: Saint Louis University is in Missouri, so nope.\n\nSo from the table, there are two institutions in Ohio (Cincinnati and Dayton) that were members of the conference between the years specified. Both joined before 1996 and left by 1995. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both Cincinnati and Dayton meet the criteria.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two Ohio institutions were part of the Great Midwest Conference. Checking each institution:\n\n- University of Cincinnati (OH): Joined in 1991, left in 1995.\n- University of Dayton (OH): Joined in 1993, left in 1995.\n\nBoth meet the criteria.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"left\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"left\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first: \"5 out of the 6 institutions that were in the great midwest conference joined the conference in 1991.\" \n\nWait a second, the table doesn't mention anything about the Great Midwest Conference directly. It just lists six institutions with their nicknames, locations, founding years, types (public or private), enrollments, and when they joined and left something\u2014maybe that's the conference? The columns are 'joined' and 'left', so perhaps those refer to joining and leaving a particular conference.\n\nThe claim is about 5 out of 6 institutions in the Great Midwest Conference joining in 1991. But the table doesn't specify which conference they joined or left; it just says 'joined' and 'left' with years. I have to assume that these columns refer to the same conference mentioned in the claim, the Great Midwest Conference.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- University of Cincinnati: Joined 1991\n- University of Dayton: Joined 1993\n- DePaul University: Joined 1991\n- Marquette University: Joined 1991\n- University of Memphis: Joined 1991\n- Saint Louis University: Joined 1991\n\nWait, so how many joined in 1991? Let's count:\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati: 1991 \u2192 yes.\n\nUniversity of Dayton: 1993 \u2192 no.\n\nDePaul: 1991 \u2192 yes.\n\nMarquette: 1991 \u2192 yes.\n\nUniversity of Memphis: 1991 \u2192 yes.\n\nSaint Louis: 1991 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo that's five institutions (U Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, U Memphis, SLU) joined in 1991. University of Dayton joined in 1993, so only one didn't join in 1991.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"5 out of the 6 institutions...joined the conference in 1991.\" That would mean five did, and one didn't. According to the table, that's correct: five joined in 1991, and one (Dayton) joined in 1993.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"5 out of the 6 institutions that be in the great midwest conference.\" Wait, does it say all six are in the conference? The table has six institutions. If they're all part of the Great Midwest Conference at some point, then five joined in 1991.\n\nBut looking back, all these schools were part of the Great Midwest Conference? I'm not entirely sure because the claim refers to \"the great midwest conference,\" but the table doesn't mention that explicitly. It just shows when each institution joined and left something\u2014maybe a conference.\n\nAssuming that 'joined' is referring to joining the same conference, then yes: five institutions joined in 1991 (rows 0, 2, 3, 4, 5), and one joined later (row 1). So the claim would be TRUE because five out of six joined in 1991.\n\nSo relevant cells are all the 'joined' columns for each row. Each row's 'joined' year is important to count how many joined in 1991.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says there are two public institutions that were members of the Great Midwest Conference (GMC). The table has columns like \"institution\", \"nickname\", \"location\", \"founded\", \"type\", \"enrollment\", \"joined\", and \"left\".\n\nI need to check which institutions have the type as public, and then see if they were part of the GMC by looking at the \"joined\" and \"left\" years.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the table lists several institutions with their details like founded year. The claim is about finding three members (institutions) that were founded before 1860. \n\nLooking at the \"founded\" column for each institution:\n\n1. University of Cincinnati: Founded in 1819. That's definitely before 1860.\n2. University of Dayton: Founded in 1850, which is also before 1860.\n3. DePaul University: Founded in 1898, so that's after 1860.\n4. Marquette University: Founded in 1881, which is post-1860.\n5. University of Memphis: Founded in 1912, way after.\n6. Saint Louis University: Founded in 1818, which is before 1860.\n\nSo the institutions founded before 1860 are Cincinnati (1819), Dayton (1850), and Saint Louis (1818). That makes three institutions. \n\nWait a second, the claim says \"3 of the member... be found before 1860.\" So I've identified exactly three: rows 0, 1, and 5 in the table.\n\nSo according to this, the claim is TRUE because there are three members (Cincinnati, Dayton, Saint Louis) that were founded before 1860.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows three institutions founded before 1860.

Its enrollment number is 41,357 students.\n- Saint Louis University is the last one in the table. Their enrollment is 13,785 students.\n\nNow, to check the difference between these two numbers: I'll subtract Saint Louis's enrollment from Cincinnati's. So, 41,357 minus 13,785 equals... let me calculate that. \n\n41,357 - 13,785 = 27,572.\n\nWow, that matches exactly what the claim states.

It's saying that among all institutions in Ohio, only one was part of the Great Midwest Conference. Looking at the table, there are two institutions from Ohio: University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton.

Marquette University: Type is private.\n5. University of Memphis: Type is public.\n6.

The claim is: \"more than half of the member of the great midwest conference be found before 1860.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. The claim is about when these institutions were founded. It says more than half were founded before 1860. So I need to check how many of the listed institutions in the table were founded before 1860 and see if that number exceeds half of the total.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six institutions:\n\n1.

That would be Cincinnati, Dayton, and Saint Louis. So that's three institutions.\n\nTotal number of institutions is six. More than half would mean more than 3. Since exactly three are before 1860, which is not more than half (which would require at least four), the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014more than half of six is more than 3, so it's four or more.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the university of cincinnati have the same number of student enrol as saint louis university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate both universities in the table. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- The University of Cincinnati is in row 0.\n- Saint Louis University is in row 5.\n\nNext, I need to find their enrollment numbers. \n\nFor the University of Cincinnati, checking the \"enrollment\" column under row 0 shows 41357 students. For Saint Louis University, also looking at the \"enrollment\" column in row 5 gives me 13785 students.\n\nComparing these two numbers: 41357 (University of Cincinnati) and 13785 (Saint Louis University). They are clearly different. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided; hence, it should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells for this comparison are:\n- Row 0, column \"enrollment\" for the University of Cincinnati.\n- Row 5, column \"enrollment\" for Saint Louis University.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
