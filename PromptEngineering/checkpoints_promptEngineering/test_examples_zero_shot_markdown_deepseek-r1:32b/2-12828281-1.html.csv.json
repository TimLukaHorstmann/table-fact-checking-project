    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be during week 13\". Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has several columns: week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. There are 14 rows corresponding to weeks 1 through 14 in the year 1964.\n\nI need to check if there's a game played on December 6, 1964, and whether that was during week 13. Let me scan through each row.\n\nLooking at week 13: the date is December 6, 1964. The opponent was the Buffalo Bills, result was a win (W) with a score of 16-13, and attendance was 18,134. So that's one piece of information.\n\nBut wait, I should also check if any other weeks have the date December 6, 1964. Scanning through all rows, I don't see any other entries with that date. So week 13 is the only game on that date.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the game on December 6 was during week 13 is correct. The relevant cell for this is in row 12 (assuming counting starts from 0) under the 'date' column and the 'week' column.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the table structure, each row has a specific week number. Let me recount the rows to get the right indices. Week 13 is the 13th entry in the table. Since tables usually start counting from 0, that would be row index 12.\n\nSo yes, the relevant cells are in row 12 for both 'week' and 'date'. The week number is 13, and the date matches December 6, 1964.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a game on December 6, 1964, occurred during week 13. Checking the table, row 12 (assuming zero-based index) shows that week 13 indeed took place on December 6, 1964.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the game play on december 6 , 1964 be after week 13.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's asking if the game played on December 6, 1964, occurred after week 13.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week number and details of that week's game. The weeks are numbered from 1 to 14. I need to find which week the game on December 6 falls into.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: September 13\n- Week 2: September 19\n- Week 3: September 27\n- Week 4: October 3\n- Week 5: October 10\n- Week 6: October 16\n- Week 7: October 25\n- Week 8: November 1\n- Week 9: November 8\n- Week 10: November 15\n- Week 11: November 22\n- Week 12: November 29\n- Week 13: December 6\n- Week 14: December 20\n\nLooking at week 13, the date is December 6, 1964. The game was against the Buffalo Bills with a result of W 16-13 and an attendance of 18134.\n\nThe claim says that this game was after week 13. But according to the table, December 6 corresponds to week 13 itself. Therefore, the game on December 6 is exactly in week 13, not after it.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the game wasn't after week 13; it occurred during week 13.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the game play on december 2 , 1963 be week 15\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by breaking down what each part of the claim refers to.\n\nFirst, the date mentioned in the claim is December 2, 1963. I should check the 'date' column in the table for this specific date. Looking through the dates provided:\n\n- The earliest date in the table is September 13, 1964.\n- The latest date is December 20, 1964.\n\nHmm, all the dates are in 1964, not 1963. So right off the bat, I notice that there's no game listed for December 2, 1963 because none of the entries even fall within 1963. This discrepancy already suggests the claim might be false.\n\nNext, let's look at the week numbers. The table goes up to week 14, ending on December 20, 1964. There's no mention of a week 15 in this table. Since the table only includes data from weeks 1 through 14 for the year 1964, there can't be a week 15 game scheduled on December 2, 1963 because that date is actually before the first game listed (September 13, 1964) and in a different year.\n\nAdditionally, even if we consider any potential games outside of what's listed here, the table provided doesn't include any information about week 15 or December 2, 1963. So based solely on this data, there's no supporting evidence for such a game existing.\n\nPutting it all together: The date in the claim is in 1963, but the earliest games are in 1964. Plus, week numbers go up only to 14. Therefore, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
