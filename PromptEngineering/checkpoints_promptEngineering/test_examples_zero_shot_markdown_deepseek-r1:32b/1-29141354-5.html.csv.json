    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"jessica ennis be the guest on andrew and jack guest episode broadcast on 4 may 2012\". \n\nFirst, let me parse this sentence. It seems a bit off in terms of grammar\u2014it should probably say \"was\" instead of \"be\", but I think the intended meaning is that Jessica Ennis was a guest on an Andrew and Jack episode that aired on April 4th, 2012.\n\nLooking at the table structure: there are columns like \"episode\", \"first broadcast\", \"andrew and jacks guest\", etc. So, to verify the claim, I need to check two things: whether Jessica Ennis was a guest in any episode, and if that episode's first broadcast date matches May 4th, 2012.\n\nStarting with the guests column\u2014let me scan through each row under \"andrew and jacks guest\". \n\nRow 0: Georgie Thompson\nRow 1: Louise Hazel\nRow 2: Jessica Ennis\nRow 3: Zo\u00eb Ball\nRow 4: Mo Farah\nRow 5: Ronnie O'Sullivan\nRow 6: Claudia Winkleman\n\nOkay, so Jessica Ennis is in row 2 under the guests column. Now, I need to check what date that episode was broadcast on.\n\nLooking at the \"first broadcast\" column for each row:\n\nRow 0: April 20th, 2012\nRow 1: April 27th, 2012\nRow 2: May 4th, 2012\n\nSo, row 2 has the first broadcast date as May 4th, which matches the claim. Therefore, Jessica Ennis was indeed a guest on that episode.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's any other row with her name or another possible match. From what I can see, she appears only once in row 2, and that's the date mentioned. So it seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Jessica Ennis was a guest on the episode broadcast on May 4th, 2012.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis as Andrew and Jack guest be before May 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking. It mentions two main points: \n1. Identify episodes where Jessica Ennis was the guest for \"Andrew and Jack.\"\n2. Determine if the first broadcast of such an episode occurred before May 2012.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: episode, first broadcast, Andrew and Jack's guest, Jamie's guests (with some additional info), and scores.\n- Each row represents a different episode with corresponding details.\n\nI need to find the row where \"Andrew and Jack's guest\" is Jessica Ennis. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 05x03:\n- Episode: 05x03\n- First broadcast date: 4 May 2012\n- Andrew and Jack's guest: Jessica Ennis\n\nSo, this is the relevant row. Now, checking the \"first broadcast\" date for this episode, it's listed as 4 May 2012. The claim states that this should be before May 2012. However, 4 May is within May 2012, not before.\n\nTherefore, the first broadcast with Jessica Ennis was in May 2012, which contradicts the claim stating it was before May 2012. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n- The row index for 05x03 is the third row (row_index: 2 considering zero-based indexing).\n- The columns involved are \"first broadcast\" and \"Andrew and Jack's guest.\"\n\nSo, the relevant_cells will include two objects:\n1. For Jessica Ennis as the guest.\n2. For the first broadcast date on that same row.\n\nThis ensures both parts of the claim are verified against the table data accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first broadcast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"andrew and jacks guest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
