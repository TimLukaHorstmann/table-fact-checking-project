    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the warrington town team be in the 4th position with 45 goal against.\" So, there are two parts here that need verification:\n\n1. Is Warrington Town in the 4th position?\n2. Does Warrington Town have exactly 45 goals against?\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find Warrington Town's row. Scanning down the \"team\" column, I see Warrington Town is listed at row index 3 (since rows start counting from 0). \n\nLooking at the position column for this row, it shows they're in 4th place. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the \"goals against\" column for Warrington Town, the number there is indeed 45. So both parts of the claim are correct based on the table data.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells to verify the claim are:\n- The position cell in row 3.\n- The goals against cell in row 3.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals against\"}\n   ]\n}",
