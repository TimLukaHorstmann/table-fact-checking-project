    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"for the 2018 season, the air force - navy score be yet tbd\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: It has columns like Year, Service Academy, and some other details about games between Army, Navy, and Air Force. The rows go from 1946 up to 2018.\n\nThe claim mentions the 2018 season, so I should look at the row where the year is 2018. Scanning through the years in the table, I see that there's a row for 2018 towards the end.\n\nIn that 2018 row, under each column:\n- The \"Service Academy\" column says \"tbd\". So the opponent isn't specified yet.\n- The other columns (like dates and locations) also say \"tbd\" or have placeholders like specific dates but no scores mentioned.\n\nThe claim is specifically about the Air Force vs. Navy score being tbd for 2018. In the table, since the entire row for 2018 has \"tbd\" under Service Academy and other details, it implies that the game hasn't been played yet or the information isn't available.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the score is indeed marked as tbd in the relevant cells of the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 72,\n       \"column_name\": \"Service Academy\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1983, the air force - navy score be 44-17\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me look through the table step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the row corresponding to the year 1983 in the table. Scanning down, I see a row with \"2016\" and \"tbd\", then further down, looking for numbers around there... Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe I missed it earlier.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rows, I see entries from 2014 onwards as TBDs or specific dates, but where is 1983? Hmm, perhaps I need to look more carefully. The table starts with 1973 and goes up to 2018, but in the middle, there's a row for 1983.\n\nYes, here it is: under \"Year\", there's an entry for \"1983\". Let me find that row. Once I locate the 1983 row, I need to check the score between Air Force and Navy. The table columns are Year, Army-Navy, Air Force-Navy, and Army-Air Force.\n\nSo in the 1983 row, under \"Air Force - Navy\" column, what's the value? Looking at that cell, it says \"44-17\". That matches exactly with the claim. \n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the ones where the year is 1983 and the Air Force-Navy score is 44-17. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Air Force - Navy\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has presented a table with information about Army-Navy games and a specific claim. They want me to verify if the claim is true or false based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It looks like each row represents a year, and there are several columns: \"Year\", \"Army-Navy Game\", \"NCAA BB Game\", \"NFL Game\", and \"Bowl Game\". Each cell contains details about when and where these events took place.\n\nThe claim is: \"an army-navy game will be play on 10 dec 2016 at baltimore, md\"\n\nI need to check if the Army-Navy game in 2016 was indeed scheduled for December 10th, 2016, in Baltimore, MD.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan down the \"Year\" column until I find 2016. When I reach that row (assuming it's correctly indexed), I check the relevant columns to see where the Army-Navy game is listed. \n\nIn the provided data, for the year 2016:\n- The Army-Navy Game cell has \"tbd\", meaning the details are not yet determined.\n- Looking at other columns like NFL Game or Bowl Game might provide indirect information, but the specific event in question is the Army-Navy game.\n\nSince the claim specifies December 10th, I check if any of the cells under 2016 mention this date. The \"Bowl Game\" column for 2016 shows \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore, md (m& bank stadium)\". However, that's the Bowl Game, not the Army-Navy game.\n\nWait a minute\u2014this is crucial. The claim mentions the Army-Navy game on that date and location, but according to the table, it's the Bowl Game that's scheduled there. The Army-Navy Game in 2016 is still marked as \"tbd\", which means no specific details are confirmed yet.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that the Army-Navy game will be played on December 10th, 2016, but the table doesn't confirm this\u2014it only confirms a Bowl Game at that location and date. Without explicit confirmation in the Army-Navy Game column for 2016, I can't verify the claim as true.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim isn't supported by the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 35, \"column_name\": \"Army-Navy Game\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the claim \"the score for air force - navy have all been decided up until 2018\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It says that all scores between Air Force and Navy teams are already determined up to the year 2018. That implies that every row in the table with a year \u2264 2018 should have specific data filled in for their respective cells.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it includes years from 1934 up to 2018, but not all rows are complete. Some entries under columns like 'Location', 'Date', and others have placeholders or \"tbd\", especially towards later years. \n\nFor example, let's check the year 2014:\n- The 'Result' column says \"tbd\".\n- Under 'Location', it shows dates but not specific scores.\n\nSimilarly, for 2016:\n- Most cells are marked as \"tbd\".\n\nIn 2018, again:\n- All cells under relevant columns are \"tbd\" except the date and location.\n\nThis means that even though some years up to 2018 have games listed, the actual scores (results) aren't available or determined for all of them. Therefore, not all Air Force vs. Navy games up until 2018 have their scores decided as per the table data.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because there are entries in the table for years \u2264 2018 where the score isn't provided or marked as \"tbd\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all Air Force vs. Navy game results up to 2018 are decided. However, examining the table shows several years with 'Result' as \"tbd\" or incomplete entries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 70, \"column_name\": \"Result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 71, \"column_name\": \"Result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a table of data about the Air Force vs Navy games from various years. The claim is that for the 1983 season, the score was TBD (To Be Determined). My task is to check this against the table and determine if it's true or false.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It seems to have columns like \"Year\", \"AF-NAVY\", \"AF-East\", \"Commander-in-Chief\", etc. Each row corresponds to a year from 1959 up to 2018.\n\nNow, focusing on the claim: it mentions the 1983 season and specifically refers to the Air Force vs Navy score being TBD. I need to find if there's an entry for 1983 in the table that indicates this.\n\nLooking through the rows, I can see that each row has a \"Year\" column. Scanning down, I check each year until I reach 1983. Upon finding the row with Year 1983, I look at the relevant columns to find the score for Air Force vs Navy.\n\nIn the table, for 1983, under the \"AF-NAVY\" column, it says \"42-24\". This clearly shows a specific score rather than TBD. The other columns might not be directly related to this particular claim because they refer to different matchups or events (like AF-East and Commander-in-Chief). However, since the claim is specifically about the AF-NAVY game in 1983, only that column's data is relevant.\n\nTherefore, the table shows a definite score for the 1983 Air Force vs Navy game, which contradicts the claim that it was TBD. So, the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"AF-NAVY\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"all but 1 season be about to have or have an army - navy game in baltimore, md (m& t bank stadium)\". \n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. It suggests that in almost all seasons, except one, there was or is going to be an Army-Navy game held at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each row to see if the \"Location\" column for the Army-Navy game is listed as M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. The relevant column here seems to be the \"Location\" or perhaps a specific date column indicating where the game was held.\n\nWait, looking at the columns: it's not clear what each column represents beyond the headers like \"Army\", \"Navy\", and \"Location\". But from the data, I can see entries under \"Location\" that specify where the games are held. For example, in 2014, the location is listed as \"13 dec 2014 at baltimore, md (m& t bank stadium)\", which fits the claim.\n\nI should go through each row starting from the first one. However, the table starts with rows that have seasons like 1980, but looking at the data provided in the query, it seems to list years up until 2018, with some TBD entries for 2014, 2016, and 2018.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that from 2014 onwards, the locations are listed as \"tbd\" or specific dates at M&T Bank Stadium. For example:\n\n- 2014: Location is \"13 dec 2014 at baltimore, md (m& t bank stadium)\"\n- 2016: Location is \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore, md (m& t bank stadium)\"\n- 2018: The location seems to be TBD but the date is listed as \"8 dec 2018\" without specifying the venue.\n\nWait, no, looking back, for 2018, it's only stated as \"tbd\" under Army and Navy columns, but the Location column says \"8 dec 2018\". It doesn't specify M&T Bank Stadium there. So that might be a problem because if the location isn't specified, we don't know where it was held.\n\nSimilarly, for 2014 and 2016, the locations are correctly at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. For 2018, since the Location column doesn't specify the venue, but just the date, perhaps that's the exception mentioned in the claim as \"all but 1 season\".\n\nBut wait, let me check all rows to see if there's any other season where the location isn't at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nLooking back, from 2004 onwards up to 2013, I don't have data here because the table in the query starts with 2004 and goes up. Wait no, the user provided a much longer table starting from earlier years but cut off some parts. However, for the purpose of this analysis, let's focus on the data given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the columns. The columns seem to be labeled as \"Army\", \"Navy\", and \"Location\". For example:\n\n- In 2014: Army has a TBD entry, Navy is at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.\n- Similarly, for other years, some have specific locations, others are TBD.\n\nWait no, looking again, it's not clear. Let me parse the table correctly.\n\nLooking back at the table structure:\n\nThe columns seem to be \"Army\", \"Navy\", and \"Location\". Each row represents a season (year), and under each column, there are details about where their games are held or scheduled.\n\nSo for each year, if both Army and Navy have their games at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, then it fits the claim. If one of them doesn't, that could be an exception.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about whether there's an Army-Navy game held at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore for all but one season.\n\nSo regardless of other games, as long as the Army-Navy matchup is at that stadium, it counts.\n\nLooking through each year:\n\n- 2014: \"Location\" column says \"13 dec 2014 at baltimore, md (m& t bank stadium)\" \u2013 this fits.\n- 2016: \"Location\" column says \"10 dec 2016 at baltimore, md (m& t bank stadium)\" \u2013 also fits.\n- 2018: The Location column just has the date \"8 dec 2018\", without specifying the venue. So that's a problem because we don't know where it was held.\n\nAdditionally, looking back to earlier years:\n\nFor example, in 2013 (not shown here), perhaps the location is different? But since the table provided doesn't include all previous years, but the user says \"all but 1 season\", maybe one of those seasons is before the ones listed here where it wasn't at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\nAlternatively, considering only the data given:\n\nFrom 2014 onwards, except for 2018, the games were held at M&T Bank Stadium. For 2018, since the location isn't specified as Baltimore, that's one season not fitting.\n\nTherefore, if all seasons except 2018 had the game there, then the claim holds true with only one exception.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of the table provided, the claim is TRUE. All seasons except for 2018 had the Army-Navy game at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, MD.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim is TRUE.",
