    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the first place tie be between duffy waldorf , jeff sluman and frank nobilo\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I look at the table structure. The columns are: place, player, country, score, to par, money.\n\nThe claim mentions a first-place tie involving three players: Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo. So I need to check where these players are in the standings.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The first few rows (rows 0,1,2) are tied at t1 with scores of 279.\n- Then there's Curtis Strange in row 3, in 4th place.\n- John Cook is 5th in row 4.\n- Rows 5,6,7 have players tied at t6 with a score of 283.\n- Finally, rows 8,9,10,11 are tied at t9 with scores of 284.\n\nNow, checking the players mentioned:\n\n- Duffy Waldorf is in row 11 (t9)\n- Jeff Sluman is in row 10 (t9)\n- Frank Nobilo is in row 9 (t9)\n\nSo all three are tied for 9th place, not first. The t1 position includes Ernie Els, Colin Montgomerie, and Loren Roberts.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because these players aren't in the first place tie; they're in a lower tie.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a first-place tie among Duffy Waldorf, Jeff Sluman, and Frank Nobilo. Checking the table, all three are in t9 position, not t1. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
