Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"player kyle beckerman from the usa have 21 goal, but player nat borchers from the usa have only 9 goal.\" So I need to check two things here: \n\n1. Does Kyle Beckerman have 21 goals?\n2. Does Nat Borchers have 9 goals?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go row by row to find these players.\n\nStarting with Kyle Beckerman. Scanning through the player names, I see that he's listed in rank 3. Let me check his details. The columns are rank, player, nation, caps, goals, and years. For Kyle Beckerman, under the \"goals\" column, it shows 21. So that matches the claim\u201421 goals.\n\nNext, Nat Borchers is mentioned. I'll look through the players until I find his name. There he is at rank 5. Checking his \"goals\" column, it's listed as 9. That also aligns with what the claim states\u2014only 9 goals.\n\nBoth pieces of information in the claim are correctly reflected in the table. Kyle Beckerman does have 21 goals, and Nat Borchers has 9 goals. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells to verify this, I need to note their positions. Kyle Beckerman is in row index 2 (since the first row after headers is 0), and his goals are under the \"goals\" column. Similarly, Nat Borchers is in row index 4, also under the \"goals\" column.\n\nSo both parts of the claim have been verified against the table, confirming that the statement is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

His nation is 'arg', so he is from Argentina.\n\nNext, Javier Morale's details are in row 6. The table says his years are 2007-present, matching the claim.

The first part is about Ned Grabavoy having 8 goals, and the second is about Tony Beltran having 0 goals. I'll check each of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each player has a 'goals' column which should indicate how many goals they've scored. Let me find Ned Grabavoy's row. Scanning through, I find him in row index 7 (since the first row is 0). His goals are listed as 8. That matches the claim.\n\nNext, Tony Beltran is mentioned. Checking his row, he's in row index 6.

Looking at the table, row index 2 (since counting starts from 0) has \"kyle beckerman\" under the player column. The years for him are listed as \"2007 - present.\" So that's a match.\n\nNext, Chris Wingert is in row index 3. His years are also \"2007 - present,\" which aligns with the claim.\n\nThen, Javier Morales is mentioned in the claim. Checking the table, I see his name in row index 5 as \"javier morales.\" His years are listed as \"2007 - present\" as well. So that's another match.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"kyle beckerman, chris wingert, and javier morale.\" But Javier's last name is spelled \"morales\" in the table. Maybe it's just a typo in the claim? Or perhaps I should consider if there are two players with similar names. No, looking at the table, only one player named Javier Morales is listed. So it seems the claim might have a minor typo, but since it's referring to \"javier morale,\" which isn't exactly matching, maybe that's an issue.\n\nBut wait, in the relevant cells, I should look for the exact entries as per the table. The claim says \"javier morale,\" but the table has \"javier morales.\" So if Javier Morales is correctly listed, does the typo affect the answer? Hmm, perhaps not because it's about the years, not the spelling of his name.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just check each player:\n\n- Kyle Beckerman: 2007 - present (matches)\n- Chris Wingert: 2007 - present (matches)\n- Javier Morales: 2007 - present (matches)\n\nSo all three have the same years as per the claim, despite the minor spelling difference in the claim.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read through the table and understand what each column represents. The table lists players with their ranks, names, nations, caps, goals, and years they've been active. So, \"nation\" refers to the country they're from.\n\nThe claim is: \"player nick rimando, kyle beckerman, chris wingert, and nat borchers be not from the usa\". Hmm, so it's saying that these four players are not from the USA. My job is to check each of their entries in the table to see if they're indeed not from the USA.\n\nLet me go through each player one by one:\n\n1. **Nick Rimando**: Looking at row 0 (since indexing starts at 0), under \"nation\" it's listed as \"usa\". So, he is from the USA. But the claim says he's not. That seems contradictory right off the bat.\n\n2. **Kyle Beckerman**: He's in row 2. His nation is also \"usa\". Again, according to the table, he's from the USA, which goes against the claim stating he isn't.\n\n3. **Chris Wingert**: Row 3 shows his nation as \"usa\" too. So yet another player who's supposed to be not from the USA but actually is.\n\n4. **Nat Borchers**: In row 4, his nation is listed as \"usa\". So, this also doesn't fit with the claim.\n\nWait a minute, all four players mentioned in the claim are from the USA according to the table. The claim states that none of them are from the USA, but the data shows the opposite. Therefore, the claim is false because it's asserting they're not from the USA when in fact they are.\n\nTo make sure I'm thorough, let me double-check each row:\n\n- Nick Rimando (Row 0): usa\n- Kyle Beckerman (Row 2): usa\n- Chris Wingert (Row 3): usa\n- Nat Borchers (Row 4): usa\n\nYep, all four are listed as being from the USA. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should also consider if there's any chance of misreading the table or misunderstanding the claim.

The years he played are indeed 2007-2012, so that part matches the claim. However, according to the table, he's from Argentina.
