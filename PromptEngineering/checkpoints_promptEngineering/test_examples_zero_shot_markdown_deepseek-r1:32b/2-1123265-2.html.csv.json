The task is to determine whether the claim \"tarso marque do not complete any lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Tarso Marques did not complete any laps in the race. To verify this, I should look at the relevant information in the table related to him.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are columns for driver, constructor, laps, time/retired, and grid. The column \"laps\" indicates how many laps each driver completed during the race. \n\nNext, I'll search through the table to find the row corresponding to Tarso Marques. Scanning down the list of drivers:\n\n- Row 0: Damon Hill\n- ...\n- Continuing until row 22: Tarso Marques\n\nIn row 22, under the \"laps\" column, it shows that he completed 0 laps. Additionally, the \"time/retired\" column mentions \"spun off,\" indicating that he didn't finish the race.\n\nSince the claim is about whether Tarso Marques did not complete any laps, and the table explicitly states 0 laps, this supports the claim being TRUE.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided in the table, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"tarso marque start in grid 13 but do not complete any lap.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for \"Tarso Marques\" in the table. Scanning through the driver names, I see \"tarso marques\" listed at row index 23 (assuming counting starts from 0). \n\nNext, checking the grid position: his grid is 21, not 13 as claimed. So this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nThen, looking at laps completed, it's 0, meaning he didn't finish any lap. That part matches the claim.\n\nSince the grid number doesn't match (21 instead of 13), the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
