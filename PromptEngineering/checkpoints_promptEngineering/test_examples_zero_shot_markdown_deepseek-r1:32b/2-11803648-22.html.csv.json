    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says, \"curtis lazar and marcus hogberg be the only player to not have an overall above 100.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is stating. It claims that Curtis Lazar and Marcus Hogberg are the only two players in the table whose \"overall\" ranking is not above 100. So, my task is to check each player's overall score and see if all others except these two have an overall of 100 or higher.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows of data. Each row represents a different player with their respective details including the \"overall\" column. Let me go through each player one by one.\n\n1. **Curtis Lazar**: He's in round 1 and has an overall score of 17. That's definitely below 100.\n2. **Marcus Hogberg**: In round 3, his overall is 78. Also below 100.\n3. **Tobias Lindberg**: Round 4, overall 102 (from Philadelphia via Tampa Bay). This is above 100.\n4. **Ben Harpur**: Round 4, overall 108. That's also above 100.\n5. **Vincent Dunn**: Round 5, overall 138. Definitely above 100.\n6. **Chris Leblanc**: Round 6, overall 161 (from Dallas). Way above 100.\n7. **Quentin Shore**: Round 6, overall 168. Also way above 100.\n\nSo, from this, Curtis Lazar and Marcus Hogberg have overall scores of 17 and 78 respectively, both below 100. The rest of the players all have overalls above 100. \n\nThe claim says that these two are the \"only\" players with an overall not above 100. Since checking each row confirms that no other player besides Lazar and Hogberg has an overall below or equal to 100, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells in the table were relevant for this determination. For each player, the \"overall\" column is crucial because it's the basis of the claim. So, for every row (player), I looked at the \"overall\" value. Therefore, all rows and specifically the \"overall\" column are relevant.\n\nTo list them out:\n\n- Row 0: Curtis Lazar, overall =17\n- Row 1: Marcus Hogberg, overall=78\n- Row 2: Tobias Lindberg, overall=102\n- Row3: Ben Harpur, overall=108\n- Row4: Vincent Dunn, overall=138\n- Row5: Chris Leblanc, overall=161\n- Row6: Quentin Shore, overall=168\n\nEach of these \"overall\" cells is relevant because they were all checked to confirm whether their values are above or below 100. Since the claim is about only two players not having an overall above 100, and all others do, each of these cells contributes to verifying that condition.\n\nSo, compiling this information, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include every row's \"overall\" column.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"overall\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"overall\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 3 player for canada, and 2 of them play centre\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to identify all players from Canada. Looking at the 'nationality' column:\n\n- Row 0: Curtis Lazar from Canada\n- Row 1: Marcus Hogberg from Sweden (not Canadian)\n- Row 2: Tobias Lindberg from Sweden (not Canadian)\n- Row 3: Ben Harpur from Canada\n- Row 4: Vincent Dunn from Canada\n- Rows 5 and 6 are players from the United States.\n\nSo, there are three Canadian players: Curtis Lazar, Ben Harpur, and Vincent Dunn. That matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check how many of these three play as centres. Looking at their positions:\n\n- Curtis Lazar is a centre/right wing\n- Ben Harpur plays defense (not a centre)\n- Vincent Dunn is a centre\n\nSo, out of the three Canadian players, only two are centres: Curtis Lazar and Vincent Dunn. Wait, actually, I need to be careful here. Curtis Lazar's position is listed as \"centre / right wing,\" which means he can play both positions but is primarily considered a centre. So that counts him as one centre. Then, Vincent Dunn is explicitly a centre. That makes two centres.\n\nWait, hold on: the claim says 2 of them (the three Canadians) play centre. But looking again:\n\n- Curtis Lazar: centre/right wing\n- Ben Harpur: defense (not a centre)\n- Vincent Dunn: centre\n\nSo that's two centres among the three Canadians. Therefore, the second part of the claim is correct as well.\n\nWait another moment\u2014Curtis Lazar is listed in row 0. His position is \"centre / right wing.\" Does this mean he plays both positions? Or is he primarily a centre? The table lists his position as such, so for counting purposes, we can consider him as playing centre. So that's two centres: Lazar and Dunn.\n\nWait, but looking at the relevant cells:\n\nCurtis Lazar is in row 0 with position \"centre / right wing.\" His nationality is Canada. Ben Harpur is in row 3; he's a defense player from Canada. Vincent Dunn is in row 4 as a centre from Canada.\n\nSo, three Canadians: rows 0, 3, and 4. Among these:\n\n- Row 0: centre (counts)\n- Row 3: defense (doesn't count)\n- Row 4: centre (counts)\n\nThus, two centres among the three Canadians. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table indicates there are three Canadian players, with two of them playing as centres.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

My goal is to check all Canadian players in the table and see if they all share the same position.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple columns: round, overall, player name, position, nationality, and club team. For this claim, I'm particularly interested in the 'nationality' and 'position' columns because those directly relate to whether a player is Canadian and what their position is.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Curtis Lazar from Canada plays as a centre/right wing.\n2. **Row 1**: Marcus Hogberg from Sweden, so he's not Canadian.\n3. **Row 2**: Tobias Lindberg from Sweden, also not Canadian.\n4. **Row 3**: Ben Harpur is Canadian and plays defense.\n5. **Row 4**: Vincent Dunn is Canadian and a centre.\n6. **Row 5**: Chris Leblanc is American, so he's out of consideration.\n7. **Row 6**: Quentin Shore is also American.\n\nNow, focusing only on the Canadian players (rows 0, 3, 4):\n\n- Curtis Lazar: Centre / Right Wing\n- Ben Harpur: Defense\n- Vincent Dunn: Centre\n\nFrom this data, we can see that not all Canadian players have the same position.

Wait, let me count:\n\nThe table has headers as row 0, then data rows starting at 1.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1: round 1\nRow 2: round 3 (Marcus)\nRow 3: round 4 (Tobias)\n\nWait no, looking back, the markdown shows:\n\n|   round  | overall                                | player           | position             | nationality    | club team                   |\n|--------:|:--------------------------------------|:----------------|:--------------------|:--------------|:---------------------------|\n|       1  | 17                                     | curtis lazar     | centre  / right wing  | canada         | edmonton oil kings  (whl)    |\n|       3  | 78                                     | marcus hogberg   | goalie               | sweden         | link\u00f6pings hc  (se)          |\n|       4  | 102 (from philadelphia via tampa bay) | tobias lindberg  | right wing           | sweden         | djurg\u00e5rdens if  (se)         |\n\nSo row indices for data are 1,2,3,...\n\nSo Marcus is in row 2, Tobias in row 3.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\nFor Marcus Hogberg: position and nationality in row 2.\n\nFor Tobias Lindberg: position and nationality in row 3.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"} (Wait no, row indices start at 0 for headers. Wait, the first data row is index 1.)\n\nSo Marcus Hogberg is in row index 2: round 3.\n\nTobias Lindberg is in row index 3: round 4.\n\nBut when extracting relevant cells, I think we only need to point out each relevant cell that supports the claim.\n\nSo for Marcus:\n\n- Position: row 2, position\n- Nationality: row 2, nationality\n\nFor Tobias:\n\n- Position: row 3, position\n- Nationality: row 3, nationality\n\nBut in the example given, they just listed the cells without all of them. Wait no, perhaps only checking that each player's position and nationality is correct.\n\nWait, but the claim says both are Swedish, so we need to check their nationalities, and Marcus is a goalie, Tobias is a right wing.\n\nSo for each player:\n\nMarcus: position (row 2, position) is goalie, nationality (row 2, nationality) is sweden.\n\nTobias: position (row 3, position) is right wing, nationality (row 3, nationality) is sweden.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are these four cells. But in the example response, they only included two cells. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can include each cell that directly supports the claim. So for each player, both their position and nationality need to be checked.\n\nSo:\n\n- For Marcus Hogberg: row 2 (data index 1), column \"position\" and \"nationality\".\n- For Tobias Lindberg: row 3 (data index 2), same columns.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are four in total. But looking at the example, they didn't include all possible; maybe just one per each aspect? Or perhaps only the specific cells that confirm each part of the claim.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about both being Swedish and their respective positions, we can point to each player's nationality and position.\n\nSo:\n\nFor Marcus: row index 1 (since data starts at 1), \"position\" and \"nationality\".\n\nWait no, let me get this straight. The markdown table shows headers as the first line after |--------|... So rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: headers\n\nRow 1: round 1, player Curtis Lazar\n\nRow 2: round 3, Marcus Hogberg\n\nRow 3: round 4, Tobias Lindberg\n\nSo Marcus is in row index 2, Tobias in row index 3.\n\nThus, relevant cells are:\n\n- For Marcus: position (row 2), nationality (row 2)\n\n- For Tobias: position (row 3), nationality (row 3)\n\nBut since the example only showed two cells for an answer that required checking two aspects, perhaps I should include each of these four. But maybe in this case, to keep it concise, just list all relevant cells that were checked.\n\nSo:\n\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, in the example, they only included two cells. So maybe it's acceptable to list all four as relevant.\n\nSo compiling this, the answer is TRUE because both are Swedish, Marcus is a goalie, and Tobias is a right wing.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Marcus Hogberg and Tobias Lindberg are both from Sweden, with Marcus being a goalie and Tobias a right wing. Checking the table:\n\n- **Marcus Hogberg** (Row 2): Position - Goalie; Nationality - Sweden\n- **Tobias Lindberg** (Row 3): Position - Right Wing; Nationality - Sweden\n\nBoth aspects of the claim are confirmed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
