    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the date of vacancy when the position in the table be 10th and the manner of departure be resign be 28 february 2011.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim correctly. It's a bit of a run-on sentence, but I think it means that for a row where \"position in table\" is \"10th\" and the \"manner of departure\" is \"resigned,\" the corresponding \"date of vacancy\" should be \"28 February 2011.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has several columns: team, outgoing head coach, manner of departure, date of vacancy, position in table, incoming head coach, and date of appointment.\n\nSo, I need to scan through each row and find any that meet both conditions: \"position in table\" is 10th AND \"manner of departure\" is resigned. Then, check if the corresponding \"date of vacancy\" is indeed February 28, 2011.\n\nLet's go row by row:\n\n1. Uni\u00e3o de leiria: position is \"off - season\" \u2013 not 10th.\n2. Mar\u00edtimo: position is 15th \u2013 not 10th.\n3. Naval 1 de maio (first instance): position is 14th \u2013 nope.\n4. Acad\u00e9mica: position is 9th \u2013 doesn't fit.\n5. Naval 1 de maio again: position is 16th \u2013 no.\n6. Portimonense: position is 16th \u2013 nope.\n7. Acad\u00e9mica again: position is 13th \u2013 not 10th.\n8. Sporting: position is 3rd \u2013 doesn't match.\n9. Beira - mar: here, \"position in table\" is 10th and manner of departure is resigned. So this row fits both conditions.\n\nNow, for this row (row index 8, assuming the first row after header is 0), what's the date of vacancy? The claim says it should be February 28, 2011. Looking at the table, the date of vacancy in that row is \"28 february 2011.\" So yes, that matches.\n\nAre there any other rows where position is 10th and manner is resigned? Let me check again quickly. The Beira - mar row is the only one with 10th position. \n\nSo the claim holds true because in the relevant row, the date of vacancy is indeed February 28, 2011.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position in table\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"manner of departure\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}]}",

The claim states: \"when the team be uni\u00e3o de leiria , the date of appointment be 10 july 2010\".\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the team is 'uni\u00e3o de leiria'. Scanning through the table rows:\n\nRow 0: Team is 'uni\u00e3o de leiria', outgoing coach 'lito vidigal', manner of departure 'sacked', date of vacancy '7 july 2010', position in table 'off - season', incoming coach 'pedro caixinha', date of appointment '10 july 2010'.\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 0.\n\nNow, checking if when team is uni\u00e3o de leiria, the date of appointment is indeed '10 july 2010'. The table shows that in this row, the incoming coach was appointed on '10 july 2010', which matches the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the date of vacancy be 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach be carlos azenha\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It mentions two specific pieces of information: the date of vacancy being December 28, 2011, and the incoming head coach being Carlos Azenha.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure to understand where each piece of information is located. The relevant columns here are \"date of vacancy\" and \"incoming head coach.\" My goal is to find a row in the table that matches both these conditions simultaneously.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Team Uni\u00e3o de Leiria, date of vacancy July 7, 2010; incoming coach Pedro Caixinha. Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1**: Mar\u00edtimo, September 14, 2010; incoming coach Pedro Martins. Not matching.\n3. **Row 2**: Naval 1 de Maio, September 27, 2010; incoming coach Rog\u00e9rio Gon\u00e7alves. Doesn't match.\n4. **Row 3**: Acad\u00e9mica, December 21, 2010; incoming coach Jos\u00e9 Guilherme. Not matching.\n5. **Row 4**: Naval again, December 19, 2010; incoming coach Carlos Mozer. Still not the date or coach mentioned.\n6. **Row 5**: Portimonense, December 28, 2011; incoming coach Carlos Azenha. This matches both the date and the coach!\n7. **Row 6**: Acad\u00e9mica again, February 20, 2011; incoming Ulisses Morais. Doesn't match.\n8. **Row 7**: Sporting, February 26, 2011; incoming Jos\u00e9 Couceiro. Not matching.\n9. **Row 8**: Beira-Mar, February 28, 2011; incoming Rui Bento. Doesn't fit.\n10. **Row 9**: Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, March 1, 2011; incoming Bruno Ribeiro. Not matching.\n\nI found that Row 5 has the date of vacancy as December 28, 2011, and the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha. Therefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied by this row. \n\nTo ensure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check the other rows to make sure there aren't any duplicates or similar entries that might cause confusion. But from my initial pass, it seems Row 5 is the only one that fits.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE based on the information in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date of vacancy\"}, {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incoming head coach\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"as the team be uni\u00e3o de leiria , the date of appointment be before10 july 2010\"\n\nFirst, I should parse this claim. It's a bit awkwardly phrased, but I think it means that for the team \"uni\u00e3o de leiria\", the date of appointment of their incoming head coach is before July 10, 2010.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the team is \"uni\u00e3o de leiria\". Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row has \"uni\u00e3o de leiria\" as the team.\n  \nIn that row, the relevant columns are:\n- incoming head coach: pedro caixinha\n- date of appointment: 10 july 2010\n\nThe claim is asking if this date (date of appointment) is before July 10, 2010. The date listed is exactly July 10, 2010.\n\nWait, so the claim says \"before\", meaning it should be earlier than that date. Since the appointment was on the same day, not before, this would make the claim FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check to ensure I'm interpreting correctly. The table shows the date as 10 July 2010, and the claim is about whether it's before that date. Therefore, since it's exactly on that date, it doesn't satisfy \"before\".\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for this determination:\n- The row index where \"uni\u00e3o de leiria\" is listed (which is 0).\n- The columns needed are \"team\" and \"date of appointment\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant_cells would include both these columns from row 0.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date of appointment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the date of vacancy be after 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach, carlos azenha.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of this claim. It mentions two things:\n1. The date of vacancy is after December 28, 2011.\n2. The incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha.\n\nI need to check each row in the table to see if there's a case where both these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each team one by one:\n\n1. Uni\u00e3o de Leiria: Outgoing coach Lito Vidigal left on July 7, 2010. Incoming is Pedro Caixinha starting July 10, 2010. Date of vacancy is July 7, 2010, which is way before December 28, 2011.\n\n2. Mar\u00edtimo: Coach Mitchell Van Der Gaag was sacked on September 14, 2010. Incoming Pedro Martins started the same day. Date of vacancy is Sep 14, 2010\u2014again earlier than Dec 28, 2011.\n\n3. Naval 1 de Maio: Victor Zvunka was sacked on September 27, 2010. Incoming R\u00f3gerio Gon\u00e7alves started October 6, 2010. Date of vacancy is Sep 27, 2010\u2014still too early.\n\n4. Acad\u00e9mica: Jorge Costa resigned on December 21, 2010. Incoming Jos\u00e9 Guilherme started Dec 27, 2010. Vacancy date is Dec 21, 2010\u2014still before the claim's date.\n\n5. Naval 1 de Maio again: R\u00f3gerio Gon\u00e7alves was sacked on December 19, 2010. Incoming Carlos Mozer started Dec 30, 2010. Vacancy date is Dec 19, 2010\u2014nope.\n\n6. Portimonense: Litos was sacked on December 28, 2011. Incoming Carlos Azenha was appointed on Dec 29, 2010. Wait a minute, that doesn't make sense because the incoming date is in 2010, but the vacancy is in 2011? That seems conflicting. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at row 6: The outgoing head coach is Litos, manner of departure sacked on Dec 28, 2011. Incoming is Carlos Azenha appointed on Dec 29, 2010. Wait, that's a problem because the appointment date (Dec 29, 2010) is earlier than the vacancy date (Dec 28, 2011). That doesn't make logical sense. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps I'm misreading it.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking back, maybe the date of vacancy for Portimonense is Dec 28, 2011. The incoming coach was appointed on Dec 29, 2010. That seems inconsistent because how can someone be appointed before the vacancy occurs? It might mean that Carlos Azenha was already in place before Litos left, but that's unusual.\n\nBut according to the table, Portimonense's outgoing coach Litos was sacked on Dec 28, 2011, and the incoming is Carlos Azenha with an appointment date of Dec 29, 2010. That seems like a mistake because the appointment should be after the vacancy.\n\nBut regardless, according to the claim, we need a vacancy date after Dec 28, 2011, but in this row, it's exactly on Dec 28, 2011, which is not \"after.\" So even if there was a mistake, it doesn't meet the condition of being after.\n\nMoving on to the next rows:\n\n7. Acad\u00e9mica again: Jos\u00e9 Guilherme resigned on Feb 20, 2011. Incoming Ullisses Morais started Feb 22, 2011. Vacancy is Feb 20, 2011\u2014still before Dec 28, 2011.\n\n8. Sporting: Paulo S\u00e9rgio resigned on Feb 26, 2011. Incoming Jos\u00e9 Couceiro started the same day. Vacancy date is Feb 26, 2011.\n\n9. Beira-Mar: Leonardo Jardim resigned on Feb 28, 2011. Incoming Rui Bento started March 1, 2011. Vacancy is Feb 28, 2011.\n\n10. Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal: Manuel Fernandes was sacked on March 1, 2011. Incoming Bruno Ribeiro started the same day. Vacancy date is March 1, 2011.\n\nSo none of these rows have a vacancy date after Dec 28, 2011. The only row with Carlos Azenha as incoming coach is Portimonense, which had the vacancy on Dec 28, 2011, but not after that date.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table where both conditions are met: a vacancy date after Dec 28, 2011, and Carlos Azenha as incoming coach. So the claim is not supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves determining if there exists an instance where the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha following a vacancy occurring after December 28, 2011.\n\nAfter analyzing all entries:\n\n- **Portimonense**: The outgoing coach was sacked on December 28, 2011. However, the appointment of Carlos Azenha as the incoming coach occurred on December 29, 2010, which is before the vacancy date and thus does not satisfy the condition.\n\nNo other entries in the dataset meet both criteria: a vacancy after December 28, 2011, with Carlos Azenha as the incoming coach.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is no instance where Carlos Azenha was appointed as an incoming head coach following a vacancy that occurred after December 28, 2011.",
