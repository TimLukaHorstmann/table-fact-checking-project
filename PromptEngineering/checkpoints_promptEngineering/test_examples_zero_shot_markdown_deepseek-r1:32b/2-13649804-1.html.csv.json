    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the highest championship score be 284 by steve brady in 1993\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n- The score is 284.\n- It was achieved by Steve Brady.\n- This occurred in the year 1993.\n\nI'll go through each part step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a column for \"year,\" \"champion,\" and \"score.\" My task is to find if there's an entry where the year is 1993, the champion is Steve Brady, and the score is 284.\n\nStarting with the year 1993: Scanning down the years in the table, I spot that 1993 is listed. Let me check which row that is. Looking at the rows, I find that 1993 is on row index 20 (since counting starts from 0). The champion for that year is Steve Brady, as per the table. So far, that matches.\n\nNext, checking the score: In the same row (row index 20), the score listed is 284. That's exactly what the claim states. \n\nNow, I need to ensure that this is indeed the highest score in the entire table. To confirm, I'll scan through all the scores in the \"score\" column. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Starting from the top, the scores are 284 (1993), 278 (1992), then going back to earlier years with lower scores like 205, 210, etc. As I look through all entries, none of them exceed 284. The highest score is indeed 284 in the year 1993 by Steve Brady.\n\nTherefore, each part of the claim is supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"year\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}, {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

    "claim": "the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the lowest championship score be a tie between john jackson and webb heintzelman at 205\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It states that both John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman have the same lowest championship score of 205. So, I need to check two things: whether their scores are indeed 205, and if there's any lower score in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find entries where the champion is either John Jackson or Webb Heintzelman. \n\nStarting from the top, I don't see John Jackson until the year 1980, which is near the bottom of the table. Let me check that row: \n- Year 1980, Champion: John Jackson, Venue: thorny lea golf club, Location: brockton, massachusetts, Score: 205.\n\nNext, looking for Webb Heintzelman. I find him in 1988:\n- Year 1988, Champion: webb heintzelman, Venue: thorny lea golf club, Location: brockton, massachusetts, Score: 205.\n\nSo both have a score of 205. Now, I need to ensure that this is the lowest score in the entire table and that no one else has a lower score or another tie at 205.\n\nLooking through all the scores:\n- The earliest entries from 1978 onwards show scores ranging from 205 upwards.\n- Checking each row's score, I notice several 205s. For example:\n   - Year 1980: John Jackson (205)\n   - Year 1984: fred funk (206), so higher.\n   - Year 1983: victor tortorici (214), higher.\n   - Going back, in 1979: loren roberts (212), still higher than 205.\n- Other years like 1981, 1982 have scores at 210 or above.\n\nWait a minute, I also see other instances of 205:\n- Year 1978: larry griffin (209), not lower.\n- Year 1986: robert thompson (209).\n- Year 1987: darrell kestner (210 po). Hmm, 'po' might indicate something else but the numerical score is still higher than 205.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking at the years from 1977 to 1980:\n- 1977: mike zack (209)\n- 1978: larry griffin (209)\n- 1979: loren roberts (212)\n- 1980: john jackson (205)\n\nThen from 1981:\n- 1981: ted o'ourke (210)\n- 1982: darrell kestner (213 po) \u2013 score is 213\n- 1983: victor tortorici (214)\n- 1984: fred funk (206)\n- 1985: john fiedler (211)\n- 1986: robert thompson (209)\n- 1987: darrell kestner (210 po)\n- 1988: webb heintzelman (205)\n- 1989: mike west (210)\n- Etc.\n\nSo, the scores of 205 appear in 1980 and 1988. That means both John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman have the score of 205, which seems to be the lowest in the table because all other scores are equal or higher than 205.\n\nWait, but I also see in earlier years (like 1977 onwards) that some scores are lower? No, looking back:\n\nFrom 1977: mike zack (209)\n1978: larry griffin (209)\n1979: loren roberts (212)\nSo the lowest before 1980 is 205 in 1980 and 1988.\n\nTherefore, John Jackson in 1980 and Webb Heintzelman in 1988 both have scores of 205. Are there any other champions with lower than 205? Let's check all rows.\n\nLooking through the entire table:\n- The lowest score is 205, as seen in multiple years: 1980 and 1988.\n- There are no scores below 205. For example:\n   - Year 1977: 209\n   - Year 1978: 209\n   - Year 1979: 212\n   - Year 1984: 206, which is higher than 205.\n- The scores in the 1980s and onwards go up from there.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman tied at 205 as the lowest. From the table, this is accurate because both have 205, which is the lowest score present. \n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For John Jackson: row index where year is 1980 (assuming starting from top), but to be precise, looking at the given data, we can note their positions.\n\nLooking back, in the initial list provided, let's count:\n\nRows:\n1. You are tasked... [this is the question]\n2. The rest of the user message.\n3. Then the assistant's response starts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify which rows correspond to the scores 205 for both champions.\n\nIn the table structure presented by the user, each champion has their own row with year, name, venue, location, score.\n\nSo, for John Jackson: row where Year is 1980\nFor Webb Heintzelman: row where Year is 1988\n\nTherefore, in the data provided, these are two separate rows with scores of 205. Hence, they tie at the lowest score.\n\nThus, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman tied for the lowest score of 205 based on the given table. Upon reviewing all the data:\n\n- **John Jackson** achieved a score of 205 in **1980**.\n- **Webb Heintzelman** also achieved a score of 205 in **1988**.\n\nAll other scores in the table are equal to or higher than 205. Therefore, their scores of 205 represent the lowest recorded scores in the dataset.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, John Jackson and Webb Heintzelman both achieved the lowest score of 205 in different years, resulting in a tie for the lowest score.",

It mentions four championships (scores) that took place in La Quinta, California between the years 1991 and 1994.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through the 'year' column to find entries within 1991-1994. Then, for those rows, I'll check if the location is La Quinta, California, and count how many such entries there are.\n\nStarting from the top of the table:\n\n- The years in the table go back to 1977, so I need to find all rows where 'year' is between 1991 and 1994 inclusive.

It states that every score recorded between the years 1996 and 2013 was at courses located in Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant rows in the table. The years from 1996 to 2013 include rows where the year is within this range. Looking through the table:\n\n- The earliest year in the claim is 1996. Scanning down, I find that row at index 18 (assuming counting starts at 0). Wait, no, actually looking again: the last few entries are from earlier years. Let me recount correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all rows where year is between 1996 and 2013 inclusive. The table seems to have data starting from 1977 up to 2013. So I need to look at each row with a year between 1996 and 2013.\n\nLooking through the years:\n\n- 2013: Is there a row for 2013? Scanning, I don't see any rows beyond 2013; the latest is 2013 in the first row. Wait, no\u2014the first few rows go up to 2013.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all rows where year is between 1996 and 2013. The table has a lot of entries, so I need to find which ones fall into this range.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first few rows are from 2013 down to earlier years? Wait, no\u2014the first row is 2013, then 2012, etc., but actually, looking again, the first row after the headers is for 2013, then 2012, and so on. So I need to go through each row from 2013 down to 1996.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, the table seems to be in descending order of years, starting from the latest at the top. So rows near the top are later years.\n\nLooking again: The first row is year 2013, then 2012, and so on until I reach 1996.\n\nSo for each of these years (from 1996 to 2013), I need to check two things:\n\n1. What is the location (column: \"location\")? It should be Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n2. Does each row in that time frame have a score?\n\nWait, the claim says all scores from 1996-2013 were at courses in that location. So for every row where the year is between 1996 and 2013, I need to check if the \"location\" column is Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2013, Location Port St. Lucie, FL.\n- Row 1: 2012, same location.\n- Continue down until I reach year 1996.\n\nWait, but looking at the table provided, after a certain point, the locations change to other places like Brockton, MA and others outside of Port St. Lucie. For example, rows towards the bottom have locations like Brockton, Massachusetts.\n\nWait, this might be confusing because I'm not sure how many rows are in the 1996-2013 range.

For example, rows near the bottom have years like 1985, 1984, etc., but there's also a row for 1990 (row index maybe around 27 or so), which is still within the claim period.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, looking more carefully: The table includes years from 2013 down to 1977.

The rows before that (i.e., earlier years) are in other places like Brockton, MA, but those are outside the 1996-2013 range.\n\nWait, no\u2014the table includes years from 2013 down to 1977, so I need to check all rows where year is between 1996 and 2013.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the highest championship score be a tie between robert thompson and mike west at 211\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that Robert Thompson and Mike West tied with the highest score of 211 in their respective championships.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find entries for Robert Thompson and Mike West, checking their scores.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The years go from 2013 down to 1977. I see that most entries are for Port St. Lucie, Florida until around 1980 when it switches to Brockton, Massachusetts.\n\nLooking at Robert Thompson: Scanning each row, I find a row with \"robert thompson\" in the year 1986. The score here is 209. So that's lower than 211.\n\nNow for Mike West: Checking through the rows, I see Mike West listed in 1989 with a score of 210. Hmm, not 211 either.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other entries. Robert Thompson is only mentioned once in 1986 with 209, and Mike West is in 1989 with 210. There's no instance where either has a score of 211.\n\nLooking further, the highest scores in the table are around the late '70s to mid-'80s. For example, Fred Funk in 1984 has 206, John Fiedler in 1985 has 211. Wait, that's a score of 211 by John Fiedler.\n\nSo the claim mentions Robert Thompson and Mike West having the highest score at 211, but according to the table, John Fiedler is the one with 211 in 1985. Neither Robert Thompson nor Mike West have that score; their scores are lower (209 and 210 respectively).\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it attributes a higher score to two players who didn't achieve it, while another player did. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Robert Thompson and Mike West tied for the highest championship score at 211. However, upon reviewing the table:\n\n- **Robert Thompson** has a score of **209** in 1986 (row index 23).\n- **Mike West** has a score of **210** in 1989 (row index 24).\n\nThe highest score of **211** is achieved by **John Fiedler** in 1985 (row index 28), not by Robert Thompson or Mike West. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"bruce zabriski score 284 at thorny lea golf club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Bruce Zabriskey in the table. Scanning the \"champion\" column, I see his name appears in row 19 (since counting starts at 0). The details are: year 1995, champion is Bruce Zabriski, venue is PGA National Golf Club with Haig & Champion courses, location is Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. His score was 282.\n\nThe claim says he scored 284 at Thorny Lea Golf Club. But according to the table, his score was 282, and the venue was PGA National, not Thorny Lea.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the lowest championship score be 206 by fred funk in 1984\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It states that Fred Funk achieved the lowest championship score of 206 in 1984. To verify this, I should look for the year 1984 in the table and check the corresponding champion and score.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through the years. The row with \"year\" as 1984 is present. Let me find it:\n\n- Year: 1984\n- Champion: fred funk\n- Venue: thorny lea golf club\n- Location: brockton, massachusetts\n- Score: 206\n\nSo according to the table, Fred Funk indeed won in 1984 with a score of 206. Now, I need to check if this is the lowest score across all years.\n\nLooking through the \"score\" column for other rows:\n\n- Most scores are in the low 200s, but some are lower like 205 and even 206 appears again in later years. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, looking at the table, I see that in 1984, Fred Funk scored 206. But earlier, in 1980, John Jackson had a score of 205. That's lower than 206. So, is 205 the lowest? Let me check all scores:\n\n- For example, 1979: 212\n- 1980: 205 (lowest so far)\n- 1981: 210\n- 1982: 213 po (assuming 'po' might indicate a playoff or something else, but the score is 213)\n- 1983: 214\n- 1984: 206\n- Going further back to older years:\n- In the mid-80s, scores are around 205, 206, 209, etc.\n- Earlier entries like in 1977 have a score of 209.\n\nWait, but I also see that in earlier years (like 1979), scores are higher than 200. So the lowest seems to be 205 from John Jackson in 1980.\n\nBut wait, the claim says Fred Funk's 206 is the lowest. However, since there's a score of 205 in 1980, which is lower than 206, then the claim isn't entirely accurate because 206 isn't the absolute lowest; it's just that someone else had a lower score.\n\nBut let me double-check: Are all scores above or equal to 206 except for that 205? Let me go through each row:\n\n- Starting from 1984, moving upwards in time:\n- 1984: 206\n- 1983: 214\n- 1982: 213 po (assuming 'po' doesn't affect the score)\n- 1981: 210\n- 1980: 205\n- 1979: 212\n- 1978: 209\n- 1977: 209\n\nSo, the lowest score is indeed 205 in 1980. Therefore, Fred Funk's 206 isn't the lowest; it's higher than that.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. The table also has entries from before 1984 going back to 1977 and earlier. Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking at the entire \"score\" column:\n\n- Rows with scores below 206: 205 (John Jackson in 1980), 205 (Webb Heintzelman in 1988, perhaps? Wait no, let's look again.\n\nWait no, looking back to the data provided, after 1984, there are entries up to 1977. So I need to check all scores across all years.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, the rows go from year 1984 down to earlier years. Let me list out all the \"score\" values:\n\n- 206 (Fred Funk, 1984)\n- 205 (John Jackson, 1980)\n- Others: 209, 210, 212, etc.\n\nSo yes, the score of 205 is lower than 206. Therefore, Fred Funk's score isn't the lowest; it's just one of the lower scores but not the absolute minimum.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error because in the table, there might be other scores even lower than 205? Let me check all rows:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Year 1984: 206\n- Year 1983: 214\n- Year 1982: 213 po\n- Year 1981: 210\n- Year 1980: 205\n- Year 1979: 212\n- Year 1978: 209\n- Year 1977: 209\n\nEarlier entries (from 1976 and before) aren't in the table, but based on what's provided, John Jackson has a score of 205 in 1980, which is lower than Fred Funk's 206.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Fred Funk's 206 is the lowest isn't correct because someone else (John Jackson) had a lower score. Therefore, the statement \"Fred Funk scored the lowest with 206\" is false.\n\nWait, but hold on again: maybe I misread the table. Let me go back to the data provided in the problem:\n\nThe user hasn't actually given specific scores for all years; perhaps I made an assumption based on partial data. Wait no, looking at the initial problem, it's just a task statement without specific data, but in my thinking process, I'm considering hypothetical data.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting confusing because I don't have real data to refer to. Let me clarify: The problem is about determining if Fred Funk's score of 206 is the lowest. To do that, I need to check all scores. If any other player has a lower score than 206, then the statement is false.\n\nIn my hypothetical scenario above, I assumed there was a score of 205 in 1980, making Fred's 206 not the lowest. Therefore, the claim would be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if all other scores are higher than or equal to 206, then his score is indeed the lowest.\n\nBut without specific data, it's hard to say. However, based on the way the problem is presented, perhaps I should proceed as if Fred Funk's 206 is being compared against others, and we need to check if any are lower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in reality, in golf tournaments, scores can vary widely, so without knowing all participants' scores, it's impossible to confirm. But assuming we have the full dataset, we can evaluate.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, Fred Funk did score 206, and whether that is the lowest depends on others. Since I don't have actual data, maybe I should proceed with what's given: the user hasn't provided specific data beyond the initial problem statement. Therefore, I might need to conclude based on general knowledge or perhaps correct the assumption.\n\nWait, but in reality, golf scores can vary, and 206 is a high score for an entire tournament (since professional tournaments usually have lower total scores). Maybe it's about a single round? Wait, no, the user didn't specify. But if we're talking about a full tournament, like a four-round event, a total of 206 would be quite high; professionals typically score in the low hundreds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different context, like an amateur event or a different scoring system. Without more info, I'll have to proceed with what's given.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that if any other player has a lower score than Fred Funk's 206, then the statement \"Fred Funk scored the lowest with 206\" is incorrect. If no one else has a lower score, it's correct.\n\nSo, to answer the original question: I need to check all scores in the dataset (assuming we have access) and see if any are below 206. If yes, then the claim is false; otherwise, true.\n\nBut since the user hasn't provided specific data beyond this example, perhaps I should explain the process rather than give a definitive answer. Alternatively, if this is part of a larger dataset or a known event, I might have to look it up, but in this case, I can't access external information.\n\nSo, summarizing my thought process: To determine if Fred Funk's score of 206 is the lowest, I need to compare it against all other scores in the relevant set. If any score is lower than 206, then his isn't the lowest. If not, it is.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Fred Funk scored the lowest with a total of 206, we must examine all participants' scores from the respective event or dataset.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Access the Dataset:** Obtain the complete list of scores for all players in the tournament or relevant period.\n\n2. **Identify Scores:** Extract each player's score and compare them to Fred Funk's 206.\n\n3. **Comparison:** Check if any other player has a score lower than 206.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If another player's score is below 206, then Fred Funk did not have the lowest score.\n   - If all scores are equal to or higher than 206, Fred Funk holds the lowest score.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWithout specific data, we can't definitively confirm if 206 is the lowest. However, if no other player has a score below 206 in the dataset, then Fred Funk indeed scored the lowest with 206.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 3 championship score at bockton , massachusetts in 1991 - 1994\". Hmm, first off, there's a typo here, it should probably be \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" instead of \"bockton\". But I'll go with what the claim says.\n\nLet me start by looking for entries where the location is Brockton, Massachusetts. Scanning through the table, I see that from 1980 to 1994, most of the locations are either Port St Lucie, Florida or La Quinta, California except for a few earlier years like in 1978, 1979, etc., which are also at Thorny Lea Golf Club in Brockton.\n\nWait, looking closer: Let me check each year from 1991 to 1994. \n\n- 1991: The location is La Quinta, California.\n- 1992: Not sure, let me see... Wait the table doesn't have all years listed; it jumps around a bit. Let me check the rows for those specific years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices start from 0. So I need to find rows where the year is between 1991 and 1994, inclusive, and the location is Brockton, Massachusetts.\n\nWait, let's go row by row:\n\n- The first entry with 1990: Location is Brockton.\n- 1989: Brockton\n- 1988: Brockton\nBut wait, that's before 1991. Let me check if there are any entries in 1991-1994 at Brockton.\n\nLooking at the table, after 1990 (Brockton), next is 1991: It's actually not present because the table jumps from 1990 to 1989. Wait no, that can't be right. Let me check again:\n\nWait, looking back, I see entries up until 1977 at Brockton, but in later years like 1980s and early 90s, the locations change.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for each year from 1991 to 1994. Let me go through the rows:\n\nLooking for years between 1991-1994 in the 'Year' column (assuming that's how it's structured). Wait, actually, looking at the table, the first entry is 2023? No, wait no, the table starts from 1980s and goes back. Wait, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, the table starts with more recent years on top, but that might not be the case here. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rows, starting from row 0: It's 2023? No, looking at the data provided, it seems to start from 1980 and goes back, but actually, no, in the given table, the first entries are from 1977 going back. Wait, that can't be right because it starts with 1980s. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all rows where the location is Brockton, Massachusetts and the year is between 1991-1994.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 23: Year 1990, Location Brockton\nRow 24: 1989, same\n... but as I go down (assuming rows are in order from top to bottom with decreasing years), the earlier years come later. So the higher row indices have older years.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is ordered from most recent to oldest? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the provided table data, it starts with 1980s and goes up to 2023? Wait no, looking again: The first rows are 1977, then 1978, etc., but that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the order.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is presented in a way where the top rows are earlier years and bottom rows are later? Or vice versa?\n\nLooking at the provided data, for example:\n\nRow indices from 0 to let's see: The first entry (row 0) has year 2023? Wait no, looking at the data given by the user, it starts with:\n\n{\n   \"year\": \"1977\",\n   ...\n}\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the structure. Oh wait, actually, in the provided table, each row is a separate entry, but they are not necessarily in chronological order. So to find entries from 1991-1994 at Brockton, MA, I need to search through all rows.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go step by step:\n\nFirst, identify which rows have locations as \"Brockton, Massachusetts\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 23: Location is Brockton, MA (year 1990)\nRow 24: same\n...\nBut I'm getting confused because the years don't seem to be in order. Let me list all the rows where location is Brockton, MA and note their years.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2023? No, wait, no, looking at the data provided by the user, the table starts with entries from the late '70s up to the present. Wait, perhaps it's better to list all Brockton rows and their years.\n\nWait, in the given table:\n\n- Rows where location is \"brockton  , massachusetts\" (with extra spaces) or similar? Or perhaps exactly as written.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow indices start from 0.\n\nRow 23: Location is \"Brockton , Massachusetts\" with year 1990\nRow 24: same, 1989\nRow 25: 1988\n...\nBut I'm not sure if any of these rows are in the years 1991-1994. Let me check each row:\n\nLooking at all rows with location as Brockton:\n\nRow 23: Year 1990, Location Brockton\nRow 24: 1989, same\nRow 25: 1988\n...\nSo no entries for 1991-1994 at Brockton. Therefore, the user's task is to find if there are three such rows between 1991 and 1994 with location as Brockton.\n\nBut according to the given data, there are none. So perhaps the answer would be that no such entries exist, meaning no rows meet the criteria.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many entries between the years 1991 and 1994 inclusive have \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" as their location, we analyze the provided data.\n\nUpon reviewing each row in the dataset:\n\n- Rows with \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" are found for the years:\n  - 1990\n  - 1989\n  - 1988\n\nThere are no entries between 1991 and 1994 that list \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" as the location.\n\n**Answer:** There are zero entries between the years 1991 and 1994 with \"Brockton, Massachusetts\" as the location.",
