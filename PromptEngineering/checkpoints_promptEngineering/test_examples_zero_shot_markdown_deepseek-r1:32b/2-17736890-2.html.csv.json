    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the game between ipswich town and leyton orient have the highest attendance of the list.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row that has both ipswich town as the home team and leyton orient as the away team. Scanning down the rows, I notice that row 18 mentions \"ipswich town\" under the \"home team\" column and \"leyton orient\" under the \"away team\" column.\n\nNext, I need to check the attendance for this game. In row 18, the \"attendance\" column shows 10477. Now, I have to verify if this is indeed the highest attendance in the entire table.\n\nLooking through all the rows:\n\n- Row 1: 9293\n- Row 2: 6261\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998\n- Row 7: 5366\n- Row 8: 2682\n- Row 9: 6471\n- Row 10: 5574\n- Row 11: 3399\n- Row 12: 5684\n- Row 13: 6239\n- Row 14: 3525\n- Row 15: 7230\n- Row 16: 3094\n- Row 17: 2360\n- Row 18: 10477\n\nComparing all these numbers, 10477 is indeed the highest. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are in row 18 for \"home team\", \"away team\", and \"attendance\". However, since the question only asks about attendance to verify the claim, I'll include only the \"attendance\" cell from that row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the score of the game with the lowest attendance be 1 - 2\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. I have a table that lists various games with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance. My task is to find out which game had the lowest attendance and then check if the score of that particular game was indeed 1-2.\n\nOkay, starting with the attendance column because that's crucial for identifying the game in question. I need to scan through each row's attendance number and find the smallest one.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 3: Attendance is 2735\nRow 4: 2571\nRow 5: 2566\nRow 6: It looks like there are multiple rows with \"cheltenham town won...\" but I think that might be an error because all columns in a row should correspond to the same game. Maybe it's just one row with all cells filled with the same info? But attendance is listed as 2998 here.\nRow 7: 5366\nRow 8: 2682\nRow 10: 5574\nRow 11: 3399\nRow 12: 5684\nRow 13: 6239\nRow 14: 3525\nRow 15: 7230\nRow 16: 3094\nRow 17: 2360\nRow 18: 10477\n\nWait, row 18 has the highest attendance at 10477. The lower ones are:\n\nLooking for the smallest number. Let's list all attendances again more clearly:\n\n- Row 3: 2735\n- Row 4: 2571\n- Row 5: 2566\n- Row 6: 2998 (but this row seems to have incorrect data as it's repeating the same info across columns, maybe a formatting error)\n- Row 8: 2682\n- Row 14: 3525\n- Row 17: 2360\n\nWait, row 17 has 2360, which is lower than the others I noted. So that's attendance for row 17.\n\nSo the lowest attendance is at row 17 with 2360. Now, what was the score of that game?\n\nLooking at row 17:\n\nScore is \"1 - 2\". The home team was dagenham & redbridge against reading.\n\nSo yes, the score is 1-2 where dagenham lost to reading.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that the lowest attendance game had a score of 1-2. Which matches what I found here. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The 'score' column is where I should look for goal numbers.\n\nI'll go through each row's score to identify all instances where either the home or away team scored 4 goals. \n\n- Row 1: Coventry City 3 - Aldershot Town 1 \u2192 Highest here is 3.\n- Row 2: Milton Keynes Don 1 - Norwich City 0 \u2192 Highest is 1.\n- Row 3: Wycombe Wanderers 0 - Birmingham City 4 \u2192 Here, Birmingham scored 4.

That's the third instance.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me double-check each row from 1 to 18:\n\nRow 3: Birmingham City scored 4 (third column).\nRow 4: Brighton scored 4 (first part of score).\nRow 18: Ipswich Town scored 4.\n\nSo that's three times a team scored exactly 4 goals. \n\nI don't see any other instances where a team scored more than 4, so the highest is indeed 4 and it appears thrice.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"only 1 game resulted in a 0 score for both teams but changed after extra time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table to check the 'score 1' column and see which games ended with a 0-0 result. \n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n- Row 1: Coventry City vs Aldershot Town - Score is 3-1.\n- Row 2: Milton Keynes Donvs vs Norwich City - Score is 1-0.\n- Row 3: Wycombe Wanderers vs Birmingham City - Score is 0-4. Wait, no, the score is 0 for Wycombe and 4 for Birmingham, so it's not a 0-0.\n\nContinuing:\n- Row 4: Brighton & Hove Albion vs Barnet - 4-0.\n- Row 5: Gillingham vs Colchester United - 0-1. Again, only one team has 0.\n- Row 6: Southend United vs Cheltenham Town - The score is 0-0.\n\nWait a minute, looking at row 6, it shows \"cheltenham town won 1  - 0 after extra time\" in all columns. That's odd because it seems like the main table data got messed up for that particular tie number. It appears that this row might be an error or perhaps an additional note about a game.\n\nBut focusing on the 'score 1' column, I see that only row 6 has \"0 - 0\" as the score before any extra time. The rest of the rows either have one team with 0 or both teams scoring more than 0.\n\nHowever, for row 7 onwards:\n- Row 7: Swansea City vs Brentford - 2-0.\n- Row 8: Luton Town vs Plymouth Argyle - 2-0.\n- Row 9: Exeter City vs Southampton - 1-3.\n- And so on. None of these have a 0-0 score.\n\nNow, considering the claim mentions that the game resulted in a 0-0 but changed after extra time. From row 6, it's noted that Cheltenham Town won 1-0 after extra time. So this was the only game where both teams had 0 goals initially, and then after extra time, the score became 1-0.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other rows with a 0-0 in 'score 1' that also have an extra-time result. Looking through all rows again:\n- Only row 6 has \"0 - 0\" and mentions extra time resulting in a win for Cheltenham Town.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only one game (row 6) had both teams scoring 0 initially, which changed after extra time.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim into two parts: \n\n1. The game between Ipswich Town and Leyton Orient has the highest attendance.\n2. This same game has the lowest total score.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the attendance numbers in the 'attendance' column to find which row has the highest value. Scanning through the rows, the last one (row 18) shows an attendance of 10477. Comparing this with other attendances like 9293 and 6471, it's clear that 10477 is indeed the highest in the list.\n\nNext, I'll check the total scores for each game to see if row 18 has the lowest. The 'score 1' column shows various results, such as \"3 - 1\", \"1 - 0\", etc. To find the total score, I need to add both numbers in each game's score.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- Row 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n- Row 2: 1 + 0 = 1\n- Row 3: 0 + 4 = 4\n- Row 4: 4 + 0 = 4\n- Row 5: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Row 6: 0 + 0 = 0 (but it's a draw, so total is 0)\n- Row 7: 2 + 0 = 2\n- Row 8: 2 + 0 = 2\n- Row 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Row 10: 1 + 0 = 1\n- Row 11: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Row 12: 2 + 1 = 3\n- Row 13: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Row 14: 0 + 1 = 1\n- Row 15: 2 + 3 = 5\n- Row 16: 2 + 1 = 3\n- Row 17: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Row 18: 4 + 1 = 5\n\nThe lowest total score is in row 6, which is a draw with both teams scoring 0. So the claim that Ipswich vs Leyton has the lowest total score is incorrect because their total was 5, not the lowest.\n\nTherefore, while the attendance part is correct, the total score part isn't. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"for all the game list, the attendance be never under 2360\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: tie no, home team, score 1, away team, and attendance. The rows list various games with their details.\n\nThe claim states that in all games listed, the attendance is never under 2360. So, my task is to check each game's attendance figure to ensure none are below 2360.\n\nI'll start from the top of the table:\n\n1. Row 0: Attendance is 9293 - way above 2360.\n2. Row 1: 6261, also well above.\n3. Row 2: 2735, still above.\n4. Row 3: 2571, okay.\n5. Row 4: 2566, still good.\n6. Row 5: 2998, yes.\n\nWait a second, row 6 seems off. The entire row is repeating the same phrase \"cheltenham town won 1 0 after extra time\" across all columns. That might be an error or maybe it's indicating that this game went into extra time, but I don't see an attendance number here. So perhaps there's no data for attendance in row 6. But since the claim is about \"all the game list,\" and if there's a missing data point, does that affect the claim? The instruction says to check each condition against the table as given. If attendance isn't provided, I can't verify it for that row, which might make the claim invalid because we don't know.\n\nBut let me continue checking other rows:\n\n7. Row 6: As mentioned, no numerical data.\n8. Row 7: 5366\n9. Row 8: 2682\n10. Row 9: 6471\n11. Row 10: 5574\n12. Row 11: 3399\n13. Row 12: 5684\n14. Row 13: 6239\n15. Row 14: 3525\n16. Row 15: 7230\n17. Row 16: 3094\n18. Row 17: 2360\n19. Row 18: 10477\n\nWait, row 17 has attendance exactly 2360. The claim is that none are under 2360. So, 2360 is the threshold; anything equal or above is acceptable.\n\nBut what about rows without data? For example, row 6 doesn't have an attendance figure provided. In such cases, can we assume it's under or over? Since the claim says \"for all,\" if any game has attendance below 2360 or if there's missing data, it might make the claim false.\n\nWait, but row 17 is exactly 2360, which meets the condition. However, in row 5 (tie no 6), the attendance is 2998, which is above 2360. So all rows except row 6 have attendances above or equal to 2360.\n\nBut then I realize that row 17 has attendance exactly 2360. The claim says \"never under,\" so 2360 is acceptable. But perhaps the user meant strictly above, but as written, it's \"under,\" which 2360 isn't under, so it's fine.\n\nWait no, row 17 is 2360, which is exactly equal to the threshold. So according to the claim, that's still acceptable because it's not under.\n\nBut then I look back at row 6: It doesn't have an attendance number. The entire row seems to be a duplicate or perhaps an error in formatting. For example, the tie no is 7, but the rows are numbered up to 18 with some ties missing. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo where they meant to add more info but didn't.\n\nIn any case, for the games listed, except row 6 which doesn't have attendance data, all other attendances are above or equal to 2360. So does row 6 affect the claim? The claim says \"for all the game list.\" If a game in the list doesn't provide attendance, then we can't confirm it meets the condition, making the overall claim potentially false because not all games meet the criteria (some might have lower attendances).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to include row 6 as part of the table but didn't input the data correctly. But based on what's given, row 6 doesn't have an attendance figure.\n\nWait another thought: Row numbers go from 0 to 18, which is 19 rows. The tie nos are up to 18? Wait no, looking again:\n\nTie nos in the table are 1, 2, 3, ..., but row 6 has tie no as \"7\". Wait that doesn't make sense because after row 5 (tie no 6), the next is row 6 with tie no 7. So perhaps it's a numbering error.\n\nWait actually, the first few rows have tie nos 1 to 6, then the next row (row 6) has tie no 7? That would make sense because each row is a separate game. But in that case, row 6 should have an attendance figure as well. However, it's filled with text instead.\n\nSo perhaps this is an error in data entry, and we can't consider that row for the claim since there's no numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all other rows except row 6 are correct, and row 6 is a duplicate or mistake.\n\nBut regardless, according to the table as presented, some games don't have attendance numbers. However, only the rows with numerical data in the attendance column matter for this claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at all the rows that have an attendance number:\n\nRow 0: 9293\nRow 1: 6261\nRow 2: 2735\nRow 3: 2571\nRow 4: 2566\nRow 5: 2998\nRow 7: 5366\nRow 8: 2682\nRow 9: 6471\nRow 10: 5574\nRow 11: 3399\nRow 12: 5684\nRow 13: 6239\nRow 14: 3525\nRow 15: 7230\nRow 16: 3094\nRow 17: 2360\nRow 18: 10477\n\nWait, but in the initial count, row 6 doesn't have an attendance number. So rows with data are from 0-5, then starting again at tie no 7 (row 6) which is a problem.\n\nBut perhaps that's just how it's presented\u2014maybe the user meant to include all games up to tie no 18 but had some formatting issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row 6 is a duplicate of another game or an error. But regardless, for this analysis, I can only consider rows with numerical attendance data.\n\nSo in those, the smallest attendance is 2360 (row 17). So according to that, all attendances are equal to or above 2360, which meets the claim's condition of \"never under.\"\n\nWait but if row 6 doesn't have an attendance figure, can we include it in the analysis? The claim is about all games listed. If a game's attendance isn't listed, then technically, we can't confirm that its attendance wasn't below 2360. So in such cases, the claim would be invalid because not all games meet the condition (we don't know about row 6).\n\nBut perhaps the user intended for row 6 to have an attendance figure but didn't provide it. In real analysis, missing data points can complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread row 6. Let me check again:\n\nRow 6: tie no is 7, home team is \"cheltenham town won 1 0 after extra time\", score 1 is same as home team? That seems off. The rest of the columns also have that text instead of numerical data.\n\nSo it's clear that row 6 was entered incorrectly and doesn't provide valid attendance information. Therefore, for the purposes of this claim, perhaps we should exclude row 6 because it lacks necessary data.\n\nIn that case, all other rows with valid attendance figures are above or equal to 2360, so the claim holds.\n\nWait but let me confirm: Is there any game in the table where attendance is below 2360?\n\nLooking through the numbers:\n\n- Row 17 has exactly 2360. The rest are higher.\n\nSo no games have attendance under 2360. Therefore, the claim is correct based on the data provided, except for row 6 which lacks data but isn't a numerical value below 2360; it's just missing.\n\nBut if we consider all rows with data, they meet the condition. So maybe the answer is that the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in all listed games, attendance is never under 2360. After analyzing each game:\n\n- Most games have attendances significantly above 2360.\n- One game has exactly 2360 attendees.\n- A problematic row lacks valid data but isn't below 2360.\n\nThus, the claim holds true for all games with available data.\n\n**Answer:** Yes",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no game that result in a 0 score for both team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's saying there's no game where both teams scored zero goals. So, I'm looking for any row in the table where the home team and away team scores are both zero.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe relevant columns are \"home team\", \"score 1\", and \"away team\". The \"score 1\" column shows the results of each game as home score - away score. I'll go through each row to check if any have a score like 0-0, which would mean both teams scored zero.\n\nStarting from row 1:\nRow 1: Coventry City vs Aldershot Town, score is 3-1 \u2192 Not 0-0.\nRow 2: Milton Keynes Dons vs Norwich City, score 1-0 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: Wycombe Wanderers 0-4 Birmingham City \u2192 Home team scored 0, but away team scored 4. So not both zero.\nRow 4: Brighton & Hove Albion 4-0 Barnet \u2192 Both teams didn't score zero.\nRow 5: Gillingham 0-1 Colchester United \u2192 Again, only home team is zero.\nRow 6: Southend United vs Cheltenham Town, score 0-0. Wait, that's a draw with both scoring zero? But looking closely, the next row (row 7) has \"cheltenham town won 1 - 0 after extra time\". Hmm, perhaps there was an error in the table formatting.\n\nWait, rows 6 and 7 might be merged or have conflicting data. Let me check again:\n\nRow 6: Southend United 0-0 Cheltenham Town \u2192 Attendance is 2998.\nRow 7 starts with \"cheltenham town won...\" but that seems to repeat the same information, possibly an error in the table format.\n\nAssuming row 6 is correct as written, then there's a game where both teams scored zero. So the claim would be FALSE because such a game exists.\n\nBut I need to confirm if row 7 is part of the data or an error. The way it's written suggests that rows 6 and beyond might have issues. However, based on the initial data up to row 18, only row 6 has a 0-0 score.\n\nWait, but in row 6, the score is 0-0, which fits the claim of both teams scoring zero. So the claim that there's no such game would be false because row 6 exists.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cell is row 6, column \"score 1\".\n</think>\n\nThe table shows a game where Southend United and Cheltenham Town drew 0-0 in row 6. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the highest score for any team be 4 and only appear thrice on the table, and be only obtained by home team.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means.\n\nThe first part is that the highest score for any team is 4. So, I'm looking through the 'score 1' column to find the maximum goals scored by a team. Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 3: Wycombe Wanderers (home) lost 0-4, so Birmingham City as away scored 4.\n\nRow 4: Brighton & Hove Albion scored 4 against Barnet.\n\nAny other scores of 4? Looking through the rest, I don't see any. So yes, the highest score is 4, achieved by two teams: Birmingham City and Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nBut wait, the claim says it appears thrice on the table. Hmm, that's a problem because only two instances have a team scoring 4 goals.\n\nWait, let me double-check all rows:\n\nRow 1: Coventry 3-1 Aldershot\nRow 2: MK Dons 1-0 Norwich\nRow 3: Wycombe 0-4 Birmingham (Birmingham scored 4)\nRow 4: Brighton 4-0 Barnet (Brighton scored 4)\nRow 5: Gillingham 0-1 Colchester\nRow 6: Southend 0-0 Cheltenham (extra time, but no 4 goals)\nRows 7-18 don't show any scores of 4. So only two instances where a team scored 4.\n\nSo the highest score is indeed 4, but it appears twice, not thrice. That's one condition failing.\n\nAlso, the claim says these high scores are only obtained by home teams. Let's check who scored those 4 goals:\n\nIn row 3, Birmingham City is away and they scored 4 against Wycombe (home). So that's an away team scoring 4. In row 4, Brighton & Hove Albion is home and scored 4.\n\nSo the highest score of 4 was achieved by both a home team (Brighton) and an away team (Birmingham City), which contradicts the claim that it's only obtained by home teams.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two issues: the high score appears twice instead of thrice, and both home and away teams have achieved this score. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score 1\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"for all the game list, the attendance be never over 9293\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that in every game listed in the table, the attendance figure does not exceed 9293. So, my job is to check each row's attendance value and see if any of them are higher than 9293.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: tie no, home team, score 1, away team, and attendance. The relevant column here is \"attendance\" because that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Attendance is 9293. This equals the threshold but doesn't exceed it.\n2. **Row 1**: Attendance is 6261. This is below 9293.\n3. **Row 2**: Attendance is 2735. Also below.\n4. **Row 3**: Attendance is 2571. Below as well.\n5. **Row 4**: Attendance is 2566. Again, under the limit.\n6. **Row 5**: Attendance is 2998. Still below.\n7. **Row 6**: There's an extra row here that seems to repeat \"cheltenham town won 1 - 0 after extra time\" across all columns. This looks like a mistake or perhaps an incorrect entry. However, since it doesn't provide an attendance figure, I can ignore this row for the purpose of checking numerical data.\n8. **Row 7**: Attendance is 5366. Below 9293.\n9. **Row 8**: Attendance is 2682. Under the threshold.\n10. **Row 9**: Attendance is 6471. Still below.\n11. **Row 10**: Attendance is 5574. Under 9293.\n12. **Row 11**: Attendance is 5684. Below the limit.\n13. **Row 12**: Attendance is 6239. Also under.\n14. **Row 13**: Attendance is 3525. Below.\n15. **Row 14**: Attendance is 7230. Under 9293.\n16. **Row 15**: Attendance is 3094. Still below.\n17. **Row 16**: Attendance is 2360. Under the limit.\n18. **Row 17**: Attendance is 10477. Oh, wait a minute\u2014this is higher than 9293.\n\nUpon reaching row 17, I found that the attendance was 10,477, which exceeds the claimed maximum of 9,293. This means that the claim isn't true for all games because there's at least one instance where attendance was over the stated limit.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
