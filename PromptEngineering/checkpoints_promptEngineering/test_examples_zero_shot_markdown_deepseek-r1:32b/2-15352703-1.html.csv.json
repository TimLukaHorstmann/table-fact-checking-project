    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"draft pick number 155 come from arizona university\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for draft pick number 155 in the 'pick' column. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: pick 16\n- Row 1: pick 43\n- Row 2: pick 70\n- Row 3: pick 101\n- Row 4: pick 155\n\nOkay, found it in row 4. Now, I need to check the 'college' column for this row. The college listed is \"arizona\". \n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"arizona university\" but the table just lists \"arizona\". Are these the same? Arizona University could refer to the University of Arizona. So it's reasonable to consider them equivalent.\n\nTherefore, draft pick 155 (row index 4) is from Arizona, supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because draft pick number 155 attended the University of Arizona, as indicated in row 4.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that Arizona is the college with the last draft pick. So, I need to find out which college has the highest pick number in the table because higher pick numbers mean they were picked later in the draft process.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player's draft details, including their round, pick number, position, and college. The relevant columns here are \"college\" and \"pick\". I need to find the highest value in the \"pick\" column because that will indicate the last pick. \n\nI'll go through the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: Pick 16 (Fresno State)\n- Row 1: Pick 43 (Louisville)\n- Row 2: Pick 70 (Arizona)\n- Row 3: Pick 101 (LSU)\n- Row 4: Skip since it's round 6, but I'll check all picks\nWait, actually, the table goes up to pick 293. So, I need to go through each pick number:\n\nRow 0: 16\nRow 1: 43\nRow 2: 70\nRow 3: 101\nRow 4: 155 (Arizona)\nRow 5: 167\nRow 6: 171\nRow 7: 182\nRow 8: 209\nRow 9: 239\nRow 10: 266\nRow 11: 293 (Northwestern State, LA)\n\nSo the highest pick number is 293 in row 11. The college for that pick is Northwestern State, not Arizona. \n\nWait a second, though. Let me double-check. The claim says \"arizona be the college who have the last draft pick\". So if Arizona has any of the later picks, but not necessarily the very last one, does that matter? Or does it mean they have the very last pick?\n\nIn this context, \"last draft pick\" likely refers to the highest numbered pick. Looking at the table, the highest pick is 293 (row 11), which is Northwestern State, LA. So Arizona's picks are in rows 2 (70) and row 4 (155). The last pick by Arizona is 155, but that's not the overall last pick.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the college with the last draft pick (highest number) is Northwestern State, LA, not Arizona.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The highest pick number is 293 for Northwestern State, not Arizona.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
