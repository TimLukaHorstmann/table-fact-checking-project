    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"mikhail mamistov have a perfection percentage of 77.96\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully looking at the table.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the 'name' column to find Mikhail Mamistov. Scanning through each row:\n\n1. Svetlana Kapanina - not him.\n2. Viktor Chmal - nope.\n3. Mikhail Mamistov - found here. So his row is the third one, which would be index 2 if we start counting from zero.\n\nNow, looking at the columns in that row: 'rank', 'name', 'nationality', 'score', and 'perfection'. The claim mentions perfection percentage, so I need to check the value under the 'perfection' column for this row.\n\nLooking at the table, in row 3 (which is index 2), the 'perfection' value is listed as 77.96%. That exactly matches the claim. \n\nSo, since the name and the perfection percentage both match up with what's stated in the claim, it seems to be true. I don't see any discrepancies here.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 'perfection' column of row 2 (index starting at 0). So I'll list that in the relevant_ells as {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"perfection\"}.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking Mikhail Mamistov's perfection percentage in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 2,\n       \"column_name\": \"perfection\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"pierre marmy have a perfection percentage of 73.24\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table and the claim. The table has five columns: rank, name, nationality, score, and perfection. Each row represents a person with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"pierre marmy\" and his perfection percentage as 73.24%. My goal is to verify this by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nLooking at the rows, I'll search for Pierre Marmy's name. Scanning down, I find Pierre Marmy in row index 8 (since counting starts from 0). The columns we're interested in are \"name\" and \"perfection.\"\n\nIn row 8:\n- The \"name\" column shows \"pierre marmy.\"\n- The \"perfection\" column shows \"73.24%\".\n\nThe claim states that Pierre Marmy has a perfection percentage of exactly 73.24%. Comparing this with the table, it's a direct match.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other entries for Pierre Marmy in case of duplicates, but looking through the table, he appears only once.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"perfection\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"svetlana fedorenko be rank 8\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two pieces of information: the person's name, Svetlana Fedorenko, and her rank being 8. My task is to check if these details match in the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has columns for rank, name, nationality, score, and perfection. The rows go from rank 1 to 9. I'll need to find Svetlana Fedorenko in this table and check her rank.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Rank 1: Svetlana Kapanina\n2. Rank 2: Viktor Chmal\n3. Rank 3: Mikhail Mamistov\n4. Rank 4: Elena Klimovich\n5. Rank 5: Oleg Shpolyanskiy\n6. Rank 6: Castor Fantoba\n7. Rank 7: Fran\u00e7ois Le Vot\n8. Rank 8: Svetlana Fedorenko\n9. Rank 9: Pierre Marmy\n\nAh, there she is at row index 8 (assuming the first data row is index 0). So her rank is indeed 8. \n\nWait, just to make sure I'm counting correctly. The table starts with rank 1 as Svetlana Kapanina, so each subsequent row increments by one in rank. Therefore, Svetlana Fedorenko being at the 8th position (row index 7) actually has a rank of 8. But wait, in the table provided, the rows are zero-indexed? Or is it that the first data row is considered index 0?\n\nWait, no, looking back, the initial markdown shows the header as row 0, and then each subsequent data row starts at index 1. So Svetlana Fedorenko is in row 8 if counting from 1, but in terms of zero-indexing, it's row 7. But when the user refers to \"row_index\", I think they mean the position in the data rows starting from 0. Let me check.\n\nIn the table provided, Svetlana Fedorenko is on the 8th line if counting from 1 (header plus data), but considering only data rows, she's at index 7. However, in the initial markdown, after the header, each row starts with rank 1 and goes down. So row_index 0 would be rank 1, row_index 1 is rank 2, etc. Therefore, Svetlana Fedorenko being rank 8 would be at row_index 7.\n\nWait, no, that's not right because if the table has 9 data rows (ranks 1 to 9), then row indices from 0 to 8 correspond to ranks 1 to 9. So rank 8 is at row index 7. But in the table provided, Svetlana Fedorenko is in the 8th position when counting from 1, which would be row_index 7.\n\nSo yes, her name and rank match correctly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are her name and rank. \n\nWait, but looking back at the table, Svetlana Fedorenko's row is the 8th in data rows (if starting count from 1), which would be row_index 7. But I should confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to index rows as they are presented: header is row 0, then each data row follows. So the first data row is row 1, which is rank 1. So Svetlana Fedorenko is in row 8 (data row 7 if starting from 0). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIn the table provided, the rows are:\n\n| rank | name                | ... |\n|-------:|:-------------------| ... |\n|      1  | svetlana kapanina   | ... |\n|      2  | viktor chmal        | ... |\n...\n|      8  | svetlana fedorenko  | ... |\n\nSo in terms of the data rows, Svetlana Fedorenko is at rank 8. So if we consider row indices starting from 0 for the header and then each data row as 1 onwards, she's in row 8 (since there are 9 data rows). But I think in this context, \"row_index\" refers to the position within the entire table including the header. Or perhaps it's zero-based indexing of the data rows only.\n\nWait, looking at the example given by the user:\n\nIn their example JSON, they have \"row_index\":0 for \"Revenue\", which is a column name in the first row (header). So I think \"row_index\" refers to the entire table including the header. So the header is row 0, then data rows start from row 1.\n\nSo Svetlana Fedorenko is in rank 8, which would be row index 7 because:\n\n- Row 0: Header\n- Rows 1-9: Ranks 1-9\n\nTherefore, her row index is 8 (since Rank 8 is the 8th data row after the header). Wait no, wait: If the first data row is rank 1 at row 1, then rank 2 at row 2, ..., rank 8 would be at row 8. Therefore, row_index is 8.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because there are 9 data rows (ranks 1-9), each corresponding to rows 1-9 in the table (header is row 0). So Svetlana Fedorenko's row index would be 8 for rank 8. Therefore, when checking her name and rank, we look at row_index 8.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, the data rows are from row 1 to row 9. So rank 8 is at row 8 (since ranks start at 1). Therefore, yes, row index 8 for Svetlana Fedorenko's name and rank.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- For her rank: \"rank\" column in row 8\n- For her name: \"name\" column in row 8\n\nThus, both these cells confirm that she is ranked 8. So the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
