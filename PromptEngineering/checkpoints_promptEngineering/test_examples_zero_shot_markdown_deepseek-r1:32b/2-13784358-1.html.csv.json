    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the year 1989 with symphony tower hold the rank of 2\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions three pieces of information: the year 1989, Symphony Tower, and its rank being 2. So I need to check each part against the table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it has columns for rank, name, height in feet (and meters), floors, and year. The rows list various buildings with their details.\n\nI'll start by searching for \"Symphony Tower\" in the 'name' column. Scanning through the names:\n\n- Row 1: one america plaza\n- Row 2: symphony towers\n- So yes, row index 1 (since counting starts at 0) has the name 'symphony towers'.\n\nNow, checking the year for this row. The 'year' column in row 1 says 1989, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, looking at the rank. In row 1, under the 'rank' column, it's listed as 2. So that also aligns with the claim stating it holds rank 2.\n\nWait a second, the table shows \"symphony towers\" and not \"Symphony Tower\". The names are slightly different in capitalization, but I think this is just a minor variation, so it should be considered the same building.\n\nSo putting it all together: the name matches (with some case difference), the year is correct, and the rank is 2. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true based on the table data.\n\nI should also make sure there's no other row that might have conflicting information. Looking through the rest of the table, I don't see any other entry with 'symphony' in the name except for row 1. So there's no conflict here.\n\nThus, all parts of the claim are supported by the relevant cells in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because \"Symphony Towers\" has a rank of 2 and was completed in 1989 according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning the 'name' column, I see a row with \"meridian condominiums\". That's our target.\n\nNext, I check the columns relevant to floors. The claim is about the number of floors. In the table, there's a column named 'floors'. For Meridian Condominiums, this value is 28. \n\nSo, according to the table, Meridian Condominiums do have 28 floors. This directly supports the claim.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information or other entries for Meridian Condominiums that might suggest a different number of floors. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"meridian condominium have 28 floors.\" Checking the table, under the 'floors' column for \"meridian condominiums,\" it indeed shows 28 floors.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"1975 be the year for the nbc building\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It's stating that the NBC Building was completed in 1975. My task is to verify if this information matches what's given in the table.\n\nI'll start by scanning the \"name\" column to find the row where the building is called \"nbc building.\" Scanning through the list, I see towards the bottom of the table that there's a row with \"nbc building\" under the name column. The row index for this entry is 30 (since we start counting from 0 at the top).\n\nOnce I've located the correct row, I need to check the corresponding \"year\" column to see what year it lists. Looking at the same row, the \"year\" column shows 1975. \n\nSo, putting this together: the NBC Building is listed in the table with a completion year of 1975, which exactly matches the claim made. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows that might have the same name or similar names to ensure I haven't missed anything. Scanning through again, all other entries under \"name\" are distinct and none mention NBC except for this single entry. Thus, there's no ambiguity here.\n\nIn conclusion, since the table clearly states that the NBC Building was completed in 1975, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that the NBC building was completed in 1975. Referring to the table, the row containing \"nbc building\" has the year 1975. Therefore, the claim is accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"meridian condominium have 27 number of floor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and scan for entries related to Meridian Condominiums. Scanning down the list, I see a row labeled \"Meridian Condominiums\". The row index here is 20. Let me check the details of that row.\n\nIn the \"floors\" column, it says 28 floors. Wait, so according to this, Meridian Condominiums have 28 floors, not 27 as claimed. That means the claim isn't accurate.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll look through all other rows to ensure there are no other entries that might refer to Meridian Condominiums or something similar. Skimming through the rest of the table, I don't see any other mentions of \"Meridian\" or anything close to it in the names column.\n\nSo, based on the data provided, the relevant cell is row 20 under the \"floors\" column, which states 28 floors. Since the claim says 27, that's incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Meridian Condominiums have 27 floors, but the table shows they have 28.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've been given a table in markdown format and a claim to evaluate. The claim is: \"1975 be the year for rank 30\". My task is to determine whether this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table structure. The columns are 'rank', 'name', 'height feet (m)', 'floors', and 'year'. Each row corresponds to a building with its respective details. \n\nThe claim specifically mentions rank 30. So, my first step is to locate the row where the rank is 30. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The ranks go from 1 to 31.\n- Looking at each row:\n  - Rank 29: Wells Fargo Plaza\n  - Rank 30: El Cortez Apartment Hotel\n  - Rank 31: NBC Building\n\nSo, rank 30 is in the second-to-last row. The details for that row are:\n\n| rank | name                  | height feet (m) | floors | year |\n|------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------|------|\n| 30   | el cortez apartment hotel | 310 (94)        | 16     | 1927 |\n\nWait a minute, the claim says the year for rank 30 is 1975. But according to this row, the year is 1927, not 1975. \n\nHmm, did I misread? Let me double-check. Scanning from top: Rank 30 corresponds to El Cortez Apartment Hotel with a year of 1927. The NBC Building at rank 31 has the year 1975. So, it seems there's been a mix-up in the claim\u2014probably confusing rank 30 with 31.\n\nTherefore, since the year for rank 30 is indeed 1927 and not 1975, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
