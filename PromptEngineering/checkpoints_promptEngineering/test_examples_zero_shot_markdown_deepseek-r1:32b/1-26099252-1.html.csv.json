The claim says, \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean, release november 27th, 2012, be the stable version of the software.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to see what needs verification:\n1. **Version Number**: 4.2.1 Jelly Bean.\n2. **Release Date**: November 27, 2012.\n3. **Stable Version**: It's stated as the stable version.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find a row that has both the version number and release date mentioned in the claim. \n\nI'll scan through each browser's details:\n- Android Browser: The operating system is Android, and looking at the latest stable release column, it says \"4.2.1 jelly bean (November 27, 2012).\" That matches both the version number and the release date mentioned in the claim.\n  \nNow, I'll check if there are any discrepancies or additional information that might affect the truthfulness of the claim:\n- The claim refers to it as \"the stable version,\" and the table explicitly mentions it under the latest stable release for Android Browser. So, that part checks out.\n\nI don't see any other rows with 4.2.1 Jelly Bean or November 27, 2012, so this seems to be the only relevant row.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table, making it TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"latest stable release\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: browser, operating system, latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 (webm), and vp9 (webm). The rows list different browsers along with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about the Android Browser running on Android. So I should find the row where the browser is \"android browser\" and the operating system is \"android.\" Looking at the table, the first row fits this description: \n\n| android browser    | android                             | 4.2.1 jelly bean (November 27, 2012) | 2.3             | 3.0             | 2.3             | no              |\n\nNow, I need to check two things: the version numbers for Theora and H264 in this row.\n\nFor Theora, the value is listed as 2.3. That matches the claim exactly. \n\nNext, looking at H264, it's listed as 3.0, which also aligns with what the claim states.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: Theora version is 2.3 and H264 version is 3.0 for the Android Browser on Android. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** Look for \"android browser\" under the 'browser' column with operating system 'android'.\n2. **Check Theora Version:** In this row, Theora version is 2.3 as per the table.\n3. **Check H264 Version:** In the same row, H264 version is listed as 3.0.\n\nBoth versions match the claim exactly, confirming it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"theora\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim about Konqueror's support for VP8 and VP9 (WebM) is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"Konqueror supports only vp8 (webm) 4.4, but not vp9 (webm).\" So, I need to check two things from the table:\n\n1. Does Konqueror support VP8 WebM? If yes, what version?\n2. Does it support VP9 WebM?\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"vp8 ( webm )\" and \"vp9 ( webm )\". The rows correspond to different browsers.\n\nI'll scan through each row until I find Konqueror's entry.\n\nHere's the table:\n\n1. Android Browser\n2. Chromium\n3. Google Chrome\n4. Internet Explorer (Windows)\n5. Internet Explorer (Windows Phone)\n6. Internet Explorer (Windows RT)\n7. Konqueror\n8. Safari (iOS)\n9.

So yes, Konqueror supports VP8 WebM version 4.4.\n\nNext, checking the VP9 column for Konqueror: it's marked as \"no\". That means Konqueror does not support VP9 WebM.\n\nSo putting that together: Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) at 4.4 but doesn't support VP9. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table for this conclusion. The two columns are \"vp8 ( webm )\" and \"vp9 ( webm )\", both under row index 7 (since Konqueror is the 8th row but zero-indexed it's 6? Wait, wait, no: rows start from 0.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow indices start at 0.

Wait, no\u2014the markdown has 10 lines after the header, so maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to count from 0 as per the data rows starting at index 0:\n\nLooking at the data rows:\n\nRow 0: android browser\nRow 1: chromium\nRow 2: google chrome\nRow 3: internet explorer (windows)\nRow 4: internet explorer (windows phone)\nRow 5: internet explorer (windows rt)\nRow 6: konqueror\nRow 7: safari (ios)\nRow 8: safari (macos x)\n\nSo Konqueror is row index 6.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For VP8 WebM: column \"vp8 ( webm )\" in row 6.\n- For VP9 WebM: column \"vp9 ( webm )\" in row 6.\n\nHence, the relevant_cells list includes both these columns under row 6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Konqueror supports VP8 WebM version 4.4 and does not support VP9 WebM.

Theora must be 2.3.\n2. H264 must be 3.0.\n3. Under these conditions, VP8 (WebM) should be r47759.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a browser and its associated data across different columns including Theora, H264, and VP8 (WebM).\n\nI'll go through each browser row to see if any of them meet both conditions of Theora=2.3 and H264=3.0.\n\nStarting with the first row: Android Browser.\n- Theora is 2.3.\n- H264 is 3.0.\nSo, this meets the first two conditions. Now check VP8 (WebM): it's listed as 2.3. But the claim says it should be r47759. So in this row, VP8 is 2.3, which doesn't match.\n\nNext, Chromium:\n- Theora is r18297.\n- H264 is manual install. Neither is 3.0. So this row doesn't meet both conditions.\n\nGoogle Chrome:\n- Theora is 3.0.\n- H264 is 3.0. Wait, but the claim requires Theora=2.3. So this row doesn't fit because Theora isn't 2.3 here.\n\nInternet Explorer (Windows):\n- Theora is manual install; not 2.3. Skip.\n\nInternet Explorer (Windows Phone) and IE on Windows RT:\n- Theora values don't match 2.3, so skip.\n\nKonqueror:\n- Theora is 4.4, H264 is 4.4. Doesn't meet the conditions.\n\nSafari on iOS and macOS:\n- Theora isn't 2.3 in either case.\n\nSo only the Android Browser row meets both Theora=2.3 and H264=3.0.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim that I need to verify as TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the problem carefully. The table lists different browsers along with their operating systems, latest stable releases, and support for various video codecs like Theora, H264, VP8 (WebM), and VP9 (WebM). Each row represents a specific browser or version combination.\n\nThe claim is: \"the 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 ) be the stable version where the h264 be 9.0 and vp9 (webm) be no\". So, I need to check if in the row corresponding to Android Browser with the latest stable release \"4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012)\", the H264 version is 9.0 and VP9 (WebM) support is 'no'.\n\nLooking at the table, let me find the relevant row. Scanning down, the first row after headers is Android Browser with operating system Android, latest stable release \"4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012)\". Perfect, that's our target row.\n\nNow, checking the H264 and VP9 columns in this row. The H264 column for this row shows '3.0', not '9.0'. And the VP9 (WebM) column shows 'no', which matches the claim.\n\nSo, part of the claim is true (VP9 being no), but another part isn't (H264 is 3.0 instead of 9.0). Since both conditions in the claim need to be satisfied for it to be TRUE, and one of them fails, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nTo structure the response, I'll collect the relevant cells: the row index where Android Browser is listed (which is row_index 0), and the specific columns H264 and VP9 (WebM). This helps in identifying exactly which parts of the table were checked to determine the answer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"h264\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"vp9 ( webm )\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"when vp8 (webm) be 6.0, and the vp9 (webm) be 29.0, the operating system be window.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what's being asked. We're looking for a row where both vp8 is 6.0 and vp9 is 29.0. If such a row exists, we then check if the corresponding operating system is \"window\" (I think they mean Windows here).\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: browser, operating system, latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 (webm), and vp9 (webm). So I need to focus on the vp8 and vp9 columns for each row.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Android Browser**: vp8 is 2.3, vp9 is no. Doesn't match.\n2. **Chromium**: vp8 is r47759 (which isn't a version number like 6.0) and vp9 is r172738. Not matching either.\n3. **Google Chrome**: Here, vp8 is 6.0 and vp9 is 29.0. That matches the first part of the claim. Now, what's the operating system? The row says \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\" under operating system. Wait, that seems odd because usually, the operating system column would specify the OS, not a version number. Maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding in the table.\n\nWait, looking again at the table:\n\nIn the \"operating system\" column for Google Chrome, it says \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\". That seems to be the version of Chrome rather than the OS. So perhaps this is an error in how the table is structured.\n\nAssuming that the operating system might actually be inferred by the browser's typical platforms. Google Chrome runs on multiple OSes like Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. But in the table, it's listed as having \"30.0.1599.101\" under OS, which doesn't specify a particular OS.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again: the row for Google Chrome has under operating system: \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\". That seems like the version of Chrome, not the OS. So perhaps this is a mistake in how the table was built.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe there's no row where both vp8 is 6.0 and vp9 is 29.0 with an operating system being Windows. Because Google Chrome has those versions but its OS isn't specified as Windows here; instead, it's showing a version number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the columns. Let me look at the table headers again:\n\n- The first column is browser.\n- Second is operating system.\n- Third is latest stable release.\n\nSo for Google Chrome, under \"operating system\", it says \"30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)\", which seems incorrect because that's the version number of Chrome, not an OS. The correct operating systems should be like Windows, macOS, etc.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps there is no row where both vp8 is 6.0 and vp9 is 29.0 with the OS being Windows. Therefore, the claim would be false because either the OS isn't specified correctly or such a combination doesn't exist in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks for a browser where vp8 is 6.0 and vp9 is 29.0, expecting the OS to be Windows. Only Google Chrome meets the version conditions, but its OS entry is incorrect (a version number), not \"Windows\". Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vp8  ( webm )\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"vp9  ( webm)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"operating system\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
