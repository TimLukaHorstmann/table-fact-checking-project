The first part says Kristofer was nominated for 3 acting awards. Let's see how many nominations he had in 2012.\n   - Row index 4: FAMAS Awards, category \"german moreno youth achievement award\" with result \"won\". So this is a win, not a nomination.\n   - Wait, the claim says he was nominated for 3 awards. Let's check all 2012 entries.\n     - Row 3 (2012): The Young Critics Circle Awards, category \"best performance\", result \"nominated\".\n     - Row 4: FAMAS Awards, won.\n     - Row 5: 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, won.\n     So in 2012, he was nominated once and won twice. The claim says he was nominated for 3 awards, which isn't accurate because only one nomination exists.\n\n2. The second part mentions winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. From row 4, yes, that's correct\u2014he won this award in 2012.\n\nBut since the first part of the claim is incorrect (he was nominated once, not thrice), the overall claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given claim about Kristofer Martin's awards in 2013 is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully:\n\n\"In 2013, Kristofer Martin receives only an honorable mention for best supporting actor in Oros at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but wins Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at the 10th Golden Screen Award.\"\n\nSo, there are two parts to this claim:\n\n1. In 2013, he received an honorable mention for best supporting actor in Oros at the 16th LIIF Expo.\n2. Also in 2013, he won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Oros at the 10th Golden Screen Awards.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the years listed are 2012 and 2013. Let's focus on 2013 entries first.\n\nFor the first part: In 2013, the award giving body is \"16th Long Island International Film Expo\", category is \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\", nominated for \"oros\", result is \"won\". Wait, but the claim says he received an honorable mention. However, in the table, under 'result' it's marked as 'won'. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The category might just be an honorable mention, so perhaps the result being 'won' refers to receiving the award within that category. Or perhaps the claim is correct because he was awarded (won) the honorable mention in that category.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes \"honorable mention\" isn't a win but a recognition. So maybe the table's 'result' as 'won' might be misleading here. But according to the table, it's marked as 'won', so perhaps the claim is accurate because he did receive (win) the honorable mention award.\n\nNext, for the second part: same year 2013, award body is \"10th golden screen awards\", category \"best actor in a supporting role\", nominated for \"oros\", result \"won\". This matches exactly with the claim that he won Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Golden Screen Awards.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the table. The first part refers to an honorable mention which he 'won', and the second part is a clear win.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in the table for 2013, where Kristofer Martin received both an honorable mention (which was awarded) at the LIIF Expo and won Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Golden Screen Awards.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_2_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_3_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_4_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_5_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_6_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_7_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_8_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"3 of Kristofer Martin's award nominations be for his performance in Oros\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It says that three of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were specifically for his role in the movie titled \"Oros.\" To verify this, I'll examine each row in the table to see if there are entries where he was nominated for roles in \"Oros.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **2013, 1st Sunday All Stars Awards**: The nominee is listed as \"none,\" so Kristofer Martin wasn't nominated here.\n2. **2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo**: Nominated for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" in the movie \"Oros.\" Result: Won.\n3. **2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards**: Nominated for \"best actor in a supporting role\" in \"Oros.\" Result: Won.\n4. **2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards**: Nominated for \"best performance\" in \"Oros.\" Result: Nominated.\n5. **2012, 28th PMPc Star Awards for Movies**: This nomination is for \"new movie actor of the year\" for \"Tween Academy: Class of 2012,\" not related to \"Oros.\"\n6. **2012, FAMAS Awards**: Won an award unrelated to acting in a specific role; it's a youth achievement award.\n7. **2012, 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards**: This is about being the most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching, not related to \"Oros.\"\n\nNow, counting the nominations specifically for \"Oros\":\n\n- 2013: Two wins (Long Island and Golden Screen).\n- 2012: One nomination (Young Critics Circle).\n\nThat's a total of three nominations where Kristofer Martin was recognized for his performance in \"Oros.\" \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from rows 1, 2, and 3, focusing on the \"nominated for\" column each time.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kristofer Martin received three award nominations for his role in \"Oros.\" By examining the table:\n\n- **Row 1**: Nominated for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" in \"Oros.\"\n- **Row 2**: Nominated for \"best actor in a supporting role\" in \"Oros.\"\n- **Row 3**: Nominated for \"best performance\" in \"Oros.\"\n\nThese three instances confirm the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim about Kristofer Martin's award nominations and wins between 2012 and 2013 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"kristofer martin have be nominate for 7 act award between 2012 and 2013 , win 4 of those award.\" It seems there are a few typos here. The correct version should probably be: \"Kristofer Martin has been nominated for 7 acting awards between 2012 and 2013, winning 4 of those awards.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that it lists various awards from different years and categories. My task is to count how many times Kristofer Martin was nominated for acting awards in these two years and how many he won.\n\nStarting with 2013:\n\n1. **Row 0:** The award body is \"1st sunday all stars awards\" in the category \"stand out season performer.\" The nominee is listed as \"none,\" which suggests that Kristofer wasn't nominated here. So, this doesn't count towards his nominations.\n\n2. **Row 1:** \"16th long island international film expo\" for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor\" with the nominee being \"oros.\" Assuming \"oros\" refers to Kristofer Martin, and he won this award. This counts as one nomination and one win.\n\n3. **Row 2:** \"10th golden screen awards\" in \"best actor in a supporting role,\" again nominated for \"oros,\" who I assume is Kristofer. He won here too. So another nomination and another win.\n\nMoving on to 2012:\n\n4. **Row 3:** \"the young critics circle awards\" for \"best performance.\" The nominee is \"oros,\" so Kristofer was nominated but didn't win. That's one more nomination.\n\n5. **Row 4:** \"28th pmpc star awards for movies\" category is \"new movie actor of the year,\" nominee is \"tween academy : class of 2012.\" This doesn't seem to be Kristofer, so I'll skip this row as it doesn't contribute to his nominations.\n\n6. **Row 5:** \"famas awards\" with the award being \"german moreno youth achievement award,\" and the nominee is \"n/a.\" Since the nominee isn't specified as Kristofer, I can disregard this.\n\n7. **Row 6:** \"1st party pilipinas most liked awards\" for \"most liked loveteam with joyce ching,\" nominee is \"n/a.\" Again, not relevant to Kristofer's acting nominations.\n\nSo, from the table:\n\n- Nominations: Rows 1 (2013), 2 (2013), and 3 (2012) \u2192 Total of 3 nominations.\n- Wins: Rows 1 and 2 in 2013 \u2192 Total of 2 wins.\n\nThe claim states he was nominated for 7 awards and won 4. However, according to the table, there are only 3 nominations with 2 wins. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because the numbers don't match up. The relevant cells that support this conclusion are the rows where Kristofer Martin was either nominated or won, which are rows 1, 2, and 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were not based on nomination for a specific show.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row in the table to see which ones involve Kristofer Martin winning awards. Since the table mentions \"nominated for\" as \"none,\" \"oros,\" \"tween academy: class of 2012,\" and \"n/a,\" I think these are related to specific shows or roles.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (2013):** Nominated for \"none.\" The result is \"nominated,\" so he didn't win here. So this isn't a win, but just a nomination without any specific show mentioned.\n  \n- **Row 1 (2013):** Awarded by the 16th Long Island International Film Expo for \"honorable mention for best supporting actor.\" He was nominated for \"oros\" and won. Here, \"oros\" seems to be a specific role or show.\n\n- **Row 2 (2013):** Golden Screen Awards for \"best actor in a supporting role,\" also for \"oros,\" which he won. Again, same as above.\n\n- **Row 3 (2012):** Young Critics Circle Awards for \"best performance.\" He was nominated for \"oros\" and got nominated. Not a win.\n\n- **Row 4 (2012):** PMPC Star Awards for \"new movie actor of the year,\" nominated for \"tween academy: class of 2012\" but didn't win.\n\n- **Row 5 (2012):** FAMAS Awards, he won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award. Here, \"n/a\" is listed under \"nominated for.\" So this award wasn't based on a specific show or role because it's marked as n/a.\n\n- **Row 6 (2012):** Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards for being the most liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching. He won, and it's also marked \"n/a\" under nominated for. So this award wasn't based on a specific show either.\n\nNow, looking at the wins:\n\n- Row 1 (2013): Won for \"oros,\" which is specific.\n- Row 2 (2013): Same as above.\n- Row 5 (2012): Won without being nominated for a specific show (\"n/a\").\n- Row 6 (2012): Also won without a specific nomination.\n\nSo between 2012 and 2013, Kristofer Martin has four wins. Two of them are in rows 5 and 6, where \"nominated for\" is n/a. That means these two awards were not based on nominations for a specific show or role.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"2 of the award wins by Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013 were not based on nomination for a specific show\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about Kristofer Martin's awards in 2013 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully:\n\n\"In 2013, Kristofer Martin received 2 honorable mentions for best supporting actor in 'Oros' at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo, but won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for 'Oros' at the FAMAS Award.\"\n\nWait, actually, looking again, it says he received two honorable mentions? Or maybe I misread. Let me check the claim again:\n\n\"Kristofer Martin receive 2 honorable mention for best support actor in oros...\". Hmm, so the claim is that in 2013, he got two honorable mentions?\n\nBut looking at the table, let's see what happened in 2013.\n\nThe table has multiple rows. Let me go through each row and check for the year 2013 and any mention of Kristofer Martin or 'Oros'.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n\n- Year: 2013\n- Award body: 1st Sunday All Stars Awards\n- Category: Stand out season performer\n- Nominated for: None\n- Result: Nominated\n\nThis doesn't relate to 'Oros' or supporting actor roles, so probably not relevant.\n\nSecond row:\n- Year: 2013\n- Award body: 16th Long Island International Film Expo\n- Category: Honorable mention for best supporting actor\n- Nominated for: Oros\n- Result: Won\n\nSo in this case, he won the honorable mention. The claim says he received two of these. Hmm, but here it's only one.\n\nThird row:\n- Year: 2013\n- Award body: 10th Golden Screen Awards\n- Category: Best actor in a supporting role\n- Nominated for: Oros\n- Result: Won\n\nSo in 2013, he won the Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the Golden Screen Awards for 'Oros'.\n\nNow, looking back at the claim:\n\nHe received two honorable mentions for best supporting actor. But according to the table, he only has one entry from 2013 where he won an honorable mention. So that's just one, not two. That could be a discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions winning Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS Award in 2013. Let me check the table for FAMAS and 2013.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nThe FAMAS Awards entry is in 2012:\n\n- Year: 2012\n- Award body: FAMAS Awards\n- Category: German Moreno Youth Achievement Award\n- Nominated for: n/a\n- Result: Won\n\nSo in 2013, there's no FAMAS award mentioned where he won Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The only relevant awards in 2013 are the Sunday All Stars (nominated), Long Island Film Expo (won honorable mention), and Golden Screen Awards (won best supporting actor).\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says he won at FAMAS Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. But according to the table, that didn't happen in 2013\u2014it happened in 2012 under a different category.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\n- The claim states two honorable mentions in 2013: but only one is present.\n- It also claims he won Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS in 2013, but the table shows that happened in 2012 under a different category.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect. He didn't receive two honorable mentions; he received one. And he didn't win Best Actor in a Supporting Role at FAMAS in 2013\u2014he won a different award in 2012 and another supporting role award in 2013 elsewhere.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me clarify: In the table, for 2013, he won the Golden Screen Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. So that part is correct if it's about Golden Screen, but the claim says FAMAS. Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes the win to FAMAS instead of Golden Screen.\n\nSo both issues make the claim incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award giving body\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about Kristofer Martin's award nominations and wins between 2012 and 2013 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly: \"kristofer martin have be nominate for 7 best actor award between 2012 and 2013, win 4 of those award.\" So, there are two main points here:\n\n1. Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 Best Actor awards.\n2. He won 4 out of those 7 awards.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents an award nomination or win. The relevant columns are \"year,\" \"award giving body,\" \"category,\" \"nominated for,\" and \"result.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to see which ones pertain to Kristofer Martin's Best Actor nominations and whether he won them.\n\nRow 0: 2013, 1st Sunday All Stars Awards, Stand Out Season Performer, none, nominated. \n- The category here isn't \"Best Actor,\" so this doesn't count towards the claim. \n\nRow 1: 2013, 16th Long Island International Film Expo, Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor, Oros, won.\n- This is a supporting actor award, not Best Actor, so it's irrelevant.\n\nRow 2: 2013, 10th Golden Screen Awards, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Oros, won.\n- Again, this is for a supporting role, not Best Actor. So, doesn't count.\n\nRow 3: 2012, The Young Critics Circle Awards, Best Performance, Oros, nominated.\n- \"Best Performance\" might be interpreted as Best Actor. This could be one nomination.\n\nRow 4: 2012, 28th PMPc Star Awards for Movies, New Movie Actor of the Year, Tween Academy : Class of 2012, nominated.\n- The category is about being a new actor, not specifically Best Actor. So, this might not count as a Best Actor nomination.\n\nRow 5: 2012, FAMAS Awards, German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, n/a, won.\n- This isn't related to acting in a leading role; it's a youth achievement award.\n\nRow 6: 2012, 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching, n/a, won.\n- This is about being liked as a team member, not an acting award.\n\nNow, let's count how many times Kristofer Martin was nominated for Best Actor:\n\nLooking at the categories:\n- Only Row 3 (2012) has a category that could be considered Best Actor. Rows 1 and 2 are supporting roles, which don't fit the claim about Best Actor awards.\n\nSo, there's only one nomination in the table under the category of \"Best Performance\" for 2012. This doesn't meet the claim of 7 nominations.\n\nRegarding wins: Even if we consider other categories as potential Best Actor wins, the closest is Row 3, which was a nomination but not a win. Rows 1 and 2 are supporting roles and wouldn't count towards Best Actor wins either.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 7 Best Actor awards and won 4 isn't supported by the table. The information provided in the table doesn't align with the numbers stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is about whether all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in \"Oros.\" I need to check the provided table to see if every nomination he received was indeed for that role.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and look at the 'nominated for' column. \n\nLooking at 2013 entries:\n- The first award is from the 1st Sunday All Stars Awards in the category \"stand out season performer.\" Here, it's noted as \"none,\" which suggests that Kristofer wasn't nominated for a specific role but maybe just recognized overall. This might not be related to \"Oros.\"\n  \nMoving on to the next two rows for 2013:\n- Both are from other award bodies and list him as being nominated for \"oros.\" So these definitely support the claim.\n\nNow, checking the 2012 entries:\n- The Young Critics Circle Awards nomination is again for \"oros,\" so that's in line with the claim.\n- The next one is the PMPc Star Awards, where he was nominated as \"new movie actor of the year\" for \"tween academy : class of 2012.\" This seems like a different role or project, not related to \"Oros.\"\n  \nThe last two awards in 2012:\n- The FAMAS award is for a youth achievement and mentions \"n/a,\" which could mean it's unrelated.\n- The Party Pilipinas award is about being the most liked loveteam with someone else, again likely not related to \"Oros.\"\n\nSo, some nominations are indeed for \"Oros,\" but others aren't. This means the claim that all nominations were for \"Oros\" isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in \"Oros.\" Upon reviewing each row in the table, it's clear that some nominations are for different roles or projects. Therefore, the claim is not entirely accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "all of the award win by kristofer martin between 2012 and 2013 be base on nomination for a specific show",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"all of the award win by kristofer martin between 2012 and 2013 be base on nomination for a specific show.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It says that every award Kristofer Martin won in those years was based on a nomination tied to a specific show. So, I need to check each award he won between 2012 and 2013 to see if there's a corresponding \"nominated for\" entry.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 2013, 1st sunday all stars awards, stand out season performer. The nominated for column says \"none,\" but the result is \"nominated.\" So he was nominated here but didn't win. Since the claim is about wins, this one doesn't count.\n\nRow 1: 2013, 16th long island international film expo, honorable mention for best supporting actor. Nominated for \"oros\" and won. Here, there's a specific nomination (\"oros\"), so that fits the claim.\n\nRow 2: 2013, 10th golden screen awards, best actor in a supporting role. Also nominated for \"oros\" and won. Again, a specific show.\n\nRow 3: 2012, the young critics circle awards, best performance. Nominated for \"oros,\" but result is \"nominated.\" Since he didn't win here, it doesn't affect the claim.\n\nRow 4: 2012, 28th pmpc star awards for movies, new movie actor of the year. The nominated for column says \"tween academy : class of 2012\" and result is \"nominated.\" Not a win, so irrelevant.\n\nRow 5: 2012, famas awards, german moreno youth achievement award. Nominated for \"n/a,\" but he won it. The problem here is that the nominated for is \"n/a,\" which probably means there wasn't a specific show nomination. So this contradicts the claim because one of his wins wasn't based on a specific show.\n\nRow 6: 2012, 1st party pilipinas most liked awards, most liked loveteam with joyce ching. Nominated for \"n/a,\" and he won. Again, no specific show mentioned in the nominated for column, so this also contradicts the claim.\n\nSo, Kristofer Martin has multiple wins: rows 1,2,5,6. Among these, rows 5 and 6 have \"n/a\" as the nominated for, meaning their awards weren't based on a specific show nomination. Therefore, not all of his awards between 2012-2013 were based on nominations for specific shows. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to note the relevant cells. For each win (rows where result is 'won'), we check the 'nominated for' column. Rows 1 and 2 have valid nominated for entries, but rows 5 and 6 do not. So, the relevant cells are row indices 1-4,5-7 in columns year, award giving body, category, and nominated for.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the claim is about all the awards he WON being based on a nomination. So I should focus only on rows where result is 'won'. Let me adjust:\n\nWon rows are:\nRow 1: won\nRow 2: won\nRow5: won\nRow6: won\n\nSo checking these four rows. For each, check if 'nominated for' column has a specific show.\n\nRow1: \"oros\" \u2013 yes.\nRow2: \"oros\" \u2013 yes.\nRow5: \"n/a\" \u2013 no.\nRow6: \"n/a\" \u2013 no.\n\nSince two of the four wins have 'n/a', the claim is false. Therefore, the answer is FALSE. The relevant cells are all the rows where he won and the columns related to that (award giving body, category, nominated for, result). But according to the instructions, I need to list each cell used in verifying the claim.\n\nSo, I'll include for each row where he won:\n- Year\n- Award giving body\n- Category\n- Nominated for\n- Result\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, since we're looking at each win and checking if nominated_for is specific. So the relevant cells are rows 1,2,5,6 in columns 'nominated for' to see if they have a value or not.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells will include row indices 1,2,5,6 under 'nominated for'.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"nominated for\"}\n   ]\n}",
