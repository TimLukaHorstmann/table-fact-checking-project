    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"timo boll won the ittf pro tour men single 3 times between 1997 and 2012\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are year location, mens singles, womens singles, mens doubles, and womens doubles. Each row represents a specific year's event in a particular location, along with the winners of each category.\n\nThe claim is about Timo Boll winning men's singles three times between 1997 and 2012. So I need to check how many times Timo Boll appears as the winner in the \"mens singles\" column within that time frame.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- 2012 Kobe: Jun Mizutani\n- 2011 Kobe: Seiya Kishikawa\n- 2010 Kobe: Timo Boll (this counts)\n- 2009 Wakayama: Oh Sang-eun\n- 2008 Yokohama: Ma Lin\n- 2007 Chiba: Wang Hao\n- 2006 Yokohama: Wang Liqin\n- 2005 Yokohama: Timo Boll (this counts)\n- 2004 Kobe: Chen Qi\n- 2003 Kobe: Timo Boll (this counts)\n- 2002 Kobe: Kalinikos Kreanga\n- 2001 Yokohama: Chiang Peng-lung\n- 2000 Kobe: Wang Liqin\n- 1999 Kobe: Vladimir Samsonov\n- 1998 Wakayama: Kong Linghui\n- 1997 Chiba: Jan-Ove Waldner\n\nSo Timo Boll is listed as the winner in three different years: 2010, 2005, and 2003. That's three times within the specified period of 1997 to 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows Timo Boll winning men's singles in 2010, 2005, and 2003, which are three wins between 1997 and 2012. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the ittf pro tour be host in yokohama 4 time between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Yokohama four times between the years 1997 and 2012. So, I'm looking for entries in the table where the location is Yokohama within those years.\n\nLooking at the table structure: The first column is \"year location\", which combines both the year and the host city. Each row represents a different year from 1997 to 2012. My goal is to count how many times Yokohama appears as the location in this range.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 0 (2012 Kobe)**: Location is Kobe, not Yokohama.\n- **Row 1 (2011 Kobe)**: Same as above.\n- **Row 2 (2010 Kobe)**: Again, Kobe.\n- **Row 3 (2009 Wakayama)**: Not relevant.\n- **Row 4 (2008 Yokohama)**: This is a hit. So count = 1.\n- **Row 5 (2007 Chiba)**: Not relevant.\n- **Row 6 (2006 Yokohama)**: Another hit. Count increases to 2.\n- **Row 7 (2005 Yokohama)**: Third hit. Now count is 3.\n- **Row 8 (2004 Kobe)**: Back to Kobe.\n- **Row 9 (2003 Kobe)**: Same as above.\n- **Row 10 (2002 Kobe)**: Still Kobe.\n- **Row 11 (2001 Yokohama)**: Fourth hit. Count reaches 4.\n- **Rows 12 to end (years 2000 and below)**: These are outside the range specified in the claim, so I can stop here.\n\nSo within the years 1997 to 2012, Yokohama hosted the event four times. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 4 (2008): \"year location\" is Yokohama.\n- Row 6 (2006): Same.\n- Row 7 (2005): Same.\n- Row 11 (2001): Same.\n\nEach of these rows has the \"year location\" column indicating Yokohama. Therefore, the relevant cells are in columns \"year location\" for rows 4, 6, 7, and 11.\n\nBefore finalizing, I'll double-check that there are no other instances between 1997 and 2012. Scanning through again confirms only these four entries. So yes, the claim holds.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"year location\"}, {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"year location\"}, {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"year location\"}, {\"row_index\":11, \"column_name\":\"year location\"}]}",

The claim is: \"wang nan be the only female to win 3 year in a row in womens single at the ittf pro tour.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It states that Wang Nan was the only woman to win three consecutive years in the women's singles category of the ITTF Pro Tour.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check the \"womens singles\" column and see if there are any instances where a female player won for three consecutive years. \n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to look for Wang Nan's name in the \"womens singles\" column. From what I can see:\n\n- 2001: Wang Nan\n- 2000: Wang Nan\n- 1999: Wang Nan\n\nWait, that seems like three consecutive years\u20141999, 2000, and 2001\u2014all with Wang Nan as the winner. So that's three in a row.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other players who achieved this. Let me go through each year:\n\n- 2012: Shen Yanfei\n- 2011: Feng Tianwei\n- 2010: Wang Yuegu\n- 2009: Park Mi Young\n- 2008: Zhang Yining (China, but as a team? Wait, no\u2014actually, in the table, under \"womens singles,\" it's listed as China for 2008. That might be a typo because individual players are usually named, so perhaps that refers to someone from China like Zhang Yining or Guo Yue.\n- 2007: Wang Nan\n- 2006: Wang Yuegu\n- 2005: Zhang Yining\n- 2004: Zhang Yining\n- 2003: Guo Yue\n- 2002: Kim Kyung Ah\n- 1998: Li Ju\n- 1997: Wang Chen\n\nLooking at these, the only instance of three consecutive wins is Wang Nan in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Other players like Zhang Yining won multiple times but not three in a row. For example, Zhang Yining won in 2005 and 2004, which are two consecutive years, but not three.\n\nSo based on the table, Wang Nan is indeed the only female to win three years in a row in women's singles.

So, I need to check how many times each location was a host during those years.\n\nLooking at the table, the first column is \"year location\". Each row lists a year and the corresponding location.

Let's see:\n\nLooking at Yokohama:\n- 2001, 2005, 2006, 2008 \u2192 four times.\nChiba: 1997 and 2007? No, 1997 was chiba, 2007 was chiba as well.

The claim states: \"the ittf pro tour be host in kobe 4 time between 1997 and 2012.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. The claim is about the ITTF Pro Tour being hosted in Kobe four times within a specific timeframe from 1997 to 2012. My task is to check the table provided and see if that's accurate.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and location where the event was held. The columns include \"year location,\" which seems to combine both the year and the city. So, for each entry in this column, I can extract the year and the location.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table one by one:\n\n1. 2012 Kobe: That's within the timeframe.\n2. 2011 Kobe: Also within.\n3. 2010 Kobe: Yes.\n4. 2009 Wakayama: Not Kobe, so I can skip this.\n5. 2008 Yokohama: Not Kobe.\n6. 2007 Chiba: No.\n7. 2006 Yokohama: No.\n8. 2005 Yokohama: No.\n9. 2004 Kobe: Yes, this is within the timeframe (1997-2012).\n10. 2003 Kobe: Also within.\n11. 2002 Kobe: Yes.\n12. 2001 Yokohama: No.\n13. 2000 Kobe: That's within the timeframe.\n14. 1999 Kobe: Within.\n15. 1998 Wakayama: Not Kobe.\n16. 1997 Chiba: No.\n\nNow, let me count how many times Kobe appears between 1997 and 2012:\n\n- 2012: Yes\n- 2011: Yes\n- 2010: Yes\n- 2004: Yes\n- 2003: Yes\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2000: Yes\n- 1999: Yes\n\nWait, that's more than four times. But wait, let me check again because the claim is specifically between 1997 and 2012. So from 1997 to 2012 inclusive.\n\nLooking back:\n\nKobe hosts in:\n- 1999\n- 2000\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2004\n- 2010\n- 2011\n- 2012\n\nSo that's eight times, not four. Wait, but wait the table shows Kobe in:\n\nRows:\nRow 0: 2012 Kobe\nRow 1: 2011 Kobe\nRow 2: 2010 Kobe\nRow 3: 2009 Wakayama (no)\nRow 4: 2008 Yokohama (no)\nRow 5: 2007 Chiba (no)\nRow 6: 2006 Yokohama (no)\nRow 7: 2005 Yokohama (no)\nRow 8: 2004 Kobe\nRow 9: 2003 Kobe\nRow 10: 2002 Kobe\nRow 11: 2001 Yokohama (no)\nRow 12: 2000 Kobe\nRow 13: 1999 Kobe\nRow 14: 1998 Wakayama (no)\nRow 15: 1997 Chiba (no)\n\nSo counting the rows where location is Kobe:\n\nRows 0,1,2,8,9,10,12,13. That's 8 times.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"4 times.\" So clearly, it was hosted more than four times in that period. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because it was actually eight times, not four.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row from 1997 to 2012:\n\n- 2012: Kobe (Row 0)\n- 2011: Kobe (Row 1)\n- 2010: Kobe (Row 2)\n- 2004: Kobe (Row 8)\n- 2003: Kobe (Row 9)\n- 2002: Kobe (Row 10)\n- 2000: Kobe (Row 12)\n- 1999: Kobe (Row 13)\n\nYes, that's eight times. Therefore, the claim of four times is incorrect.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because it was hosted in Kobe more than four times between 1997 and 2012.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is **FALSE**. The ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe eight times between 1997 and 2012, not four times.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Claim:** The ITTF Pro Tour was hosted in Kobe four times between 1997 and 2012.\n2. **Examine the Table:** Review each row to find entries where the location is Kobe within the specified years.\n3. **Count Occurrences:**\n   - 2012 Kobe\n   - 2011 Kobe\n   - 2010 Kobe\n   - 2004 Kobe\n   - 2003 Kobe\n   - 2002 Kobe\n   - 2000 Kobe\n   - 1999 Kobe\n4. **Total Count:** There are eight instances where the event was hosted in Kobe.\n5. **Conclusion:** Since there are eight occurrences, not four, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is FALSE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"zhang yining be the only female to win 3 year in a row in womens single at the ittf pro tour\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that Zhang Yining is the only woman who has won three consecutive years in the women's singles category of the ITTF Pro Tour. So, my goal is to check if this is accurate by examining the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: year location, mens singles, womens singles, mens doubles, womens doubles.\n- Each row represents a different year and location, with corresponding champions in each category.\n\nI need to focus on the \"womens singles\" column to see who won each year. Let's list out the winners from 2012 going back:\n\n- 2012 Kobe: Shen Yanfei\n- 2011 Kobe: Feng Tianwei\n- 2010 Kobe: Wang Yuegu\n- 2009 Wakayama: Park Mi-young\n- 2008 Yokohama: Zhang Yining\n- 2007 Chiba: Wang Nan\n- 2006 Yokohama: Wang Yuegu\n- 2005 Yokohama: Zhang Yining\n- 2004 Kobe: Zhang Yining\n- 2003 Kobe: Guo Yue\n- 2002 Kobe: Kim Kyung-ah\n- 2001 Yokohama: Wang Nan\n- 2000 Kobe: Wang Nan\n- 1999 Kobe: Wang Nan\n- 1998 Wakayama: Li Ju\n- 1997 Chiba: Wang Chen\n\nFrom this list, I notice that Zhang Yining won in 2005, 2004, and 2003. That's three consecutive years (2003, 2004, 2005). Are there any other female players who have achieved this?\n\nLooking further:\n\n- Wang Yuegu won in 2010 and 2006, but not consecutively.\n- Wang Nan has multiple wins but not three in a row. Her consecutive wins seem to be spread out with gaps.\n- Other winners like Shen Yanfei, Feng Tianwei, Park Mi-young, Guo Yue, Kim Kyung-ah, Li Ju, and Wang Chen don't have three consecutive wins either.\n\nSo Zhang Yining is indeed the only female player who won three consecutive years in women's singles. \n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. The rows corresponding to 2003, 2004, and 2005 under the \"womens singles\" column are crucial because they show Zhang Yining winning each of those years.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are from these three rows in the womens singles column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"womens singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kobe host the most ittf pro tour in between 2004 and 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Kobe hosted the majority of ITTF Pro Tours between the years 2004 and 2009. So, I need to check how many times Kobe was the location for these events within that time frame and compare it with other locations during those same years.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year and location. The \"year location\" column has entries like \"2012 kobe\", indicating both the year and the host city. My task is to focus on the rows where the year falls between 2004 and 2009 inclusive.\n\nLet me list out all the years from 2004 to 2009 and note their corresponding locations:\n\n- 2004: kobe\n- 2005: yokohama\n- 2006: yokohama\n- 2007: chiba\n- 2008: yokohama\n- 2009: wakayama\n\nWait, the table starts from 1997, so I'll go through each year between 2004 and 2009.\n\nLooking at the \"year location\" column:\n\n- 2004 kobe (row index 11)\n- 2005 yokohama (row 12? Wait, no. Let me check: from the table given, the years go from 1997 to 2012. So I need to find all rows where year is between 2004 and 2009.\n\nLet me count each occurrence:\n\n- 2004 kobe\n- 2005 yokohama\n- 2006 yokohama\n- 2007 chiba\n- 2008 yokohama\n- 2009 wakayama\n\nWait, that's from the years in the table. So between 2004 and 2009 inclusive, how many times was Kobe the host?\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n- 2004: kobe (1)\n- 2005: yokohama\n- 2006: yokohama\n- 2007: chiba\n- 2008: yokohama\n- 2009: wakayama\n\nSo Kobe hosted only once in that period, which is 2004. Meanwhile, Yokohama hosted three times (2005, 2006, 2008), Chiba once (2007), and Wakayama once (2009). So the most hosts are actually Yokohama with three events.\n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Let me check each row's year:\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row indices 11: 2004 kobe\n- 12: 2005 yokohama\n- 13: 2006 yokohama\n- 14: 2007 chiba\n- 15: 2008 yokohama\n- 16: 2009 wakayama\n\nYes, so from 2004 to 2009, there are six entries. Kobe only in 2004. So Kobe hosted once, Yokohama three times, Chiba once, Wakayama once.\n\nThus, the claim that Kobe hosted the most is false because Yokohama hosted more during those years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because between 2004 and 2009, Kobe only hosted the event once, while Yokohama hosted it three times. The relevant cells are the entries for each year from 2004 to 2009 under the \"year location\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"year location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"year location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 ITTF Pro Tour events were hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The table has columns: year location, mens singles, womens singles, mens doubles, and womens doubles. Each row represents an event with its corresponding details.\n\nThe claim mentions two ITTF Pro Tour events hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. So, I need to check how many times Yokohama appears in the \"year location\" column within that time frame.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Starting from 2012 going back:\n  - 2012 Kobe: Not Yokohama.\n  - 2011 Kobe: Not Yokohama.\n  - 2010 Kobe: Not Yokohama.\n  - 2009 Wakayama: Not Yokohama.\n  - 2008 Yokohama: This is one occurrence.\n  - 2007 Chiba: Not Yokohama.\n  - 2006 Yokohama: Another occurrence, so that's two.\n  - 2005 Yokohama: Wait, but the claim is between 1997 and 2012. So 2005 is within that range as well? But wait, the table shows up to 1997 in row index 16 (assuming rows are numbered starting at 0). Let me recount:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the years. The rows go from 2012 down to 1997. So let's list all the \"year location\" entries between 1997 and 2012.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: 2012 Kobe\nRow 1: 2011 Kobe\nRow 2: 2010 Kobe\nRow 3: 2009 Wakayama\nRow 4: 2008 Yokohama \u2192 This is one.\nRow 5: 2007 Chiba\nRow 6: 2006 Yokohama \u2192 Second occurrence.\nRow 7: 2005 Yokohama \u2192 Wait, but 2005 is within 1997-2012. So that's a third event at Yokohama. But the claim says two events.\n\nWait, no\u2014the years in the table are from 2012 down to 1997. Let me list all the locations and their years:\n\nLooking through each row's \"year location\":\n\nRow 0: 2012 Kobe\nRow 1: 2011 Kobe\nRow 2: 2010 Kobe\nRow 3: 2009 Wakayama\nRow 4: 2008 Yokohama \u2192 1st event\nRow 5: 2007 Chiba\nRow 6: 2006 Yokohama \u2192 2nd event\nRow 7: 2005 Yokohama \u2192 3rd event (but 2005 is within the range)\nWait, but the claim says \"between 1997 and 2012\". So does that include 1997 and 2012? The wording is a bit ambiguous. If it's inclusive, then events from 1997 to 2012 are considered.\n\nLooking at rows beyond row 6:\n\nRow 8: 2004 Kobe\nRow 9: 2003 Kobe\nRow 10: 2002 Kobe\nRow 11: 2001 Yokohama \u2192 This is another event in 2001, which is within the range. So that's a third occurrence.\n\nWait, so there are more than two events at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. Let me count them:\n\n- 2008: Yokohama (Row 4)\n- 2006: Yokohama (Row 6)\n- 2005: Yokohama (Row 7)\n- 2001: Yokohama (Row 11)\n\nWait, that's four events. But perhaps I made a mistake because the table may not have all years listed. Let me check each row:\n\nRows with year location as Yokohama:\n\nRow 4: 2008 Yokohama\nRow 6: 2006 Yokohama\nRow 7: 2005 Yokohama\nRow 11: 2001 Yokohama\n\nWait, but the claim says \"between 1997 and 2012\". So 2008, 2006, 2005, and 2001 are all within that period. That's four events, not two.\n\nBut maybe I misread the table\u2014perhaps each row represents a different event, but perhaps some rows have multiple events in the same location and year? No, each row is one event with its details.\n\nWait, no, looking back, each row is for a specific year and location. So if \"year location\" is 2008 Yokohama, that's one event. Similarly for others.\n\nSo that would mean there are four events at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012, which contradicts the claim of two events. But let me check again because maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't have all years; it's only showing certain events. Let me list each row with year location:\n\nRow 0: 2012 Kobe\nRow 1: 2011 Kobe\nRow 2: 2010 Kobe\nRow 3: 2009 Wakayama\nRow 4: 2008 Yokohama\nRow 5: 2007 Chiba\nRow 6: 2006 Yokohama\nRow 7: 2005 Yokohama\nRow 8: 2004 Kobe\nRow 9: 2003 Kobe\nRow 10: 2002 Kobe\nRow 11: 2001 Yokohama\nRow 12: 2000 Chiba (Wait, the table might not go down to 2000. Let me check how many rows there are.\n\nThe user provided a table with rows from 2012 down to 1997. So let's see:\n\nAssuming rows go up to row 16 or so, but perhaps the key is that in the years between 1997 and 2012, how many times does Yokohama appear.\n\nFrom the table, I can see:\n\n- 2008: Yokohama\n- 2006: Yokohama\n- 2005: Yokohama\n- 2001: Yokohama\n\nThat's four events. So if the claim is that two were hosted there, it would be FALSE because there are more than two.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Each row represents a single event with its location and year. So each occurrence of \"Yokohama\" in the \"year location\" column counts as one event.\n\nTherefore, if between 1997 and 2012 (inclusive), there are four events at Yokohama, then the claim is incorrect because it states two events were hosted there.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\nLooking through each row's year:\n\n- Row 4: 2008 Yokohama\n- Row 6: 2006 Yokohama\n- Row 7: 2005 Yokohama\n- Row 11: 2001 Yokohama\n\nThat's four events. So the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps the table doesn't include all years, and maybe between 1997 and 2012, only two were in Yokohama. But based on the provided data, there are four events listed as being in Yokohama within that period.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two ITTF Pro Tour events were hosted at Yokohama between 1997 and 2012. Upon examining the table, we find that Yokohama hosted events in 2008, 2006, 2005, and 2001\u2014all within the specified timeframe. This results in four events rather than two.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE",
