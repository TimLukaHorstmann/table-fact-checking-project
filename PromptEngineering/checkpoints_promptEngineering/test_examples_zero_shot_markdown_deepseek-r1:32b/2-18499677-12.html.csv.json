Since the table shows his 2008 club as \"budu\u0107nost podgorica\", he was indeed not part of \"m roma volley\" during that year.\n\nSo, the relevant cell to verify this claim is the \"2008 club\" entry for sa\u0161a starovi\u0107 in row index 9.

So that's one instance where RPA Perugia has a player, but not Dejan Bojovi\u0107.\n\nNext, the second row is Dejan Bojovi\u0107, and his 2008 club is gabeca montichiari.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"2 of the people on the female team roster come from the podgorica club of budu\u0107nost\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. Looking at the columns: name, height, weight, spike, and 2008 club. The claim mentions a \"female team roster,\" so my first thought is to check if there are any female names listed in the table. However, all the names provided\u2014nikola kova\u010devi\u0107, dejan bojovi\u0107, novica bjelica, etc.\u2014appear to be male names based on common naming conventions.\n\nNext, I'll focus on the claim about two people coming from the podgorica club of budu\u0107nost.

Two of them (vlado petkovi\u0107 and sa\u0161a starovi\u0107) are from budu\u0107nost podgorica, but since there are no female entries, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the club of 2008, rpa perugia, have as a player bojovi\u0107\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions that in the year 2008, the club \"rpa perugia\" had a player named \"bojovi\u0107.\" So, my goal is to check if there's any row in the table where both the '2008 club' column has \"rpa perugia\" and the 'name' column includes someone with the last name \"bojovi\u0107.\"\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: name, height, weight, spike, 2008 club. So, I need to focus on these two columns for each row.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Name is nikola kova\u010devi\u0107. Club is rpa perugia. The last name here is \"kovacevic,\" not \"bojovi\u0107.\" So, this doesn't match.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Name is dejan bojovi\u0107. Club is gabeca montichiari. Here, the last name is \"bojovi\u0107,\" but the club isn't rpa perugia. This doesn't fit the claim either.\n\n3. **Row 2 to Row 11**: Names are novica bjelica, bojan jani\u0107, vlado petkovi\u0107, marko samard\u017ei\u0107, nikola grbi\u0107, milo\u0161 niki\u0107, andrija geri\u0107, ivan miljkovi\u0107, sa\u0161a starovi\u0107, marko podra\u0161\u010danin. None of these have the last name \"bojovi\u0107.\"\n\nWait a minute, I just noticed that in row 1, the name is dejan bojovi\u0107, but his club isn't rpa perugia. So, the claim says that rpa perugia has bojovi\u0107 as a player, but according to this table, dejan bojovi\u0107 plays for gabeca montichiari.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where both the '2008 club' is rpa perugia and the name includes \"bojovi\u0107.\" So, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.

It's stating that out of 12 players, only one isn't part of the 2008 club called \"tour\" or something related to volleyball (vb). So, I should look at each player's \"2008 club\" column and see how many are in a club named \"tours vb\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Nikola Kova\u010devi\u0107: Club is rpa perugia.\n2. Dejan Bojovi\u0107: gabeca montichiari.\n3. Novica Bjelica: copra nordmeccanica.\n4. Bojan Jani\u0107: marmi lanza verona.\n5. Vlado Petkovi\u0107: budu\u0107nost podgorica.\n6. Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107: tours vb.\n7. Nikola Grbi\u0107: trentino volley.\n8. Milo\u0161 Niki\u0107: sparkling milano.\n9. Andrija Geri\u0107: lube banca marche.\n10.

Therefore, only one out of twelve is in that specific club, which aligns with the claim. All others are not part of \"tour's 2008 club\", so the statement holds true.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells for each row where the club is checked. So for each player (rows 0-11), the \"2008 club\" column is examined, and only row 6 has \"tours vb\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts that only one of the twelve players is in the \"tour's 2008 club\". Upon reviewing each entry in the table, only Marko Samard\u017ei\u0107 from row 6 is associated with \"tours vb\". All other players are part of different clubs. Thus, the claim is accurate.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:** Each player's \"2008 club\" entry to verify their association.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"2008 club\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
