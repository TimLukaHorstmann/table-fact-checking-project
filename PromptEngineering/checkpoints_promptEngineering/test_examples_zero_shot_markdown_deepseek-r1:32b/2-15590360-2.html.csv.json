    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be 0 pole in the moto2 class\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the table structure and the data it contains.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different motorcycle racing class with various statistics across the columns: season, race count, podiums, and poles. The classes listed are 125 cc, 250 cc, motogp, moto2, and total.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"moto2\" and refers to having zero poles. So I'll focus on the row corresponding to the moto2 class. In that row, under the \"pole\" column, the value is 0. That directly supports the claim that there are no poles in the moto2 class.\n\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity or other data that might affect this conclusion. For instance, looking at the \"season\" for moto2 shows it's listed as \"2010 -\", which I assume means from 2010 onwards. The race count is 62, and podiums are 4. None of these seem to contradict the pole value.\n\nAdditionally, checking other rows just to make sure there isn't conflicting information: all classes except motogp have some poles (though most have zero), but since we're only concerned with moto2, the relevant data is clear.\n\nTherefore, the claim that there are 0 poles in the moto2 class is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are zero poles in the moto2 class. According to the table, under the \"pole\" column for the moto2 row, the value is indeed 0. This directly confirms the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"4 pole have a moto2 class\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: It has columns for class, season, race, podiums, and pole. The rows list different motorcycle racing classes with their respective stats over various seasons.\n\nThe claim mentions \"4 pole have a moto2 class.\" I think this means that in the Moto2 class, there are 4 poles. Alternatively, it could mean that the Moto2 class has achieved 4 pole positions across its races. So, I need to check the Moto2 row for the number of poles.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows are:\n  1. 125 cc\n  2. 250 cc\n  3. motogp\n  4. moto2\n  5. total\n\nSo, the Moto2 class is in row index 4 (assuming counting starts from 0: 0-125cc, 1-250cc, 2-motogp, 3-moto2, but wait, no\u2014the table has five rows including 'total'. So rows are 0 to 4. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices:\n0: 125 cc\n1: 250 cc\n2: motogp\n3: moto2\n4: total\n\nWait, the claim is about Moto2 class, so row index 3.\n\nNow, looking at column names: 'pole' is one of them. So I need to check the 'pole' value for Moto2.\n\nIn row 3 (Moto2), the pole column has a value of 0. That means 0 poles.\n\nThe claim states there are 4 poles in Moto2 class, but according to the table, it's 0. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might contribute or be misinterpreted. The 'total' row (row 4) has pole=0 as well. So overall, no poles across all classes, including Moto2.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n- Row 3 (Moto2) and column 'pole'.\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are 4 poles in the Moto2 class. Checking the table, under the Moto2 row and pole column, the value is 0. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n1. Identify the relevant rows and columns for \"moto2\" and \"pole.\"\n2. The Moto2 class is in row index 3.\n3. The 'pole' column for this row shows 0.\n4. Since 0 \u2260 4, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pole\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
