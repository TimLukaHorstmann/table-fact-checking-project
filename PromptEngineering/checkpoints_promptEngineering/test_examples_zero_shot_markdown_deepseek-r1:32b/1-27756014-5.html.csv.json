    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"during the 2010-11 milwaukee buck season, brandon jennings be the leader for high assist in 8 game.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that Brandon Jennings led the team in assists in 8 games during that season.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I see there's a column named \"high assists,\" which likely indicates who had the most assists in each game. So for each row (game), I'll check if Brandon Jennings is listed under \"high assists.\"\n\nLet me go through each game:\n\n1. Game 4: high assists - Brandon Jennings (7). So that's one.\n2. Game 5: Carlos Delfino. Not Jennings.\n3. Game 6: John Salmons. No.\n4. Game 7: Brandon Jennings again (5). Second time.\n5. Game 8: Jennings with 6. Third.\n6. Game 9: Earl Boykins. No.\n7. Game 10: Jennings with 6. Fourth.\n8. Game 11: Jennings and John Salmons both have 6. So Jennings shares this game, but that still counts as a lead? Or does it count only when he's the sole leader?\n9. Game 12: Earl Boykins, Brandon Jennnings, John Salmons each have 4. So multiple leaders here; does that mean Jennings didn't solely lead? Maybe the claim is about leading in assists regardless of others.\n10. Game 13: Jennings with 3. Fifth time.\n11. Game 14: Keyon Dooling. No.\n12. Game 15: Jennings again with 6. Sixth.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nGame 4: Jennings (yes)\nGame 7: Jennings\nGame 8: Jennings\nGame 10: Jennings\nGame 11: Jennings shares, but perhaps counts as a lead if he is one of them.\nGame 13: Jennings\nGame 15: Jennings\n\nSo that's games 4,7,8,10,11,13,15 \u2013 that's seven games where he was either the sole or shared leader. Game 11 might count as a tie, but depending on interpretation.\n\nWait, let me recount accurately:\n\nLooking at each game:\n\n- Game 4: Jennings leads with 7\n- Game 5: Carlos Delfino (no)\n- Game 6: John Salmons (no)\n- Game 7: Jennings (yes) \u2013 total 2\n- Game 8: Jennings (3)\n- Game 9: Earl Boykins (no)\n- Game 10: Jennings (4)\n- Game 11: Jennings and Salmons (5, but tied. So maybe counts as a lead or not? If it's about being the sole leader, then no; if it's about being one of the leaders, yes.\n- Game 12: multiple leaders including Jennings (6 if counting ties)\n- Game 13: Jennings (7)\n- Game 14: Keyon Dooling (no)\n- Game 15: Jennings (8)\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me list each game where Jennings is in the high assists:\n\nGame 4: yes\nGame 7: yes\nGame 8: yes\nGame 10: yes\nGame 11: yes (tied)\nGame 12: yes (tied)\nGame 13: yes\nGame 15: yes\n\nThat's 8 games where he was either the sole leader or tied. The claim says \"leader for high assist in 8 game,\" which I think refers to being one of the leaders, not necessarily sole.\n\nTherefore, Brandon Jennings led (either alone or tied) in 8 games as per the table. So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brandon Jennings was the leader in assists for 8 games during the season. By examining each game's \"high assists\" column, Jennings appears in 8 instances where he either solely led or was tied. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 6 game play at bradley center during the milwaukee buck 2010 - 11 season.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. It's stating that there were six games played at the Bradley Center by the Milwaukee Bucks in their 2010-11 season.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a column named \"location attendance.\" This column lists where each game was held and how many people attended. My task is to count how many times \"Bradley Center\" appears in this column across all rows because that will indicate how many games were played there.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: November 2 vs Portland, location attendance is Bradley Center with 13087. So that's one.\n- Row 1: November 3 vs Boston, at TD Garden. Not Bradley Center. Move on.\n- Row 2: November 5 vs Indiana, at Conseco Fieldhouse. Not the center we're looking for.\n- Row 3: November 6 vs New Orleans, back to Bradley Center with 16731 attendance. That's two.\n- Row 4: November 9 vs New York, again at Bradley Center, 13286 people. Three now.\n- Row 5: November 10 vs Atlanta, held at Philips Arena. So nope.\n- Row 6: November 13 vs Golden State, back to Bradley Center with 17049. That's four.\n- Row 7: November 16 vs LA Lakers, still at Bradley Center, attendance 18059. Five games so far.\n- Row 8: November 19 vs Philadelphia, at Wells Fargo Center. Not our venue.\n- Row 9: November 20 vs Oklahoma City, again at Bradley Center with 16975. That's six.\n- Rows 10 to 14: The remaining games are at Quicken Loans Arena, the palace of Auburn Hills, etc., so no more Bradley Center.\n\nSo adding them up: rows 0,3,4,6,7,9 all have \"Bradley Center\" in the location attendance column. That's a total of six games.\n\nWait, let me recount to be sure I didn't miss any:\n\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: No\nRow 2: No\nRow 3: Yes (2)\nRow 4: Yes (3)\nRow 5: No\nRow 6: Yes (4)\nRow 7: Yes (5)\nRow 8: No\nRow 9: Yes (6)\nRows 10-14: None\n\nYes, that's six games.

The table has data for various games from November 2 to November 26.\n\nLet me look at the columns relevant to this claim: date, location attendance, and the game details like team and opponent.\n\nThe claim mentions the game on November 26. Let's find that row in the table. Scanning through the dates:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 14 has the date november 24.\nWait, no, let me recount. The rows are from index 0 to 14 (total 15 games). Wait, no\u2014the last row is game 15 on november 26.\n\nSo looking at row 14: it's november 24 vs cleveland, location quicken loans arena with attendance 20562. But the claim refers to november 26.\n\nWait, no\u2014row 14 is game 14, november 24, and row 15 is game 15 on november 26. Let me check the table again:\n\nRow 13: november 20\nRow 14: november 24\nRow 15: november 26\n\nSo for row 15 (index 14 in zero-based), the date is november 26, location is the palace of auburn hills, attendance 17133.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"quicken loan arena.\" So I need to see if any game at quicken loans arena on november 26 has the highest attendance.\n\nLooking through all games:\n\nRow indices and their details:\n\nRow 0: bradley center\nRow 1: td garden\nRow 2: conseco fieldhouse\nRow 3: bradley center\nRow 4: bradley center\nRow 5: philips arena\nRow 6: bradley center\nRow 7: wells fargo center\nRow 8: quicken loans arena (november 24)\nRow 9: palace of auburn hills (november 26)\n\nWait, the claim says the november 26 game at quicken loan arena.

The claim mentions \"quicken loan arena\" but in the table, that location was on november 24 (row 8) with attendance 20562. \n\nWait, so perhaps the claim is incorrect because it attributes the highest attendance to the wrong game. Let me double-check all attendances:\n\nLooking at each row's \"location attendance\":\n\nRow 0: bradley center - 17133\nRow 1: td garden - 19262\nRow 2: conseco fieldhouse - 15854\nRow 3: bradley center - 17631\nRow 4: bradley center - 18012\nRow 5: philips arena - 17399\nRow 6: bradley center - 19100\nRow 7: wells fargo center - 15530\nRow 8: quicken loans arena - 20562 (november 24)\nRow 9: palace of auburn hills - 17133 (november 26)\n\nSo the highest attendance is indeed 20562 on november 24 at quicken loans arena, not november 26.

The task is to determine whether the claim about Brandon Jennings leading in both high rebounds and points in 8 games during the 2010-11 Milwaukee Bucks season is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully: \"Brandon Jennings be the leader for high rebound and point in 8 game.\" So, we're looking to see if there are exactly 8 games where Brandon Jennings is listed as both the top scorer (high points) and the top rebounder (high rebounds).\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game. The relevant columns here are \"high points\" and \"high rebounds\". I'll need to examine these two columns for each game to check if Jennings is listed in both.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Game 4 (November 2):** High points - Corey Maggette (16), High rebounds - Andrew Bogut (9). Jennings isn't leading either category here.\n2. **Game 5 (November 3):** High points - Andrew Bogut (21), High rebounds - Andrew Bogut (13).

No Jennings in either.\n5. **Game 8 (November 9):** High points - Brandon Jennings (19), High rebounds - Ersan Ilyasova (9). Here, Jennings leads points but not rebounds.\n6. **Game 9 (November 10):** High points - Corey Maggette (20), High rebounds - Drew Gooden and Ersan Ilyasova (10). Jennings isn't leading either.\n7. **Game 10 (November 13):** High points - John Salmons (26), High rebounds - Andrew Bogut (17). No Jennings in either.\n8. **Game 11 (November 16):** High points - Brandon Jennings (31), High rebounds - Andrew Bogut (18). Jennings leads points but not rebounds.\n9. **Game 12 (November 19):** High points - Corey Maggette (20), High rebounds - Drew Gooden and John Salmons (8). Jennings isn't leading either.\n10. **Game 13 (November 20):** High points - Brandon Jennings (25), High rebounds - Drew Gooden (16). Jennings leads points but not rebounds.\n11. **Game 14 (November 24):** High points - Keyon Dooling (18), High rebounds - Drew Gooden and Luc Moute (9). No Jennings in either.\n12. **Game 15 (November 26):** High points - Brandon Jennings (25), High rebounds - Ersan Ilyasova (11). Jennings leads points but not rebounds.\n\nFrom this analysis, it's clear that in multiple games (Games 8, 11, 13, 15), Brandon Jennings leads in points. However, there's no instance where he also leads in rebounds. In all these cases, the high rebounds are attributed to other players like Andrew Bogut or Ersan Ilyasova.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Jennings led both in rebounds and points in 8 games isn't supported by the data provided.

The claim states that \"3 venue have attendance under 14000 in november during the 2010-11 milwaukee buck season.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The key elements are:\n\n1. **Venue (Location):** Looking at the table, there's a column called \"location attendance\" which lists both the venue and the attendance number.\n2. **Attendance under 14000:** This means any attendance figure less than 14,000 is relevant.\n3. **November games in the Milwaukee Bucks season (2010-11):** All the games listed are from November, so each row represents a game played that month.\n\nSo my task is to go through each row of the table and check two things for each location:\n\n- What's the attendance number?\n- Is it under 14,000?\n\nLet me start by listing out all the rows and their corresponding \"location attendance\" values. The row indices are from 0 to 14.\n\nRow 0: Bradley Center 13087\nRow 1: TD Garden 18624\nRow 2: Conseco Fieldhouse 14115\nRow 3: Bradley Center 16731\nRow 4: Bradley Center 13286\nRow 5: Philips Arena 11211\nRow 6: Bradley Center 17049\nRow 7: Bradley Center 18059\nRow 8: Wells Fargo Center 14557\nRow 9: Bradley Center 16975\nRow 10: Quicken Loans Arena 20562\nRow 11: The Palace of Auburn Hills 17133\n\nWait, let me correct that. The table has 15 rows (from game 4 to game 15). So the row indices should be from 0 to 14.\n\nLet's list them properly:\n\n- Row 0 (Game 4): Bradley Center 13087\n- Row 1 (Game 5): TD Garden 18624\n- Row 2 (Game 6): Conseco Fieldhouse 14115\n- Row 3 (Game 7): Bradley Center 16731\n- Row 4 (Game 8): Bradley Center 13286\n- Row 5 (Game 9): Philips Arena 11211\n- Row 6 (Game 10): Bradley Center 17049\n- Row 7 (Game 11): Bradley Center 18059\n- Row 8 (Game 12): Wells Fargo Center 14557\n- Row 9 (Game 13): Bradley Center 16975\n- Row 10 (Game 14): Quicken Loans Arena 20562\n- Row 11 (Game 15): The Palace of Auburn Hills 17133\n\nWait, actually, the table starts at Game 4 and goes up to Game 15. So there are 12 games listed, which would be rows 0 to 11.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to extract the attendance number and check if it's under 14,000.\n\nLet me go through each one:\n\n- Row 0: 13087 \u2192 Under 14k? Yes.\n- Row 1: 18624 \u2192 No.\n- Row 2: 14115 \u2192 Wait, is that under 14k? 14,115 is over 14k. So no.\n- Row 3: 16731 \u2192 Over.\n- Row 4: 13286 \u2192 Under.\n- Row 5: 11211 \u2192 Under.\n- Row 6: 17049 \u2192 Over.\n- Row 7: 18059 \u2192 Over.\n- Row 8: 14557 \u2192 Wait, is that over or under? 14,557 is just over 14k. So no.\n- Row 9: 16975 \u2192 Over.\n- Row 10: 20562 \u2192 Over.\n- Row 11: 17133 \u2192 Over.\n\nSo the rows with attendance under 14,000 are:\n\nRow 0 (13087), Row 4 (13286), and Row 5 (11211). That's three venues. Wait, but let me check each location:\n\n- Bradley Center appears multiple times: Rows 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.\n\nBut in terms of unique venues, it's the same venue every time. So does the claim refer to unique venues or total games? The wording says \"3 venue have attendance under 14000.\" So I think they're talking about three different locations where the attendance was under 14k.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 0: Bradley Center (under)\n- Row 5: Philips Arena (under)\n- Are there any other venues with attendance under? Let's see. \n\nWait, let me check all the rows again for under 14k and note their locations:\n\nRow 0: Bradley Center - 13087\nRow 4: Bradley Center - 13286\nRow 5: Philips Arena - 11211\n\nSo only two unique venues: Bradley Center and Philips Arena. But wait, in Row 5, it's Philips Arena with 11211. Are there any others?\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 0: Bradley (under)\n- Row 1: TD Garden (over)\n- Row 2: Conseco Fieldhouse (14115 \u2192 over 14k)\n- Row 3: Bradley (over)\n- Row 4: Bradley (under)\n- Row 5: Philips Arena (under)\n- Row 6: Bradley (over)\n- Row 7: Bradley (over)\n- Row 8: Wells Fargo (14557 \u2192 over)\n- Row 9: Bradley (over)\n- Row 10: Quicken Loans (20k \u2192 over)\n- Row 11: Palace of Auburn Hills (17k \u2192 over)\n\nSo only two venues had any games with attendance under 14k: Bradley Center and Philips Arena. But wait, the claim says \"3 venue have attendance under 14000.\" So that would require three different locations where at least one game had attendance under.\n\nBut from the data, only two venues meet this condition. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps it's counting all games, regardless of location. But the wording says \"3 venue\" which implies three distinct places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count includes multiple games at the same venue as separate instances? That might not make sense because the venues are unique. So, no, it should be about three different locations where attendance was under 14k in any game that month.\n\nGiven that only two venues (Bradley Center and Philips Arena) had games with attendance under 14k, the claim of three venues is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are three venues with attendance under 14,000. However, upon reviewing each row, only two venues (Bradley Center and Philips Arena) meet this condition. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": false,\n  \"explanation\": \"Only two unique venues had games where attendance was under 14,000.\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"all the game be play at bradley center during the buck 2010-11 season.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this correctly. It seems like the user might have meant that all games were played at Bradley Center during the Bucks' 2010-11 season. So my task is to check if every game listed in the table was held at Bradley Center.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column named \"location attendance.\" Each row under this column gives the location where the game was played and the number of attendees. My goal is to examine each entry in this column for all 15 games (rows) and see if they are all at Bradley Center.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: bradley center 13087\nRow 1: td garden 18624 \u2192 This is Boston's arena, not Bradley.\nRow 2: conseco fieldhouse 14115 \u2192 Indiana's home court.\nRow 3: bradley center 16731\nRow 4: bradley center 13286\nRow 5: philips arena 11211 \u2192 Atlanta\u2019s venue.\nRow 6: bradley center 17049\nRow 7: bradley center 18059\nRow 8: wells fargo center 14557 \u2192 Philadelphia's arena.\nRow 9: bradley center 16975\nRow 10: quicken loans arena 20562 \u2192 Cleveland\u2019s place.\nRow 11: the palace of auburn hills 17133 \u2192 Detroit\u2019s home court.\n\nSo, in rows 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, and 11, the games were not played at Bradley Center. That means the claim isn't true because not all games were there.\n\nI also need to note which cells are relevant. These would be the \"location attendance\" column for each row that's outside Bradley Center. So I should list those rows with their respective indices and the column name.\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are in the \"location attendance\" column of rows 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, and 11.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the most point scored by a single player in a single game in November during the 2010-11 Milwaukee Bucks season was 37 in the November 16 game against the Trail Blazers.\"\n\nFirst, I should understand what exactly is being claimed here. It's about the highest points scored by a single player in any game that took place in November of that season. The claim says that this maximum was 37 points, specifically in the game on November 16 against Portland.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like the opponent, date, score, and individual performances such as high points. Each cell under \"high points\" shows the player's name along with their point total in parentheses.\n\nMy first step is to examine all games played in November 2010-11 for the Milwaukee Bucks. Scanning through each row:\n\nGame 4: November 2 vs. Portland - High points by Corey Maggette with 16 points.\nGame 5: November 3 vs. Boston - Andrew Bogut scored 21.\nGame 6: November 5 vs. Indiana - John Salmons had 22.\nGame 7: November 6 vs. New Orleans - Andrew Bogut again with 19.\nGame 8: November 9 vs. New York - Brandon Jennings scored 19.\nGame 9: November 10 vs. Atlanta - Corey Maggette got 20 points.\nGame 10: November 13 vs. Golden State - John Salmons had a high of 26.\nGame 11: November 16 vs. LA Lakers - Brandon Jennings scored 31 points.\nGame 12: November 19 vs. Philadelphia - Corey Maggette with 20 again.\nGame 13: November 20 vs. Oklahoma City - Brandon Jennings had 25.\nGame 14: November 24 vs. Cleveland - Keyon Dooling scored 18.\nGame 15: November 26 vs. Detroit - Brandon Jennings with 25.\n\nSo, looking through the \"high points\" column for each game in November, the highest individual score I see is 31 points by Brandon Jennings on November 16 against LA Lakers. The claim mentions a game against the Trail Blazers (Portland) where the player scored 37 points. However, checking Game 4 (November 2 vs. Portland), Corey Maggette only had 16 points.\n\nTherefore, there's no instance in the table of any player scoring 37 points in November that season for the Bucks. The highest was 31 by Jennings against LA Lakers. So the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states a 37-point game against Portland on November 16, but checking the data, Brandon Jennings scored 31 points against LA Lakers on November 16, and Corey Maggette had only 16 against Portland.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the november 2 game at td garden have the highest attendance of 14115 during the 2010-11 buck season.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into parts that I can check against the table.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. The game was on November 2.\n2. It was played at TD Garden.\n3. The attendance for this game was 14,115.\n4. This is the highest attendance during the 2010-11 season.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the \"date\" column, November 2 falls on row index 0 (since counting starts at 0). The location for that game was Bradley Center with an attendance of 13,087. Wait, but according to the claim, it's TD Garden. Hmm, so I need to check if any other games were played at TD Garden.\n\nLooking through the \"location attendance\" column:\n- Row index 0: bradley center 13087\n- Row index 1: td garden 18624\n- Row index 2: conseco fieldhouse 14115\n- Etc.\n\nSo, in row index 1, the location is TD Garden with attendance 18,624. That's higher than 14,115 mentioned in the claim.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the november 2 game at td garden\". But from row index 0, November 2 was at Bradley Center. So there's a discrepancy here because the game on November 2 wasn't at TD Garden; it was at Bradley Center. The game at TD Garden was on November 3 (row index 1), which had an attendance of 18,624.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect for two reasons: \na) The game on November 2 wasn't at TD Garden.\nb) Even if it were, 18,624 is higher than 14,115.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Row index 0 has date November 2, teamPortland, location Bradley Center, attendance 13,087. So the claim incorrectly states that November 2 was at TD Garden and had attendance 14,115. But in reality, on November 2, it's not TD Garden, so the game at TD Garden is a different date (November 3), with higher attendance.\n\nSo, the correct highest attendance during this period was 18,624 at TD Garden on November 3, which isn't what the claim says. The claim incorrectly attributes that attendance to a game on November 2 at TD Garden, which didn't happen.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly references the location and date of the game with the highest attendance. The correct highest attendance was 18,624 on November 3 at TD Garden.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"all 12 games of the buck 2010-11 season during the month of november have under 14000 attendance.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check how many games there are in November for the Bucks. Looking at the 'date' column, all dates fall under November (e.g., november 2, november 3, etc.), so it seems these are all November games.\n\nNext, the claim mentions \"12 game[s]\" but looking at the table, I count only 14 rows. However, perhaps not all games are listed here. Wait, maybe the season's November games total 15 as per the table provided (rows 4 to 15). Hmm, the user might have a typo, but let me proceed with the data given.\n\nNow, focusing on attendance: The claim says each game has under 14000 attendees. I'll check each 'location attendance' value:\n\n- Game 4: 13087 (under)\n- Game 5: 18624 (over)\n- Game 6: 14115 (slightly over, but wait, is it under? 14115 is just over 14k. Wait, the claim says under 14000. So 14115 is above.\n  \nWait a minute, Game 5 has attendance of 18624, which is way over 14k. Also, Game 6 is 14115, which is just over.\n\nTherefore, the claim that all games have under 14000 attendance is FALSE because at least two games (Games 5 and 6) exceed this number.\n\nSo, I'll mark the answer as FALSE and list the relevant cells where the attendance exceeds 14k.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
