    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon be the high rebounders in game 62 against Houston.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It mentions two players, Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon, as the high rebounders in a specific game\u2014game number 62 against Houston.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row corresponding to game 62. Scanning through the 'game' column, I see that game 62 is on March 5th against Houston. \n\nNow, the relevant columns for this claim are \"high rebounds.\" In the table, each row has a \"high rebounds\" column which lists players who had the highest rebounds in that game.\n\nIn game 62's row, under \"high rebounds,\" it says: \"vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7)\". This indicates that both Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon were the high rebounders with 7 rebounds each. \n\nSo, according to this data, the claim is accurate because both players are listed as having the highest rebounds in game 62 against Houston.\n\nI should also note the exact cells I checked: row index 2 (since counting starts from 0), and the \"high rebounds\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. In game 62, Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon are listed as high rebounders with 7 rebounds each.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"orlando win game 65 with a score of 79 - 92\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"game 65\". Looking at the table, each row corresponds to a specific game number under the 'game' column. So I'll search for the row where the 'game' number is 65.\n\nLooking through the rows, I find that row index 5 (since counting starts from 0) has \"march 10\" as the date and \"orlando\" as the team. The game number here is indeed 65. So this is the relevant row for our claim.\n\nNow, checking the 'score' column for this row. The score listed is \"l 79  - 92 (ot)\". The 'l' stands for loss, indicating that Orlando lost this game. The scores are 79 for Orlando and 92 for the opposing team.\n\nThe claim states that Orlando won the game with a score of 79-92. But according to the table, Orlando lost the game 79-92. So there's a contradiction here because if they lost, they didn't win as the claim suggests.\n\nAdditionally, let me check other details just to be thorough. The team column for game 65 is \"orlando\", which matches the claim. However, since the outcome was a loss ('l'), the rest doesn't matter\u2014Orlando did not win the game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because Orlando lost game 65 with the score 79-92.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Orlando won game 65. The table shows they lost with a score of 79-92.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim and check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"on march 10 , vince carter (43) have high point and alvin williams (9) have high assist\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the date is March 10. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The rows are numbered from game 60 to game 73. Let me go through each row's date:\n   - Game 60: March 1\n   - Game 61: March 3\n   - Game 62: March 5\n   - Game 63: March 7\n   - Game 64: March 8\n   - Game 65: March 10 \u2192 This is the row we need.\n\nNow, looking at game 65 on March 10:\n\n- High points: vince carter (16)\n- High rebounds: antonio davis (12)\n- High assists: chris childs (7)\n\nThe claim mentions that Vince Carter had high points with 43 and Alvin Williams had high assists with 9. But according to the table, on March 10:\n\n- Vince Carter's high points were only 16, not 43.\n- The high assists were from Chris Childs (7), not Alvin Williams.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect based on this row.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there's any other game where Vince Carter had 43 points and Alvin Williams had 9 assists. Looking through the table:\n\n- In game 62 (March 5 vs Houston), Vince Carter did have high points with 43. On that day:\n   - High assists were from Alvin Williams (9)\n   - So on March 5, both parts of the claim would be true if the date were correct.\n\nBut since the claim is about March 10, which doesn't align with the data for game 62, the claim stands as false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim references March 10 but mentions statistics that occurred on a different date. Therefore, it's false based on the given table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assist\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about game number 72 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"game number 72 on march 28 be against cleveland with a score of w 94 - 80 (ot)\". So, there are three parts to check here:\n1. The game number should be 72.\n2. The date should be March 28.\n3. The opponent is Cleveland, and the score is a win by 94-80 in overtime.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. It's an HTML table with several columns: game, date, team, score, etc. Each row represents a different game.\n\nI need to find the row where the \"game\" column is 72. Scanning through the \"game\" numbers:\n- Game 60\n- Game 61\n- ...\n- Game 73\n\nYes, I see game number 72 as one of the entries. Now, let's check the details for game 72.\n\nLooking at row index 11 (since counting starts from 0; the first data row is index 0), which corresponds to game 72. The date here is March 28, so that matches the claim. \n\nNext, the opponent: in the \"team\" column for this row, it says \"atlanta\". Wait, that's different from Cleveland mentioned in the claim. So the team they played against was Atlanta, not Cleveland.\n\nAdditionally, checking the score: the score is listed as w 85 - 83 (ot). The claim states a win with 94-80, but here it's 85-83. That doesn't match either.\n\nSo both the opponent and the score don't align with the claim. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because game number 72 was against Atlanta, not Cleveland, and the score was a win of 85-83 (OT), not 94-80.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
