    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"prince park be home to the carlton team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand what information it contains. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game with specific details about the teams involved, their scores, where the game was played, how many people attended, and when.\n\nThe claim is about whether Prince Park is the home ground for Carlton. So, I need to look at each row in the table and see if there's any information that links Carlton as the home team at Prince Park.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n1. The first row involves Essendon vs Fitzroy at Windy Hill.\n2. The second row has Collingwood vs South Melbourne at Victoria Park.\n3. The third row is Carlton vs Hawthorn, and the venue here is Princes Park.\n4. The fourth row shows Richmond vs North Melbourne at Punt Road Oval.\n5. The fifth row mentions St Kilda vs Melbourne at Junction Oval.\n6. The sixth row has Geelong vs Footscray at Kardinia Park.\n\nFrom this, I can see that in the third row, Carlton is indeed the home team, and the venue is listed as Princes Park. This directly supports the claim because it shows that Carlton plays at Prince Park (note: there's a typo in the claim; it should be \"Princes\" instead of \"Prince\"). However, since the claim uses \"prince park,\" which might be a misspelling, but the main point is whether Carlton's home ground is listed as Princes Park.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell that supports this is row index 2 (since we start counting from 0) under the venue column. This confirms that when Carlton is the home team, they play at Princes Park.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
