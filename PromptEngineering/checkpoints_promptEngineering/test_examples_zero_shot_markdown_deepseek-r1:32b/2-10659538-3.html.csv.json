    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"66189 crowd attend the New Orleans Saint game with a record of 6 - 1.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for games involving the New Orleans Saints in the table. Scanning through each row, I see two entries where the opponent is the New Orleans Saints:\n\n- Week 7: Result was a loss (L) with score 34-31. The attendance was 66189, and the record after this game was 6-1.\n\nAnother mention of New Orleans Saints is in Week 14, but that's a win with attendance 70332 and record 11-2.\n\nSo for the specific claim about 66189 attendees when facing the Saints, it refers to Week 7. The relevant cells here are:\n\n- Row 6 (Week 7) under 'attendance' which is 66189.\n- The same row's 'record' column showing 6-1.\n\nAll parts of the claim match this row exactly. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about that table. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. Looking at the columns: week, date, opponent, result, record, tv time, and attendance. There are 17 rows, each representing a different week from week 1 to week 17. However, week 8 seems to have all dashes except for the attendance column, which is marked as 'nan', indicating missing data.\n\nThe claim states: \"66189 crowd attend the game with a record of 6 - 1 on week 8.\" So I need to check two things in week 8: the attendance and the record.\n\nLooking at week 8's row, the attendance is listed as 'nan', which means it's not available or there's no data. Since attendance is missing, we can't confirm that 66189 people attended the game. Additionally, the record for week 8 isn't provided either\u2014it's just a dash. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check if week 7's record was 6-0 and after week 8 they might have lost or won, but since week 8 is missing data, we can't confirm the claim. The next available week is week 9 with a record of 7-1. So between week 7 (record 6-0) and week 9 (7-1), perhaps there was a loss in week 8, which would make the record 6-1 after week 8. But since week 8's result is missing, we can't be certain.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions attendance of 66189. Looking through other weeks, I see that week 7 had an attendance of 66189. So maybe the user confused week 7 with week 8? But according to the table, week 7's result was a loss (34-31) against the New Orleans Saints, and that's when they dropped to 6-1 after winning all previous games.\n\nBut since the claim specifically mentions week 8, which has no data, I can't confirm either the attendance or the record. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to week 8 where both attendance and record are missing (marked as 'nan'). Since there's no information for week 8, the claim cannot be verified.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"66084 crowd attend the indianapolis colt game on december 30, 2001.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. There are three key pieces of information to verify:\n1. The date mentioned is December 30, 2001.\n2. The opponent in question is the Indianapolis Colts.\n3. The attendance figure given is 66,084.\n\nI need to check each of these against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's a markdown table with columns: week, date, opponent, result, record, tv time, and attendance. Each row represents a game from week 1 through week 17.\n\nStarting with the date, December 30, 2001\u2014I'll scan the 'date' column to find that specific date. Scanning down, I notice that week 16 has the date \"december 30, 2001.\" So that's a match for the date.\n\nNext, checking the opponent for that week: in row 16 (since counting starts at 0 or 1? Wait, looking back, the rows are labeled from 1 to 17. Wait no, actually, in the table provided, the first row after the header is week 1, so week 16 would be row index 15 if starting from 0. But let me clarify: the table starts with week 1 as the first data row, so row index 0 is week 1, up to row index 16 being week 17.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the actual data rows:\n\nRow 1 (week 1): September 9, 2001\n...\nRow 16 (week 16): December 30, 2001\n\nSo in the table, week 16 is row index 15 if counting from 0. Wait no: looking at the markdown, the first data row after the header is week 1, so week 1 is row index 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list out all the rows:\n\nRow 0: week 1\nRow 1: week 2\n...\nRow 15: week 16 (December 30, 2001)\nRow 16: week 17\n\nSo for week 16, row index is 15.\n\nIn that row, the opponent is listed as \"indianapolis colts.\" That matches the claim's opponent. So that's a second match.\n\nNow, checking the attendance: in the same row (row 15), under 'attendance' it's 66084. The claim states 66084, so that's an exact match.\n\nSo all three components of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo structure the relevant cells:\n\n- For the date: row index 15 (since week 16 is at row 15 if starting from 0), column 'date'\n- For the opponent: same row 15, column 'opponent'\n- For attendance: same row 15, column 'attendance'\n\nWait no\u2014each relevant cell refers to one aspect. Since all three aspects are covered in a single row (row 15), each component is in that row but under different columns.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n{\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n{\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n{\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n\nBut perhaps since all are in the same row, but each column is different. Alternatively, maybe just one cell if we're checking multiple aspects from a single row. But according to instructions, I think each relevant piece needs its own entry.\n\nWait, no\u2014each part of the claim (date, opponent, attendance) comes from separate cells within that row.\n\nSo the 'relevant_cells' array should include all three columns for that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
