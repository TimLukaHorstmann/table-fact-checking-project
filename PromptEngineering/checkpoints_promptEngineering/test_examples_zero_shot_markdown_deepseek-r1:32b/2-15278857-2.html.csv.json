    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"dicky bond and bruce bannister share the lowest number of goals\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are name, goals, apps, avge, and career. Since the claim is about the number of goals, I should focus on the \"goals\" column for each relevant player.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: dicky bond and bruce bannister. Let me find their respective rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Dicky Bond is listed towards the bottom with 60 goals.\n- Bruce Bannister is a few rows above, also with 60 goals.\n\nNow, I need to check if they share the lowest number of goals. To do this, I'll go through each player's \"goals\" value and see if any have fewer than 60.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Bobby Campbell: 121 goals (higher)\n2. Frank O'Rourke: 88 goals (higher)\n3. Dean Windass: 76 goals (higher)\n4. John Hallows: 74 goals (higher)\n5. Joe Cooke: 68 goals (higher)\n6. Gerry Ingram: 64 goals (higher)\n7. Bobby Ham: 64 goals (same as above, but still higher than 60)\n8. David McNiven: 64 goals\n9. Sean McCarthy: 63 goals\n10. John Hall: 63 goals\n11. David Jackson: 61 goals\n12. Bruce Bannister: 60 goals\n13. Dicky Bond: 60 goals\n\nI see that both Dicky Bond and Bruce Bannister have the lowest number of goals with 60 each. All other players have more than 60 goals. Therefore, they do share the lowest number.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because both have the same and lowest goal count in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}]}",

That's one athlete with 64 goals besides Bobby Ham.\n- Bobby Ham indeed has 64 goals as stated in the claim.\n- David McNiven also has 64 goals, which is another one.\n\nSo, we have three athletes with 64 goals: Bobby Ham, Gerry Ingram, and David McNiven. This matches the claim that Bobby Ham and two others each have 64 goals.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. The key column here is \"goals\" because it's where we check the number of goals for each athlete. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Gerry Ingram is in row index 5 (assuming starting count from 0) and has 64 goals.\n- Bobby Ham is in row index 6 with 64 goals.\n- David McNiven is in row index 7, also with 64 goals.\n\nEach of these entries falls under the \"goals\" column.

The 'career' column shows their active years.\n\nFor frank o'rourke, the career is listed as \"1907 - 1914\". To find out how many years that is, I subtract 1907 from 1914: 1914 - 1907 = 7 years. But since both start and end are inclusive, it's actually 8 years (from 1907 to 1914 inclusive).\n\nFor john hallows, the career is \"1930 - 1936\". Subtracting gives 1936 - 1930 = 6 years. Again, including both start and end, that's 7 years.\n\nNow, comparing their careers: frank has 8 years, john has 7 years. The claim is that frank's career is 1 year longer than john's. \n\nYes, 8 years (frank) minus 7 years (john) equals exactly 1 year difference.

The claim is: \"there be less than 2 difference between the highest and lowest average.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions a difference between the highest and lowest averages. Looking at the table, there's a column named \"avge,\" which likely stands for average goals per game or something similar. So, the first step is to identify the highest and lowest values in the \"avge\" column.\n\nI'll start by listing out all the \"avge\" values from each row:\n\n1. bobby campbell: 0.44\n2. frank o'rourke: 0.46\n3. dean windass: 0.35\n4. john hallows: 0.45\n5. joe cooke: 0.25\n6. gerry ingram: 0.37\n7. bobby ham: 0.34\n8. david mcniven: 0.3\n9. sean mccarthy: 0.48\n10. john hall: 0.15\n11. david jackson: 0.24\n12. bruce bannister: 0.29\n13. dicky bond: 0.2\n\nNow, I need to find the highest and lowest values here.\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n\n- The highest \"avge\" is 0.48 (sean mccarthy).\n- The lowest \"avge\" is 0.15 (john hall).\n\nNext, calculate the difference between these two extremes: 0.48 - 0.15 = 0.33.\n\nThe claim states that this difference should be less than 2. Since 0.33 is much less than 2, the claim holds true.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything. The \"avge\" column doesn't specify if it's per match or another metric, but since all values are below 1 and considering they're averages over multiple games, it makes sense that the difference would be a small decimal. So, yes, 0.33 is indeed less than 2.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.
