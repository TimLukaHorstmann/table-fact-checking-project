    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"rene lambert play right wing and be draft with the 146th pick\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its two main parts:\n\n1. **Rene Lambert plays right wing.**\n2. **He was drafted with the 146th pick.**\n\nI need to verify both statements against the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: pick, player, position, nationality, nhl team, and college/junior/club team. The rows are numbered from 144 to 151. \n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: Rene Lambert's position. I'll scan through the \"player\" column to find his name. Here, I see at row index 2 (assuming the first data row is index 0), the player is Rene Lambert. The corresponding \"position\" for this row is listed as \"right wing\". This matches the claim, so the first part seems correct.\n\nNext, checking the pick number. In the same row where Rene Lambert's name appears, I look at the \"pick\" column. It shows 146, which aligns with the claim stating he was drafted with the 146th pick. \n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table, the overall statement is TRUE.\n\nI also need to note the relevant cells that were used for verification. For Rene Lambert's position, it's the cell at row index 2 under \"position\". For the pick number, it's the same row but under the \"pick\" column.\n\nTherefore, both pieces of information are correctly supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"right wing , rene lampert  , be pick 145th\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim mentions three pieces of information:\n1. Position: right wing\n2. Player name: Rene Lampert\n3. Pick number: 145th\n\nNow, I'll go through the table row by row to see if this information aligns.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has several columns: pick, player, position, nationality, NHL team, and college/junior/club team. The rows are numbered from 144 to 151.\n\nStarting with pick number 145 because that's what the claim specifies:\n- Row index 1 (since indexing starts at 0; row 1 is pick 145)\n- Player: Steve Lyon\n- Position: defence\n\nHmm, so according to this, pick 145 is Steve Lyon, a defenceman. But the claim says it's Rene Lampert as a right wing. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I should check all rows just in case there are any discrepancies or if the claim refers to another row. Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0 (pick 144): Garry Howatt, left wing\n- Row 1 (pick 145): Steve Lyon, defence\n- Row 2 (pick 146): Rene Lambert, right wing\n- Row 3 (pick 147): Juri Kudrasovs, centre\n- Row 4 (pick 148): Marcel Comeau, centre\n- Row 5 (pick 149): Don Atchison, goaltender\n- Row 6 (pick 150): Dave Arundel, defence\n- Row 7 (pick 151): Fred Riggall, right wing\n\nLooking at row 2 (pick 146), I see Rene Lambert is a right wing. So he's picked at 146, not 145 as the claim suggests.\n\nAlso, in row 1 (pick 145), it's Steve Lyon, not Rene Lampert. Position there is defence, which also doesn't match the claim.\n\nSo, the claim incorrectly states that Rene Lambert was picked 145th. He was actually picked at 146th position as a right wing, and pick 145 was for Steve Lyon, a defenceman.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim don't align with the table data: the player name doesn't match, the pick number is off by one, and the position only partially matches but in the wrong row. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rene Lambert was picked 145th as a right wing. However, according to the table:\n\n- Pick 145 corresponds to Steve Lyon, a defenceman from Canada.\n- Rene Lambert is listed at pick 146 with the position of right wing.\n\nThus, the claim incorrectly attributes the pick number and player details.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
