    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here with some football match data, and there's a claim that says \"the home team only score zero 3 times out of all games.\" My task is to figure out if this claim is true or false by looking at the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the home teams scored zero goals in three games. So I need to go through each row and check how many times the home team's score was zero.\n\nLooking at the table structure: Each row has columns for tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. The 'score' column shows both the home and away scores separated by a hyphen. For example, in the first row, it's 1-1, which means both teams scored once.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Home team is Liverpool with a score of 1-1. So Liverpool scored 1 goal. Not zero.\n2. **Row 1 (replay)**: Portsmouth is the home team here, and the score is 1-0. They scored once. Again, not zero.\n3. **Row 2**: Sunderland is home with a 1-1 score. They scored once.\n4. **Row 3 (replay)**: Birmingham City are home and lost 0-2. Here, the home team scored zero. That's one instance.\n5. **Row 4**: Sheffield United scored 1 goal in a 1-0 win. Not zero.\n6. **Row 5**: Tranmere Rovers scored twice in a 2-1 win. Not zero.\n7. **Row 6 (tie no 5)**: Fulham's score is 0-0, so both teams scored zero. That counts for the home team as well. Second instance.\n8. **Row 7 (replay)**: West Ham United are the home team and lost 0-3. They scored zero. Third instance.\n9. **Row 8**: Manchester United won 4-2, so their score is four goals. Not zero.\n10. **Row 9**: Millwall scored once in a 1-0 win. Not zero.\n11. **Row 10**: Arsenal won 2-1, scoring two goals.\n\nSo adding up the instances where the home team scored zero: Row 3 (Birmingham City), Row 6 (Fulham), and Row 7 (West Ham United). That's three times total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In Row 6, it was a tie with both teams scoring zero, so Fulham as the home team did score zero. And in Row 3, Birmingham City also scored zero. Then in the replay of that game, West Ham as the home team scored zero again. So that's three times.\n\nI don't see any other rows where the home team scored zero. The claim says it happened three times out of all games. Looking back at the table, there are 11 rows, each representing a match (including replays). So in those 11 games, the home teams scored zero exactly three times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says, \"the manchester unite vs manchester city game have the highest attendance of all game.\" Let me look at the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through each row to find the game between Manchester United and Manchester City. Looking down the 'home team' and 'away team' columns, I see that in row 6 (since indexing starts at 0), the home team is Manchester United and the away team is Manchester City. The attendance for that game was 67228.\n\nNext, I need to check all other games to ensure no other game has higher attendance. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Liverpool vs Portsmouth, attendance 34669\n- Row 1: Portsmouth vs Liverpool (replay), 19529\n- Row 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City, 24966\n- Row 3: Birmingham City vs Sunderland (replay), 25645\n- Row 4: Sheffield United vs Colchester United, 17074\n- Row 5: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City, 12215\n- Row 6: Fulham vs West Ham (0-0), 14705\n- Row 7: West Ham vs Fulham (replay), 27934\n- Row 8: Manchester United vs Manchester City, attendance is 67228\n- Rows 9 and 10 don't have data beyond what's provided.\n\nLooking at all the attendances, row 6 has the highest number with 67228. All other games have lower attendances. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because that game indeed had the highest attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Manchester United vs. Manchester City game had the highest attendance. From the table, this game's attendance is 67,228, which is higher than all others.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"tie no 7 have the lowest attendance out of all feature game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table and what each column represents. The columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. Each row corresponds to a specific match with its details.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"tie no 7.\" So my first step is to locate tie number 7 in the table. Looking at the table rows:\n\n1. Tie no 1\n2. replay (probably a replay of tie 1)\n3. Tie no 2\n4. replay (replay of tie 2)\n5. Tie no 3\n6. Tie no 4\n7. Tie no 5\n8. replay (replay of tie 5)\n9. Tie no 6\n10. Tie no 7\n\nSo, row index 9 corresponds to tie no 7. The attendance for this match is listed as 10,420.\n\nNext, I need to verify if this is indeed the lowest attendance across all feature games. Feature games likely refer to all the matches listed in the table. So, I should look at the 'attendance' column of every row and compare them.\n\nLet's list out the attendances:\n\n- Tie 1: 34,669\n- Replay (Portsmouth vs Liverpool): 19,529\n- Tie 2: 24,966\n- Replay (Birmingham City vs Sunderland): 25,645\n- Tie 3: 17,074\n- Tie 4: 12,215\n- Tie 5: 14,705\n- Replay (West Ham United vs Fulham): 27,934\n- Tie 6: 67,228\n- Tie 7: 10,420\n\nNow, comparing these numbers to find the lowest attendance. The attendances are:\n\n34,669; 19,529; 24,966; 25,645; 17,074; 12,215; 14,705; 27,934; 67,228; 10,420.\n\nLooking at these values, the smallest number is 10,420, which corresponds to tie no 7. However, I notice another attendance of 12,215 for tie no 4. That's lower than some but higher than tie 7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check:\n\n- Tie 7: 10,420\n- Tie 4: 12,215\n\nYes, 10,420 is indeed lower than 12,215. So, the claim states that tie no 7 has the lowest attendance. Based on this comparison, it seems correct.\n\nHowever, I should ensure that there are no other games with even lower attendance. Looking through all the attendances again:\n\n34k, 19k, 24k, 25k, 17k, 12k, 14k, 28k, 67k, and 10k.\n\nYes, 10k is the smallest. Therefore, tie no 7 does have the lowest attendance among all listed games.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Identified tie no 7's attendance as 10,420.\n- Compared it with all other attendances in the table.\n- Confirmed that 10,420 is indeed the lowest figure.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"tie no 1 be the game tie score game with the highest attendance.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like there are a few parts here:\n\n1. **Tie No 1**: This refers to the first row in the table, which is \"tie no\" 1.\n2. **Game tie score game**: This might be referring to the attendance number for that game.\n3. **Highest attendance**: The claim is asserting that Tie No 1 has the highest attendance among all the games listed.\n\nSo, the main point is whether the attendance for Tie No 1 is the highest in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row's \"attendance\" column and see which one is the highest. Let me list out the attendances:\n\n- Tie 1: 34,669\n- Replay (Portsmouth vs Liverpool): 19,529\n- Tie 2: 24,966\n- Replay (Birmingham City vs Sunderland): 25,645\n- Tie 3: 17,074\n- Tie 4: 12,215\n- Tie 5: 14,705\n- Replay (West Ham United vs Fulham): 27,934\n- Tie 6: 67,228\n- Tie 7: 10,420\n- Tie 8: 38,136\n\nNow, looking at these numbers, the highest attendance is 67,228, which is for Tie No 6 between Manchester United and Manchester City. \n\nSo, according to this, Tie No 1 has an attendance of 34,669, but there's another tie (Tie 6) with a much higher attendance. Therefore, the claim that Tie No 1 has the highest attendance is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider only the initial ties and not include the replays? Let me check the structure of the table again. The table includes both regular ties and their replays. However, each tie number (like 1 to 8) has a corresponding game, some of which have replays listed as \"replay\" in the tie no column.\n\nSo, for Tie No 1, there are two games: the initial match with attendance 34,669 and the replay with 19,529. But when considering the highest attendance across all games (including replays), we have to compare all attendances together. Since 67,228 is higher than 34,669, Tie No 1 isn't the highest.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other ties like Tie 8 has an attendance of 38,136, which is also lower than Tie 6's 67,228. Therefore, the claim doesn't hold because there's a higher attendance elsewhere in the table.\n\nSo, to sum up, I need to identify the highest attendance in the entire table and check if it belongs to Tie No 1. Since it doesn't, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the game with tie no 6 has the highest attendance of 67,228, which is higher than tie no 1's attendance of 34,669.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"both the arsenal and chelsea team be only feature on the list a single time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It states that both Arsenal and Chelsea appear exactly once in the list. So my task is to check how many times each of these teams appears as either the home team or the away team in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance. There are 8 rows listed, with some labeled as replays.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to count the occurrences of Arsenal and Chelsea.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home Team: Liverpool\n- Away Team: Portsmouth\nNeither Arsenal nor Chelsea here.\n\nRow 2 (replay):\n- Home Team: Portsmouth\n- Away Team: Liverpool\nStill no mention of either team.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home Team: Sunderland\n- Away Team: Birmingham City\nNope, not relevant.\n\nRow 4 (replay):\n- Home Team: Birmingham City\n- Away Team: Sunderland\nAgain, nothing to note here.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home Team: Sheffield United\n- Away Team: Colchester United\nNot applicable.\n\nRow 6:\n- Home Team: Tranmere Rovers\n- Away Team: Swansea City\nStill no Arsenal or Chelsea.\n\nRow 7:\n- Home Team: Fulham\n- Away Team: West Ham United\nNope.\n\nRow 8 (replay):\n- Home Team: West Ham United\n- Away Team: Fulham\nAgain, neither team is here.\n\nNow, looking at Row 9:\n- Home Team: Manchester United\n- Away Team: Manchester City\nNo Arsenal or Chelsea here either.\n\nRow 10:\n- Home Team: Millwall\n- Away Team: Burnley\nNot relevant.\n\nFinally, Row 11:\n- Home Team: Arsenal\n- Away Team: Chelsea\nHere we have both teams mentioned. \n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, I notice that Arsenal appears only once as the home team in row 8, and Chelsea appears only once as the away team in row 8.

The 'tie no' seems to indicate match numbers, some of which are replays. The 'home team' and 'away team' columns show who is playing at home and away in each match. The 'score' column has the results, like 1-1 or 0-2. 'Attendance' isn't directly relevant for this claim about scoring points.\n\nThe key here is to check if any home team scored zero goals in a game because, in football, a score of 0 means they didn't score at all. If that happens, then the claim would be false.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Tie no 1: Liverpool (home) vs Portsmouth (away), score 1-1. Both teams scored once; home team didn't score zero.\n2. Replay for tie 1: Portsmouth (home) vs Liverpool (away), score 1-0. Home team scored once again, so not zero here either.\n3. Tie no 2: Sunderland (home) vs Birmingham City (away), 1-1. Both teams scored once.\n4. Replay tie 2: Birmingham City (home) vs Sunderland (away), 0-2. Wait, the home team here is Birmingham City and their score is 0. So they didn't score at all in this replay. That means the claim that \"the home team never score zero points through all the game\" is false because there's at least one instance where a home team scored zero.\n\nSo I need to note that row as relevant. The row index for this is 3, and the column to look at is 'score'.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE with the relevant cell being row 3, score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all home teams scored at least one goal in every game.

Scanning down, row 5 shows \"Manchester United\" as the home team with a score of 4-2 against \"Manchester City,\" and the attendance is listed as 67,228.\n\nNext, I need to check all other games' attendances to see if this is indeed the lowest. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Liverpool vs Portsmouth: 34,669\n2. Portsmouth replay at Liverpool: 19,529 (replay attendance)\n3. Sunderland vs Birmingham City: 24,966\n4.

Let me recount the rows:\n\n- Row 0: tie no 1 (attendance 34669)\n- Row 1: replay of tie no 1 (attendance 19529)\n- Row 2: tie no 2 (24966)\n- Row 3: replay of tie no 2 (25645)\n- Row 4: tie no 3 (17074)\n- Row 5: tie no 4 (12215)\n- Row 6: tie no 5 (14705)\n- Row 7: replay of tie no 5 (27934)\n- Row 8: tie no 6 (67228)\n- Row 9: tie no 7 (10420)\n- Row 10: tie no 8 (38136)\n\nNow, I'll collect all the attendance numbers:\n\n34669, 19529, 24966, 25645, 17074, 12215, 14705, 27934, 67228, 10420, 38136.\n\nI need to find the highest and second highest attendances.

Let me double-check:\n\n- Highest: 67228 (tie6)\n- Second highest: 38136 (tie8)\n- Third: 34669 (tie1)\n\nYes, that's correct. So tie no1 is third, not second.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are those where attendance is listed for each tie, but specifically focusing on tie no1 and the other attendances to determine their ranking.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because tie no 1 has the third highest attendance, not the second.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"both the arsenal and chelsea team be only feature on the list more than 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to understand its structure. The table has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and attendance. There are eight rows listed, each representing a match between two teams.\n\nThe claim mentions both Arsenal and Chelsea appearing more than once in the list. So my goal is to check how many times each of these teams appears as either the home or away team in the table.\n\nI'll start by examining each row for occurrences of Arsenal and Chelsea.\n\nLooking at Row 0: Home team is Liverpool, away team is Portsmouth. Neither Arsenal nor Chelsea are here.\nRow 1: It's a replay between Portsmouth and Liverpool. Still no Arsenal or Chelsea.\nRow 2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City. No match with the claim teams.\nRow 3: Replay between Birmingham City and Sunderland. Again, not relevant.\nRow 4: Sheffield United vs Colchester United. Not relevant.\nRow 5: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City. No mention of Arsenal or Chelsea here.\nRow 6: Fulham vs West Ham United. Still no.\nRow 7: Manchester United vs Manchester City. Nope.\n\nWait, that's all rows except Row 8 and beyond? Let me recount. The table has 10 rows:\n\nRows:\n0: Liverpool vs Portsmouth\n1: Portsmouth replay vs Liverpool\n2: Sunderland vs Birmingham City\n3: Birmingham City replay vs Sunderland\n4: Sheffield United vs Colchester United\n5: Tranmere Rovers vs Swansea City\n6: Fulham vs West Ham United\n7: Manchester United vs Manchester City\n8: Millwall vs Burnley\n9: Arsenal vs Chelsea\n\nOh, I see. Row 9 is where Arsenal and Chelsea appear. But looking at the table again, it's only once each in that row.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 9 (10 rows). The last two matches are:\n8: Millwall vs Burnley\n9: Arsenal vs Chelsea\n\nIn Row 9, Arsenal is the home team and Chelsea is the away team. So both appear once each in this table.\n\nNow, checking all other rows for any additional appearances of Arsenal or Chelsea:\n\nLooking back through all rows (0 to 9):\n\n- Any occurrence of Arsenal besides row 9? No.\n- Any occurrence of Chelsea besides row 9? No.\n\nSo both teams only appear once in the entire list. Therefore, the claim that they each feature more than once is FALSE.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells where Arsenal and Chelsea are listed:\n\nFor Arsenal: Row 9, home team.\nFor Chelsea: Row 9, away team.\n\nSince these are their only mentions, the claim isn't supported. Hence, the answer should be FALSE with the relevant cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
