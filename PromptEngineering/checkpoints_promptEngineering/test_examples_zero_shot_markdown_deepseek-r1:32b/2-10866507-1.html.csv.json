The claim states: \"the away team for both 14 july 2007 and on 20 july 2007 be perth glory.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. On 14 July 2007, was the away team Perth Glory?\n2. On 20 July 2007, was the away team also Perth Glory?\n\nI need to check each of these dates in the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (round 1) has the date as 14 July 2007. The home team is Newcastle Jets, and the away team is Perth Glory. So for this date, the away team is indeed Perth Glory.\n  \n- The second row (round 2) is on 20 July 2007. Here, Adelaide United is the home team, and the away team is also Perth Glory.\n\nSo both dates have Perth Glory as the away team. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. For each date mentioned in the claim:\n\n- For 14 July 2007 (Row 0), the 'away team' column shows Perth Glory.\n- For 20 July 2007 (Row 1), the 'away team' column again shows Perth Glory.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are the 'date' and 'away team' columns for both rows.

The row for this date shows that the home team is Central Coast Mariners and the away team is Perth Glory. So on 4 August, Perth Glory was indeed the away team. \n\nNext, the grand final (gf) is on 12 August 2007. In this row, Adelaide United is the home team, and Perth Glory is the away team again. Therefore, on both specified dates, Perth Glory was listed as the away team.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells to support these findings:\n- For 4 August 2007 (row index 3), the 'away team' column shows Perth Glory.\n- For 12 August 2007 (row index 4), the 'away team' column also shows Perth Glory.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's about two different dates and stadiums, checking if the crowd size was larger on one date compared to another.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find the rows corresponding to these dates and stadiums. \n\nStarting with 4 August 2007 at Bluetongue Central Coast Stadium. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 3 has the date 4 august 2007 and stadium bluetongue central coast stadium, with a crowd of 5967.\n\nNext, checking 20 July 2007 at Hindmarsh Stadium:\n\n- Row 1 shows date 20 july 2007, away team perth glory, home team adelaide united, and the crowd is 3513.\n\nNow, comparing the two crowds: 5967 vs. 3513. Clearly, 5967 is larger than 3513. Therefore, the claim that the crowd on 4 August was larger than on 20 July is TRUE.\n\nTo structure the answer as per instructions:\n\n- The answer should be \"TRUE\".\n- Relevant cells are the crowd numbers for each event:\n   - For 4 August: row index 3 (since rows start at 0), column 'crowd'.\n   - For 20 July: row index 1, column 'crowd'.\n\nSo, compiling this into a JSON object with these details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the home team be adelaide unite on both 20 july 2007 and on 12 august 2007\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure to understand where the necessary information lies. The table has columns: round, date, home team, score, away team, crowd, stadium. \n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: 20 July 2007 and 12 August 2007. For each of these dates, I need to check if Adelaide United was the home team.\n\nStarting with 20 July 2007:\n- I'll scan through the 'date' column to find this date. It's in row index 1.\n- Looking at the 'home team' for that row, it says \"adelaide united\". So on 20 July 2007, Adelaide United was indeed the home team.\n\nNext, checking 12 August 2007:\n- I look for this date in the 'date' column and find it at row index 4.\n- The 'home team' here is again \"adelaide united\". So on 12 August 2007 as well, Adelaide United was the home team.\n\nBoth instances satisfy the claim that Adelaide United was the home team on those dates.

I need to check each of these dates and see if Adelaide United was the away team on both occasions.\n\nStarting with 4 August 2007, which is the semi-finals (sf) round. Looking at row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0), the date is indeed 4 August 2007. The home team is central coast mariners, and the away team is perth glory. So Adelaide United isn't listed as the away team here; instead, they're not even mentioned in this row.\n\nNext, checking 12 August 2007, which is the grand final (gf) round. This is row index 4. The date matches, and looking at the teams, the home team is Adelaide United, while the away team is Perth Glory. So on this date, Adelaide United is actually the home team, not the away team.\n\nPutting it together, Adelaide United was the away team neither on 4 August nor on 12 August.
