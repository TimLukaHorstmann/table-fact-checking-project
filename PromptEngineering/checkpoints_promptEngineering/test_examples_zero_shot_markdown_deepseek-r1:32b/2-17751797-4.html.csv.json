    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the score be 1 - 0 when the away team be bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this claim is stating. It's asserting that there was a game where Bolton Wanderers were the away team and the score was 1-0. So, my task is to check if such an entry exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. I need to scan through each row to find any instance where the away team is \"bolton wanderers\" and the score is 1-0.\n\nStarting from the top, I go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 1: Away team is Brighton & Hove Albion, score is 2-2. Doesn't match.\nRow 2: This is a replay between Brighton and Liverpool. Not relevant here since we're looking for Bolton Wanderers as the away team.\nRow 3: Away team is Oldham Athletic, score 2-0. No match.\nRow 4: Away team is Rotherham United, score 1-0. Still not Bolton.\nRow 5: Replay between West Ham and Luton Town. Doesn't help.\nRow 6: Woking vs Everton. Not relevant.\nRow 7: Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon. No.\nRow 8: New Newcastle vs Nottingham Forest. No Bolton here either.\nRow 9: Tottenham vs Oxford United. Again, no match.\nRow 10: Coventry City vs Southampton. Still not it.\nRow 11: Portsmouth vs Bournemouth. Nope.\nRow 12: Manchester United as the home team with a score of 1-0 against Bolton Wanderers. Wait, that's interesting. Here, the away team is Bolton Wanderers, and the score is 1-0. But wait, in this row, it's Manchester United at home with a score of 1-0 against Bolton as the away team.\n\nSo according to this, there was a game where Bolton Wanderers were the away team, and the score was indeed 1-0. That would make the claim TRUE because the table shows that specific match.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss anything. Scanning through all the rows again, especially looking for any mention of Bolton Wanderers as the away team:\n\nRow 15: Arsenal vs Leeds United. No.\nRows after that are replays and other games without Bolton.\n\nSo only in row 14 (if counting from zero or one?), let me clarify the indices. Wait, the table has rows starting from tie no 1 to 16. Let's count:\n\nRow 0: Tie 1\nRow 1: Replay of Tie 1\nRow 2: Tie 2\n...\nRow 14 (assuming counting from zero): That would be row index 14, which is \"port vale vs manchester city\". Not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the rows properly, considering each tie and its replay as separate entries.\n\nLooking back, in the table:\n\nRow index starts at 0:\n\n0: Tie no 1\n1: Replay of Tie 1\n2: Tie no 2\n3: Tie no 3\n4: Tie no 4\n5: Replay of Tie 4\n6: Tie no 5\n7: Tie no 6\n8: Tie no 7\n9: Replay of Tie 7\n10: Tie no 8\n11: Tie no 9\n12: Tie no 10\n13: Tie no 11: Manchester United vs Bolton Wanderers, score 1-0. So row index 13.\n\nYes, so in row 13 (if starting from zero), the away team is Bolton Wanderers, and the score is 1-0. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because such a match exists in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the score be 2 - 3 when the away team be liverpool on the date of 30 / 01 / 1991.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\n1. **Away Team is Liverpool**: I need to find rows where the 'away team' column has 'liverpool'.\n2. **Date is 30/01/1991**: Look for rows with this date.\n3. **Score is 2 - 3**: Check if in those specific rows, the score matches.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (row_index 0) has Liverpool as the home team against Brighton on 26/01/1991.

It states that whenever Shrewsbury Town was the home team, the score of that match was 1-0. So I need to check all rows where the home team is Shrewsbury Town and verify their scores.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. The relevant columns here are \"home team\" and \"score\".\n\nI'll go through each row to find any entries where the home team is Shrewsbury Town.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, date. Each row represents a match with specific details.\n\nThe claim is about a scenario where the away team is \"brighton and hove albion\" (I think there's a typo in the claim; it says \"heave albion,\" but I assume they mean \"hove albion\"). So, the main points to check are:\n1. Are there any rows where the away team is \"brighton  & hove albion\"?\n2. For those rows, what was the score?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- The first row has tie no 1: home team is Liverpool, away team is Brighton & Hove Albion, and the score is 2-2. So this matches.\n- Then there's a replay for this match on 30/01/1991 where the score is 2-3 in favor of Liverpool, but the away team here is still Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nWait, so the claim says \"the score be 2 - 2 when the away team be brighton and heave albion.\" So it's looking for any instance where the away team is Brighton & Hove Albion and the score was 2-2. From row index 0, that's exactly what happened.\n\nBut then there's a replay in row index 1, same away team but a different score. However, the claim doesn't specify it's only about the initial tie or any replays; it just mentions the away team being Brighton & Hove Albion and the score being 2-2.\n\nSo, since at least one occurrence meets both conditions (row index 0), the claim is TRUE. The relevant cell for this would be the 'score' column in that row, which shows 2-2 when the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nI should also consider if there are other rows with the same away team but different scores, like the replay. However, since the claim doesn't specify it's only about the first match or all matches, any instance where both conditions meet is sufficient to make the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows a match (row index 0) where the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion and the score was 2-2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that when Wimbledon was the home team, the score of the match was 1-0. So I'm looking for a row in the table where \"home team\" is Wimbledon and the \"score\" column shows 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are multiple rows, some marked as replays. Let me go through each relevant entry to see if any fit this condition.\n\nI start scanning the \"home team\" column. I check each row:\n\n- The first few entries have home teams like Liverpool, Notts County, Crewe Alexandra, etc., none of which are Wimbledon.\n- Then I reach row 6: it says \"shrewsbury town\" as the home team with a score of 1-0 against Wimbledon. Wait, so here Wimbledon is the away team, not the home team. So this doesn't fit the claim because the home team isn't Wimbledon in this case.\n  \nContinuing further down:\n- There are replays and other matches, but I don't see any row where Wimbledon is listed as the home team. All entries either have Wimbledon as an away team or not involved at all.\n\nSo, based on the table, there's no instance where Wimbledon was the home team with a score of 1-0. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when Wimbledon was the home team, the score was 1-0.

The claim states that there's a match where Liverpool was the home team, the score was 2-3, and this happened after January 30, 1991.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, date.\n\nI need to find any row where:\n- Home team is Liverpool\n- Score is 2 - 3\n- Date is on or after 30/01/1991\n\nLet me go through the table rows one by one:\n\nRow 0: tie no 1, home team liverpool, score 2-2, away team brighton, date 26/01/1991. This is before 30/01/1991 and the score isn't 2-3.\n\nRow 1: tie no replay, home team brighton, away liverpool, score 2-3, date 30/01/1991. Here, Liverpool is the away team, not home. So this doesn't fit because we need Liverpool as home team.\n\nWait, maybe there's a replay where Liverpool was home again? Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 2: tie no 2, home notts county, score 2-0, date same as others.\n\nRow 7: newcastle vs nottingham forest on 13/02/1991. No liverpool here.\n\nReplays for other matches... Let me check all replays:\n\nRows with 'replay' in tie no:\n\nRow1: brighton (home) vs liverpool (away), score 2-3, date 30/01/1991.\n\nIs there another replay where Liverpool was home? The initial match between liverpool and brighton was on 26/01/1991 with a 2-2 draw. Then the replay is row1, which is brighton at home again?\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nRow0: tie no1 is liverpool (home) vs brighton away, score 2-2 on 26/01.\n\nThen Row1 is a replay where brighton is home and liverpool is away, with score 2-3 on 30/01. So in this case, Liverpool wasn't the home team in the replay.\n\nLooking further down, are there any other replays involving liverpool? It seems not; the only other replays involve different teams like crewe alexandra vs rotherham, luton vs west ham, etc., but none of them have liverpool as the home team after 30/01/1991.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let me scan all rows again:\n\nRow0: liverpool home on 26/01\n\nRow1: replay with brighton home on 30/01\n\nThen other rows up to row7: no liverpool as home team after that date.\n\nRows 8-15 don't have liverpool as home. Row16 is cambridge united vs middlesbrough, not relevant.\n\nSo the only match where Liverpool was involved after 26/01 is in row1, but they were away. Therefore, there's no entry where Liverpool was home team with a score of 2-3 on or after 30/01/1991.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim correctly. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it means: \"The score was 1-0 with Bolton Wanderers as the home team.\" So, we're looking for a match where Bolton Wanderers were the home team and the score was 1-0.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents either an initial match or a replay. The columns are tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. I'll scan through each row to find any entry where the home team is Bolton Wanderers and check if their score matches 1-0.\n\nStarting from row 0: Home team is Liverpool vs. Brighton. Not Bolton. Next, row 2: Notts County vs Oldham Athletic. No. Row3: Crewe Alexandra vs Rotherham United. Still no. Row4: Luton Town vs West Ham. Nope. The next few rows up to row15 don't show Bolton as home team.\n\nWait, let me check all the rows more carefully. Maybe I missed something.\n\nRow 0: Liverpool (home) - score 2-2.\nRow1: Brighton replay against Liverpool. Home is Brighton but not Bolton.\nRow2: Notts County (home) - 2-0.\nRow3: Crewe (home) - 1-0.\nRow4: Luton Town (home) - 1-1, then a replay where West Ham won 5-0.\nRow5: Woking (home) lost 0-1 to Everton.\nRow6: Shrewsbury Town (home) vs Wimbledon. Score 1-0. Oh! Here's a match with the home team as Shrewsbury Town and score 1-0.\n\nWait, so the claim is about Bolton Wanderers being the home team with a 1-0 score. So I need to look for 'bolton wanderers' in the home team column.\n\nLooking further: Row7: Newcastle vs Nottingham Forest. No. Row8: Tottenham vs Oxford. Not them. Row9: Coventry City (home) - 1-1, replay where Southampton won 2-0.\nRow10: Portsmouth (home) 5-1 Bournemouth. No.\nRow11: Manchester United (home) 1-0 against Bolton Wanderers. Wait, here's the row where the away team is Bolton. So in row11, home team is Man Utd, away is Bolton, and score is 1-0.\n\nSo the claim says \"the home team be bolton wanderer\" which would mean Bolton as home. But in this case, they're the away team. So that doesn't fit.\n\nContinuing: Row12: Norwich vs Swindon. No. Row13: Millwall drew 4-4 with Sheffield Wednesday; replay where Sheffield won 2-0.\nRow14: Port Vale (home) 1-2 Man City. Not Bolton.\nRow15: Arsenal played Leeds, first a draw then replays leading to Arsenal winning 1-2 on the last replay.\n\nSo after checking all rows, I don't see any instance where Bolton Wanderers are the home team with a score of 1-0. The only time they're mentioned is as the away team in row11 against Man Utd, which was a 1-0 win for Man Utd.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table because there's no match where Bolton Wanderers were the home team with a 1-0 score.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bolton Wanderers were the home team with a score of 1-0.

Let me check: The rows are numbered from 1 to 16, but in markdown tables, sometimes they're zero-indexed in code but here the user has rows like \"tie no 1\", \"replay\", etc.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow index 0: tie no 1\n...\nRow index 4: tie no 2 (since row 3 is replay for tie 1)\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the rows with their indexes and tie numbers.\n\nLet me count each row:\n\nRow 0: tie 1\nRow 1: replay of tie 1\nRow 2: tie 2\nRow 3: tie 3\nRow 4: tie 4\nRow 5: replay of tie 4\nRow 6: tie 5\nRow 7: tie 6\nRow 8: tie 7\nRow 9: replay of tie 7\nRow 10: tie 8\nRow 11: tie 9\nRow 12: tie 10\nRow 13: tie 11\nRow 14: tie 12\nRow 15: tie 13\nRow 16: replay of tie 13\nRow 17: tie 14\nRow 18: tie 15\nRow 19: replay of tie 15 (Leeds vs Arsenal)\nRow 20: replay of tie 15 again\nRow 21: replay of tie 15 again?\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rows with their indexes:\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nRow 0: tie no=1\nRow 1: replay (tie no=1)\nRow 2: tie no=2\nRow 3: tie no=3\nRow 4: tie no=4\nRow 5: replay of tie 4\nRow 6: tie no=5, home team=woking? Wait, let me look.\n\nWait, the table shows:\n\nRow 6 is \"woking\" as away team?\n\nLooking at row index 6 (the fifth row in markdown):\n\n| 5         | woking                  | 0 - 1    | everton                 | 27 / 01 / 1991 |\n\nWait, no. The tie no=5 is row index 6: \"woking\" as away team? Let me check:\n\nRow index 6: tie no=5, home team=woking? Or wait, the columns are:\n\ntie no | home team | score | away team | date\n\nSo for tie no=5 (row index 6), the home team is woking and away is everton.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before the away team be woking.\" Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nThe row with tie no=5 has:\n\ntie_no: 5\nhome_team: woking? Or wait, looking at the data:\n\nIn the provided table, the fifth row (index 4) is tie no=2, but the sixth row (index 5) is a replay. Wait, perhaps I'm not indexing correctly.\n\nWait, let me count from the start:\n\nRow 0: tie_no=1\nRow 1: replay of tie 1\nRow 2: tie_no=2\nRow 3: tie_no=3\nRow 4: tie_no=4\nRow 5: replay of tie 4\nRow 6: tie_no=5\n\nSo, row index 6 is tie no=5.\n\nLooking at that row:\n\ntie_no:5\nhome_team: woking? Or wait, the home team is \"woking\"? Let me check the actual data.\n\nWait, in the table, the fifth tie (row index 6) has:\n\n\"5         | woking                  | 0 - 1    | everton                 | 27 / 01 / 1991\"\n\nSo home team is \"woking,\" and away team is \"everton.\"\n\nWait, but the claim says \"before the away team be woking.\" So perhaps it's looking for a tie where the away team is Woking.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\ntie no=5 has away team everton. Is there any row where the away team is Woking?\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: away team middlesbrough\nRow1: replay, away team middlesbrough (same as tie 1)\nRow2: away team middlesbrough? Wait no, let me see.\n\nWait, no. Let's look at all the away teams:\n\ntie_no=1: away team middlesbrough?\nNo, looking at row 0: tie no=1, home team middlesbrough, away team?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each row's away team.\n\nRow index 0: away_team=middlesbrough\nRow1: replay of tie 1, away_team=middlesbrough\nRow2: tie_no=2, away_team=?\nLooking at the data:\n\nThe rows are:\n\nRow0: |1         | middlesbrough           | 4 - 3    | manchester city          | 26 / 01 / 1991 |\nSo away team is manchester city.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each row correctly:\n\nRow index 0: tie_no=1, home_team=middlesbrough, away_team=manchester city\nRow1: replay of tie no=1, same teams?\nYes, away_team=manchester city\n\nRow2: tie_no=2, home_team=nottingham forest, away_team=ipswich town\n\nRow3: tie_no=3, home_team=oxford united, away_team=sheffield wednesday\n\nRow4: tie_no=4, home_team=coventry city, away_team=portsmouth\n\nRow5: replay of tie 4, same teams: portsmouth as away.\n\nRow6: tie_no=5, home_team=woking, away_team=everton\n\nAh, here's the row where away team is everton, not woking. So in tie no=5, the away team is everton, and the home team is woking.\n\nSo, looking for a row where the away team is \"woking,\" I don't see any such entry.\n\nThus, the claim says that tie number 5 is before the away team is Woking, but since there's no tie where the away team is Woking, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that tie number 5 comes before a match where the away team is Woking. However, in the table, tie number 5 has Woking as the home team against Everton. There are no entries where Woking is the away team.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"tie_no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"away_team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
