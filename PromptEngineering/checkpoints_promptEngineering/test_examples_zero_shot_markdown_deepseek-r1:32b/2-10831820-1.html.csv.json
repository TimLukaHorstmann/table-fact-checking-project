    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"zo\u00eb wanamaker play the character ariadne oliver\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: actor, character, title/rank, series, and years. The rows list different actors along with their respective characters, titles/ranks, which series they appeared in, and the years associated with each role.\n\nThe claim is about Zo\u00eb Wanamaker playing the character Ariadne Oliver. So, I'll check if there's a row where the actor is Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and the corresponding character is Ariadne Oliver.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that the last two rows involve actors who appeared in series 10-13 from 2006 to 2013. Specifically:\n\nRow 4: Zo\u00eb Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver\nRow 5: David Yelland as George\n\nSo, row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0) corresponds to Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and the character Ariadne Oliver.\n\nI'll verify if all parts of the claim match this entry. The actor's name is correctly spelled as \"zo\u00eb wanamaker\" in lowercase in the table but the claim uses proper capitalization, which shouldn't be an issue. The character's name is exactly \"ariadne oliver,\" matching the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_actors\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the actor of the character ariadne oliver be hugh fraser.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It's saying that Hugh Fraser is the actor who plays the character Ariadne Oliver in some series.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows corresponding to different actors and their roles. The columns include 'actor', 'character', 'title / rank', 'series', and 'years'. \n\nI'll search for the character 'ariadne oliver' in the table. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: David Suchet plays Hercule Poirot.\n- Row 1: Hugh Fraser as Arthur Hastings.\n- Row 2: Philip Jackson as James Japp.\n- Row 3: Pauline Moran as Felicity Lemon.\n- Row 4: Zo\u00eb Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver.\n- Row 5: David Yelland as George.\n\nFrom this, I see that the character Ariadne Oliver is played by Zo\u00eb Wanamaker in rows 10 to 13 from 2006 to 2013. Hugh Fraser, on the other hand, plays Arthur Hastings and is listed in row indices 1 and 4. \n\nThe claim incorrectly attributes Ariadne Oliver's role to Hugh Fraser instead of Zo\u00eb Wanamaker. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nRelevant cells for verification are where the character 'ariadne oliver' is mentioned (row 4) and any rows involving Hugh Fraser (rows 1 and 4). Each row's relevant columns are 'actor' and 'character'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"character\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"actor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"character\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
