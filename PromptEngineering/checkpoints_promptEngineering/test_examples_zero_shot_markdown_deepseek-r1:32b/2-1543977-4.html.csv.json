    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1999\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is saying. The claim mentions two runners-up: Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin. It says they were the runner-ups behind Tiger Woods in 1999. So, I'm looking for information about the year 1999, the team or individual, and specifically who was the runner-up.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different year, so I'll start by finding the row where the year is 1999. Scanning down the \"year\" column, I see that the first row has the year 1999.\n\nIn that row, let's look at the relevant columns. The claim mentions Tiger Woods being involved, so checking the \"team\" and \"individual\" columns for this row. The \"team\" is listed as Mark O'Meara & Tiger Woods, and the \"individual\" is Tiger Woods. So, Tiger Woods was indeed part of that team and was the individual in 1999.\n\nNow, the claim states that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were the runners-up behind him. To verify this, I'll check the \"runners-up\" column for the 1999 row. The entry there is \"santiago luna & miguel angel martin.\" That matches exactly with what the claim is saying.\n\nSo, putting it all together: in 1999, Tiger Woods was part of the team and was the individual winner. Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were listed as runners-up in that same row. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here. Both parts of the claim\u2014the year, the individuals involved, and their roles\u2014are correctly represented in the table. So, I can confidently say the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have only win 1 year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that Tiger Woods has only won one year according to the data in the table. My job is to check if this statement holds true or not.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists information about various years from 1993 to 1999. Each row includes details like country, team, individual winner, location, and runners-up. The key columns here are \"year\" and \"individual\", as they directly relate to who won each year.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to identify instances where Tiger Woods is listed as the individual winner.\n\n1. **Row 0 (1999):** The individual column shows \"tiger woods\". So, in 1999, Tiger Woods won.\n2. **Row 1 (1998):** The individual winner is Scott Verplank. Not Tiger Woods.\n3. **Row 2 (1997):** The individual winner is Colin Montgomerie. Again, not Tiger Woods.\n4. **Row 3 (1996):** The individual winner is Ernie Els. Not relevant to the claim.\n5. **Row 4 (1995):** The individual is Davis Love III. Not Tiger Woods.\n6. **Row 5 (1994):** Fred Couples won here, so no match for Tiger Woods.\n7. **Row 6 (1993):** Bernhard Langer is the winner. Not relevant.\n\nAfter reviewing all rows, I notice that Tiger Woods only appears once as the individual winner in the year 1999. There are no other instances of him winning in any other years listed in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"tiger wood have only win 1 year\" is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cell that verifies this is from row index 0 under the \"individual\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the tournament was first held in cape town in 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The event (tournament) was held.\n2. It was the first time it was held there.\n3. The location was Cape Town.\n4. The year was 1996.\n\nLooking at the table, I should check which rows have 'cape town' as the location and see if that corresponds to 1996.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (1999)**: Location is Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 1 (1998)**: Location is Auckland, New Zealand. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 2 (1997)**: Location is Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 3 (1996)**: Location is Cape Town, South Africa. This matches the location in the claim.\n- **Row 4 (1995)**: Location is Shenzhen, China. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 5 (1994)**: Location is Dorado, Puerto Rico. Not Cape Town.\n- **Row 6 (1993)**: Location is Orlando, Florida, USA. Not Cape Town.\n\nSo, the only occurrence of Cape Town as a location is in 1996. Since this is the first time it's listed as a location in the table and it's the only entry for Cape Town, the claim that the tournament was first held there in 1996 appears to be correct based on the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"santiago luna miguel angel martin be the runner up behind tiger wood in 1997\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin as the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1997.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to find information about 1997. The table is structured with columns: year, country, team, individual, location, runners-up.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 1999: Runners-up are Santiago Luna & Miguel Angel Martin, and the individual winner is Tiger Woods.\n- 1998: Different runners-up.\n- 1997: This row mentions \"runners - up\" as Colin Montgomerie & Raymond Russell. The team was Padraig Harrington & Paul McGinley, with Colin Montgomerie as the individual.\n\nWait a minute, so in 1997, the runners-up were Colin Montgomerie and Raymond Russell, not Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin. Those two were actually the runners-up in 1999 when Tiger Woods won.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that Santiago Luna and Miguel Angel Martin were the runners-up behind Tiger Woods in 1997, but according to the table, they were the runners-up in 1999. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are from row index 0 (1999) for \"runners - up\" and individual as Tiger Woods, and row index 2 (1997) showing different runners-up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runners - up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"tiger wood have win several year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the table and the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it has columns: year, country, team, individual, location, runners-up. The rows represent data from 1993 to 1999.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tiger wood\" (I assume that's Tiger Woods) winning several years. So I need to check how many times Tiger Woods appears as a winner in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- 1999: The team column lists \"mark o' meara & tiger woods\". The individual winner is \"tiger woods\".\n- Other years:\n  - 1998: Individual winner is Scott Verplank.\n  - 1997: Individual winner is Colin Montgomerie.\n  - 1996: Individual winner is Ernie Els.\n  - 1995: Individual winner is Davis Love III.\n  - 1994: Individual winner is Fred Couples.\n  - 1993: Individual winner is Bernhard Langer.\n\nSo Tiger Woods only appears as the individual winner in the year 1999. That's just one win, not several. The claim says \"several years,\" which implies more than two or three wins. Since there's only one instance, the claim isn't supported by the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Tiger Woods won in several years, but according to the table, he only won once in 1999 as the individual winner. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"individual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the tournament be first hold in cape town in 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998. So, I need to check two things: whether there's an entry for Cape Town and if that year is 1998.\n\nLooking at the table, the 'location' column lists where each tournament took place. Scanning through each row:\n\n- 1999: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n- 1998: Auckland, New Zealand\n- 1997: Kiawah Island, South Carolina, USA\n- 1996: Cape Town, South Africa\n- 1995: Shenzhen, China\n- 1994: Dorado, Puerto Rico\n- 1993: Orlando, Florida, USA\n\nFrom this, I notice that Cape Town appears in the location column for the year 1996. The claim says it was first held there in 1998, which doesn't match. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Cape Town's tournament occurred two years earlier than claimed.\n\nAdditionally, to confirm if it was the first time, I check previous entries before 1996. Since all earlier locations are different and don't include Cape Town, the entry in 1996 is indeed the first occurrence of Cape Town as a location.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim incorrectly states both the year and the fact that it was first held there. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim says the tournament was first held in Cape Town in 1998, but according to the table, Cape Town's event occurred in 1996.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
