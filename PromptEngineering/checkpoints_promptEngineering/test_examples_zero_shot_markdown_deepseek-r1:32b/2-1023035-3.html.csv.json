    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"steve sumner score only 1 less goal than shane smelz for the new zealand national football team.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and find the rows corresponding to Steve Sumner and Shane Smeltz.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For Steve Sumner, his goals are listed as 22.\n- For Shane Smeltz, the goals are 23.\n\nThe claim states that Steve scored only one less goal than Shane. So if Shane has 23, then subtracting one would give us 22, which matches Steve's total. That makes the claim correct in terms of the numbers provided.\n\nI should also check if both players are indeed part of the New Zealand national team. The table doesn't specify each player's country, but since the question mentions \"New Zealand,\" I assume all listed players are from there. Alternatively, looking at first caps and recent caps might help verify their teams. For example, Steve Sumner's first cap is against Burma in 1976, which suggests he was playing for New Zealand.\n\nSo both Steve Sumner (22 goals) and Shane Smeltz (23 goals) are from the same team, and the difference is exactly one goal. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Steve Sumner scored 22 goals and Shane Smeltz scored 23, a difference of one.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"vaughan coveny be the record holder for the most goal and the most cap from the new zealand national football team, while shane smeltz be second.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It's making two points:\n\n1. Vaughan Coveny holds both the records for the most goals and the most caps.\n2. Shane Smeltz is second in both these categories.\n\nI'll need to check each of these points against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns for \"goals\" and \"caps.\" Each row represents a player with their respective stats.\n\nLet's start by examining the goals column. The numbers listed are:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny: 28\n- Shane Smeltz: 23\n- Steve Sumner: 22\n- Brian Turner: 21\n\nSo, Vaughan has 28 goals, which is more than any other player listed here. Shane comes in second with 23. So the claim holds for goals.\n\nNext, looking at the caps column:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny: 64\n- Steve Sumner: 58\n- Brian Turner: 59 (Wait, that's actually higher than Vaughan? Let me double-check.)\n\nOh wait, Brian Turner has 59 caps. So Vaughan's 64 is more than Brian's 59. Then Shane Smeltz has 49 caps.\n\nSo, Vaughan leads in both goals and caps. The next highest after Vaughan for caps would be Steve Sumner with 58 or Brian Turner with 59. Wait, but the claim says Shane is second. So that might not hold because Brian has more caps than Shane.\n\nWait, no\u2014Shane Smeltz's caps are listed as 49. Let me see all the cap numbers again:\n\n1. Vaughan Coveny: 64\n2. Steve Sumner: 58\n3. Brian Turner: 59\n4. Grant Turner: 42\n5. Others have lower than that.\n\nSo actually, after Vaughan with 64 caps, the next highest is Brian Turner with 59, then Steve Sumner with 58. So Shane Smeltz is not second in caps; he's fifth or so.\n\nWait no, let me list all the cap counts:\n\n- Vaughan:64\n- Steve Sumner:58\n- Brian Turner:59\n- Jock Newall:10\n- Keith Nelson:20\n- Chris Killen:48\n- Grant Turner:42\n- Darren McClennan:43\n- Michael McGarry:54\n- Wynton Rufer:23\n- Steve Wooddin:24\n- Roy Coxon:8\n- Chris Jackson:60\n- Dave Taylor:47\n- Colin Walker:15\n- Chris Wood:31\n\nWait, so looking at the caps:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny: 64 (highest)\n- Chris Jackson:60 (second highest)\n- Steve Sumner:58\n- Brian Turner:59 (higher than Steve)\n- Michael McGarry:54\n- Grant Turner:42\n- Darren McClennan:43\n- Keith Nelson:20\n- Chris Killen:48\n\nSo actually, the order from highest to lowest is:\n\n1. Vaughan Coveny - 64\n2. Chris Jackson - 60\n3. Brian Turner -59\n4. Steve Sumner -58\n5. Michael McGarry -54\n6. Darren McClennan -43\n7. Grant Turner -42\n8. Keith Nelson -20\n9. Jock Newall -10\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the table, each player has their own cap count. Let me sort them correctly:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny: 64\n- Chris Jackson:60\n- Brian Turner:59\n- Steve Sumner:58\n- Michael McGarry:54\n- Darren McClennan:43\n- Grant Turner:42\n- Keith Nelson:20\n- Jock Newall:10\n\nWait, that can't be right because Vaughan is 64, Chris Jackson is second with 60, Brian Turner is third with 59, Steve Sumner fourth with 58, Michael McGarry fifth with 54. So Shane Smeltz has only 49 caps, which would put him much lower down the list.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table:\n\nShane Smeltz's row: \"shane smeltz\" is in row index 1 (assuming rows are zero-based). His cap count is 49. So in the list of all players, his caps are only 49, which is less than several others.\n\nSo according to the table:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny:64\n- Chris Jackson:60\n- Brian Turner:59\n- Steve Sumner:58\n- Michael McGarry:54\n- Darren McClennan:43\n- Grant Turner:42\n- Keith Nelson:20\n- Jock Newall:10\n\nSo Shane Smeltz is not second in caps; he's way below. Therefore, the claim that Shane is second in both goals and caps isn't accurate for caps.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\nIn the table, the cap counts are as follows:\n\nRow 0: Vaughan Coveny -64\nRow1: Shane Smeltz-49\nRow2: Steve Sumner-58\nRow3: Brian Turner-59\nRow4: Jock Newall-10\nRow5: Keith Nelson-20\nRow6: Chris Killen-48\nRow7: Grant Turner-42\nRow8: Darren McClennan-43\nRow9: Michael McGarry-54\nRow10: Wynton Rufer-23\nRow11: Steve Wooddin-24\nRow12: Roy Coxon-8\nRow13: Chris Jackson-60\nRow14: Dave Taylor-47\nRow15: Colin Walker-15\nRow16: Chris Wood-31\n\nSo the correct order of caps is:\n\n1. Vaughan Coveny -64\n2. Chris Jackson -60\n3. Brian Turner -59\n4. Steve Sumner -58\n5. Michael McGarry -54\n6. Darren McClennan -43\n7. Grant Turner -42\n8. Keith Nelson -20\n9. Jock Newall -10\n10. Wynton Rufer -23\n11. Steve Wooddin -24\n12. Dave Taylor -47\n13. Chris Killen -48\n14. Colin Walker -15\n15. Roy Coxon -8\n16. Chris Wood -31\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the order because some of these are higher than others. Let me list all cap numbers:\n\nRow0:64 (Vaughan)\nRow1:49 (Shane)\nRow2:58 (Steve Sumner)\nRow3:59 (Brian Turner)\nRow4:10 (Jock Newall)\nRow5:20 (Keith Nelson)\nRow6:48 (Chris Killen)\nRow7:42 (Grant Turner)\nRow8:43 (Darren McClennan)\nRow9:54 (Michael McGarry)\nRow10:23 (Wynton Rufer)\nRow11:24 (Steve Wooddin)\nRow12:8 (Roy Coxon)\nRow13:60 (Chris Jackson)\nRow14:47 (Dave Taylor)\nRow15:15 (Colin Walker)\nRow16:31 (Chris Wood)\n\nSo the correct order from highest to lowest is:\n\n1. Vaughan Coveny - 64\n2. Chris Jackson -60\n3. Brian Turner -59\n4. Steve Sumner -58\n5. Michael McGarry -54\n6. Darren McClennan -43\n7. Grant Turner -42\n8. Keith Nelson -20\n9. Jock Newall -10\n10. Wynton Rufer -23 (Wait, 23 is higher than some above? No, because after row9:54, row10 is 23 which is less than 54)\nWait no, I think the correct way is to sort all cap counts:\n\n64,60,59,58,54,47,43,42,48,31,24,23,20,15,10,8\n\nSo sorted descendingly:\n\n64 (Vaughan)\n60 (Chris Jackson)\n59 (Brian Turner)\n58 (Steve Sumner)\n54 (Michael McGarry)\n48 (Chris Killen)\n47 (Dave Taylor)\n43 (Darren McClennan)\n42 (Grant Turner)\n31 (Chris Wood)\n24 (Steve Wooddin)\n23 (Wynton Rufer)\n20 (Keith Nelson)\n15 (Colin Walker)\n10 (Jock Newall)\n8 (Roy Coxon)\n\nWait, but in this sorted list, Chris Killen is 48, which is higher than Dave Taylor's 47. So:\n\n64,60,59,58,54,48,47,43,42,31,24,23,20,15,10,8.\n\nSo in this list, Shane Smeltz is at 49 caps. Wait, but looking back, row1: Shane Smeltz has 49 caps. But in the sorted list above, after 54 comes 48, then 47, etc. So 49 isn't listed because I didn't include it. Let me correct that:\n\nIncluding Shane's 49, which is between 54 and 48.\n\nSo sorted correctly:\n\n64,60,59,58,54,49 (Shane),48,47,43,42,31,24,23,20,15,10,8.\n\nTherefore, Shane Smeltz is sixth in caps with 49. So he's not second; he's sixth.\n\nSo the claim that Shane is second in both goals and caps isn't accurate for caps\u2014he's actually sixth in caps.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original claim: the user said \"You are tasked to...\", but I'm supposed to figure out if Shane Smeltz is second in goals and caps. From the table, Shane has 49 caps and someone else (Chris Jackson) has 60, Brian Turner 59, etc.\n\nSo in terms of goals, the user didn't provide that data, so perhaps it's assumed or given elsewhere. But according to the cap counts here, Shane isn't second; he's sixth.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect regarding caps.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake because sometimes players can have more appearances through different sources, but in this specific table, Shane Smeltz has 49 caps, which makes him sixth.\n\nSo the correct answer would be that the claim is false because Shane isn't second in both; he's only second in goals perhaps, but not in caps.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Shane Smeltz is second in both goals and caps is incorrect. According to the provided data:\n\n- **Goals**: The information about goals isn't specified here, so we can't confirm his ranking in goals.\n- **Caps**: Shane Smeltz has 49 caps, which places him sixth overall.\n\nTherefore, while he may be second in goals (if that's accurate based on other data), he is not second in caps. \n\nAnswer: The claim is false. Shane Smeltz is not second in both goals and caps; he is sixth in caps.",

The claim states: \"chris wood, chris killen, and shane smelz be the only current new zealand national football team player who be also in the top 20 of highest goal score for the team.\"\n\nFirst, I should parse the claim correctly. It mentions three players: Chris Wood, Chris Killen, and Shane Smeltz. The claim asserts that these are the only current New Zealand national team players who are also in the top 20 goal scorers.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check each of these players' data.\n\n1. **Chris Wood**: His career is listed as 2009 onwards. He has 10 goals and 31 caps. The \"most recent cap\" is September 5, 2013. However, since his career is ongoing (as indicated by the dash \"-\"), he could still be active. But I need to check if he's currently playing.\n\nWait, but in 2013, the most recent cap for Chris Killen was September 5, 2013. That might be relevant.\n\n2. **Chris Killen**: His career is from 2000 onwards with 16 goals and 48 caps. The most recent cap was September 5, 2013. So he hasn't played since then; thus, he's likely not a current player anymore.\n\n3. **Shane Smeltz**: His career started in 2003, but it's ongoing as indicated by the dash. He has 23 goals and 49 caps. The most recent cap was March 21, 2013. That's more than a decade ago, so he might not be active anymore.\n\nNow, checking if they are currently playing: If \"current\" implies still actively playing for the team as of now (assuming the current year is around 2023), then looking at their most recent caps:\n\n- Chris Wood's last cap was September 5, 2013.\n- Chris Killen's last cap was also September 5, 2013.\n- Shane Smeltz's last cap was March 21, 2013.\n\nAll three haven't played in the last 10 years, so they're not current players anymore. Therefore, the claim that these are the only current players is incorrect because none of them are active now.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other players who have high goals:\n\n- Vaughan Coveny has 28 goals.\n- Steve Sumner: 22\n- Brian Turner: 21\n- Others have fewer than 20. So the top goal scorers would be in the range of those with higher goals.\n\nBut the main issue is that all three mentioned are not current players, so the claim's assertion about them being the only current players in the top 20 is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Shane Smeltz is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"If Shane Smelz scored 5 more goals throughout his time with the New Zealand national football team, he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\" \n\nSo, the key points here are:\n1. Shane Smeltz's current number of goals.\n2. The number of goals of the current top scorer(s) in the table.\n\nIf adding 5 to Shane's goals makes him surpass or equal the highest scorer, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find Shane Smeltz's goal count and then check who has the most goals. \n\nFrom the table:\n- Shane Smeltz has 23 goals (row index 1).\n- The other players have varying numbers of goals: Vaughan Coveny with 28, Steve Sumner with 22, Brian Turner with 21, etc.\n\nWait, Vaughan Coveny is at 28 goals. If Shane Smeltz has 23 and he scores 5 more, that would bring him to 28 as well. So, he would tie with Vaughan Coveny. \n\nThe claim says he would be the \"highest scoring athlete,\" which implies being first. But if he only reaches 28, same as Vaughan, then he isn't higher than him. Therefore, he wouldn't surpass Vaughan; they'd be equal.\n\nBut maybe I should check all the goal counts to make sure there's no one else with more than 23 but less than or equal to 28 who could potentially be in between.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Vaughan Coveny: 28\n- Shane Smeltz: 23 (plus 5 would be 28)\n- Steve Sumner: 22\n- Brian Turner: 21\n- The rest have fewer goals, like 17, 16, etc.\n\nSo the next highest after Vaughan is Steve Sumner with 22. Shane's 23 plus 5 is 28, which equals Vaughan's current total. Therefore, Shane would be tied for first, not surpassing him as the highest scorer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if there are any other players with more goals than 23? Let me check again:\n\nVaughan has 28, Shane is at 23. No one else between them except Steve Sumner at 22, so no one in between. So adding 5 to Shane's goals would make him equal to Vaughan but not higher.\n\nSo the claim says he will be the highest scorer. But if they're tied, it depends on how the ranking is done. Some systems might list them as joint first, others might consider the earlier player or something else. However, in this context, without more info, I think the claim implies that Shane would surpass Vaughan and become the sole highest scorer.\n\nTherefore, since he only reaches 28 and ties with Vaughan, the claim is not true because he doesn't exceed Vaughan's total; he just matches it. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm considering all relevant cells in the table:\n\n- Shane Smeltz's goals: row index 1, column \"goals\".\n- Vaughan Coveny's goals: row index 0, column \"goals\".\n\nThese are the two main points of comparison. The rest might not be necessary because their goal counts don't interfere with this specific comparison.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE because Shane Smeltz would tie with Vaughan Coveny but not surpass him.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that Shane Smeltz needs to reach a higher goal count than the current top scorer. Currently, Shane has 23 goals (row index 1), and adding 5 makes it 28. Vaughan Coveny is already at 28 (row index 0). Since they would tie, Shane doesn't surpass him.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim about Vaughn Coveney is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Vaughn Coveney have a cap during his second year and during his third year of the team, overall he have 19 cap throughout his year with the team.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. Vaughn had a cap in his second year.\n2. He also had a cap in his third year.\n3. The total number of caps he accumulated over all his years with the team was 19.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I'll check the relevant information for Vaughn Coveney. From the first row:\n\n- Career: 1992 - 2006\n- Goals: 28\n- Caps: 64\n- First cap: July 7, 1992\n- Most recent cap: June 4, 2006\n\nSo his career spanned from 1992 to 2006. That's a total of 15 years.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Caps in the second and third year:**\n   - His first cap was in 1992 (his first year). So his second year would be 1993, and the third year would be 1994.\n   - The table doesn't provide information about specific years beyond the start and end dates. It only gives the total number of caps throughout his career.\n\n2. **Total caps:**\n   - According to the table, he has 64 caps in total.\n\nSo evaluating each part:\n\n- The claim says he had a cap in his second year (1993) and third year (1994). Since we don't have data on individual years, only the total, we can't confirm whether he had caps in those specific years. However, since he played until 2006, it's likely he did play in subsequent years.\n\n- The claim states he had a total of 19 caps. But according to the table, his total is 64, which is significantly higher than 19.\n\nTherefore, while we can't confirm the specifics about his second and third year based on the given data, the total number of caps is definitely incorrect. Hence, the claim isn't fully supported by the information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the total number of caps for Vaughn Coveney is 64, not 19.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"caps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, my first step is to locate their respective rows in the table.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Steve Sumner's row is the third one (row index 2).\n- Shane Smeltz's row is the second one (row index 1).\n\nNext, I need to check their goal counts. The 'goals' column shows how many goals each player has scored.\n\nFor Steve Sumner: The goals are listed as 22.\nFor Shane Smeltz: The goals are listed as 23.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference in their goal counts. Shane Smeltz has 23 goals, and Steve Sumner has 22 goals. So, 23 - 22 equals 1. That means Steve Sumner scored 1 less goal than Shane Smeltz, not 2 as claimed.\n\nSince the claim states that Steve scored 2 less goals, but according to the table, it's only a difference of 1, the claim is incorrect.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. However, since the 'goals' column directly provides their respective scores, no further data is needed. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Steve Sumner scored 2 less goals than Shane Smeltz, but according to the table, Steve has 22 and Shane has 23, making a difference of only 1 goal.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim about Chris Wood is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"if chris wood score 5 more goal throughout his time with the new zealand national football team, he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find Chris Wood's row. Scanning down, I see that Chris Wood is listed in the last row of the table. His details are as follows: career from 2009 onwards, 10 goals, 31 caps, first cap on June 3, 2009, and most recent cap on September 5, 2013.\n\nNow, the claim is about adding 5 more goals to Chris Wood's current total. So if he has 10 goals now, adding 5 would give him 15 goals. \n\nNext, I need to check who currently has the highest number of goals in the table. Let me go through each row and note down the 'goals' column.\n\nLooking at each player:\n- Vaughan Coveny: 28 goals\n- Shane Smeltz: 23 goals\n- Steve Sumner: 22 goals\n- Brian Turner: 21 goals\n- Jock Newall: 17 goals\n- Keith Nelson: 16 goals\n- Chris Killen: 16 goals\n- Grant Turner: 15 goals\n- Darren McClennan: 12 goals\n- Michael McGarry: 12 goals\n- Wynton Rufer: 12 goals\n- Steve Wooddin: 11 goals\n- Roy Coxon: 10 goals\n- Chris Jackson: 10 goals\n- Dave Taylor: 10 goals\n- Colin Walker: 10 goals\n\nSo, the highest scorer currently is Vaughan Coveny with 28 goals. Shane Smeltz has 23, Steve Sumner 22, Brian Turner 21, Jock Newall 17, Keith Nelson and Chris Killen both have 16, Grant Turner has 15.\n\nIf Chris Wood's current total is 10 and he scores 5 more, that brings him to 15 goals. Comparing this to the others, Grant Turner already has 15 goals. So after adding 5, Chris would tie with Grant Turner at 15 each.\n\nBut wait, does the claim specify being the highest scorer? If someone else also has 15, then Chris wouldn't be the sole highest. However, maybe in this context, it's about surpassing the next highest below him. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no: Vaughan Coveny is at 28, which is way higher than anyone else. So even if Chris Wood adds 5 goals to reach 15, that's still much lower than 28. Therefore, he wouldn't be the highest scorer; Vaughan remains on top.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nWait, no, Vaughan Coveny has 28, which is higher than Chris Wood after adding 5 (which would make him 15). So even with the additional goals, Chris's total of 15 is still less than 28.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he would be the highest scorer is false because there are players (Vaughan Coveny) who have more goals than his projected total.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. Adding 5 goals to Chris Wood's current 10 makes him 15, but Vaughan Coveny has 28 goals, which remains higher.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"grant turner, colin walker, and steve sumner be the only current New Zealand national football team player who be also in the top 20 of highest goal scorer for the team.\"\n\nWait, that wording seems a bit off. Maybe it's a translation issue or a typo. I think they mean these three are the only current players on the team who are among the top 20 goal scorers.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a player with details like name, career years, goals, caps, first cap date, and most recent cap date.\n\nI need to check two things:\n\n1. Are grant turner, colin walker, and steve sumner currently on the team?\n2. Do they rank in the top 20 goal scorers?\n\nWait, but looking at the table, it's just a list of players with their stats. I don't see any indication of who is currently active or part of the national team now.\n\nEach player has \"career\" years. For example:\n- Grant Turner: 1980 - 1988\n- Colin Walker: 1984 - 1988\n- Steve Sumner: 1976 - 1988\n\nThese careers ended in the late 80s, so they were active decades ago. The most recent caps are from the 80s as well.\n\nLooking at current players, we might need to consider who is still playing for New Zealand now. For example, Chris Wood has a career listed as 2009 - present (since his \"career\" field ends with \"-\"). His most recent cap was in 2013, but that's not too recent either\u2014current players would have more recent caps.\n\nWait, the claim says they are current players. But according to the table, all these three players have careers ending before 1988 or earlier. So they can't be current players anymore because their last caps were in the 80s.\n\nAdditionally, looking at goals: Steve Sumner has 22 goals, Grant Turner has 15, and Colin Walker has 10. These are pretty high numbers. But without knowing who is currently on the team, it's hard to say if these three are the only ones in the top 20.\n\nBut from the table, all the players listed have careers ending by at least 1988 except for a few like Shane Smeltz and Chris Killen, whose careers go up to more recent years (like Smeltz's most recent cap was in 2013). But even then, that's still not current as of today.\n\nSo if the claim is about them being current players, that's false because their last caps were decades ago. Therefore, they can't be current players anymore.\n\nAlso, considering other players in the table: Chris Killen has 16 goals and his most recent cap was in 2013, which might make him a more recent player than the three mentioned. But again, it's not clear if he is still active now.\n\nGiven that, I think the claim is false because Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner are not currently playing for New Zealand; their careers ended in the 80s.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Grant Turner, Colin Walker, and Steve Sumner are the only current players on the New Zealand national football team who are also among the top 20 goal scorers. However, examining the table reveals that all three have career years ending by 1988, with their most recent caps in the same decade. This indicates they are not currently active players. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Current Players:** The claim refers to current players, but the table shows all three mentioned players (Grant Turner, Colin Walker, Steve Sumner) had careers ending in 1988. Their last caps were in that decade, meaning they are no longer active.\n\n2. **Check Goal Scores:** They have high goal counts (Sumner: 22, Grant Turner: 15, Walker: 10), placing them in the top ranks, but this doesn't affect their current status.\n\n3. **Evaluate Claim Validity:** Since none of them are currently playing for New Zealand, they cannot be the only current players in the top 20 goal scorers. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"career\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"career\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim about Chris Wood and Dave Taylor is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states two main points:\n1. Chris Wood holds both the record for the most goals and the most caps.\n2. Dave Taylor is second in both these categories.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each player's goals and caps to verify these statements.\n\nStarting with Chris Wood: Checking his row, he has 10 goals and 31 caps. Now, I need to see if this is the highest among all players.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- Vaughan Coveny has 28 goals (highest) and 64 caps.\n- Shane Smeltz has 23 goals and 49 caps.\n- Steve Sumner has 22 goals and 58 caps.\n- Brian Turner has 21 goals and 59 caps.\n- Jock Newall has 17 goals and 10 caps.\n- Keith Nelson has 16 goals and 20 caps.\n- Chris Killen has 16 goals and 48 caps.\n- Grant Turner has 15 goals and 42 caps.\n- Darren McClennan, Michael McGarry, Wynton Rufer each have 12 goals with varying caps.\n- Steve Wooddin has 11 goals.\n- Roy Coxon, Chris Jackson, Dave Taylor all have 10 goals. Wait, but the claim is about Chris Wood and Dave Taylor.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the goals column:\n\nChris Wood: 10 goals\nDave Taylor: 10 goals\n\nSo both have 10 goals each? That would mean they are tied for that position, not one being first and the other second. But Vaughan Coveny has 28 goals, which is clearly more than either of them.\n\nLooking at caps:\n\nChris Wood has 31 caps.\nDave Taylor has 47 caps.\n\nNow, checking the caps column:\n- Vaughan Coveny: 64\n- Shane Smeltz: 49\n- Steve Sumner: 58\n- Brian Turner: 59\n- Others have fewer.\n\nSo Chris Wood is at 31, which isn't near the top. Dave Taylor has 47, which is less than several others like Vaughan (64), Steve Sumner (58), Brian Turner (59). So neither of them holds the record for most caps.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. The claim says Chris Wood is the record holder, but according to the table, Vaughan Coveny has 64 caps and 28 goals, which are both higher than Chris Wood's numbers. Therefore, Chris Wood doesn't hold either of these records.\n\nFurthermore, Dave Taylor isn't second in either category because there are multiple players with more goals and caps than him.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect on both counts: neither Chris Wood nor Dave Taylor holds those positions as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Chris Wood does not have the most goals or caps. Vaughan Coveny has more goals (28) and caps (64), making the statement incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"caps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
