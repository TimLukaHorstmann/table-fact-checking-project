The task is to determine whether the claim \"only 3 of the new justice be appoint by sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to understand the data we're working with. The table lists several justices along with their ranks, years until mandatory retirement, who appointed them, and the year they were appointed.\n\nThe claim mentions that only three new justices were appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. To verify this, I need to look at the \"appointed by\" column and count how many entries have Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n as the appointing authority.\n\nLooking through each row:\n1.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n only appoint new justice during the year 2004\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. The table has several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. There are nine rows, each representing a different person with their respective details.\n\nThe claim states that Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n only made appointments in the year 2004. So I need to check if all her appointments were indeed in 2004 or if there are any other years involved.\n\nLooking at the 'appointed by' column, I see that some entries say \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n\" and others say \"luis fortu\u00f1o\". I should focus on the rows where \"appointed by\" is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n.\n\nNow, examining each row:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n2. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: also appointed by her in 2004.\n3. Liana Fiol Matta: same as above, 2004.\n\nWait, those are the only three entries where Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n is the appointing authority. So, according to this table, she made all her appointments in 2004. There's no entry where she appointed someone in a year other than 2004.\n\nTherefore, since all her appointments were indeed in 2004, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are those where \"appointed by\" is Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n and their respective \"year appointed\".

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"2/3 of the judges appointed have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that two-thirds of the judges appointed have more than 10 years remaining before they must retire. So, my goal is to verify this by examining the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. The key column for our claim is \"years until mandatory retirement\" because that's what we're comparing against the 10-year threshold.\n\nNext, I'll list out each judge's years until retirement to assess how many have more than 10 years left:\n\n1. Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez: 6 years\n2. Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: 11 years\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: 17 years\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: 0 years (he's already at mandatory retirement)\n5. Liana Fiol Matta: 2 years\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: 27 years\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: 13 years\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: 15 years\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: 19 years\n\nNow, I'll count how many of these have more than 10 years left:\n\n- Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: 11 (yes)\n- Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: 17 (yes)\n- Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: 27 (yes)\n- Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: 13 (yes)\n- Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: 15 (yes)\n- Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: 19 (yes)\n\nThat's a total of 6 judges with more than 10 years left.\n\nNext, I'll count the total number of judges. There are 9 entries in the table, so two-thirds of that would be approximately 6 (since 2/3 of 9 is exactly 6). \n\nSo, according to our count, exactly 6 out of 9 judges have more than 10 years until retirement. Therefore, this meets the claim's condition.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if any judge has exactly 10 years or not. In this case, none do; all either have less than 10 or more. So our initial count stands.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that \"appointed\" refers correctly to those who are currently holding the position and haven't retired yet. Since Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton has 0 years left, he's already mandatory retired, so we exclude him from the count of current judges. Wait, does this affect our calculation?\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake here. The claim is about \"the judge appoint have more than 10 year to go.\" So, it's about all appointed judges, including those who might already be retired? Or only current ones?\n\nLooking back at the table, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton has 0 years left, meaning he's either retired or about to retire. So if we consider all appointed judges regardless of their current status, then the total number is 9. But the claim says \"2/3 of the judge appoint have more than 10 year,\" which might be interpreted as among all appointed ones, two-thirds are still having over 10 years left. However, in reality, if someone has already retired (like Federico), they don't contribute to the current active judges.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: does the claim count only current judges or includes those who have already retired? The table doesn't specify whether they're still in office or not, but since it's about mandatory retirement, it's possible that some are still serving while others may have left. \n\nBut without explicit information on whether each judge is currently holding their position, we can assume the data represents all appointed judges regardless of current status. Therefore, even if someone has 0 years left (like Federico), they were appointed and thus included in the count.\n\nSo, total appointed judges: 9\n\nNumber with more than 10 years until retirement: Let's recount:\n\nAnabelle Rodr\u00edguez: 6 - no\nEdgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: 11 - yes\nErick Kolthoff Caraballo: 17 - yes\nFederico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton: 0 - no (but he was appointed, so count as a judge)\nLiana Fiol Matta: 2 - no\nLuis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: 27 - yes\nMildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: 13 - yes\nRafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: 15 - yes\nRoberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: 19 - yes\n\nWait, that's only 6 again. So 6 out of 9 have more than 10 years left.\n\nSo 6/9 is exactly two-thirds. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm the exact numbers:\n\nTotal rows: 9\n\nYears until retirement >10: \n\nEdgardo (2010) - 11\nErick (2009) -17\nLuis (2011)-27\nMildred (2009)-13\nRafael (2009)-15\nRoberto (2011)-19\n\nThat's six judges. So 6/9 is indeed two-thirds.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two-thirds of the appointed judges have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement. By examining each judge's remaining years, we found that exactly 6 out of 9 judges meet this condition, which is two-thirds.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"none of the judge last more than a year as chief justice\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that no judge served as chief justice for more than one year. So, I'm looking for any information in the table about how long each chief justice has held their position.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with different names and details. Each row includes the name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. The key here is to focus on the \"rank\" column because that tells us who is a chief justice versus an associate justice.\n\nI see that most of the entries have the rank as \"associate justice,\" but there's one entry with the rank \"chief justice.\" That person is Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, appointed in 2004 by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. The years until mandatory retirement for this position are listed as 0 years.\n\nNow, I need to interpret what the \"years until mandatory retirement\" means. If it's 0 years, does that mean they have already reached their mandatory retirement year? Or does it indicate something else? Typically, if someone is a chief justice and has 0 years left until retirement, it could mean that their term was up in that same year they were appointed.\n\nSo, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed as chief justice in 2004. If the table shows 0 years remaining until mandatory retirement, that suggests his term ended in 2004 itself. Therefore, he served less than a year as chief justice because he was appointed and then retired in the same year.\n\nSince there's only one chief justice listed, and he didn't serve more than a year, the claim holds true. There are no other chief justices in the table to consider. \n\nTo support this conclusion, the relevant cells would be the row where Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is listed as the chief justice, specifically looking at his \"rank\" and \"years until mandatory retirement.\" These details confirm that he didn't serve longer than a year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows only one person with the rank of chief justice, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton, who was appointed in 2004. The years until mandatory retirement for this position are listed as 0, indicating that his term ended in the same year he was appointed, meaning he did not serve more than a year.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The rows are indexed starting from 0, so Edgardo is row 1, Erick row 2, Luis Estrella row 5, Mildred row 6, Rafael row 7, and Roberto row 8.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 1, column \"appointed by\"\n- Row 2, column \"appointed by\"\n- Row 5, column \"appointed by\"\n- Row 6, column \"appointed by\"\n- Row 7, column \"appointed by\"\n- Row 8, column \"appointed by\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the chief justice be appoint in 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that the Chief Justice was appointed in the year 2011. My task is to check if this is accurate according to the data provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. I need to find the row where the rank is \"chief justice\" because that's what the claim is about.\n\nScanning through the names, I see Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton listed as the Chief Justice. The table shows that he was appointed in 2004 by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. So his appointment year isn't 2011\u2014it\u2019s earlier than that.\n\nNow, let me check if there's any other row where someone is a Chief Justice. Looking through all the rows, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is the only one with the rank \"chief justice.\" The rest are associate justices.\n\nSo the claim says the chief justice was appointed in 2011, but according to the table, he was appointed in 2004. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll also look at other appointments in 2011 just to make sure there isn't any confusion. The associate justices appointed in 2011 are Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez and Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n, but neither of them is a chief justice.\n\nThus, the relevant cell for this check is Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton's year appointed, which is 2004. Since that doesn't match the claim, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year appointed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"sila mar\u00eda calder\u00f3n appoint the chief justice\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the instructions carefully. They mention that I need to check each condition in the claim against the table and identify relevant cells. If the claim is fully supported by the data, I should return \"TRUE\"; otherwise, \"FALSE\". The answer needs to be a JSON object with two keys: \"answer\" and \"relevant_cells\", where the latter lists row indices and column names of the supporting evidence.\n\nLooking at the table, it has five columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. There are nine rows in total, each representing a justice or chief justice.\n\nThe claim is about whether Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n appointed the Chief Justice. So I need to find out two things from the table:\n1. Who was appointed as the Chief Justice?\n2. Who appointed them?\n\nI'll scan through the \"rank\" column to identify any entries with \"chief justice\". Scanning down, I see that Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is listed as the Chief Justice. His row is at index 3.\n\nNow, looking at the \"appointed by\" column for this row, it states Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n. So, according to the table, she did appoint the Chief Justice.\n\nTo confirm, let me check other rows to see if there are any other Chief Justices or conflicting information. The rest of the entries under \"rank\" are all associate justices except Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton. This confirms that he's the only Chief Justice in the list.\n\nAdditionally, I'll check the year appointed for consistency. It says 2004, which aligns with other appointments made by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n as seen in rows 0 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in row index 3 under columns \"name\", \"rank\", and \"appointed by\".\n\nI need to list the relevant cells. The key pieces of information are:\n- Name: Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton (row_index 3, column \"name\")\n- Rank: Chief Justice (row_index 3, column \"rank\")\n- Appointed by: Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n (row_index 3, column \"appointed by\")\n\nSo the relevant cells would include these three. But since the claim is about whether she appointed the chief justice, the essential columns are \"rank\" and \"appointed by\".\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table and what each column represents. The table has five columns: name, rank, years until mandatory retirement, appointed by, and year appointed. Each row corresponds to a judge with their respective details.\n\nThe claim in question is about whether one of the judges was appointed by \"luis fortu\u00f1o.\" So, I need to check the 'appointed by' column for each judge's entry to see if any have that name listed as their appointer.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row is Anabelle Rodr\u00edguez, appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n2. The second row is Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda, also appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2010. This matches the claim.\n3. Erick Kolthoff Caraballo was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n4. Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n5. Liana Fiol Matta was appointed by Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n in 2004.\n6. Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n7. Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n8. Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2009.\n9. Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2011.\n\nFrom this, I can see that several judges were appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o: Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda (row 1), Erick Kolthoff Caraballo (row 2), Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez (row 6), Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco (row 7), Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres (row 8), and Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n (row 9). That's six judges in total appointed by him.\n\nThe claim states that \"1 of the judge be appoint by luis fortu\u00f1o,\" which is a bit awkwardly phrased but essentially means at least one judge was appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o. Since there are multiple instances, the claim is definitely TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for each judge appointed by Luis Fortu\u00f1o:\n\n- Edgardo Rivera Garc\u00eda: row 1, column 'appointed by'\n- Erick Kolthoff Caraballo: row 2, column 'appointed by'\n- Luis Estrella Mart\u00ednez: row 6, column 'appointed by'\n- Mildred Pab\u00f3n Charneco: row 7, column 'appointed by'\n- Rafael Mart\u00ednez Torres: row 8, column 'appointed by'\n- Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n: row 9, column 'appointed by'\n\nSo, these are the rows where the 'appointed by' column has \"luis fortu\u00f1o.\" Therefore, each of these rows contributes to supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"appointed by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
