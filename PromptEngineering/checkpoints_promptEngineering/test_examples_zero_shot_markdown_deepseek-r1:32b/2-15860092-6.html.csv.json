    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the highest percentage win % be 80.00 against the opposition pune warriers india.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It's saying that Pune Warriors India has an 80% win rate and that this is the highest among all teams listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: \"opposition,\" \"span,\" \"lost,\" \"tied,\" and \"win %.\" The relevant parts here are the \"opposition\" column to identify which team we're talking about and the \"win %\" column to check their win percentage.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find Pune Warriors India. Let me go down the list:\n\n1. Chennai Super Kings: 40%\n2. Delhi Daredevils: 60%\n3. Kings XI Punjab: 55%\n4. Mumbai Indians: 20%\n5. Pune Warriors India: 80% (row index 4)\n6. Rajasthan Royals: 50%\n7. Royal Challengers Bangalore: ~47.33%\n8. Sunrisers Hyderabad: 50%\n9. Deccan Chargers: ~77.78%\n10. Kochi Tuskers Kerala: 0%\n\nSo, Pune Warriors India has a win percentage of 80%, which is the highest in the list except for Deccan Chargers at approximately 77.78%. Wait, actually, 80% is higher than Deccan's ~77.78%, so yes, Pune Warriors India does have the highest win percentage.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that this is indeed the case across all rows. Scanning again, no other team has a higher win percentage than 80%. The closest is Deccan Chargers with about 77.78%, which is less than 80%.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Pune Warriors India's win percentage of 80% is indeed the highest in the table.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are the \"opposition\" and \"win %\" for Pune Warriors India, which is row index 4.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opposition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the lowest percentage win % be 0.00 against the opposition kochi tusker kerala.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for opposition, span, lost, tied, and win%. There are nine rows with different teams listed under \"opposition.\"\n\nThe claim is talking about the lowest win percentage being 0.00 against Kochi Tuskers Kerala. So, I need to check two things: does Kochi Tuskers Kerala have a win% of 0.00, and is that indeed the lowest in the table?\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Chennai Super Kings have a win% of 40.\n2. Delhi Daredevils have 60.\n3. Kings XI Punjab have 55.\n4. Mumbai Indians have 20.\n5. Pune Warriors India have 80.\n6. Rajasthan Royals have 50.\n7. Royal Challengers Bangalore have approximately 47.33.\n8. Sunrisers Hyderabad have 50.\n9. Deccan Chargers have about 77.78.\n10. Kochi Tuskers Kerala is listed with a win% of 0.\n\nSo, Kochi Tuskers Kerala has the lowest win percentage at 0%, which matches the claim. Now, I should check if this is indeed the case and ensure that no other team has a lower percentage than them.\n\nLooking through each row's win%:\n\n- The highest percentages are 80 (Pune Warriors) and 77.78 (Deccan Chargers), but the lowest is clearly 0 for Kochi Tuskers Kerala. No other team in the table has a lower win% than that, so this must be the correct minimum.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Kochi Tuskers Kerala has the lowest win percentage of exactly 0%, and there's no team with a negative or lower percentage than that.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data. Kochi Tuskers Kerala has the lowest win% at 0.00, which matches the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opposition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the average win % with all of the match against the opposition chennai super king and delhi daredevil be 50%\".\n\nFirst, let me understand what this claim is saying. It's talking about the average winning percentage when considering matches against two specific teams: Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents a different opposition team along with their stats like span, lost, tied, and win %. \n\nSo I need to find the rows corresponding to Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- The first row is \"chennai super kings\" with a win % of 40.\n- The second row is \"delhi daredevils\" with a win % of 60.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the average of these two percentages. To do that, I'll add the two win percentages and divide by 2. \n\nSo, 40 (Chennai) + 60 (Delhi) = 100. Dividing this by 2 gives me an average of 50%. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Chennai has 40%, Delhi has 60%. Adding them gives 100, which divided by two is indeed 50%. So the average win percentage across these two opposition teams is exactly 50%.\n\nAre there any other considerations? The claim mentions \"all of the match against\" these two. Does that mean we're only considering their individual stats and not any combined results? I think in this context, it refers to each team's performance when facing either of these two, but since the table lists win percentages per opposition, taking their individual averages is correct.\n\nSo, based on the numbers from the table, the average win percentage for Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Daredevils is 50%, which makes the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"win %\"}, {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win %\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the team lost 4 more matches to the chennai super king than they do to the delhi daredevil.\" Hmm, wait a second\u2014actually, looking at the table, it's about opposition teams and their performance against them.\n\nWait, maybe I misread that. Let me check again. The claim is: \"the team lost 4 more match to the chennai super king than they do to the delhi daredevil.\" Oh, so perhaps it's referring to how many matches a particular team (maybe not specified) lost against these two opposition teams.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists an opposition team and some stats about them. The columns are \"opposition,\" \"span,\" \"lost,\" \"tied,\" and \"win %.\" So for each opposition team, we have how many matches they've lost against that team or something? Wait, no\u2014wait, maybe it's the number of losses a team has when facing these opposition teams.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me clarify: Each row in the table is an opposition team and their stats. So for example, the first row is Chennai Super Kings as opposition, with 8 lost matches. Wait, no\u2014looking at the column headers, \"lost\" seems to be how many times they (the opposition) have lost? Or perhaps it's how many matches a particular team has lost against each opposition.\n\nWait, actually, the table's structure isn't entirely clear. The columns are \"opposition,\" \"span,\" \"lost,\" \"tied,\" and \"win %.\" So for each opposition team, we're given their performance in terms of lost, tied, and win percentage. For example, Chennai Super Kings as an opposition have 8 losses, Delhi Daredevils have 4 losses.\n\nWait, so the claim is saying that a certain team (maybe not specified) has lost 4 more matches to Chennai Super Kings than they did to Delhi Daredevils. So we need to see if the number of losses against CSK is 4 more than against DDA.\n\nLooking at the table: For opposition Chennai Super Kings, under \"lost\" it's 8. For Delhi Daredevils, it's 4. So 8 - 4 equals 4. That would mean that the team lost 4 more matches to CSK than to DDA. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The table shows the \"lost\" column for each opposition. Does this represent how many times the opposing team (like CSK) has lost, or how many times our team has lost against them? That's a crucial point.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the columns. Maybe the \"lost\" column is the number of losses by the opposition teams themselves when they played against others, not how many times our team lost to them. So if CSK have 8 losses in their span, that doesn't necessarily mean that another team has 8 wins over them.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the team lost 4 more match to the chennai super king than they do to the delhi daredevil.\" So it's about how many times the team (presumably our team) lost against CSK versus DDA. But in the table, for each opposition, we have their own stats.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the \"lost\" column is the number of matches that a particular team (like, say, Mumbai Indians or another team) has lost when playing against these opposition teams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is about all the losses that each opposition team has incurred across their span. So for example, CSK as an opposition have 8 losses in total from 2008-2013. DDA have 4. So if a team played against both and lost more to one than the other.\n\nWait, but the claim is about how many times a single team (the one making the claim) has lost to each opposition. The table doesn't specify that; it's just showing stats for each opposition as a whole.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the claim again: \"the team lost 4 more matches to the chennai super king than they do to the delhi daredevil.\" So if the team has x losses against CSK and y against DDA, then x = y + 4.\n\nLooking at the table, for opposition CSK, the \"lost\" column is 8. For DDA, it's 4. If we assume that these are the number of times a certain team (maybe not specified) has lost to each, then 8 - 4 equals 4, which would make the claim true.\n\nAlternatively, if \"lost\" refers to the opposition teams' losses against others, then maybe our team's wins over them. So our team might have 8 wins over CSK and 4 over DDA, meaning they lost fewer to CSK? But that doesn't fit the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction. If \"lost\" is how many times the opposition teams themselves have lost, then if a team (say, Team X) has played against CSK, maybe their win % against CSK is higher or lower.\n\nBut the table's data is for each opposition team across their span, not per opponent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about a specific team losing more to one opposition than another by 4 matches. So if we look at the \"lost\" column for CSK (8) and DDA (4), then yes, they lost 4 more to CSK. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. The table might not directly represent a single team's losses against these oppositions but rather each opposition's overall losses across all their matches in that span. So perhaps it's not per opponent but aggregate.\n\nWait, maybe each row represents an opposition team and their performance against all teams they've played against during their span. So for CSK, over 2008-2013, they have 8 losses. DDA has 4. So if a specific team (say, Team A) is being compared, the claim says Team A lost 4 more matches to CSK than to DDA.\n\nBut without knowing how many times Team A played against each and their respective results, we can't directly say that. The table doesn't specify individual matchups but rather the opposition's overall stats.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the \"lost\" column for each opposition is the number of losses they've incurred against all opponents in their span, so if a team (e.g., Team X) played against CSK and DDA, then the number of times Team X lost to them would be based on those stats.\n\nBut without knowing how many games Team X played against each, it's impossible to determine. The claim is about a specific team losing 4 more matches to one opposition than another, but with the given data, we can only see that CSK as an opposition have 8 losses in total and DDA have 4.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is referring to the difference between the number of times our team lost to each. If the \"lost\" column represents how many times our team has lost against each opposition, then yes, 8 - 4 equals 4, so TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, if \"lost\" refers to the opposition's own losses, it might not directly translate. But given the context of the claim, it's more likely that \"lost\" is from our team's perspective.\n\nSo, in conclusion, based on the table showing 8 and 4 losses against CSK and DDA respectively, the difference is 4, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that a specific team lost 4 more matches to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) than to Delhi Daredevils (DDA). Referring to the table provided:\n\n- **Chennai Super Kings (CSK)** have 8 losses listed under their \"lost\" column.\n- **Delhi Daredevils (DDA)** have 4 losses listed.\n\nCalculating the difference:  \n8 (losses against CSK) - 4 (losses against DDA) = 4\n\nThis means the team lost 4 more matches to CSK than to DDA, which aligns with the claim. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"the lowest percentage win % be 80.00 against the opposition pune warriers india\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Pune Warriors India has a winning percentage of 80%, and this is the lowest among all teams in the table. So, my goal is to check two things: \n\n1. What is Pune Warriors India's win percentage?\n2. Is this the lowest win percentage in the table?\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying the row for Pune Warriors India. Scanning through the opposition column, I find that Pune Warriors India has a span from 2011 to 2013. The win % column shows 80. So their winning percentage is indeed 80%.\n\nNext, I need to check all other teams' win percentages to see if any have a lower value than 80%. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Chennai Super Kings: 40%\n- Delhi Daredevils: 60%\n- Kings XI Punjab: 55%\n- Mumbai Indians: 20% \n- Pune Warriors India: 80% (already noted)\n- Rajasthan Royals: 50%\n- Royal Challengers Bangalore: ~47.33%\n- Sunrisers Hyderabad: 50%\n- Deccan Chargers: ~77.78%\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala: 0%\n\nLooking at these percentages, the lowest I see is Kochi Tuskers Kerala with a win percentage of 0%. That's significantly lower than Pune Warriors India's 80%. \n\nTherefore, the claim that Pune Warriors India has the lowest win percentage isn't correct because there are teams with much lower percentages. Specifically, Kochi Tuskers Kerala has the absolute lowest at 0%.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"win %\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the team lost 4 more matches to the Chennai Super King than they do to the Mumbai Indian.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It seems like it's comparing two teams: one opposing team (Chennai Super Kings) and another opposing team (Mumbai Indians). The claim is about how many more losses a particular team has against these two opponents.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents an opposing team with their stats from 2008 to various years. For each opposing team, there are columns for \"lost\" which indicates the number of matches lost against them.\n\nSo, I need to find out how many losses there are against Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. Then, check if the difference is 4 in favor of one over the other.\n\nLet's go through the table row by row:\n\n1. **Chennai Super Kings**: They have a \"lost\" value of 8.\n2. **Delhi Daredevils**: Lost 4 matches.\n3. **Kings XI Punjab**: Lost 5 matches.\n4. **Mumbai Indians**: Lost 10 matches.\n5. **Pune Warriors India**: Lost 1 match.\n6. **Rajasthan Royals**: Lost 5, with a tie of 1.\n7. **Royal Challengers Bangalore**: Lost 6.\n8. **Sunrisers Hyderabad**: Only exists in 2013, lost 1.\n9. **Deccan Chargers**: Exist from 2008-2012, lost 2.\n10. **Kochi Tuskers Kerala**: Only in 2011, lost 2.\n\nWait a second, the claim mentions \"the team\" which is ambiguous. It's unclear which team we're referring to. Are we talking about a specific team that has more losses against Chennai Super Kings compared to Mumbai Indians by 4? Or is it comparing how many times one opposing team made another lose?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misinterpreted. Maybe it's saying that the team lost 4 more matches when playing against the Chennai Super Kings than they did against the Mumbai Indians. In other words, for a particular team, their losses against CSK are 4 more than their losses against MI.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row represents an opposing team and their stats. So each entry is about how many times that opposing team lost to others? Or perhaps it's the opposite: how many matches the team (presumably another team) has lost against these opponents.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify what each column means. The \"lost\" column could represent the number of losses that the opposing teams have in their matches. So for example, Chennai Super Kings have 8 losses in total during their span. Similarly, Mumbai Indians have 10 losses.\n\nBut the claim says a team lost 4 more matches to CSK than to MI. That would mean if a particular team played against both CSK and MI, they lost 4 more times to CSK than to MI. But I don't see any information about individual teams' performances against specific opponents in this table; it's just the opposing teams' stats overall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is showing how many matches each opposing team has lost during their span, so for example, the Mumbai Indians have 10 losses in total from 2008-2013. Similarly, Chennai Super Kings have 8 losses. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the \"lost\" column. If it's how many times the team (like the user's team) has lost to each opposing team, then perhaps for each opposing team, that row indicates how many times the user's team lost against them.\n\nBut the table doesn't specify whose perspective this is. It just lists opposing teams with their stats. So without knowing which team we're referring to in the claim, it's impossible to verify the statement because the table only provides the losing counts for each opposing team but not from a specific team's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"lost\" column refers to how many times each opposing team has lost overall during their span. In that case, Chennai Super Kings have 8 losses, Mumbai Indians have 10 losses. So if we're talking about another team (let's say Team X), comparing how many times Team X lost against CSK vs MI.\n\nBut the table doesn't provide data on specific matchups between opposing teams; it only provides each opposing team's total losses. Therefore, without additional information on individual match outcomes, we can't determine if a particular team lost 4 more matches to CSK than to MI.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-read the table and claim carefully.\n\nThe table has columns: opposition, span, lost, tied, win%. So for each opposing team (like Chennai Super Kings), they have a span of operation, how many matches they've lost, tied, and their winning percentage.\n\nSo, for example, the row \"chennai super kings\" shows that during 2008-2013, they lost 8 matches. Similarly, \"mumbai indians\" lost 10 matches in their span of 2008-2013.\n\nThe claim is: \"the team lost 4 more match to the chennai super king than they do to the mumbai indian\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's saying that a certain team (not listed here) has lost 4 more times against Chennai Super Kings than against Mumbai Indians. So for example, if a team lost X matches to CSK and Y matches to MI, then X = Y + 4.\n\nBut in this table, each row is about an opposing team's performance. There's no data about which team they're playing against. Therefore, we can't determine how many times any specific team has lost to both CSK and MI because the table doesn't provide that information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a misunderstanding of the \"lost\" column. If the \"lost\" column represents how many matches each opposing team has lost in their overall history, then CSK has 8 losses, Mumbai Indians have 10. So if we're talking about the same team (e.g., Team X) losing to these two, but without knowing how Team X performed against both, we can't compare.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe each row is an opposing team and the \"lost\" column indicates how many times they've lost in total. So if another team played against CSK and MI, their losses against those teams would be a part of CSK's and MI's \"lost\" counts. But without knowing the distribution, we can't tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is showing each opposing team's performance against all others, so the \"lost\" column is how many times they lost in total. So if Team A (the user's team) played against CSK and lost 8 times, but that would be under CSK's row. But without knowing how Team A performed overall, it's unclear.\n\nI think the main issue here is ambiguity in the table's data and the claim. The table provides each opposing team's total losses over their span, but doesn't give any information about specific matchups or another team's performance against them. Therefore, we can't verify whether a particular team lost 4 more matches to CSK than to MI.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"lost\" column is referring to how many times the user's team has lost to each opposing team. In that case, for example, if \"chennai super kings\" have 8 losses, it could mean that the user's team lost 8 times against them. Similarly, Mumbai Indians have 10 losses, meaning the user's team lost 10 times against them. So then, the difference would be 2 losses more to MI than to CSK.\n\nBut in this case, the claim says they lost 4 more matches to CSK than to MI, which would require the user's team having 4 more losses against CSK. But according to these numbers, if the \"lost\" column is about the user's team's losses against each opposing team, then:\n\n- Losses to CSK: 8\n- Losses to MI: 10\n\nDifference: MI has 2 more losses than CSK. So that would mean the user's team lost fewer times to CSK (8) compared to MI (10). Therefore, they didn't lose 4 more matches to CSK but actually lost 2 fewer.\n\nBut this is a big assumption because the table doesn't specify whose perspective the \"lost\" column is from. It just says each opposing team's losses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"lost\" refers to how many times each opposing team has lost in their history. So if you're comparing against two teams, CSK and MI, which have 8 and 10 losses respectively, but that doesn't directly relate to a particular team's performance against them.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and lack of specific data on individual matchups, it's impossible to confirm or deny the claim based solely on this table. Therefore, more information is needed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified with the provided data because the table only shows each opposing team's total losses over their span, not the number of times a specific team lost against them. Without information on individual matchups or another team's performance against both CSK and MI, we can't determine if a particular team lost 4 more matches to CSK than to MI.\n\n**Answer:** The claim cannot be confirmed or denied based on the given data as it lacks specific matchup information.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the highest percentage win % be 0.00 against the opposition kochi tusker kerala.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems like it's saying that Kochi Tuskers Kerala has the highest win percentage of 0%. But wait, if their win percentage is 0%, that would mean they didn't win any matches, which might not be the \"highest\" in a typical sense because other teams have higher percentages.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check the \"win %\" column. The first team, Chennai Super Kings, has a 40% win rate. Next, Delhi Daredevils have 60%, which is higher. Kings XI Punjab have 55%, Mumbai Indians 20%, Pune Warriors India 80%, Rajasthan Royals 50%, Royal Challengers Bangalore about 47.33%, Sunrisers Hyderabad 50%, Deccan Chargers around 77.78%, and Kochi Tuskers Kerala at 0%.\n\nSo, the highest win percentage in the table is actually Pune Warriors India with 80%. But the claim says that the highest is 0% for Kochi Tuskers. That doesn't make sense because 0% isn't the highest; it's the lowest among all teams except maybe others if they had lower percentages. Wait, looking back, Mumbai Indians have 20%, which is higher than 0%. So Kochi's 0% is actually the lowest win rate.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it incorrectly states that Kochi Tuskers Kerala has the highest win percentage when in fact their win percentage is the lowest at 0%, and Pune Warriors India holds the highest with 80%.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells to verify this. I'll need to check the \"win %\" column across all rows, but specifically focus on Kochi's row and the highest values elsewhere.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be the win percentages of each team. However, since the user instruction says to list the specific cells that support or refute the claim, I should point out the row where Kochi is and their win %, as well as any other rows showing higher win %. But maybe just highlighting Kochi's win % cell is sufficient because it clearly shows 0%, which contradicts the claim of being the highest. Alternatively, including all win percentages to compare might be better for thoroughness.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should include only the cells relevant to verifying the specific claim. The claim mentions two things: \"highest percentage\" and \"Kochi Tusker Kerala.\" So, I need to check if Kochi's win % is indeed 0% and whether that's the highest in the table.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cell is the one where opposition is Kochi Tuskers Kerala and their win %. Also, perhaps any other team with a higher win percentage could be included as counterexamples. But maybe for brevity, just showing Kochi's win % of 0% would suffice to show that it's not the highest.\n\nSo, in terms of row indices, the last row is Kochi Tuskers Kerala at row index 8 (assuming counting from 0). The column name is \"win %\".\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE because the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the average win % with all of the match against the opposition sunrisers hyderabad and delhi daredevil be 50%.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table for the relevant teams mentioned in the claim. Those are Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Daredevils.\n\nLooking at Sunrisers Hyderabad:\n- Their row is listed with a span of 2013.\n- The \"win %\" column shows 50%.\n\nNext, Delhi Daredevils:\n- They have a span from 2008 to 2013.\n- Their win % is 60%.\n\nNow, the claim mentions taking the average of these two teams' win percentages. So I need to calculate (50% + 60%) / 2.\n\nCalculating that: (50 + 60) = 110; divided by 2 equals 55%. \n\nThe claim states the average should be 50%, but according to the table, it's actually 55%. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI need to note which cells I used for this calculation. For Sunrisers Hyderabad, that's row index 7 in the \"win %\" column. For Delhi Daredevils, it's row index 1 in the same \"win %\" column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 7, \"win %\"\n- Row 1, \"win %\"\n\nSince these are the only cells needed to evaluate the average, and the average doesn't match the claim, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"win %\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"win%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the average win % with all of the match against the opposition rajasthan royal and the kochi tusker kerala be 50%.\" \n\nFirst, I'll identify which rows in the table correspond to these two teams. Looking at the 'opposition' column:\n\n- Rajasthan Royals are listed in row 5.\n- Kochi Tuskers Kerala are listed in row 8.\n\nNext, I need to find their respective win percentages from the 'win %' column:\n\n- For Rajasthan Royals (row 5), the win percentage is 50%.\n- For Kochi Tuskers Kerala (row 8), the win percentage is 0%.\n\nNow, to calculate the average of these two percentages: (50 + 0) / 2 = 25%. The claim says the average should be 50%, but my calculation shows it's actually 25%. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n\nI also need to note which cells are relevant for this determination.
