    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"daniel boaventura be 1 of 6 people who play gomez addams.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The claim mentions that Daniel Boaventura is one of six people who played Gomez Addams in different casts or productions. So, I should check the table for all instances where someone plays Gomez Addams and count how many unique actors there are across the various columns.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a role, and each column lists the actor in that specific production (Broadway original, closing Broadway, US tour, etc.). The first row is about Gomez Addams. Let me list out all the actors for Gomez from each column:\n\n1. Original Broadway Cast: Nathan Lane\n2. Closing Broadway Cast: Roger Rees\n3. Original US Tour Cast: Douglas Sills\n4. Original Nonequity Tour Cast: Jesse Sharp\n5. Original S\u00e3o Paulo Cast: Daniel Boaventura\n6. Original Lima Cast: Diego Bertie\n\nSo, each column represents a different production or tour, and each has its own actor for Gomez Addams. Counting these, we have six distinct actors across the columns.\n\nNow, checking if Daniel Boaventura is among them. Yes, he's listed under the Original S\u00e3o Paulo Cast in that row. So, he is indeed one of the six people who played Gomez Addams as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the table shows exactly six actors for Gomez Addams across different casts, including Daniel Boaventura.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Daniel Boaventura is one of six actors playing Gomez Addams. The table lists six distinct actors in different casts, with Boaventura being one of them.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_0\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_0\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_0\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_0\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_0\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"pugsley addams be the only role that have 3 people available to play it in the original s\u00e3o paulo cast.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. It's saying that for the role of Pugsley Addams, there are three different actors listed under the \"original S\u00e3o Paulo cast.\" Additionally, no other roles should have three or more actors in their respective casts.\n\nLooking at the table, each row corresponds to a role, and each column lists the actors for different productions. The relevant columns here are:\n\n- \"role\" (to identify which character we're looking at)\n- \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" (since that's where the claim is focused)\n\nI'll start by locating Pugsley Addams in the table. Scanning through, I find the row with \"pugsley addams.\" The entry under \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\" for this role is: nicholas torres, gustavo daneluz, matheus lustosa. That's three names separated by commas, so it seems there are indeed three people listed.\n\nNext, I need to check if any other roles have three or more actors in their original S\u00e3o Paulo casts. Let me go through each role:\n\n1. Gomez Addams: Only one name, Daniel Boaventura.\n2. Morticia Addams: One name, Marisa Orth.\n3. Uncle Fester: Claudio Galvan\u2014only one.\n4. Grandma Addams: In\u00e1 de Carvalho\u2014one person.\n5. Wednesday Addams: Laura Lobo\u2014one name.\n6. Pugsley Addams (already checked): Three people.\n7. Lurch: Rog\u00e9rio Guedes\u2014one actor.\n8. Mal Beineke: Wellington Nogueira\u2014one.\n9. Alice Beineke: Paula Capovilla\u2014one.\n10. Lucas Beineke: Beto Sargentelli\u2014one.\n\nLooking through all these, none of the other roles have more than one person listed in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast. This means Pugsley Addams is indeed unique in having three actors for that specific production.\n\nSo the claim holds true because only Pugsley Addams has three people in their S\u00e3o Paulo cast, and no others do.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Pugsley Addams is the sole role with three actors in the original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, while all other roles have fewer. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"bebe neuwirth plays morticia addams in the original broadway cast and krysta rodriguez plays wednesday addams.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into two parts and check each one against the table.\n\n1. **Checking Bebe Neuwirth as Morticia Addams:**\n   - Look for the row where the role is \"morticia addams.\"\n   - In the \"original broadway cast\" column, see who's listed.\n   - The table shows that under \"original broadway cast,\" morticia addams is played by bebe neuwirth. So this part checks out.\n\n2. **Checking Krysta Rodriguez as Wednesday Addams:**\n   - Find the row for \"wednesday addams.\"\n   - Check the \"original broadway cast\" column here too.\n   - The table indicates that krysta rodriguez is indeed listed in that role under the original broadway cast.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table, the entire statement is true.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The user has given me a table in markdown format about the cast of \"The Addams Family\" musical across different productions and tours. They want me to determine if a specific claim is TRUE or FALSE based on this table.\n\nThe claim is: \"adam riegler and zachary james play their same role in both the original broadway cast and the closing broadway cast.\"\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that two actors, Adam Riegler and Zachary James, have kept their roles from the original Broadway cast all the way through to the closing Broadway cast.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a role in the musical, and there are columns for different casts: original Broadway, closing Broadway, US tour, etc. So, for each actor, I need to check if they're listed under both the \"original broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast\" columns.\n\nLet me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify where Adam Riegler is in the table. Scanning down the roles:\n\n- Gomez Addams: Nathan Lane (original) and Roger Rees (closing)\n- Morticia Addams: Bebe Neuwirth (original), Brooke Shields (closing)\n- Uncle Fester: Kevin Chamberlin (original), Brad Oscar (closing)\n- Grandma Addams: Jackie Hoffman in both original and closing\n- Wednesday Addams: Krysta Rodriguez (original), Rachel Potter (closing)\n- Pugsley Addams: Adam Riegler in both original and closing\n- Lurch: Zachary James in both original and closing\n- Mal Beineke: Terrence Mann (original), Adam Grupper (closing)\n- Alice Beineke: Carolee Carmello (original), Heidi Blickenstaff (closing)\n- Lucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor (original), Jesse Swenson (closing)\n\nSo, looking at Pugsley Addams, the original cast is Adam Riegler and the closing cast is also Adam Riegler. That means he played the same role in both casts.\n\nNext, Zachary James plays Lurch. Original cast lists him as Zachary James, and so does the closing cast. So he too kept his role throughout.\n\nTherefore, both actors did play their same roles in both original and closing Broadway casts. The claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to note which cells are relevant. For Adam Riegler, it's row 5 (Pugsley Addams) under \"original broadway cast\" and \"closing broadway cast.\" Similarly, for Zachary James, it's row 6 (Lurch) in both columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the original lima cast have 11 people available to play 10 role unlike the original broadway cast which only have 10 people available to play 10 role.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. Original Lima Cast: 11 people for 10 roles.\n2. Original Broadway Cast: 10 people for 10 roles.\n\nI'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table columns, I need to examine \"original lima cast\" and \"original broadway cast\" columns.\n\nStarting with the original Lima cast:\n\nFor each role in the Lima column, I'll count how many actors are listed. Let's go row by row.\n\n1. Gomez Addams: Diego Bertie (1)\n2. Morticia Addams: Fiorella Rodriguez (1)\n3. Uncle Fester: Nicol\u00e1s Fantinato (1)\n4. Grandma Addams: Patricia Portocarrero (1)\n5. Wednesday Addams: Gina Yangali (1)\n6. Pugsley Addams: Giuseppino Castellano, Brando Gallesi. Wait, two names here.\n7. Lurch: Gustavo Mayer (1)\n8. Mal Beineke: Miguel Alvarez (1)\n9. Alice Beineke: Trilce Cavero (1)\n10. Lucas Beineke: Luis Baca (1)\n\nAdding them up: 1 +1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+1 = 11 people.\n\nSo the Lima cast has 11 actors for 10 roles, which matches the claim.\n\nNow checking the original Broadway cast:\n\nLooking at the \"original broadway cast\" column:\n\nEach role has one actor listed except Pugsley Addams. Let me count:\n\n1. Gomez: Nathan Lane (1)\n2. Morticia: Bebe Neuwirth (1)\n3. Uncle Fester: Kevin Chamberlin (1)\n4. Grandma Addams: Jackie Hoffman (1)\n5. Wednesday: Krysta Rodriguez (1)\n6. Pugsley: Adam Riegler (1) [Wait, in the Broadway cast for Pugsley, it's only Adam Riegler once? Let me double-check.\nWait no, looking back at the table:\n\nOriginal Broadway cast column shows \"adam riegler\" for Pugsley, same as closing. So each role has one actor except maybe others? Wait, let me recount.\n\n1. Gomez: 1\n2. Morticia: 1\n3. Uncle Fester: 1\n4. Grandma Addams: 1\n5. Wednesday: 1\n6. Pugsley: 1\n7. Lurch: Zachary James (1)\n8. Mal Beineke: Terrence Mann (1)\n9. Alice Beineke: Carolee Carmello (1)\n10. Lucas Beineke: Wesley Taylor (1)\n\nTotal is 10 actors for 10 roles, which matches the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"gomez have be play by 8 different actor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like there's a typo; it should probably say \"Gomez has been played by 8 different actors.\" So, I'm looking to see if Gomez Addams was portrayed by eight distinct actors across all the roles listed in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: role, original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, original US tour cast, original nonequity tour cast, original S\u00e3o Paulo cast, and original Lima cast. Each row corresponds to a different character from the Addams Family, with Gomez being one of them.\n\nLooking at the row for Gomez Addams:\n\n- Original Broadway cast: Nathan Lane\n- Closing Broadway cast: Roger Rees\n- Original US tour cast: Douglas Sills\n- Original Nonequity tour cast: Jesse Sharp\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Daniel Boaventura\n- Original Lima cast: Diego Bertie\n\nSo, counting these actors for Gomez Addams:\n\n1. Nathan Lane (Broadway original)\n2. Roger Rees (Broadway closing)\n3. Douglas Sills (US tour original)\n4. Jesse Sharp (Nonequity tour original)\n5. Daniel Boaventura (S\u00e3o Paulo original)\n6. Diego Bertie (Lima original)\n\nWait, that's six actors total. The claim is about eight different actors. But in the table provided, Gomez Addams only appears in these columns with six distinct actors.\n\nI also notice that some roles have more than one actor listed, but looking at Gomez's row, each column lists a single actor except for Pugsley, which has multiple names. However, for Gomez, each column is just one name each time.\n\nTherefore, based on the table provided, Gomez Addams was portrayed by six different actors across these different casts and tours. The claim states eight, which doesn't match. So the answer should be FALSE because there are only six actors listed, not eight.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells for Gomez Addams:\n\nEach cell in Gomez's row is relevant to count how many actors have played him. So I'll list each column for the first row (index 0) as they all contribute to the number of different actors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"there be 1 season lurch have 3 people available to play\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that in one season, the role of Lurch had three people who could play it. So, I need to check how many actors are listed for Lurch across different casts in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: original Broadway cast, closing Broadway cast, original US tour cast, and others like S\u00e3o Paulo and Lima casts. The rows list each character, including Lurch.\n\nSo, let's find the row for Lurch. In the table, I see that Lurch is in the sixth row (row index 6). Now, looking at the columns under this row:\n\n- Original Broadway cast: Zachary James\n- Closing Broadway cast: Zachary James\n- Original US tour cast: Tom Corbeil\n- Original nonequity tour cast: Dan Olson\n- Original S\u00e3o Paulo cast: Rog\u00e9rio Guedes\n- Original Lima cast: Gustavo Mayer\n\nWait, that's six different actors listed for Lurch across various casts. But the claim specifically mentions \"1 season.\" So I need to figure out if within a single season, there were three people available to play Lurch.\n\nIn theater terms, especially Broadway shows, sometimes roles are understudied or played by multiple actors in different performances. A typical season might have an original cast and then some replacements as the season progresses. But looking at the table, for the Broadway casts alone:\n\n- Original: Zachary James\n- Closing: Still Zachary James\n\nSo in Broadway, only one person played Lurch throughout both the original and closing casts.\n\nLooking beyond Broadway to other tours (US tour, nonequity tour), different actors took on the role, but these are separate from the Broadway season. The claim is about a single season, which I assume refers to a specific period, likely the Broadway run since that's often what people refer to as \"the season.\"\n\nTherefore, within one Broadway season, Lurch was played by only Zachary James. There were no other actors in the Broadway cast for that role during that time.\n\nSo the claim says there are three people available to play Lurch in one season, but according to the table, it's just one person across the original and closing Broadway casts. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in one season, Lurch was played by three different actors. However, the table shows only Zachary James listed for both the original and closing Broadway casts of Lurch.

Not Bebe Neuwirth.\n2. **Morticia Addams**: This is where Bebe Neuwirth's name comes up. However, under \"original lima cast,\" the name listed is Fiorella Rodriguez, not Bebe Neuwirth.

Different.\n6. **Pugsley Addams**: Original is Adam Riegler, Closing is also Adam Riegler. Same actor again.\n7. **Lurch**: Original is Zachary James, Closing is also Zachary James. Another same actor.\n8. **Mal Beineke**: Original is Terrence Mann, Closing is Adam Grupper. Different.\n9. **Alice Beineke**: Original is Carolee Carmello, Closing is Heidi Blickenstaff. Different.\n10. **Lucas Beineke**: Original is Wesley Taylor, Closing is Jesse Swenson. Different.\n\nSo from this, I can see that for Grandma Addams, Pugsley Addams, and Lurch roles, the same actor was in both the opening and closing casts. This directly contradicts the claim which says there are no such actors. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells from the table where this condition occurs. Each of these cases will have entries in both 'original broadway cast' and 'closing broadway cast'. \n\nFor Grandma Addams (row index 3), both columns show Jackie Hoffman.\nPugsley Addams (row index 5) shows Adam Riegler in both.\nLurch (row index 6) has Zachary James in both.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, 'original broadway cast' and 'closing broadway cast'\n- Row 5, same columns\n- Row 6, same columns\n\nI need to list each of these as separate entries in the JSON.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"there be always extra actor available for each role\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It's saying that for every role in the Addams Family musical (I assume that's what this is about), there are backup or additional actors available beyond the primary ones listed. So, does each role have more than one actor listed in any of the columns?\n\nLooking at the table, it has several columns: original broadway cast, closing broadway cast, original US tour cast, etc. Each row represents a different role, and under each column, there are actors' names.\n\nThe claim is about having \"always\" an extra actor for each role. So I need to check if every single role has more than one actor listed in any of the columns provided.\n\nLet me go through each role one by one.\n\n1. **Gomez Addams**: Original Broadway cast is Nathan Lane, Closing Broadway is Roger Rees, US Tour is Douglas Sills, Nonequity Tour is Jesse Sharp, S\u00e3o Paulo is Daniel Boaventura, Lima is Diego Bertie. That's six different actors across the columns. So definitely more than one.\n\n2. **Morticia Addams**: Bebe Neuwirth, Brooke Shields, Sara Gettelfinger, Keleen Snowgren, Marisa Orth, Fiorella Rodriguez. Again, multiple actors for each role.\n\n3. **Uncle Fester**: Kevin Chamberlin, Brad Oscar, Blake Hammond, Shaun Rice, Claudio Galvan, Nicol\u00e1s Fantinato. Multiple actors here too.\n\n4. **Grandma Addams**: Jackie Hoffman appears in both original and closing Broadway casts. Then Pippa Pear TREE (I think that's a typo), Amanda Bruton, In\u00e1 de Carvalho, Patricia Portocarrero. So multiple as well.\n\n5. **Wednesday Addams**: Krysta Rodr\u00edguez, Rachel Potter, Cortney Wolfson, Jennifer Fogarty, Laura Lobo, Gina Yangali. Multiple actors again.\n\n6. **Pugsley Addams**: Adam Riegler is listed in both original and closing Broadway casts. Then Patrick D Kennedy, Sam Primack, and the S\u00e3o Paulo column has three names: Nicholas Torres, Gustavo Daneluz, Matheus Lustosa. Lima has two names as well. So definitely multiple actors here.\n\n7. **Lurch**: Zachary James appears in both Original and Closing Broadway. Tom Corbeil, Dan Olson, Rog\u00e9rio Guedes, Gustavo Mayer. Multiple actors again.\n\n8. **Mal Beineke**: Terrence Mann, Adam Grupper, Martin Vidnovic, Mark Poppleton, Wellington Nogueira, Miguel Alvarez. Multiple actors here too.\n\n9. **Alice Beineke**: Carolee Carmello, Heidi Blickenstaff, Crista Moore, Blair Anderson, Paula Capovilla, Trilce Cavero. Again multiple actors.\n\n10. **Lucas Beineke**: Wesley Taylor, Jesse Swenson, Brian Justin Crum, Bryan Welnicki, Beto Sargentelli, Luis Baca. Multiple actors as well.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that for some roles like Gomez and Morticia, the same actor appears in different casts (e.g., Nathan Lane in Original Broadway and Roger Rees in Closing). So each role has at least two actors listed across the columns.\n\nBut let me check if any role only has one actor. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- Each role has multiple entries across the different cast categories, so there's always more than one actor available for each role as per the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because every single role in the table lists multiple actors across various casts, indicating that there are extra actors available.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"closing broadway cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original us tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original nonequity tour cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original s\u00e3o paulo cast\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original lima cast\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
