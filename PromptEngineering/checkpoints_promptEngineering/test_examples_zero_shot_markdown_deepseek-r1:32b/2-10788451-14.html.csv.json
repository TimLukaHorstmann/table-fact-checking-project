The columns are 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', etc.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the 'date' column for all rows to find entries from 31 july 1965. All rows in this table have that date, so every game is on that day.\n\nNext, I need to check each row's 'away team' column to see if Melbourne appears there. \n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Geelong vs North Melbourne: Away team is North Melbourne.\n2. Essendon vs Footscray: Away team is Footscray.\n3. Carlton vs South Melbourne: Away team is South Melbourne.\n4. St Kilda vs Richmond: Away team is Richmond.\n5. Melbourne vs Fitzroy: Here, the home team is Melbourne, so they are playing at home, not away. The away team here is Fitzroy.\n6. Hawthorn vs Collingwood: Away team is Collingwood.\n\nIn none of these rows does 'melbourne' appear in the 'away team' column. Instead, Melbourne is listed as the home team in one game. \n\nTherefore, the claim that \"melbourne do not play as an away team on 31 july 1965\" is TRUE because they only played at home that day.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table in front of me with six rows and several columns, each representing different details about some games. The claim is that \"a total of 6 games have a date of 31 July 1965.\" My job is to figure out if this claim is true or false based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's stating that there are six games listed with the specific date of 31st July 1965. So my task is to go through each row and check the 'date' column for each game to see if it matches this date.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that each row represents a different game between two teams. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The key here is the 'date' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nStarting with the first row, it says 31 July 1965 under the date. That's a match. Next, the second row also has 31 July 1965 as the date. That's two so far. The third row again lists 31 July 1965, making three. Moving on to the fourth row, same date\u2014now four games. Fifth row is still 31 July 1965, bringing it up to five. Finally, the sixth and last row also has the same date, which makes six.\n\nSo each of the six rows in the table has a 'date' value of 31 July 1965. That means every game listed took place on that specific day. Therefore, the claim accurately reflects the data presented in the table because all six games indeed have that date.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies or exceptions here. Each row clearly states the same date, so adding them up gives us exactly six games on 31 July 1965. There's no game listed with a different date to throw this off.\n\nIn conclusion, since every single one of the six entries in the table has the date specified by the claim, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"Richmond have an away team score 02 points higher than Fitzroy do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant information in the table. The table has columns like 'home team', 'home team score', 'away team', 'away team score', and others. Since the claim is about away team scores of Richmond and Fitzroy, I need to find their respective away team scores.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Geelong vs North Melbourne: Away team is North Melbourne with a score of 5.4 (34). Not relevant here.\n2. Essendon vs Footscray: Away team Footscray scored 6.11 (47). Still not the teams we're interested in.\n3. Carlton vs South Melbourne: Away team is South Melbourne with 13.12 (90). No, not Fitzroy or Richmond.\n4. St Kilda vs Richmond: Here, Richmond is the away team. Their score is 11.17 (83).\n5. Melbourne vs Fitzroy: Fitzroy is the away team here, scoring 11.15 (81).\n6. Hawthorn vs Collingwood: Away team Collingwood scored 12.22 (94). Not needed for this claim.\n\nSo, from rows 4 and 5:\n\n- Richmond's away score: 11.17 (83)\n- Fitzroy's away score: 11.15 (81)\n\nWait a minute, the scores are given in the format of goals behinds (total points). So 11.17 is 11 goals and 17 behinds, totaling to (11*6) +17 = 66+17=83. Similarly, Fitzroy's 11.15 is 11*6 +15=66+15=81.\n\nNow the claim says Richmond have an away score that's 02 points higher than Fitzroy. Let me calculate the difference: 83 (Richmond) - 81 (Fitzroy) = 2. So yes, Richmond scored exactly 2 points more than Fitzroy as away teams.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For Richmond: row index 4 (since counting from 0), column 'away team score'.\n- For Fitzroy: row index 5, column 'away team score'.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me double-check the rows. The table has six rows, indexed 0 to 5.\n\nRow 4 is Melbourne vs Fitzroy, so away team is Fitzroy with 11.15 (81). So row_index 4 for Fitzroy's away score.\n\nRichmond is in row 3: St Kilda vs Richmond. So row index 3 for Richmond's away score.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n- {\"row_2\": 5? Wait no. Let me recount the rows with their indices.\n\nWait, let me list them properly:\n\nRow 0: Geelong vs North Melbourne\nRow 1: Essendon vs Footscray\nRow 2: Carlton vs South Melbourne\nRow 3: St Kilda vs Richmond (Richmond is away)\nRow 4: Melbourne vs Fitzroy (Fitzroy is away)\nRow 5: Hawthorn vs Collingwood\n\nSo for Richmond as away team, it's row index 3.\n\nFor Fitzroy as away team, it's row index 4.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_3\": \"away team score\"}\n- {\"row_4\": \"away team score\"}\n\nWait no, in JSON terms, each object has row_index and column_name. So:\n\n[\n{\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"away team score\"},\n{\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"away team score\"}\n]\n\nAnd since the difference is exactly 2 points (83-81=2), the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}",

So, first, I need to find which games were played at the mcg and check their crowd sizes. Then, see how many games overall had a crowd over 30,000.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The first row: venue is kardinia park, so not mcg.\n2. Second row: windy hill, not mcg.\n3. Third row: princes park, nope.\n4. Fourth row: moorabbin oval, still not mcg.\n5. Fifth row: venue is mcg. The crowd here is 30,381. That's over 30,000.\n6. Sixth row: glenferrie oval, so no.\n\nSo only the fifth game was at mcg with a crowd of 30,381, which is larger than 30k.

The date for that match is 31 July 1965, which matches the claim's date. \n\nThe claim says Essendon played as an away team on that date. However, according to the table, they were actually the home team because their name is under 'home team'. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are from row 1 (since rows are zero-indexed?

Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion. Since the claim is about the number of games on a specific date, all rows where the 'date' column has \"31 july 1965\" are relevant. Each row's 'date' cell confirms that multiple games were played on that day.\n\nSo, for each of the six rows, the 'date' column is important because it shows they all occurred on July 31, 1965.

I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"the away team score be 8.12 (60) at the game where the home team score be 11.15 (81)\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down what this means. The claim is talking about a specific game where two conditions must both be true:\n1. The away team's score is exactly \"8.12 (60)\".\n2. In that same game, the home team's score is exactly \"11.15 (81)\".\n\nSo I need to look through each row of the table and see if any row satisfies both these conditions simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nEach row represents a different game with details about the home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet's go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0:\n- Home Team Score: 10.17 (77)\n- Away Team Score: 5.4 (34)\nNeither of these matches the scores in the claim, so this row doesn't fit.\n\nRow 1:\n- Home Team Score: 13.18 (96)\n- Away Team Score: 6.11 (47)\nAgain, neither score matches what's claimed.\n\nRow 2:\n- Home Team Score: 9.19 (73)\n- Away Team Score: 13.12 (90)\nNo match here either.\n\nRow 3:\n- Home Team Score: 14.12 (96)\n- Away Team Score: 11.17 (83)\nStill not matching the required scores.\n\nRow 4:\n- Home Team Score: 12.11 (83)\n- Away Team Score: 11.15 (81)\nHmm, here we have an away team score of \"11.15 (81)\" and a home team score of \"12.11 (83)\". Wait, the claim mentions the away team score as \"8.12 (60)\", which doesn't match \"11.15 (81)\". Also, the home team score in this row is 12.11 (83), not 11.15 (81). So this row doesn't satisfy both conditions.\n\nRow 5:\n- Home Team Score: 8.12 (60)\n- Away Team Score: 12.22 (94)\nHere, the home team score is \"8.12 (60)\", which matches the away team score in the claim, but that's not what we're looking for. The claim says the away team has this score, and the home team should have \"11.15 (81)\". Also, checking the away team score here is 12.22 (94), which doesn't match.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which score belongs to whom. Let me clarify: In each row, the first score under 'home team score' is for the home team, and the next is the away team's score. So in Row 5, the home team scored 8.12 (60), and the away team scored 12.22 (94).\n\nSo to restate: The claim says that the away team's score should be 8.12 (60) when the home team's score is 11.15 (81). But looking through all rows, no row has both these scores in the correct positions.\n\nIn Row 4, we have a situation where the away team's score is \"11.15 (81)\", but the home team's score there is \"12.11 (83)\". That doesn't match because the claim requires the home team to be at 11.15.\n\nIn Row 5, the home team has a score of 8.12 (60), which would correspond if we were looking for the home team having that score and the away team having another. But again, not matching both parts of the claim.\n\nTherefore, there's no row where the away team scores exactly \"8.12 (60)\" AND the home team in the same game scores \"11.15 (81)\". \n\nSo the claim is FALSE because neither condition is met in any single row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
