    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the result of a goal larger than 4 be 3 - 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that when there's a goal larger than 4, the result should be 3-1. So, I'm looking for any rows in the table where the 'goal' column has a value greater than 4 and then check if the corresponding 'result' is 3-1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The 'goal' column lists values from 1 to 5. The claim is about goals larger than 4, so I'm specifically interested in goal number 5.\n  \nNext, I'll examine each row where the goal is greater than 4:\n\n- Row index 4 has a goal of 5. Let's check the 'result' column for this row. It shows \"3 - 2\". \n\nThe claim expects the result to be 3-1 when the goal is larger than 4, but in this case, the result is 3-2. Therefore, the result does not match what the claim states.\n\nSince there's only one instance where the goal is larger than 4 (which is 5), and it doesn't meet the condition of having a result of 3-1, the claim cannot be supported by the data in the table. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are:\n- The 'goal' column for each row to identify which goals are larger than 4.\n- Once identified, the corresponding 'result' column is checked for those rows.\n\nIn this case, only row index 4 has a goal greater than 4, and its result doesn't match. So, these cells are relevant for evaluating the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on september 10 , 2013 , the result be 3 - 2",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"on september 10, 2013, the result be 3 - 2\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the date part of the claim. The date mentioned is September 10, 2013. Scanning through the 'date' column in the table, I see that on row index 4, the date is \"10 september 2013\", which matches exactly with the date in the claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the result for that specific date. The relevant cell here would be under the 'result' column of the same row. Looking at row index 4, the result shows as \"3 - 2\". That's exactly what the claim states. \n\nSo both the date and the result in the table align with the claim made. There doesn't seem to be any discrepancies or other rows that could cause confusion. Therefore, I can confidently say that the claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the relevant row shows a result of 3-2 on September 10, 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"goal for friendly competition be less than 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: It states that in all instances of friendly competitions, the number of goals scored should be less than 3. So I need to check each row where the competition type is 'friendly' and see if the goal count meets this condition.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Competition is 'friendly', score is 3-1. The total goals here are 4, which is more than 3.\n2. **Row 1**: Also a 'friendly' competition with a score of 1-2, totaling 3 goals. Since the claim says less than 3, this doesn't satisfy it either.\n3. **Row 2**: Competition isn't friendly; it's the Copa Am\u00e9rica, so we can ignore this.\n4. **Row 3**: Another 'friendly' match with a score of 1-1, totaling 2 goals. This is less than 3 and meets the claim.\n5. **Row 4**: Not a friendly competition, so irrelevant.\n\nNow, evaluating all relevant rows (0, 1, 3), I notice that Rows 0 and 1 have goal counts equal to or exceeding 3, which violates the claim. Therefore, not all 'friendly' competitions have goals less than 3.\n\nThe claim is therefore FALSE because there are instances where the goal count in friendly matches equals or exceeds 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
