    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"adelaide united play in front of 25039 crowd at adelaide oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where Adelaide United was playing away because the claim mentions they were playing at Adelaide Oval. Wait, no\u2014Adelaide Oval would be their home stadium if they're playing there. So I need to find a row where the home team is Adelaide United and the stadium is Adelaide Oval.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 18: It's round 18 on 28 December 2007. The home team is Adelaide United, away team is Sydney FC. Stadium is Adelaide Oval, crowd is 25039. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 18, \"home team\" to confirm it's Adelaide United.\n- Row 18, \"stadium\" to check if it's Adelaide Oval.\n- Row 18, \"crowd\" to see if it's 25039.\n\nAll these details match the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE with those relevant cells noted.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking row 18 where Adelaide United played at Adelaide Oval in front of a crowd of 25039.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"Sydney FC play at Adelaide Oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that Sydney FC plays their matches at Adelaide Oval. To verify this, I'll look through the table for any instances where Sydney FC is either the home team or away team and check if Adelaide Oval is listed as the stadium in those rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. First, identify all rows where Sydney FC is either the home or away team.\n   - Round 2: Home team is Sydney FC vs Adelaide United. Stadium is Sydney Football Stadium.\n   - Round 9: Home team is Sydney FC again against Adelaide United. Stadium is Sydney Football Stadium.\n   - Round 18: Away team is Sydney FC vs Adelaide United at Adelaide Oval.\n\nWait, in row 18 (index 17), the away team is Sydney FC and the stadium is Adelaide Oval. So this indicates that Sydney FC played an away match at Adelaide Oval against Adelaide United on December 28, 2007.\n\nAdditionally, let's check if there are any other instances where Sydney FC was at Adelaide Oval as either home or away. From the table, I don't see any other entries where Sydney FC is associated with Adelaide Oval.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is TRUE because Sydney FC played a match at Adelaide Oval in round 18.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"adelaide united play in front of 10256 crowd in hindmarsh stadium on november 18\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim and identify the key elements that need verification:\n1. **Team**: Adelaide United\n2. **Crowd Size**: 10,256\n3. **Stadium**: Hindmarsh Stadium\n4. **Date**: November 18\n\nNext, I'll go through each row of the table to find a match for these details.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The rows are numbered from 1 to 21.\n- Each row contains information about a specific match, including date, home team, away team, score, crowd size, stadium, and more.\n\nI'll start by searching for rows where the date is November 18. Scanning through the \"date\" column:\n- The dates go from August 25, 2007, up to January 2008.\n- I notice that row 13 has a date of November 18, 2007.\n\nNow, let's check the details for row 13:\n- **Date**: 18 november 2007\n- **Home Team**: adelaide united\n- **Away Team**: newcastle jets\n- **Score**: 1 - 1\n- **Crowd**: 10256\n- **Stadium**: hindmarsh stadium\n\nAll the elements in the claim match this row:\n- Adelaide United is indeed playing as the home team.\n- The crowd size is exactly 10,256.\n- The stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium.\n- The date matches November 18.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are accurately reflected in row 13 of the table, the claim holds true. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row index 12 (since indexing starts at 0) with the column names involved: \"date\", \"home team\", \"crowd\", and \"stadium\".\n\nBut wait, according to the instructions, I need to list each relevant cell as separate objects in the JSON. So, for each piece of information that verifies the claim, I should note which row it's in and which column it belongs to.\n\nSo, breaking down the verification:\n- The date is found under \"date\" column, row index 12.\n- The home team (Adelaide United) is in the \"home team\" column, same row.\n- The crowd size of 10,256 is in the \"crowd\" column, same row.\n- The stadium is Hindmarsh Stadium, found in the \"stadium\" column.\n\nThus, each of these columns in row index 12 supports a part of the claim. Therefore, all four cells are relevant and necessary to confirm the claim's accuracy.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"}\n   ]\n}",
