So I need to check how many players have a \"to par\" value of +8.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- The first two rows (indexes 0 and 1) have a to par of +4.\n- Rows 2,3,4,5 all show +5.\n- Then in row 6, it's +8. That's the first golfer.\n- Row 7 also has +8, so that's the second.\n- Row 8 is another +8, making three golfers.\n\nSo there are three players (Sam Snead, Bob Harris, Jack Burke Jr.) with a to par of +8. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells for each of these three golfers in their respective rows under the \"to par\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are three golfers with a score of +8.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in markdown format and shows some golfers' scores from the 1955 US Open. The claim is: \"there be 4 golfer tie for third place at the 1955 us open\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table is showing. Let me look at it closely.\n\nThe columns are: place, player, country, score, and to par. There are several rows with different placements. The 'place' column shows positions like t1, t3, t7, etc., which I assume mean tied for 1st, tied for 3rd, tied for 7th, and so on.\n\nThe claim mentions that four golfers tied for third place. So, I need to check if in the 'place' column there are four players with a place of t3.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first two rows have t1, so they're tied for first.\n- Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 all show t3 under the place column. Each of these rows represents different golfers: Julius Boros, Jack Fleck, Ben Hogan, and Walker Inman Jr.\n\nSo that's four players tied at third place. The scores are all 145 with a to par of +5. So yes, they all have the same score which makes them tie for third.\n\nThe next positions after t3 are t7 (three players) and then 10th place.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed four golfers tied for third place at the 1955 US Open as shown in the table.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells that support this answer. Each of these four rows has the 'place' as t3 and they're consecutive from row index 2 to 5 (since tables are usually zero-indexed). So each of those rows under the 'place' column is relevant.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 2, place\n- Row 3, place\n- Row 4, place\n- Row 5, place\n\nThat's four entries where place is t3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are four golfers tied for third place.

The relevant information here is the 'place' and 'country' columns.\n\nThe claim is making a statement about all top 10 finishers not being from the United States.

It has five columns: place, player, country, score, and to par.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim compares Jack Fleck's score with Harvie Ward's score from the 1955 US Open. The table provided has details about players' scores and their standings. I need to check if Jack Fleck scored fewer points than Harvie Ward in that event.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two relevant entries for Jack Fleck and Harvie Ward. Let me locate them.\n\n- Harvie Ward is listed as \"t1\" with a score of 74 + 70 = 144.\n- Jack Fleck is also listed as \"t3\" with a score of 76 + 69 = 145.\n\nNow, the claim says that Jack Fleck scored less than Harvie Ward. But according to the table, Harvie Ward's total score is 144, and Jack Fleck's is 145. That means Jack Fleck actually has a higher (worse) score than Harvie Ward because in golf, lower scores are better.\n\nWait, let me double-check: \"score\" column shows the totals. So Harvie Ward is at 144, which is tied for first place (t1), while Jack Fleck is at 145, tied for third place (t3). Therefore, Jack Fleck's score is higher than Harvie Ward's, meaning he didn't score less; instead, he scored more. So the claim that \"jack fleck score less point that harvie ward\" would be FALSE.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. In golf, lower scores are better because they indicate fewer strokes taken. So if Jack Fleck's total is 145 and Harvie Ward's is 144, Harvie Ward performed better with a lower score. Thus, the claim that Jack Fleck scored less (i.e., had a lower score) than Harvie Ward is incorrect because his score was higher.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.

Let me go through it step by step.\n\nLooking at the 'score' column, I see that several players have a score of 148. Specifically, Sam Snead, Bob Harris, and Jack Burke Jr. all have scores totaling 148. That matches the first part of the claim\u2014there are indeed three players with this score.\n\nNext, I check the 'place' column to determine their standings. All these three players are listed under \"t7,\" which I assume stands for tied at 7th place. Nowhere in the table do they have a position marked as \"1\" or \"winner.\" The top positions (t1) are occupied by Harvie Ward and Tommy Bolt, both with scores of 144.\n\nSince the claim states that these three players won the US Open with their score, but according to the table, they're all tied at 7th place, it's clear that this part of the claim is incorrect. Winning would imply a higher position, typically first place, which isn't reflected here.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider whether there are any other relevant cells or data points in the table that might affect this conclusion. The 'to par' column shows their scores relative to par, but since all three have the same score and tied positions, it doesn't change their standings.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the claim is incorrect because while they did achieve a score of 148, they didn't win; they were in 7th place.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that three players with a score of 148 won the 1955 US Open.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the lowest score at the us open in 1955 be a +3, which be achieve by 4 golfer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to:\n\n1. **Lowest Score**: The claim states that the lowest score was +3.\n2. **Achieved by 4 golfers**: Four different players achieved this score.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, it lists various places with scores and their respective 'to par' values. Let's go through each relevant part:\n\n- **To Par Column**: This shows how much each player was over or under par. The lower the number (closer to 0 or negative), the better the score.\n  \nLooking at the table:\n- The first two players, Harvie Ward and Tommy Bolt, both have a 'to par' of +4.\n- Then, Julius Boros, Jack Fleck, Ben Hogan, and Walker Inman Jr. all have +5.\n- Sam Snead, Bob Harris, and Jack Burke Jr. are at +8.\n- Gene Littler is at +9.\n\nSo the best (lowest) score in the table is +4, achieved by Harvie Ward and Tommy Bolt. \n\nThe claim mentions a +3, which isn't present in any of the rows. Therefore, there's no data supporting that the lowest score was +3. Additionally, even if we consider the closest, which is +4, only two players achieved this, not four.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: the supposed lowest score doesn't exist, and it wasn't achieved by four golfers.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the table shows that the lowest 'to par' was +4, achieved by two golfers, not +3 or four. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
