    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the barnsley game against bristol rover have the highest point differential\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify all the games mentioned. The relevant columns here are 'home team', 'away team', and 'score'. My goal is to calculate the point differential for each game and see which one has the highest difference.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. **Row 4**: Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers, score is 4-1. So, the differential here is 4 - 1 = +3.\n2. **Row 1**: Sheffield Wednesday vs Chelsea, score 0-1. Differential: 0 - 1 = -1.\n3. **Row 2**: Everton vs Coventry City, score 2-1. Differential: 2 - 1 = +1.\n4. **Row 3**: Newcastle United vs Blackburn Rovers, score 0-0. Differential: 0 - 0 = 0.\n5. **Replay row**: Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle United, score 0-1. Differential: 0 - 1 = -1.\n6. **Row 5**: Manchester United vs Fulham, score 1-0. Differential: 1 - 0 = +1.\n7. **Row 6**: Huddersfield Town vs Derby County, score 2-2. Differential: 2 - 2 = 0.\n8. **Replay row**: Derby County vs Huddersfield Town, score 3-1. Differential: 3 - 1 = +2.\n9. **Row 7**: Arsenal vs Sheffield United, score 2-1. Differential: 2 - 1 = +1.\n10. **Replay row**: Arsenal vs Sheffield United again, score 2-1. Same as before, differential is +1.\n11. **Row 8**: Leeds United vs Tottenham Hotspur, score 1-1. Differential: 0.\n12. **Replay row**: Tottenham Hotspur vs Leeds United, score 2-0. Differential: 2 - 0 = +2.\n\nNow, compiling the differentials:\n\n- Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers: +3\n- Everton vs Coventry City: +1\n- Manchester United vs Fulham: +1\n- Derby County replay: +2\n- Tottenham Hotspur replay: +2\n\nComparing all these, the highest differential is indeed +3 from the Barnsley game. No other game has a higher point differential than that.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because Barnsley's game against Bristol Rovers had the highest point difference of 3 points.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Barnsley scored 4 and Bristol Rovers scored 1 in their match, resulting in a point differential of +3. This is the highest differential compared to all other games listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"only 1 game end in a 0 to 0 tie during 1998-99 fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure and data. The columns are 'tie no', 'home team', 'score', 'away team', and 'attendance'. Each row represents a game in the FA Cup, with details about the teams, scores, dates, etc.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions games that ended in a 0-0 tie. So I need to check each row's 'score' column to see if any have a score of 0-0.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n1. Row 0: Score is 0-1. Not a tie.\n2. Row 1: Score is 2-1. Not a tie.\n3. Row 2: Score is 0-0. This is a tie.\n4. Replays (rows marked as 'replay') are additional matches played due to initial draws, so their scores might be different from the original games. I'll check them too:\n   - Row 3 replay: Score is 0-1. Not a tie.\n   - Row 6 replay: Score is 3-1. Not a tie.\n   - Row 9 replay: Score is 2-1 (original game was also 2-1, but the replay isn't a tie).\n   - Row 11 replay: Score is 2-0. Not a tie.\n\nFrom this, only row 2 has a score of 0-0. So there's exactly one game that ended in a 0-0 tie.\n\nThe claim says \"only 1 game,\" which matches what I found. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"6 game take place on 13 february 1999 during the 1998-99 fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It states that six games occurred on February 13, 1999, in the context of the 1998-99 FA Cup. So I need to check how many games were played on that specific date according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table's structure: each row represents a game with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and attendance (which includes the date). The rows are numbered from 1 onwards, but there's also a 'replay' row for some games.\n\nI'll go through each row and count how many have the attendance date as \"13 february 1999\".\n\n- Row 0: tie no 1, home team Sheffield Wednesday, score 0-1, away team Chelsea. Attendance is 13 Feb 1999.\n- Row 1: tie no 2, Everton vs Coventry City. Attendance date same as above.\n- Row 2: tie no 3, Newcastle United vs Blackburn Rovers. Date here is 14 Feb 1999.\n- Row 3: replay between Blackburn and Newcastle. Date is 24 Feb 1999.\n- Row 4: tie no 4, Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers. Attendance on 13 Feb.\n- Row 5: tie no 5, Manchester United vs Fulham. Date is 14 Feb.\n- Row 6: tie no 6, Huddersfield Town vs Derby County. Date 13 Feb.\n- Row 7: replay of Huddersfield vs Derby. Date 24 Feb.\n- Row 8: tie no 7, Arsenal vs Sheffield United. Date 13 Feb.\n- Row 9: replay of Arsenal vs Sheffield. Date 23 Feb.\n- Row 10: tie no 8, Leeds vs Tottenham. Date 13 Feb.\n- Row 11: replay of Tottenham vs Leeds. Date 24 Feb.\n\nNow, let's count the rows with attendance on 13 Feb:\n\nRow 0, Row 1, Row 4, Row 6, Row 8, and Row 10 all have 13 Feb as the date. That makes six games in total on that date.\n\nThe claim says \"6 game take place\", which matches our count of six games. However, I should also consider whether these are all part of the same FA Cup season. The table doesn't explicitly mention the season, but since all the games are listed under the same context and likely refer to a single tournament (FA Cup), it's reasonable to assume they're from the 1998-99 season as stated in the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are those in the 'attendance' column where the date is 13 Feb 1999.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"6 game be 1 by only 1 point during the 1998 - 99 fa cup.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like there might be some translation issues or typos here. Let me break it down:\n\n- \"6 game\": This likely refers to a specific game number 6 in the table.\n- \"be 1 by only 1 point\": This part is a bit unclear, but I think it means that the home team scored 1 goal and won by a margin of 1 point. In football (soccer), points are usually awarded based on wins, draws, etc., so a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 point each, and a loss gives 0.\n\nLooking at game number 6 in the table:\n\nRow index 5 corresponds to game 6. Let me check that row:\n- Home team: Huddersfield Town\n- Away team: Derby County\n- Score: 2 - 2\n\nSo, both teams scored 2 goals each, resulting in a draw. The attendance is listed as 13 February 1999.\n\nNow, the claim mentions \"6 game be 1 by only 1 point.\" If it's referring to Huddersfield Town (home team) winning by 1 goal, that doesn't match because it was a draw. Alternatively, maybe it's talking about the score being 1-0? But the score is 2-2.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps \"6 game be 1\" refers to the attendance date being February 1st or something similar, but the attendance column shows 13 February 1999 for game 6. So that doesn't fit either.\n\nAnother angle: maybe it's about the margin of victory. In a draw, neither team wins by any points, so the claim that someone won by only 1 point isn't accurate here because there was no winner; it was a tie.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows with the same date (13 February 1999), like game 1 and others, none have a score difference of just 1 goal except for game 2 where Everton beat Coventry City 2-1. But that's not game 6.\n\nAlso, considering replays: For example, game 6 had a replay on 24 February 1999 where Derby County won 3-1 against Huddersfield Town. So the initial match was a draw, and the replay decided the winner.\n\nGiven all this, the claim doesn't hold because in game 6 (row index 5), it was a draw, not a win by 1 point for either team. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"4 replay game occur during the 1998 - 99 fa cup\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a replay game is in the context of football tournaments like the FA Cup. A replay usually happens when the initial match ends in a draw, so another game is scheduled to determine the winner. In the table, replays are indicated with \"replay\" under the tie number column.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: tie no, home team, score, away team, attendance.\n- Each row represents either a regular match or a replay.\n\nI'll go through each row to identify how many replays there are.\n\n1. Row 0: Tie 1 - No replay, it's a regular game with Chelsea beating Sheffield Wednesday.\n2. Row 1: Tie 2 - Everton vs Coventry City, no replay here.\n3. Row 2: Tie 3 - Newcastle drew with Blackburn Rovers, so a replay was needed. This is the first replay.\n4. Row 3: Labelled as 'replay', this is the replay for Tie 3 between Blackburn and Newcastle. So that's one replay accounted for.\n5. Row 4: Tie 4 - Barnsley beat Bristol Rovers, no replay here.\n6. Row 5: Tie 5 - Manchester United won against Fulham, so no replay needed.\n7. Row 6: Tie 6 ended in a draw between Huddersfield and Derby County, leading to a replay. That's the second replay.\n8. Row 7: The replay for Tie 6 where Derby County beat Huddersfield. So that's accounted for as the second replay.\n9. Row 8: Tie 7 - Arsenal won against Sheffield United, so no replay here.\n10. Row 9: There's a replay for Tie 7 listed on February 23, 1999. That makes it the third replay.\nWait, but I thought only one replay was needed for each initial draw. Did they play two replays? That seems odd because typically, if the first replay is still a draw, another might occur, but in this table, both are listed as replays on different dates.\n\nHmm, maybe I should double-check that. Let me see: Tie 7 has an initial match on February 13 with Arsenal winning 2-1. Then there's another entry for the same tie (replay) on February 23, but it shows the same score, 2-1 for Arsenal. That might not make sense because if the first game was a win, why would they have a replay? Maybe that's an error in the table or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial match ended in a draw and then two replays were held. But looking at the scores: the initial is 2-1, which isn't a draw. So this might be a mistake because you don't have a replay if the first game wasn't a draw. Therefore, perhaps row 9 shouldn't be considered as a valid replay since it's not following an initial draw.\n\nContinuing:\n\n11. Row 10: Tie 8 ended in a draw between Leeds and Tottenham, leading to a replay. That's the third replay.\n12. Row 11: The replay for Tie 8 where Tottenham won against Leeds. So that's accounted for as the fourth replay.\n\nSo based on this analysis:\n\n- Replays occur at rows 3 (Tie 3), 7 (Tie 6), and 11 (Tie 8). That's three replays in total, not four. The row 9 might be an error because it seems to list a replay for a game that wasn't drawn.\n\nWait, but let me recount the replays:\n\n- Tie 3: Replayed on February 24, 1999 (row 3) \u2192 1\n- Tie 6: Replayed on February 24, 1999 (row 7) \u2192 2\n- Tie 8: Replayed on February 24, 1999 (row 11) \u2192 3\n\nThat's only three replays. So the claim says four replays occurred, but according to the table, there are three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe row 9 is a valid replay for Tie 7, even though it wasn't drawn in the initial game. That would make it four replays, which contradicts the usual FA Cup rules because replays only happen after draws. Therefore, I think that row 9 shouldn't be counted as a valid replay.\n\nThus, the total number of replays is three, not four. The claim says four, so it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows three replays: one for Tie 3, one for Tie 6, and one for Tie 8. Therefore, the claim stating four replays is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"tie no\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the barnsley game against bristol rover be on the same date as blackburn rover vs newcastle united\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like there's a typo with \"rover\" and \"rovers\", but I think it refers to Bristol Rovers and Blackburn Rovers. So, the claim is checking if Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers happened on the same date as Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle United.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to find both games mentioned in the claim and check their dates.\n\nStarting with Barnsley against Bristol Rovers: Scanning through the rows, I see a row where the home team is Barnsley. Let's check that:\n\nRow 4:\n- Home Team: Barnsley\n- Away Team: Bristol Rovers\n- Attendance Date: 13 February 1999\n\nNext, checking Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle United. The table has an entry for a replay between these two teams. Specifically, looking at the row with tie no \"replay\" and Home Team as Blackburn Rovers:\n\nRow 3 is the initial match where Newcaslte United played away against Blackburn Rovers on 14 February 1999, ending in a 0-0 draw. Then there's a replay on Row 4 (index starting from 0?), but actually, looking again, row indices start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nRow 3:\n- Tie no: 3\n- Home Team: Newcastle United\n- Away Team: Blackburn Rovers\n- Date: 14 February 1999\n\nThen there's a replay for this tie on Row 4 (index 3 if starting at 0? Wait, the table as given has rows from index 0 to 12. Let me list them:\n\nRow indices:\n0: Sheffield Wednesday vs Chelsea - 13 Feb\n1: Everton vs Coventry - 13 Feb\n2: Newcastle Utd vs Blackburn Rovers (initial) - 14 Feb\n3: Replay: Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle Utd - 24 Feb\n4: Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers - 13 Feb\n5: Man Utd vs Fulham - 14 Feb\n6: Huddersfield vs Derby - 13 Feb\n7: Replay: Derby vs Huddersfield - 24 Feb\n8: Arsenal vs Sheffield Utd - 13 Feb\n9: Replay: Arsenal vs Sheffield Utd - 23 Feb\n10: Leeds Utd vs Tottenham - 13 Feb\n11: Replay: Tottenham vs Leeds Utd - 24 Feb\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me recount properly:\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row is separated by |.\n\nSo rows are as follows (starting from index 0):\n\nRow 0:\ntie no 1: Sheffield Wednesday vs Chelsea on 13 Feb.\n\nRow 1:\ntie no 2: Everton vs Coventry City on 13 Feb.\n\nRow 2:\ntie no 3: Newcastle Utd vs Blackburn Rovers on 14 Feb.\n\nRow 3:\nreplay: Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle Utd on 24 Feb.\n\nRow 4:\ntie no 4: Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers on 13 Feb.\n\nRow 5:\ntie no 5: Man Utd vs Fulham on 14 Feb.\n\nRow 6:\ntie no 6: Huddersfield vs Derby on 13 Feb.\n\nRow 7:\nreplay: Derby vs Huddersfield on 24 Feb.\n\nRow 8:\ntie no 7: Arsenal vs Sheffield Utd on 13 Feb.\n\nRow 9:\nreplay: Arsenal vs Sheffield Utd on 23 Feb.\n\nRow 10:\ntie no 8: Leeds Utd vs Tottenham on 13 Feb.\n\nRow 11:\nreplay: Tottenham vs Leeds Utd on 24 Feb.\n\nWait, actually the table has 12 rows because the markdown shows from tie no 1 to 8 and replays in between. So the row indices would be:\n\n0: Tie 1\n1: Tie 2\n2: Tie3\n3: Replay of Tie3 (Blackburn vs Newcastle)\n4: Tie4\n5: Tie5\n6: Tie6\n7: Replay of Tie6 (Derby vs Huddersfield)\n8: Tie7\n9: Replay of Tie7 (Arsenal vs Sheffield)\n10: Tie8\n11: Replay of Tie8 (Tottenham vs Leeds)\n\nSo for the claim, we need to find:\n\n- Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers: That's row 4, tie no4. Date is 13 Feb.\n\n- Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle United: The initial match was on 14 Feb (row2), but there's a replay on row3, which is 24 Feb.\n\nThe claim says the Barnsley game is on the same date as the Blackburn vs Newcastle game. So Barnsley's game is on 13 Feb, while the initial Blackburn vs Newcastle was on 14 Feb, and the replay on 24 Feb.\n\nTherefore, the dates are different. The barnsley game is on 13 Feb, whereas the Blackburn Rovers vs Newcastle United (replay) is on 24 Feb. So they are not the same date.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Barnsley's game against Bristol Rovers occurred on the same date as the match between Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. According to the table:\n\n- Barnsley vs Bristol Rovers was held on 13 February 1999 (Row 4).\n- The initial match between Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers took place on 14 February 1999, with a replay on 24 February 1999.\n\nSince the dates do not match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row\": 4, \"column\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row\": 3, \"column\": \"Date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems to suggest that after February 24, 1999, the date February 13, 1999 had the most number of games played.

Does it mean comparing all dates after 24 Feb? Or is it saying that up until 24 Feb, which date had more?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim is \"after 24 february 1999, 13 february 1999 have the most amount of game.\" So does it mean after February 24 (i.e., dates later than that), or including up to Feb 24?\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the claim correctly. It says \"after 24 Feb 1999, 13 Feb has the most games.\" That could be ambiguous. Does it mean after February 24 (i.e., dates >24 Feb), or is it a typo and meant to say that including up until 24 Feb, which date had more?\n\nBut looking at the data, all games are on or before February 24. The latest date is Feb 24.\n\nSo, if we consider all games from the start up to after Feb 24 (which is not possible as it's the last date), perhaps the claim is comparing which date has more games when considering all dates up to and including Feb 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that on 13 Feb, there were more games than on 24 Feb. Let me see:\n\nFrom my earlier count:\n- 13 Feb: 6 games\n- 24 Feb: 3 games\n\nSo yes, 13 Feb has more games than 24 Feb.\n\nBut the claim says \"after 24 Feb, 13 Feb has the most.\" That might not make sense because after 24 Feb, there are no dates beyond that in the table. So perhaps it's a misstatement, and they meant to say that before or up to 24 Feb, 13 Feb had the most games.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is intended to mean that on 13 Feb, which was after some earlier date (like prior to Feb 13), but that doesn't fit well. Alternatively, perhaps it's a translation issue, and they meant \"as of 24 Feb, which date had the most games.\"\n\nGiven the data, 13 Feb has the highest number of games with 6, compared to other dates.\n\nSo, if the claim is interpreted as \"As of February 24, 1999, 13 February 1999 had the most amount of games,\" then it's TRUE because 13 Feb has more games than any other date up to that point.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 game in 14 february 1999 end in a tie\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two games that took place on February 14, 1999, and both ended in a tie. So I need to look through the table for any matches scheduled on that date where the score was a draw.\n\nLooking at the 'attendance' column which lists the dates, I see several entries for \"14 february 1999\". Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 3: Newcastle United vs Blackburn Rovers with a score of 0-0. That's a tie.\nReplay Row (row index 3): This is a replay between Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle, which happened on February 24, so not relevant here.\n\nNext, row 5: Manchester United vs Fulham ended 1-0, so no tie there.\n\nRow 8: Leeds United vs Tottenham with a score of 1-1. That's another tie.\nReplay Row (row index 8): This is on February 24 again, not relevant.\n\nSo, from the 'attendance' column, I find two games on February 14, 1999: one at row index 3 and another at row index 5. Wait, no\u2014actually, row 5's date is also February 14? Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices are zero-based. The first occurrence of 14 Feb is row 2 (third row), but looking back:\n\nWait the table rows are numbered as tie no: 1 to 8 and replays. So in markdown, the first row after headers is row index 0.\n\nLet me list all rows with \"14 february 1999\":\n\n- Row 3: Newcastle vs Blackburn (row index 2) \u2192 score 0-0.\n- Replays are separate entries but their dates are later. So in the main tie games, only row 3 is on Feb 14.\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at each row's 'attendance' column:\n\nRow 0: 13 Feb\nRow 1: 13 Feb\nRow 2: 14 Feb\nReplay (row index 3): 24 Feb\nRow 4: 13 Feb\nRow 5: 14 Feb \u2192 this is the game between Manchester United and Fulham, which ended 1-0, not a tie.\nRow 6: 13 Feb\nReplay row 7: 24 Feb\nRow 8: 13 Feb\nReplay row 9: 23 Feb\nRow 10: 13 Feb\nReplay row 11: 24 Feb\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all rows with \"14 february 1999\" in the 'attendance' column:\n\nLooking through each row's attendance:\n\n- Row index 2 (tie no 3) \u2192 14 Feb, score 0-0 (tie)\n- Row index 5 (tie no 5) \u2192 14 Feb, score 1-0 (not a tie)\n\nSo on February 14, there were two games: one that ended in a tie and another that didn't. The claim says both ended in a tie, which is false because only the Newcastle game was a tie.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim says \"2 game in 14 february 1999 end in a tie.\" So it's claiming there were two games on that date, both ending in ties. But looking at the data:\n\nOn Feb 14, 1999, there are two rows: row index 2 (tie no3) and row index5 (tie no5). \n\nRow index2: Newcastle vs Blackburn \u2192 0-0 tie.\nRow index5: Manchester United vs Fulham \u2192 1-0, not a tie.\n\nSo only one game ended in a tie. Therefore, the claim is false because it says both games ended in ties when actually one did and the other didn't.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Is there another game on Feb 14? Let's count:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow0: 13\nRow1:13\nRow2:14 \u2192 tie\nReplay row3:24\nRow4:13\nRow5:14 \u2192 not a tie\nRow6:13\nReplay row7:24\nRow8:13\nReplay row9:23\nRow10:13\nReplay row11:24\n\nSo only two games on Feb14, one tie and one not. So the claim is FALSE because it's saying both ended in a tie when only one did.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two games on February 14, 1999, ended in ties. Reviewing the table, there were indeed two games on that date: Newcastle vs Blackburn (0-0) and Manchester United vs Fulham (1-0). Only one was a tie, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"all the replay game happen in the same day\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows in the table are replays. Looking at the 'tie no' column, I see entries labeled as 'replay'. So, let's list those:\n\n- The fourth row (index 3) is a replay between Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United.\n- The sixth row (index 5) is another replay between Derby County and Huddersfield Town.\n- The tenth row (index 9) has a replay between Arsenal and Sheffield United.\n- The twelfth row (index 11) shows a replay involving Tottenham Hotspur and Leeds United.\n\nNext, for each of these replays, I need to check the 'attendance' column, which actually represents the date in this context. Let's see the dates:\n\n- For the first replay (row 3), the date is 24 February 1999.\n- The second replay (row 5) has a date of 24 February 1999 as well.\n- The third replay (row 9) took place on 23 February 1999.\n- The fourth replay (row 11) was also on 24 February 1999.\n\nWait, so the first three replays have dates on 24th or 23rd. Specifically, row 9 has a date of 23rd, which is different from the others that are on the 24th. That means not all replay games happened on the same day. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to check are each replay's attendance (date) column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"tie no 5 have the same score for both team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"tie no 5\"\u2014I think that refers to the row in the table where tie no is 5. Looking at the table, I see several rows with numbers under \"tie no\". So, I need to find the row where tie no is 5.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: tie no 1\n- Row 1: tie no 2\n- Row 2: tie no 3\n- Row 3: replay (not a number)\n- Row 4: tie no 4\n- Row 5: tie no 5 \u2013 this is the row we're interested in.\n  \nSo, the relevant row is row index 5. Now, checking what's in that row:\n\n| tie no    | home team            | score    | away team          | attendance        |\n|:---------|:--------------------|:--------|:------------------|:-----------------|\n| 5         | manchester united    | 1  - 0   | fulham             | 14 february 1999 |\n\nThe claim says that \"tie no 5 have the same score for both team.\" So, we're looking at the 'score' column in this row. The score is listed as \"1  - 0\". That means Manchester United scored 1 goal and Fulham scored 0 goals.\n\nWait a minute, if the scores are 1-0, that means they aren't the same. One team scored once, and the other didn't score at all. So the claim is saying both teams have the same score, but in reality, one has 1 and the other 0. Therefore, the scores are not the same.\n\nSo, I should check if the 'score' column for tie no 5 shows equal points. It doesn't\u2014it's 1-0, which isn't a draw or equal.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because the two teams didn't have the same score in that match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to tie number 5, where Manchester United and Fulham played. The score was 1-0, so they did not have the same score.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
