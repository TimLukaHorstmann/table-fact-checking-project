    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"art attack be originally broadcast on citv\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nLooking at the table headers: programme, date(s) of original removal, original channel(s), date of return, new channel(s). So for each programme listed, we have information about when it was removed originally, which channels it was on initially, when it came back, and where it returned to.\n\nThe claim is about \"art attack\" being originally broadcast on CITV. To verify this, I should look at the row corresponding to \"art attack\" in the table.\n\nFrom the table:\n- programme: art attack\n- original channel(s): citv\n\nSo, the original channel for \"art attack\" is indeed CITV. That matches exactly with the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table. The row index for \"art attack\" is 3 (since rows are zero-indexed: celebrity big brother is 0, big brother 1, absolutely fabulous 2, art attack 3). The column we're interested in is \"original channel(s)\" because that's where the original broadcast information is located.\n\nSo the relevant cell is row_index 3 and column_name \"original channel (s)\". \n\nI think that covers everything needed to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"art attack\" was originally broadcast on CITV. Checking the table, under the \"original channel(s)\" for \"art attack,\" it's listed as CITV. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"original channel (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"big brother will return on september 9, 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify the row that corresponds to \"big brother\". Scanning the programme column, I see it's the second row (index 1). The relevant columns for this claim are \"date of return\" and \"original channel(s)\", since the claim mentions when it will return.\n\nLooking at the \"date of return\" for big brother, it says September 9, 2011. That matches exactly with what the claim states. So that's a positive sign. \n\nNext, I check the original channels to make sure there's no confusion. The original channel is listed as Channel 4. But in this case, since the claim only mentions the return date and not the new channel, the channel information isn't directly relevant unless it affects the return date. However, looking at the \"new channel(s)\" column for big brother shows it returned to Channel 5. Wait a minute, that's different from the original channel.\n\nBut the claim doesn't mention the channel; it only talks about the date. So as long as the date matches, the channel change doesn't impact the truth of the claim regarding the return date. Therefore, the key point is whether big brother indeed returned on September 9, 2011, which according to the table, it did.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim's main assertion about the return date being September 9, 2011, is correct as per the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim \"big brother will return on september 9, 2011\" is supported by the table. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"born to be different will return on august 18 , 2011\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row in the table that corresponds to \"born to be different.\" Scanning through the programme column, I find it at row index 4 (since indexing starts at 0). \n\nNext, I need to check the return date for this programme. The relevant column is \"date of return.\" Looking at the value there, it says September 9, 2011. \n\nThe claim states that the return date is August 18, 2011. Comparing this with the table's information, the dates don't match. The correct return date according to the table is September 9th, not August 18th.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the return date doesn't align with what's provided in the table. \n\nTo summarize:\n- Programme: Born to be Different (Row 4)\n- Date of Return: September 9, 2011\n- Claimed Return Date: August 18, 2011\n\nSince these dates don't match, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"programme\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date of return\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
