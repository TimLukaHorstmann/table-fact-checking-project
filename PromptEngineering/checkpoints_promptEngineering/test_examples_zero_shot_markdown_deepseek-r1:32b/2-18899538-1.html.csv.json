    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's figure out whether the claim \"the home media center have no o x\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It seems like there might be a typo. The phrase \"no o x\" probably refers to whether \"os x\" is supported. So, the claim is likely asking if Home Media Center does not support OS X.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns for each operating system: \"os x\", \"unix - like\", and \"windows\". Each row represents a different media server or player with their respective supports listed under these columns.\n\nI need to locate the row for \"home media center\". Scanning through the rows, I find that it's on row index 10 (assuming counting starts at 0). The entry in the \"os x\" column for this row is \"no\", which means Home Media Center does not support OS X.\n\nTo confirm, the relevant cell is under the \"os x\" column. So, the claim is TRUE because the table indicates that Home Media Center has no support for OS X.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"os x\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"coherence have partial window\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row corresponding to \"coherence\". Scanning through the table, I see that \"coherence\" is listed in the second row (row index 3 because counting starts at 0). \n\nNext, I need to check what the claim is about. The claim says that coherence has a partial window. Looking at the columns available, there's no direct column named \"window\". However, there is a column labeled \"windows\" which likely refers to Windows OS support.\n\nIn the row for coherence, under the \"windows\" column, it shows \"partial\". This means that coherence provides partial support for Windows. The claim mentions \"partial window\", which I interpret as referring to partial Windows support.\n\nSince the table indicates that coherence does have partial Windows support, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that coherence has partial support on Windows. Checking the table, coherence's row shows 'partial' under the 'windows' column, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"windows\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"lgplv2 be the license for rygel\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: name, license, os x, unix-like, windows, web interface. My focus is on the 'license' column because the claim is about the license of a specific software named rygel.\n\nI'll scan through each row in the 'name' column to find where it says \"rygel\". Looking down the list:\n\n- Row 32: name is \"rygel\", and the corresponding license is listed as \"lgplv2\".\n\nSo, the claim states that rygel uses lgplv2 as its license. According to the table, this matches exactly.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other entries for rygel in the table. Scanning through, I don't see any duplicates, so it's clear and straightforward.\n\nTherefore, since the table confirms that rygel has the lgplv2 license, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 32,\n       \"column_name\": \"license\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the home media center have no os x and window\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that Home Media Center doesn't support OS X and Windows. Wait, actually, looking at it again: \"have no os x and window\". That could be a bit ambiguous. It might mean that it has neither OS X nor Windows support. So I need to check both the 'os x' and 'windows' columns for Home Media Center.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll scan each row until I find \"home media center\" in the name column. Let me go through them:\n\n1. 360 media server\n2. avia media player\n3. brisa\n4. coherence\n5. divx\n6. elgato eyeconnect\n7. foobar2000\n8. fuppes\n9. geexbox ushare\n10. gmediaserver\n11. home media center\n\nOkay, there it is at row index 11 (if we start counting from 0). Now, let's look at the relevant columns: 'os x' and 'windows'.\n\nFor the 'os x' column in that row, the value is \"no\". So Home Media Center does not support OS X.\n\nNext, for the 'windows' column, the value is \"yes\". Wait a minute\u2014that means it does support Windows. But the claim says it has no OS X and window (Windows). Since the Windows column is \"yes\", that contradicts the claim.\n\nSo the claim is saying Home Media Center doesn't have OS X (which is correct) and doesn't have Windows (which is incorrect because it does have Windows support). Therefore, the entire claim isn't true. The presence of Windows support makes the claim FALSE.\n\nTo structure this in the required JSON format, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- For 'os x', row index 11.\n- For 'windows', row index 11.\n\nSo the answer should be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells are both columns for row 11.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Home Media Center lacks support for both OS X and Windows. Checking the table, Home Media Center supports Windows but not OS X. Since it does have Windows support, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"os x\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"windows\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"gpl be the license for rygel\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by understanding the claim. It states that the software called \"rygel\" has a license named gpl.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the row where the name is \"rygel\". Scanning down the 'name' column, I spot \"rygel\" at row index 31 (since counting starts from 0). \n\nNext, I check the 'license' column for that row. The entry says \"lgplv2\". So, the license isn't just gpl; it's lgplv2, which is a variant of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.\n\nNow, considering if \"gpl\" alone would be correct. Since the license listed is more specific (lgplv2), using only \"gpl\" might not fully capture the actual license used by rygel. Therefore, the claim isn't entirely accurate because it doesn't mention the ' Lesser' part or the version number.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"coherence be the name when window and web interface be partial\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"coherence\" as the name. Looking at the table, I see that \"coherence\" is one of the entries under the 'name' column. So, I'll need to find the row where the name is coherence.\n\nNext, the condition says \"when window and web interface be partial.\" That means I should check two columns: 'windows' and 'web interface'. The claim states that both should be 'partial'.\n\nLet me go through each step carefully.\n\n1. **Locate the row for Coherence:**\n   Scanning the table, I find that coherence is in row index 3 (since counting starts from 0). Let's note down the relevant columns for this row:\n   - os x: partial\n   - unix-like: partial\n   - windows: partial\n   - web interface: yes\n\n2. **Check Windows and Web Interface columns:**\n   The claim specifies that both 'windows' and 'web interface' should be 'partial'. Looking at the coherence row:\n   - 'windows' is marked as 'partial'.\n   - However, 'web interface' is marked as 'yes', not 'partial'.\n\n3. **Evaluate the condition:**\n   For the claim to hold true, both specified columns need to meet the condition of being 'partial'. But in this case, while 'windows' is indeed partial, 'web interface' is 'yes', which does not match the required condition.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Since one of the conditions isn't met (web interface is yes instead of partial), the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, after carefully checking each part of the claim against the table data, I determine that the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"windows\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"web interface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
