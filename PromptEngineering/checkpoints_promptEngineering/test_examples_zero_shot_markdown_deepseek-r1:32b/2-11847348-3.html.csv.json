The columns are 'name', 'league', 'fa cup', 'league cup', and 'total'. The row indices start from 0.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: that bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals in the league, and that he is the only player who did so.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll find the row for bok\u0161i\u0107. From the markdown table, it's the first row:\n\n| name       |   league  |   fa cup  |   league cup  |   total  |\n|:----------|---------:|---------:|-------------:|--------:|\n| bok\u0161i\u0107     |        8  |        0  |            0  |       8 |\n\nSo, under 'league', bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 goals. That part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, I need to verify if he's the only player with exactly 8 league goals. Scanning down the 'league' column:\n\n- whelan: 4\n- n\u00e9meth: 3\n- ince: 2\n- cooper: 2\n- queudrue: 2\n- marinelli: 2\n- mustoe: 2\n- deane:1, johnston:1, greening:1, stockdale:1, festa:1, windass:1, southgate:1, carbone:1, ehiogu:1, murphy:0, wilson:0, cambell:0, own goals:1\n\nSo, looking through all the 'league' column values, only bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8. All others have less or equal to 8, but no one else has exactly 8.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in the fa cup\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Whelan is the sole player who scored exactly three goals in the FA Cup. So, I have to check two things: \n\n1. Does Whelan have 3 goals in the FA Cup?\n2. Is he the only one with exactly 3 goals there?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player and their performance across various competitions: league, FA cup, league cup, and total goals.\n\nLet's locate Whelan in the table. Scanning through the \"name\" column, I see that Whelan is on row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed; row 0 is Bok\u0161i\u0107, so row 1 is Whelan). The columns to focus on here are \"fa cup\" and \"total.\"\n\nFor Whelan:\n- FA Cup: 3 goals\n- Total: 7 goals\n\nSo, Whelan did score 3 goals in the FA Cup. Now, I need to check if he's the only one with exactly 3 goals there.\n\nLooking at the \"fa cup\" column for all players:\n\nBok\u0161i\u0107: 0\nwhelan: 3\nn\u00e9meth: 1\nince: 1\ncooper: 0\nqueudrue: 0\nmarinelli: 0\nmustoe: 0\ndeane: 0\njohnston: 0\ngreening: 0\nstockdale: 0\nfesta: 0\nwindass: 0\nsouthgate: 0\ncarbone: 0\nehiogu: 0\nmurphy: 0 (but he has 1 in league cup)\nwilson: 0 (also 1 in league cup)\ncambell: 1\nown goals: 1\n\nFrom this, the only player with exactly 3 FA Cup goals is Whelan. All others have either 0 or 1 goal in the FA Cup. Therefore, he's the sole player with that exact number.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"total\" column for all players:\n- Whelan has a total of 7 goals.\nOthers like Bok\u0161i\u0107 have higher totals but not specifically 3 in FA Cup.\n\nSo both conditions are met: Whelan scored 3 FA Cup goals and no one else did. The claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that Whelan is the only player with exactly 3 goals in the FA Cup, and no other player has this exact number.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

For cambell, the value under \"league\" is 0. For ehiogu, it's also 0. \n\nThe claim states that cambell scored one less goal than ehiogu in the league. If both have 0 goals, then the difference isn't 1; it's actually 0. So, the statement isn't accurate because they both have the same number of league goals.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other columns that might affect this comparison. The table includes \"fa cup,\" \"league cup,\" and \"total\" columns, but since the claim is about the league specifically, those other columns aren't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the \"league\" column for both cambell and ehiogu, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It mentions four players\u2014Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue\u2014and claims that each of them scored a total of two goals. I'll need to check each of these names in the table to see their respective \"total\" goals.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. The relevant column here is \"total\" as that's where the number of goals scored by each player is listed.\n\nStarting with Cooper. I'll search for \"cooper\" in the name column. Found him at row index 4 (since counting starts from 0). The total goals for Cooper are 2. So far, so good.\n\nNext, Marinelli. He's at row index 6. His total is also 2. Still on track.\n\nThen Mustoe. Checking row index 7, his total is 2 as well. This is consistent with the claim.\n\nLastly, Queudrue. Looking at row index 5, his total goals are 2.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"bok\u0161i\u0107 be 1 of 3 player to score 8 goal in the league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions that bok\u0161i\u0107 is one of three players who scored 8 goals in the league. So, I need to check two things: \n\n1. How many goals did bok\u0161i\u0107 score in the league?\n2. How many other players also scored exactly 8 goals?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective stats. The columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total.\n\nStarting with bok\u0161i\u0107's entry: I'll check his \"league\" column value. From the first row, under the \"league\" column, it shows 8. So, bok\u0161i\u0107 scored 8 goals in the league. That part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to verify if there are exactly two other players who also have 8 goals in the league.

This means that only one player (bok\u0161i\u0107) scored 8 goals in the league.\n\nTherefore, the claim that he's one of three players is incorrect because there are actually zero others with that same number.

So, the claim is: \"whelan be the only player to score 3 goal in any competition.\" I need to check if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are name, league, fa cup, league cup, and total. So, each row represents a player's performance across different competitions, with the totals summed up in the 'total' column.\n\nThe claim mentions that Whelan scored 3 goals in any competition. I'm assuming \"any competition\" refers to either league, FA Cup, or League Cup. But looking at the table, under 'fa cup', Whelan has a value of 3. So, he scored 3 goals in the FA Cup.\n\nNow, the claim says he's the only player with this achievement. I need to check if any other players have exactly 3 goals across any single competition or in total.\n\nLooking at each player:\n\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107: League - 8, FA Cup - 0, League Cup - 0. Total is 8.\n- Whelan: League -4, FA Cup -3, League Cup -0. Total is7.\n- N\u00e9meth: League-3, FA Cup-1, League Cup-2. Total is6.\n- Ince: League-2, FA Cup-1, League Cup-0. Total is3.\n- Cooper: All competitions have 2 or less.\n- Queudrue: Same as Cooper.\n- Marinelli: Same.\n- Mustoe: Same.\n- Deane and others below him: Most have totals of 1.\n\nSo, the only other player with a total above 3 is Bok\u0161i\u0107 (8), Whelan (7), N\u00e9meth (6). But their individual competition goals are either higher or lower than 3. Looking at each column:\n\n- League: The highest is 8 (Bok\u0161i\u0107), others have less.\n- FA Cup: Only Whelan has exactly 3, others have less.\n- League Cup: N\u00e9meth has 2, which is the highest there.\n\nSo, in terms of any single competition, only Whelan scored exactly 3 goals. However, Bok\u0161i\u0107 has more than 3 in the league, but not exactly 3. Therefore, if we interpret \"any competition\" as in at least one competition having 3 goals, then Whelan is unique because he's the only one with exactly 3 in FA Cup.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"score 3 goal in any competition.\" So, it could be interpreted that he scored 3 goals across all competitions. But looking at the 'total' column, his total is7. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the claim refers to scoring exactly 3 in a single competition.\n\nGiven the table, Whelan's FA Cup is 3. No other player has exactly 3 in any single competition. Bok\u0161i\u0107 has 8 in league, which is more than 3. Others have less. So yes, Whelan is the only one with exactly 3 goals in a single competition.\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Whelan is the only player to score exactly 3 goals in any competition.

Let me recount the rows carefully:\n\nThe table starts with bok\u0161i\u0107 at row 0, then whelan (1), n\u00e9meth (2), ince (3), cooper (4), queudrue (5), marinelli (6), mustoe (7), deane (8), johnston (9), greening (10), stockdale (11), festa (12), windass (13), southgate (14), carbone (15), ehiogu (16?), wait\u2014no, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me list the rows with their indices:\n\nRow 0: bok\u0161i\u0107\nRow 1: whelan\nRow 2: n\u00e9meth\nRow 3: ince\nRow 4: cooper\nRow 5: queudrue\nRow 6: marinelli\nRow 7: mustoe\nRow 8: deane\nRow 9: johnston\nRow 10: greening\nRow 11: stockdale\nRow 12: festa\nRow 13: windass\nRow 14: southgate\nRow 15: carbone\nRow 16: ehiogu\nRow 17: murphy\nRow 18: wilson\nRow 19: cambell\n\nSo, cambell is at row index 19.\n\nLooking at cambell's \"league\" value: It's 0.\n\nehiogu is at row index 16. His \"league\" value is 1.\n\nTherefore, cambell scored 0 goals in the league, while ehiogu scored 1 goal in the league. Since they are not equal, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait\u2014wait another moment. Let me check if I got the rows correct because sometimes markdown tables can be tricky. Looking back:\n\nThe table lists \"cambell\" at row index 20? Wait no\u2014let's recount properly starting from 0:\n\nRow indices and names:\n\n0: bok\u0161i\u0107\n1: whelan\n2: n\u00e9meth\n3: ince\n4: cooper\n5: queudrue\n6: marinelli\n7: mustoe\n8: deane\n9: johnston\n10: greening\n11: stockdale\n12: festa\n13: windass\n14: southgate\n15: carbone\n16: ehiogu\n17: murphy\n18: wilson\n19: cambell\n\nYes, so cambell is at row 19. The \"league\" column for cambell is 0.\n\nehiogu is at row 16 with a league value of 1.\n\nThus, the claim that they scored the same number of goals in the league is incorrect because 0 \u2260 1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both cambell and ehiogu have the same number of goals in the league. By examining the table, we find that cambell has 0 goals in the league, while ehiogu has 1 goal. Since these values are not equal, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"cooper , marinelli  , mustoe  and queudrue be the only player to score 2 or more goal\". So, we're looking for players who have scored 2 or more goals in total. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row under the 'total' column since that's where the overall goals are listed.\n\nStarting with the first few rows:\n- Bok\u0161i\u0107 has a total of 8 goals.\n- Whelan has 7, which is more than 2.\n- N\u00e9meth has 6.\n- Ince has 3.\n- Then we have Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue each with a 'total' of 2.\n\nSo far, the players with 2 or more goals include Bok\u0161i\u0107, Whelan, N\u00e9meth, Ince, Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue. \n\nWait, that's more than just Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue. The claim says they are the only ones with 2 or more goals, but actually, there are others who have scored more.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not accurate because other players have scored more than two goals. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly identifies Cooper, Marinelli, Mustoe, and Queudrue as the only players with 2 or more goals when in fact, there are others like Bok\u0161i\u0107, Whelan, N\u00e9meth, and Ince who have scored significantly more.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
