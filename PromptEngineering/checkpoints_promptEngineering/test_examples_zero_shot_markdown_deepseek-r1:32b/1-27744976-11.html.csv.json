    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about Kevin Martin's scoring in the given table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"Kevin Martin scored the highest amount of points singularly for all of the game except the game on April 9.\" This means that in every game listed in the table except the one on April 9, Kevin Martin had the highest point total compared to other players mentioned in each row's \"high points\" column.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns here are \"date\" and \"high points\". Each row lists who scored the most points in that game, along with their points.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. **Game 76 (April 1)**: High points are Kevin Martin with 33. This supports the claim.\n2. **Game 77 (April 3)**: Again, Kevin Martin leads with 35 points. Supports the claim.\n3. **Game 78 (April 5)**: Kevin Martin scores 30, which is higher than others mentioned. Still supporting.\n4. **Game 79 (April 6)**: Kevin Martin has 21 points, still the highest in that game. Claim holds here too.\n5. **Game 80 (April 9)**: This row mentions Chase Budinger, Kevin Martin, and Brad Miller all with 16 points each. Since it's a tie, Kevin Martin isn't the sole highest scorer here. This is the exception as per the claim.\n6. **Game 81 (April 11)**: Kevin Martin scores 28 points, which is higher than others. Supports the claim.\n\nSo, in all games except April 9, Kevin Martin either has the highest or tied for the highest. However, the claim specifies \"singularly\" and \"highest amount of point singularly,\" implying he was the sole leader each time. Since on April 9 there's a tie, that game is correctly excluded as per the claim.\n\nThus, the claim seems accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the game with the highest attendance be at the toyota center on april 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the game held at Toyota Center on April 9 had the highest attendance among all the games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location and attendance, record. The relevant column here is \"location attendance\", which shows how many people attended each game.\n\nI'll need to check the \"date\" and \"location attendance\" for the specific game on April 9 at Toyota Center. Also, I should compare this attendance number with others in the table to confirm if it's indeed the highest.\n\nStarting by scanning through each row:\n\n- Game 76: April 1, Toyota Center, attendance 18059\n- Game 77: April 3, Toyota Center, attendance 15993\n- Game 78: April 5, Toyota Center, attendance 15523\n- Game 79: April 6, New Orleans Arena, attendance 12728\n- Game 80: April 9, Toyota Center, attendance 18089\n- Game 81: April 11, Toyota Center, attendance 14898\n\nSo the claim is about April 9 at Toyota Center. That's game number 80 with an attendance of 18089.\n\nNow, let's compare this to all other games:\n\nGame 76 has 18059, which is just a bit less than 18089.\nOther games have lower attendances: 15993, 15523, 12728, and 14898.\n\nSo game 80 on April 9 at Toyota Center has the highest attendance of 18089. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the game on April 9 at Toyota Center had the highest attendance with 18089 attendees compared to all other listed games.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The claim is: \"luis scola score the highest number of high rebound in game 76 on april 1.\" I need to check if this is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', and specific columns for high points, rebounds, and assists. The claim mentions high rebounds in game 76 on April 1, so I need to focus on that row.\n\nLooking at row index 0 (since counting starts from 0), the game number is 76, date is April 1. Under 'high rebounds', it says luis scola with 14 rebounds. \n\nNow, the claim states that Luis Scola scored the highest number of high rebounds in that game. From the table, yes, he has the highest rebounds at 14 for that particular game. There's no other player listed under high rebounds in that row except him.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The relevant cell is in row 0 under 'high rebounds'. Since Luis Scola did have the highest rebounds with 14, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The claim states that Goran Dra\u017ei\u0107 does not hold the highest assists in any of the games that took place before April 9th. So, my task is to check each game before April 9 and see if there's a game where Goran had the most assists.\n\nLooking at the table, it has multiple columns including 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', 'high points', 'high rebounds', 'high assists', etc. The relevant column here is \"high assists\".\n\nI need to examine each row (each game) and check the dates. Any games before April 9 are of interest because the claim refers to that timeframe.\n\nLet me list out all the rows with their details:\n\n1. Game 76: April 1\n2. Game 77: April 3\n3. Game 78: April 5\n4. Game 79: April 6\n5. Game 80: April 9 (This is the cutoff date, so games before this are up to April 6)\n6. Game 81: April 11\n\nSo, the games before April 9 are games 76-79.\n\nNow, let's look at the 'high assists' column for each of these games:\n\n- Game 76 (April 1): Luis Scola with 6\n- Game 77 (April 3): Kyle Lowry with 8\n- Game 78 (April 5): Kyle Lowry with 9\n- Game 79 (April 6): Courtney Lee and Kyle Lowry both have 6\n\nIn all these games, Goran Dra\u017ei\u0107 isn't listed as the player with the highest assists. The high assists are from other players like Kyle Lowry or others.\n\nWait, but looking at game 80 (April 9), Goran Dra\u017ei\u0107 has 7 assists. However, since April 9 is not before April 9, it doesn't count for this claim.\n\nSo, in all the games before April 9, Goran didn't have the highest assists. Therefore, the claim that \"goran dragi\u0107 do not have the most high assist in any game before april 9\" is TRUE because he never had the highest assists in those earlier games.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"there be 3191 more people in attendance at the game versus the la clipper than at the game versus dallas.\" \n\nFirst, I should find the relevant games in the table. Let's look for the games against LA Clippers and Dallas.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Game 80 is against LA Clippers on April 9. The location attendance is listed as toyota center 18089.\n- Game 81 is against Dallas on April 11. The location attendance is toyota center 14898.\n\nSo, I need to compare these two attendances. \n\nCalculating the difference: 18089 (LA Clippers) minus 14898 (Dallas). Let's do that math:\n\n18089 - 14898 = 3191\n\nHmm, exactly 3191 more people attended the game against LA Clippers than Dallas. \n\nSo, the claim is correct because the difference matches. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, to find the relevant cells:\n\n- For the LA Clippers game: row index 4 (since counting starts at 0), column 'location attendance'.\n- For the Dallas game: row index 5, same column.\n\nSo, I'll note these two cells as relevant.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Games:**\n   - Locate games against LA Clippers and Dallas in the table.\n\n2. **Extract Attendance Numbers:**\n   - Game vs. LA Clippers (Row 4): 18089 attendees.\n   - Game vs. Dallas (Row 5): 14898 attendees.\n\n3. **Calculate Difference:**\n   - Subtract Dallas attendance from LA Clippers attendance: 18089 - 14898 = 3191.\n\n4. **Verify Claim Accuracy:**\n   - The claim states exactly 3191 more people attended the LA Clippers game, which matches the calculation.\n\n5. **Determine Answer and Relevant Cells:**\n   - Since the numbers support the claim, answer is TRUE.\n   - Highlight the attendance cells for both games as relevant.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"Brad Miller scored the highest amount of points singularly for all of the game except the game on April 11.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It suggests that in every game except the one on April 11, Brad Miller had the highest individual scoring. I'll need to check each row (game) and see who led in points.\n\nLooking at the table columns: The \"high points\" column lists players with their point totals for each game. Each row represents a different game, so I should examine this column across all rows except April 11.\n\nLet's go through each game:\n\n1. **April 1 (Row 0):** High points are Kevin Martin (33). Brad Miller isn't listed here.\n2. **April 3 (Row 1):** Again, Kevin Martin leads with 35 points.\n3. **April 5 (Row 2):** Kevin Martin scores 30 points.\n4. **April 6 (Row 3):** Kevin Martin has 21 points.\n5. **April 9 (Row 4):** This is where it's mentioned that Brad Miller scored along with Chase Budinger and Kevin Martin, each getting 16 points. Wait, so in this game, multiple players tied for the highest, including Brad Miller.\n6. **April 11 (Row 5):** High points are Kevin Martin again with 28.\n\nThe claim says Brad Miller scored the highest except on April 11. But looking at April 9, he was one of the top scorers but not singularly the highest since others also had the same points. So in that game, it's a tie, meaning Brad didn't have the highest singularly.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't true because in all other games except April 11, Brad Miller wasn't the sole top scorer. Only on April 9 did he share the high points with others.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Brad Miller only tied for the highest points in one game and didn't lead singularly in any except possibly April 9, which still was a tie.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"the game with the highest attendance be at the new orleans arena on april 6\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It states that the game with the highest attendance occurred at the New Orleans Arena on April 6. So, I need to check two things: what was the attendance for the game on April 6 at New Orleans Arena, and whether that's the highest attendance in the entire table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game. The columns include details like game number, date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, record, etc. Specifically, the \"location attendance\" column seems to indicate both where the game was played and how many people attended.\n\nI'll go through each row to find all the attendances:\n\n- Row 0 (Game 76): April 1 at Toyota Center with 18,059 attendees.\n- Row 1 (Game 77): April 3 at Toyota Center with 15,993 attendees.\n- Row 2 (Game 78): April 5 at Toyota Center with 15,523 attendees.\n- Row 3 (Game 79): April 6 at New Orleans Arena with 12,728 attendees.\n- Row 4 (Game 80): April 9 at Toyota Center with 18,089 attendees.\n- Row 5 (Game 81): April 11 at Toyota Center with 14,898 attendees.\n\nNow, I need to find the highest attendance. Looking at the numbers:\n\n- The attendances are: 18,059; 15,993; 15,523; 12,728; 18,089; and 14,898.\n\nThe two highest attendances are 18,059 (Game 76) and 18,089 (Game 80). Comparing these, 18,089 is higher. So the highest attendance is on April 9 at Toyota Center with 18,089 attendees.\n\nThe claim says that the highest attendance was at New Orleans Arena on April 6. But according to the table, the attendance there was only 12,728, which isn't even close to being the highest. The highest attendances were both at Toyota Center on different dates (April 1 and April 9), with Game 80 having the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the game with the highest attendance wasn't in New Orleans; it was in Toyota Center on a different date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"kyle lowry have the lowest assist in game on april 3 and april 5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It states that Kyle Lowry had the lowest assists in both games on April 3rd and April 5th. To verify this, I need to check the relevant cells in the table for those dates under the \"high assists\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns include \"date\", \"team\", \"score\", \"high points\", \"high rebounds\", \"high assists\", and others.\n- Each row represents a game with its details.\n\nNow, I'll locate the rows corresponding to April 3rd and April 5th.\n\nFor April 3rd (Row 1):\n- The \"high assists\" column shows \"kyle lowry 8\".\n\nFor April 5th (Row 2):\n- The \"high assists\" column lists \"kyle lowry 9\".\n\nThe claim is about Kyle Lowry having the lowest assists on these two dates. To assess this, I need to compare his assist counts with those of other players in the same games.\n\nIn Row 1 (April 3rd), the only listed high assist is Kyle Lowry with 8. Since there's no mention of another player with more or fewer assists, it implies that 8 was the highest assist count for that game. However, the claim refers to having the lowest, which doesn't align because if he had the highest, he can't simultaneously have the lowest unless it's a tie, but the table only lists him.\n\nSimilarly, in Row 2 (April 5th), Kyle Lowry has 9 assists. Again, there are no other players listed for high assists in that row, so he is the top assist-getter. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the lowest\" which would mean he had fewer than others. However, if his name is under \"high assists,\" it suggests he had the highest number of assists in those games. Therefore, Kyle Lowry having the highest assists contradicts the claim that he had the lowest.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misread. Let me check again. The column is \"high assists,\" meaning players who led their teams in assists for each game. So if Kyle's name is listed there with 8 and 9, those are the highest assist counts in their respective games. Therefore, he did not have the lowest; instead, he had the highest.\n\nSo, the claim that Kyle Lowry had the lowest assists on April 3rd and 5th is incorrect because the table shows him as having the highest assists on both dates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because in both April 3rd and April 5th games, Kyle Lowry led with the most assists, not the fewest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim: \"luis scola score the highest number of high rebound in game 54 on april 3.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look for game 54 on April 3 in the table. The games are numbered from 76 to 81, so game 54 isn't listed here. That might already make the claim false, but let me check other parts too.\n\nThe claim mentions Luis Scola having the highest rebounds in that game. Looking at the \"high rebounds\" column, I see for each game who had the most rebounds. For example, on April 1 (game 76), Luis Scola had 14 rebounds. On April 3 (game 77), Chuck Hayes had 12. The table doesn't include game 54 at all.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the game number? But according to the data provided, games start from 76 onwards, so game 54 isn't present. Therefore, the claim is referencing a game that's not in this table, which means we can't confirm it as TRUE. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, looking at April 3 (game 77), the highest rebounds were by Chuck Hayes with 12, not Luis Scola.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 3191 more people in attendance at the game versus Dallas than at the game versus the LA Clippers.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's comparing the attendance numbers for two specific games: one against Dallas and another against the LA Clippers. The claim is that there were 3,191 more people at the Dallas game compared to the LA Clippers game.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the rows where the opponent was Dallas and LA Clippers. Let me scan through the 'team' column:\n\n- Game 80: Opponent is LA Clippers.\n- Game 81: Opponent is Dallas.\n\nNow, for each of these games, I should check the attendance numbers. The relevant column here is \"location attendance.\" \n\nFor game 80 (LA Clippers), the attendance is listed as 18089. For game 81 (Dallas), the attendance is 14898.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. If Dallas had higher attendance than LA Clippers by 3,191, then the numbers should be such that Dallas's attendance minus LA Clippers' equals approximately 3,191. But according to these numbers:\n\nDallas attendance: 14,898\nLA Clippers attendance: 18,089\n\nWait, actually, if we subtract, it would be 18,089 (LA Clippers) - 14,898 (Dallas) = 3,191. So Dallas's game had fewer attendees than LA Clippers by exactly 3,191 people. But the claim says there were more people at the Dallas game compared to LA Clippers. That means according to the numbers, the attendance at Dallas was lower, so the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait no, perhaps I misread which game had which number. Let me double-check:\n\nGame 80: Team is LA Clippers, location attendance is 18,089.\nGame 81: Team is Dallas, location attendance is 14,898.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 18,089 - 14,898 = 3,191. But since the claim states that there were more people at Dallas than LA Clippers, but according to the data, it's actually the opposite. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I got the difference reversed. Let me calculate again:\n\nDallas attendance: 14,898\nLA Clippers attendance: 18,089\n\nSo Dallas has fewer people. The claim says there were more at Dallas than LA Clippers by 3,191. But in reality, LA had more. So the difference is actually -3,191 from Dallas's perspective.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because it states that Dallas had more attendees, but in reality, they had fewer.\n</think>\n\nThe attendance numbers for the games against Dallas and LA Clippers are 14,898 and 18,089 respectively. The difference shows that there were actually fewer people at the Dallas game compared to the LA Clippers game by exactly 3,191. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 80, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 81, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
