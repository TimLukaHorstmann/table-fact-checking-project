The claim says: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the oldest prime minister, 1872 - 1963.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find information about mehdi bej frash\u00ebri. Scanning the rows, I see that in row 3 (since indexing starts at 0, so row 3 is actually the fourth entry), there's an entry for \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri 1st time.\" The born-died column shows his lifespan as 1872 - 1963. So that part of the claim matches.\n\nNext, I need to check if he was indeed the oldest prime minister. To do this, I'll compare his lifespan with the others listed in the table. Let's look at each prime minister:\n\n1. Kostaq Kota (1st time): Born 1889, died 1949.\n2. Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time): Born 1859, died 1939.\n3. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: Born 1872, died 1963.\n4. Kostaq Kota (2nd time): Same as above.\n\nNow, calculating their ages:\n- Kostaq Kota lived for 1949 - 1889 = 60 years.\n- Pandeli Evangjeli lived for 1939 - 1859 = 80 years.\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived for 1963 - 1872 = 91 years.\n\nSo, Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri is indeed the oldest among them. The claim states he lived to be the oldest and provides his lifespan correctly. Therefore, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately states that mehdi bej frash\u00ebri was the oldest prime minister with the given birth and death years as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the earliest term start on 5 september 1928 under kostaq kota 's leadership\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It states that the earliest term start was on September 5, 1928, and that this term was under Kostaq Kota's leadership. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each relevant column: \"term start\" and \"name\". The rows in question are those that mention Kostaq Kota. From the table:\n\n- Row 2: Kostaq Kota (1st time) with a term starting on September 5, 1928.\n- Row 4: Kostaq Kota (2nd time) with a term starting on November 9, 1936.\n\nThe claim refers to the earliest term start. Since September 5, 1928, is earlier than any other term start in the table, this part checks out. Additionally, this term was indeed under Kostaq Kota's leadership as indicated in row 2.\n\nI should ensure there are no other entries with an earlier term start. Scanning through all rows:\n\n- The first row seems to be a header or placeholder and doesn't contain actual data.\n- Row 3 shows Pandeli Evangjeli starting on March 6, 1930.\n- Row 4 is Kostaq Kota's second term in 1936.\n\nNone of these have a term start earlier than September 5, 1928. Therefore, the claim accurately reflects the earliest term start under Kostaq Kota's leadership as per the table.\n\nIn summary, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. The earliest term start is correctly identified as September 5, 1928, and it was indeed during Kostaq Kota's tenure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"term start\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully examining the table provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the structure of the table, it has columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, and political party. The rows contain information about different prime ministers in the period 1928-1939.\n\nThe claim states that all listed prime ministers have no political party. To verify this, I should check each row under the \"political party\" column to see if any of them are listed as having a political party or not.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. The first row after the header is a general entry about \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939,\" but this isn't an individual, so I can skip it for now.\n2. Next is Kostaq Kota (1st time). His political party is listed as \"non - party.\" So that's one without a party.\n3. Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time) also has \"non - party\" under the political party column.

When did Kostaq Kota's second term start?\n2. When did Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term end?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows are index 0 to 4. Index 0 is a header row, so it doesn't count towards the data.\n- Row 1: Kostaq Kota (1st time) has a term start on 5 September 1928 and ends on 5 March 1930.\n- Row 2: Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time), terms are from 6 March 1930 to 16 October 1935.\n- Row 3: Mehdi Bej Frasheri (1st time) starts on 22 October 1935 and ends on 9 November 1936.\n- Row 4: Kostaq Kota (2nd time) starts on 9 November 1936 and ends on 8 April 1939.\n\nSo, Mehdi Bej Frasheri's term ended on 9 November 1936. Kostaq Kota's second term started the same day, 9 November 1936.\n\nThe claim says that Kostaq's term started after Mehdi's term ended. But if both terms end and start on the same date, does \"after\" apply? It depends on whether the end is exclusive or inclusive. If a term ends on a specific day, the next term would logically begin the next day. However, in this case, both events are recorded as happening on 9 November 1936.\n\nSo, if Kostaq's term started on the same day Mehdi's ended, it might not be considered \"after\" in a strict sense but rather simultaneous or overlapping. Therefore, the claim that Kostaq's term started after Mehdi's ended isn't fully accurate because they both are recorded as occurring on the same date.\n\nThus, I would determine the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"term end\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"term start\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"kostaq kota mehdi bej frash\u00ebri both 1st time prime minister of albania.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. It mentions two individuals: Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. The claim is asserting that both were first-time Prime Ministers of Albania.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns for name, born-died, term start, term end, and political party. Each row lists a prime minister along with their respective details.\n\nI'll go through each relevant row to check the information about these two individuals. \n\nStarting with Kostaq Kota: There are two entries for him in the table. The first entry is \"kostaq kota (1st time)\" which starts on September 5, 1928, and ends on March 5, 1930. Since this is his first term as Prime Minister, it aligns with the claim that he was a first-time PM.\n\nNext, looking at Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: There's an entry for him labeled \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri (1st time)\" starting on October 22, 1935, and ending on November 9, 1936. This also indicates that this was his first term as Prime Minister, supporting the claim.\n\nBoth individuals are listed under the \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" section, which likely refers to their terms within that timeframe. The table doesn't show any prior terms for either before these entries, so it's safe to conclude that both were indeed serving as Prime Ministers for the first time during this period.\n\nI also check if there are any other rows that might contradict this information, but all relevant rows confirm their positions as first-time PMs. \n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were first-time prime ministers of Albania.

The claim states: \"mehdi bej frash\u00ebri live to be the second oldest prime minister after pandeli evangjeli.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table and identify the relevant information. The table lists four Prime Ministers from 1928-1939 with their details including birth-death years.\n\nI should focus on the \"born - died\" column to find out their ages and determine who is older. Also, I need to consider that Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri's age relative to Pandeli Evangjeli will help verify if he was the second oldest.\n\nLooking at each Prime Minister:\n\n1. Kostaq Kota (1st time): Born 1889 - Died 1949\n2. Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time): Born 1859 - Died 1939\n3. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time): Born 1872 - Died 1963\n4. Kostaq Kota (2nd time): Same as the first entry.\n\nNow, let's calculate their ages at death:\n\n- Pandeli Evangjeli: Died in 1939 at age 1939 - 1859 = 80 years.\n- Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: Died in 1963 at age 1963 - 1872 = 91 years.\n\nWait, that means Mehdi lived longer than Pandeli. But the claim says he was the second oldest after Pandeli. However, according to their death ages, Mehdi is older. So perhaps I need to check when they were serving and if \"live\" refers to at the time of their terms or overall lifespan.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the claim refers to who lived longer as PMs? But no, it's about being the second oldest prime minister after Pandeli. If Pandeli died in 1939 at 80, Mehdi died in 1963 at 91, so he actually outlived Pandeli. So he is older.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nPandeli Evangjeli: Born 1859, Died 1939 \u2192 age 80.\nMehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri: Born 1872, Died 1963 \u2192 age 91.\n\nSo Mehdi is older than Pandeli. Therefore, if the claim says he was the second oldest after Pandeli, that would mean someone else is the oldest. But looking at the table:\n\n- Kostaq Kota (1st time): Born 1889, Died 1949 \u2192 age 60.\n- Kostaq Kota (2nd time): same as above.\n\nSo ages are: Pandeli (80), Mehdi (91), Kostaq (60). So actually, Mehdi is the oldest. Therefore, the claim that he was second after Pandeli would be incorrect because Mehdi is older than Pandeli.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the term \"live to be.\" It could mean how old they were when they died, which would still make Mehdi older. So if the claim says Mehdi was the second oldest, it's wrong because he was actually the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri lived longer than Pandeli Evangjeli, making him the oldest, not the second oldest.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"born - died\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

There are five rows total, but the first row seems to be a header for a group of prime ministers from 1928-1939. Then there are four actual entries.\n\nThe claim is about Albania's first prime minister starting in 1927. The table starts with \"prime ministers 1928 - 1939\" as the first row, which suggests that this group served between those years.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table about Albanian prime ministers from 1928 to 1939, and there's a claim that says \"the only 1st time minister of Albania be pandeli evangjeli.\" My task is to figure out if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that Pandeli Evangjeli was the sole first-time prime minister during that period. To verify this, I should look at each row in the table and check who served as prime ministers for the first time.\n\nLooking at the table, there are four entries under the prime ministers from 1928-1939:\n\n1. Kostaq Kota (1st time)\n2. Pandeli Evangjeli (2nd time)\n3. Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time)\n4. Kostaq Kota (2nd time)\n\nFrom this, I can see that there are two entries marked as \"1st time\": Kostaq Kota and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri. The claim says Pandeli Evangjeli was the only first-time minister, but according to the table, there are others who served for the first time.\n\nSo, since both Kostaq Kota (first instance) and Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri were serving their first terms, the claim is not accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to find all rows where it's a \"1st time\" service. \n\n- Row index 2: Kostaq Kota (1st time)\n- Row index 4: Mehdi Bej Frash\u00ebri (1st time)\n\nThese are the two instances that contradict the claim, so these cells are relevant to determine the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there were two first-time prime ministers in the period listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
