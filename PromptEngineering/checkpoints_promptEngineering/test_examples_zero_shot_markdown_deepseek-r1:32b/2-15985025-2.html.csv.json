The claim is: \"David Bielkheden's highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Diego Gonzalez.\" I need to check if this is true based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries related to Stockholm, Sweden and matches involving Diego Gonzalez. \n\nLooking at row 0: It mentions a location in Stockholm, but the opponent here is Diego Gonzalez. The result is a win with a record of 1-1 (assuming that's his highest). But wait, is this his highest? Let me check other entries.\n\nRow 29 shows another match in Stockholm against Patrick Vallee. David won via submission, and his record was 8-2 at the time. That seems higher than 1-1. \n\nRow 30: He fought Tom Haddock in Belfast, which isn't relevant to Stockholm. Row 31 is also in Stockholm, but it's a different opponent.\n\nWait, row 29 has the highest record (8-2) in Stockholm against Patrick Vallee. Since Diego Gonzalez was only one of his early opponents when he had a lower record, the claim that his highest win in Stockholm was against Gonzalez isn't accurate.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0: Location is Stockholm and opponent is Diego Gonzalez.\n- Row 29: Location is Stockholm with a higher record (8-2) against Patrick Vallee.\n\nThis shows that his highest record win in Stockholm wasn't against Diego Gonzalez but Patrick Vallee.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"David Bielkhedens highest record win in Stockholm, Sweden happened in the match against Nikola Matic\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each part of the claim step by step. The main points here are:\n\n1. **Highest Record Win**: This likely refers to a significant or notable victory for David Bielkhedens.\n2. **Location**: The event took place in Stockholm, Sweden.\n3. **Opponent**: The match was against Nikola Matic.\n\nI'll start by scanning the table for matches that occurred in Stockholm, Sweden. Looking at each row's \"City\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Stockholm, Sweden\n- Row 17: Stockholm, Sweden (x loss)\n- Row 24: Stockholm, Sweden (x win)\n- Row 35: Stockholm, Sweden (x win)\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the table doesn't have a \"City\" column. Let me correct that. Each row's location is mentioned in the \"Notes\" or within the description of each fight. I'll need to parse each row's details to find mentions of Stockholm.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Happened in Stockholm, Sweden (Highest record win against Nikola Matic)\n- Other rows mention Stockholm as well, but let's focus on the highest record win part.\n\nThe claim is that this was his \"highest\" or most significant win. So I'm checking if this particular victory is indeed the one with the highest significance for him.\n\nLooking at row 0: It says it's a \"win\" against Nikola Matic in Stockholm, Sweden. The record here shows it as a win (W), and since this is his first win listed, but to determine if it's his highest, I need to see if he has any other wins with higher significance.\n\nGoing through the rest of the table:\n\n- Row 1: Another fight in Stockholm, but it's a loss.\n- Rows further down also have fights in Stockholm, some wins and losses.\n\nBut specifically, row 0 is marked as \"highest record win\" against Nikola Matic. So according to this, yes, that seems to be his highest win there.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"happened in the match against Nikola Matic.\" I need to ensure that the opponent was indeed Nikolai Matic and not someone else.\n\nLooking at row 0, it's a fight against Nikola Matic. So both conditions are met: location is Stockholm, Sweden, and the opponent is correct.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to be TRUE based on the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"City\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given data table. The claim states: \"tommy depret be 1 of the 12 fighter that david bielkheden have lose to in his career.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim correctly. It's saying that Tommy Depret is one among twelve fighters who David Bielkheden has lost to in his career. So, I need to check if Tommy Depret is listed as someone that David Bielkheden has lost to.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row seems to represent a fight between two fighters. The columns are: \"Row\", \"Opponent\", \"Method\", \"Round\", and \"Time\". \n\nI'll start by searching for the name \"tommy depret\" in the Opponent column because that would indicate that Tommy Depret was the opponent against whom David Bielkheden fought. If I find a row where the Opponent is Tommy Depret, then I can check if the result of that fight (the Method) indicates a loss for David.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Opponent is \"You\". Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Opponent is \"david bielkheden\". Wait, this seems reversed because the claim is about Bielkheden losing to Depret. So here, if it's a fight where someone fought against David Bielkheden and won, that would be a loss for him.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify who is the fighter in each row. The first column might represent the fighter's name, but looking at the data, it seems like each row represents a fight where \"Opponent\" is who they fought against, and \"Method\" indicates how the fight ended.\n\nBut actually, the table doesn't specify whose perspective we're taking. It just lists fights between two opponents. So, to verify if Tommy Depret has beaten David Bielkheden, I need to find a row where one fighter is David Bielkheden and the other is Tommy Depret, with the result indicating that Bielkheden lost.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is \"You\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 1: Opponent is \"david bielkheden\". Wait, this might be a row where someone else fought David Bielkheden. So if the Method shows a loss for David, that would count towards his losses.\n\nWait, but in the table, each row seems to represent one of Tommy Depret's fights? Or maybe it's from another fighter's perspective. The table is a bit unclear because it doesn't specify whose fight record we're looking at. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a fight that David Bielkheden has been involved in, either as the fighter or the opponent.\n\nWait, let me re-examine. The first column seems to be the fighter's name, and then \"Opponent\" is who they fought against. So if we're looking at fights where David Bielkheden is the fighter, his opponents would be listed, along with the outcome.\n\nLooking for rows where the fighter is \"david bielkheden\". Let me scan through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Fighter is not specified; it just says \"You\".\n- Row 1: Opponent is \"david bielkheden\", so this would mean that someone fought against David. If this person (Tommy Depret) won, then it counts as a loss for Bielkheden.\n\nWait, but the way the table is structured isn't clear. Maybe each row is from the perspective of a specific fighter, perhaps Tommy Depret? Let me check: in Row 0, Opponent is \"You\", which could imply that the fighter being listed is someone else fighting against \"You\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is listing all fights involving David Bielkheden. But without clarity on whose fight record this is, it's a bit confusing.\n\nBut given the claim, we need to find if Tommy Depret has defeated David Bielkheden in one of his fights. So perhaps I should look for any row where the Opponent is \"tommy depret\" and the Method indicates that the fighter (who would be David Bielkheden) lost.\n\nWait, no\u2014the Method column shows how the fight ended. For example, if Method says \"submission\", it means the fighter won via submission. If it's a loss for Bielkheden, then Tommy Depret must have been the one who submitted or otherwise defeated him.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Opponent is \"You\". Doesn't help.\n- Row 1: Opponent is \"david bielkheden\", Method is \"submission (armbar)\". So this means someone used an armbar to submit David Bielkheden, so he lost. But the name of that fighter isn't listed here; the row just mentions the opponent as Bielkheden.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Each row might represent a fight where \"Opponent\" is who you fought against, and \"Method\" is how you won or lost. So if in any row, the Opponent is Tommy Depret and Method shows that the fighter (who would be David Bielkheden) lost, then that's a loss for him.\n\nBut looking through all rows:\n\n- Row 0: You vs. You \u2013 doesn't make sense.\n- Rows 1 to ... let me check each row carefully:\n\nRow 1: Opponent \"david bielkheden\", Method \"submission (armbar)\". So the fighter in this row defeated David Bielkheden via armbar. But who is the fighter? The row just says Opponent, so perhaps it's from another fighter's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is a fight that David Bielkheden was involved in. If that's the case, then looking for \"tommy depret\" as an opponent would be relevant.\n\nWait, but I don't see any rows where the Opponent is Tommy Depret. Let me check again:\n\nRows 0 to ... (I'll go through each row):\n\nRow 0: You vs You\nRow 1: Opponent david bielkheden, Method submission (armbar)\nRow 2: Opponent someone else...\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the table is a list of all fights involving Tommy Depret as the opponent. So each row represents a fight where the fighter's name isn't specified, but they fought against someone like \"You\" or others.\n\nThis is getting confusing because the structure isn't clear. But given that I'm looking for whether Tommy Depret has beaten David Bielkheden, I need to find if in any of the rows, the Opponent is Tommy Depret and the Method indicates a loss for David.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is from Tommy Depret's perspective. So each row represents his fights. Therefore, in Row 1, he fought against \"david bielkheden\" and won via submission (armbar). That would mean that Tommy Depret defeated David Bielkheden, contributing to one of his losses.\n\nSo if this is the case, then yes, Tommy Depret is one of the fighters who have beaten David Bielkheden. Now, does this make him one of twelve such fighters? Well, looking at the table, we only see one fight where Tommy defeated David. But perhaps in reality, there are more fights not listed here.\n\nBut based solely on the given data, yes, Tommy Depret has at least once defeated David Bielkheden.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is that Tommy Depret is one of twelve fighters who have defeated David Bielkheden. Based on the provided table, we can confirm that Tommy Depret did defeat David Bielkheden in a submission (armbar) match. However, since the table only shows one such instance and does not provide the total number of losses by David Bielkheden, we cannot verify if there are exactly twelve fighters who have defeated him.\n\nBut according to the data given, Tommy Depret is at least one of them.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, Tommy Depret is listed as defeating David Bielkheden in a submission (armbar) match.",

So I need to see if there's a row where the opponent is Tommy DePret and the result was a loss for David Bielkhedens.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents an event with details like date, location, opponent, method of victory or loss, etc.\n\nI'll scan through the rows to find any mention of Tommy DePret. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"You\" - not relevant.\nRow 1: Opponent is \"Jared Magnani\" - nope.\nRow 2: Opponent is \"Tatsuya Kawajiri\" - nope.\n...\nWait, actually, looking at the table structure provided, each row has columns like 'Opponent', 'Method', etc. So I need to look for any row where the 'Opponent' is Tommy DePret and the result was a loss.\n\nBut when I check through all the rows, I don't see any entry where the opponent's name is Tommy DePret. All opponents listed are different names. Therefore, there's no record of Tommy DePret defeating David Bielkhedens in this table.\n\nSince the claim states that Tommy DePret is one of 14 fighters who have defeated him, but according to the data provided, Tommy DePret isn't even listed as an opponent, let alone a winner against him. So the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
