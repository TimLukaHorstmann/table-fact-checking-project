The claim says that \"4 people play the position of forward in the 1982-82 season.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what counts as a forward in this table. Looking at the 'position' column, forwards are listed as 'fw'. So I should check how many players have 'fw' in their position.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: Terry Austin is fw. That's one.\nRow 12: Colin Russell is fw. That's two.\nRow 17: Kevin Stonehouse is fw. Three.\nRow 5: Maurice Cox is mf, not forward.\nRow 6: Steve Doyle is mf.\nRow 7: Roy Greenwood is df.\nRow 8: Keith Hanvey is df.\nRow 9: Timothy Hotte is fw. Wait, that's four.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me count again:\n\nTerry Austin (0), Colin Russell (12), Kevin Stonehouse (17), and Timothy Hotte (9).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"mark lillis have the most total goal of anyone in the season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the instructions carefully. The task is to check each condition in the claim against the table and verify if it's supported. If fully supported, the answer should be \"TRUE\"; otherwise, \"FALSE\". Also, I need to provide a JSON object with the answer and relevant cells that were checked.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns like 'name', 'position', various apps and goals in different competitions, and finally 'total apps' and 'total goals'. The claim is about Mark Lillis having the most total goals. So, my focus should be on the 'total goals' column for each player.\n\nI'll start by locating Mark Lillis in the table. Scanning through the names, I find his row. Under 'total goals', it says 20. That's a pretty high number, but I need to check if any other player has more than that.\n\nNow, I'll go through each player's total goals:\n\n- Terry Austin: 0\n- Malcolm Brown: 11\n- David Burke: 1\n- David Cowling: 8\n- Brian Cox: 0\n- Maurice Cox: 1\n- Steve Doyle: 2\n- Roy Greenwood: 0\n- Keith Hanvey: 4\n- Timothy Hotte: 0\n- Mick Laverick: 0\n- Mark Lillis: 20\n- Keith Mason: 0\n- Daral Pugh: 2\n- Colin Russell: 17\n- Brian Stanton: 17\n- Kevin Stonehouse: 0\n- Dave Sutton: 2\n- Peter Valentine: 0\n- Phil Wilson: 6\n\nLooking at these numbers, Mark Lillis has the highest with 20 goals. The next closest are Brian Stanton and Colin Russell both with 17 goals each. So, no one else exceeds or matches his total.\n\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity in the data. For example, some rows have numbers in parentheses, like David Cowling (41 vs 56). But since we're focusing on 'total goals', which are just single numbers without parentheses for all entries except Mark Lillis and a few others, but their total goals don't include the parentheses. So, I think it's safe to take the main number as the value.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Mark Lillis has the highest total goals of 20 compared to everyone else in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"total goals\"}\n   ]\n}",

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"brian stanton be 1 of 2 people who have more than 0 fa cup goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Brian Stanton is one of two individuals with more than zero FA Cup goals. So, my task is to verify if this statement holds true by examining the data in the table.\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant columns in the table that pertain to FA Cup goals. The columns are \"fa cup apps\" and \"fa cup goals.\" Since the claim mentions \"more than 0 fa cup goal,\" I'm particularly interested in the \"fa cup goals\" column.\n\nNext, I'll scan through each row of the table to look for entries where the value under \"fa cup goals\" is greater than zero. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. **Terry Austin**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n2. **Malcolm Brown**: FA Cup goals are 1.\n3. **David Burke**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n4. **David Cowling**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n5. **Brian Cox**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n6. **Maurice Cox**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n7. **Steve Doyle**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n8. **Roy Greenwood**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n9. **Keith Hanvey**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n10. **Timothy Hotte**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n11. **Mick Laverick**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n12. **Mark Lillis**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n13. **Keith Mason**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n14. **Daral Pugh**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n15. **Colin Russell**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n16. **Brian Stanton**: FA Cup goals are 2.\n17. **Kevin Stonehouse**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n18. **Dave Sutton**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n19. **Peter Valentine**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n20. **Phil Wilson**: FA Cup goals are 0.\n\nFrom this examination, only two players have FA Cup goals exceeding zero: Malcolm Brown with 1 goal and Brian Stanton with 2 goals. This means there are exactly two individuals who meet the condition of having more than 0 FA Cup goals.\n\nNow, focusing on Brian Stanton's data:\n- **FA Cup Goals**: 2 (which is greater than 0)\n  \nSince he's one of these two players, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brian Stanton is one of two people with more than zero FA Cup goals.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"malcolm brown have 3 more total apps than david burke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what each term means. The table has a column called \"total apps,\" which stands for total appearances. So, the claim is saying that Malcolm Brown's total appearances are three more than David Burke's.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see that each row represents a player with various stats. Each player has a 'name' and several columns including 'total apps'. \n\nI need to find the rows corresponding to Malcolm Brown and David Burke. Let me scan through the names:\n\n- The first row after the header is Terry Austin.\n- Then comes Malcolm Brown as the second row (row index 1).\n- Continuing down, I find David Burke in the third row (row index 2).\n\nNow, for each of these players, I'll check their 'total apps' values.\n\nFor Malcolm Brown:\nLooking at his row, under \"total apps,\" it says 56. So Malcolm has 56 total appearances.\n\nFor David Burke:\nIn his row, under \"total apps,\" it's listed as 53. Therefore, David has 53 total appearances.\n\nThe claim states that Malcolm has 3 more apps than David. Let me do the math: 56 (Malcolm) minus 53 (David) equals exactly 3. So yes, the difference is 3.\n\nI should also check if there are any notes in parentheses or other notations that might affect these numbers. For example, looking at other players like Maurice Cox or Daral Pugh, some have numbers with (1) or (18), but for Malcolm Brown and David Burke, their total apps don't have such annotations. So I can safely assume the numbers are straightforward.\n\nTherefore, since 56 is indeed 3 more than 53, the claim holds true.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For Malcolm Brown: row index 1, column \"total apps\"\n- For David Burke: row index 2, column \"total apps\"\n\nThis should be enough to verify the claim accurately.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total apps\"}\n   ]\n}",

The table has multiple rows, each representing a player with various statistics. Let's start by finding Dave Sutton and Phil Wilson.\n\nLooking through the \"name\" column:\n\n- Dave Sutton is listed as a df (defender) with 41 league apps.\n- Phil Wilson is also present, as an mf (midfielder) with 45 league apps.\n\nNext, I'll verify their respective league appearances. For Dave Sutton, under the \"league apps\" column, his number is indeed 41. Similarly, Phil Wilson's \"league apps\" show 45. \n\nI should also check if there are any footnotes or additional details that might affect these numbers. In some cells, I notice parentheses with numbers (like 3 (1) or 9 (18)). These likely represent substitutions or other specific mentions but don't change the primary number stated before them.

That means I need to check how many total goals Mark Lillis has and see if anyone else has the same number of total goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by finding the row for Mark Lillis. Scanning through the names, I see that Mark Lillis is listed as an mf (midfielder). Let me note down his total goals.

Checking their respective rows:\n\n- **Dave Sutton** has 41 league apps.\n- **Phil Wilson** has 45 league apps.\n\nNeither of them has 44, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"league apps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
