    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"tyrrell racing organisation, and camel team lotus honda be the only 2 entrant to appear 2 time\". So, the claim states that these two teams are the only ones that appear twice each in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has six entries across different years. The 'entrant' column lists the teams for each year. Let's go through each team and count how many times they appear:\n\n1. **Camel Team Lotus Honda**: This appears in 1987 and 1988. That's two times.\n2. **Camel Team Lotus**: This is listed in 1989, but it's a different entry from the previous two years since it doesn't include 'honda' anymore. So, this is only once.\n3. **Tyrrell Racing Organisation**: This appears twice in 1990 (rows 3 and 4). Each row has the same team name but different chassis models.\n4. **Braun Tyrrell Honda**: Appears once in 1991.\n\nFrom this, it's clear that both \"Camel Team Lotus Honda\" and \"Tyrrell Racing Organisation\" each appear twice. However, I need to check if there are any other teams that also appear more than once. Looking through the table again:\n\n- **Camel Team Lotus** appears only in 1989.\n- **Braun Tyrrell Honda** is unique to 1991.\n\nSo, no other team besides these two appears twice. Therefore, the claim holds true as per the data provided.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells: I need to identify which cells support this conclusion. The key information is in the 'entrant' column where the teams are listed. Specifically:\n\n- For Camel Team Lotus Honda:\n  - Row 0 (1987)\n  - Row 1 (1988)\n  \n- For Tyrrell Racing Organisation:\n  - Row 3 (1990, first entry)\n  - Row 4 (1990, second entry)\n\nThese four cells are the ones that show each of these teams appearing twice. \n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because only those two entrants appear twice in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"while lotus and honda produce the same number of chassis the same model be never use 2 time\"\n\nHmm, that's a bit tricky to parse. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst part: Lotus and Honda produce the same number of chassis. So I need to count how many times each team used their own chassis. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Lotus:\n  - In 1987: lotus 99t\n  - 1988: lotus 100t\n  - 1989: lotus 101\n\nSo Lotus has three different chassis models over three years.\n\nFor Honda, it's a bit more complex. The team names include \"honda\" in some entries:\n\n- 1987 and 1988: camel team lotus honda used lotus 99t and 100t (so not their own chassis)\n- In 1991, braun tyrrell honda uses tyrrell 020 with a honda v10 engine. So here, the chassis is from Tyrrell, but Honda is part of the team name.\n\nWait, does this count as Honda producing their own chassis? Or are they using another team's chassis?\n\nThe claim mentions \"produce\" so I think it refers to building or manufacturing the chassis themselves. So maybe only entries where the team name includes Honda and the chassis is from Lotus don't count. Alternatively, perhaps the chassis name needs to indicate Honda.\n\nLooking at the table, none of the chassis are named as \"honda\". They're all lotus or tyrrell. So perhaps Honda didn't produce any chassis in this table. That would mean that Lotus produced three chassis, and Honda produced zero. So they don't have the same number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The teams include Honda but use other chassis. Maybe the claim is that Lotus and Honda both used their own chassis the same number of times.\n\nBut in the table, all the chassis are from Lotus or Tyrrell. There's no entry where the team is Honda and the chassis is from Honda.\n\nSo if Lotus has three different chassis (lotus 99t, 100t, 101) over three years, and Honda didn't produce any, then their counts aren't equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should count how many times each team's name includes Honda or Lotus. Let's see:\n\n- Lotus appears in the entrant column for 1987, 1988, 1989: that's three entries.\n- Honda appears as part of the entrant in 1987, 1988, and 1991: also three entries.\n\nBut the claim is about producing chassis. So if the team includes Honda but uses a different chassis, does that count?\n\nWait, maybe I should check how many times each team used their own chassis. For Lotus, they used lotus 99t in 87, 100t in 88, and 101 in 89: three times.\n\nFor Honda, looking at the table, when is the team using a Honda chassis? The entries where the entrant includes honda are:\n\n- 1987: lotus 99t (chassis from Lotus)\n- 1988: lotus 100t (again, Lotus)\n- 1991: tyrrell 020 (Tyrrell)\n\nSo Honda never used their own chassis in these entries. They always used Lotus or Tyrrell.\n\nTherefore, the number of times Lotus produced chassis is three, and Honda produced zero. So they don't produce the same number of chassis models.\n\nMoreover, the second part of the claim says \"the same model be never use 2 time\". Maybe it's saying that no model was used twice by both teams? Or perhaps within a team, their own chassis weren't reused.\n\nLooking at Lotus: each year they have a different chassis (99t, 100t, 101), so none were reused. So for Lotus, same model never used twice.\n\nFor Honda, since they didn't produce any chassis themselves in the table, there's nothing to compare. But if we consider their usage via other teams, like Tyrrell, maybe that's different.\n\nBut the claim seems to be about whether both Lotus and Honda produced the same number of models without reusing them.\n\nGiven that Lotus used three unique chassis and Honda didn't produce any (as per this table), the first part is false. Also, even if they had produced some, since Lotus used each model once, but Honda didn't use any, it's still unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim is saying that both teams have the same count of unique chassis models and none were reused twice.\n\nBut Lotus has three, Honda zero. So counts are different. Therefore, the entire claim is false.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\nRelevant cells would be the 'entrant' and 'chassis' columns for all rows where entrant includes Lotus or Honda.\n\nSo relevant_cells would include all rows with Lotus or Honda in entrant, looking at both 'entrant' and 'chassis' columns.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"camel team lotus honda earned the highest amount of points in 1987 of any entrant, in any year.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim. It mentions two main things:\n\n1. Camel Team Lotus Honda's points in 1987.\n2. Whether that was the highest among all entrants for that specific year and across any other years.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying the relevant rows. The first row is for the year 1987, which matches the claim's timeframe. In this row, Camel Team Lotus Honda scored 7 points. \n\nNext, I need to check if this was indeed the highest in 1987. Scanning through all entries in 1987, there are no other teams listed for that year except Camel Team Lotus Honda. So, by default, their 7 points would be the highest since they're the only entrant that year.\n\nNow, the claim also mentions \"in any year,\" so I should check if 7 points is the highest across all years in the table. Let's look at each year:\n\n- **1987**: 7 points (Camel Team Lotus Honda)\n- **1988**: 1 point\n- **1989**: 3 points\n- **1990**: Two entries, both with 3 points\n- **1991**: 2 points\n\nThe highest points across all years in the table are indeed 7 points from Camel Team Lotus Honda in 1987. \n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because they earned the highest points in their respective year and that's the maximum in any other year listed as well.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells:\n\n- The row for 1987 (row index 0) under 'entrant' confirms it's Camel Team Lotus Honda.\n- The same row's 'points' column shows they earned 7 points.\n- Checking all other rows, none exceed 7 points.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the honda v6 engine earned 3 more points than the cosworth v8 when compared in aggregate.\" So, I'm looking at two engines here\u2014Honda V6 and Cosworth V8\u2014and their total points across all years they were used.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to identify which entries correspond to these engines and sum up their points.\n\nStarting with Honda V6:\n- In 1987 (row index 0), the engine is Honda V6, points are 7.\n- In 1988 (row index 1), again Honda V6, points are 1.\nAdding those together: 7 + 1 = 8 points for Honda V6.\n\nNext, Cosworth V8:\n- There are two entries in 1990 (rows 3 and 4). Both have Cosworth V8 engines with 3 points each. So, 3 + 3 = 6 points.\n- Then in 1991 (row 5), the engine is Honda V10, not Cosworth, so I can ignore that.\n\nWait a second, there's another entry for Cosworth V8? Let me double-check. The table shows two rows for 1990 with Tyrrell racing organization and Cosworth V8, both scoring 3 points each. That adds up to 6 points total for Cosworth V8.\n\nNow, comparing the totals: Honda V6 has 8 points, Cosworth V8 has 6 points. The claim says Honda earned 3 more points than Cosworth. Let's see: 8 - 6 = 2. So, Honda actually earned only 2 more points, not 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the difference is 2 points, not 3.\n</think>\n\nThe Honda V6 engines total 8 points (7 in 1987 and 1 in 1988), while Cosworth V8 engines total 6 points (3 each in two rows of 1990). The difference is 2 points, not 3.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The relevant information for this claim will be in the 'chassis' column because that's where the manufacturers are listed\u2014Lotus and Tyrrell.\n\nNow, let me go through each row to count how many times each manufacturer appears.\n\nRow 0 (1987): Chassis is \"lotus 99t\". So Lotus has 1.\nRow 1 (1988): Chassis is \"lotus 100t\". Another Lotus, so total now 2 for Lotus.\nRow 2 (1989): Chassis is \"lotus 101\". That's a third Lotus.\nRow 3 (1990): Chassis is \"tyrrell 018\". First occurrence of Tyrrell, so count 1.\nRow 4 (1990): Another entry from Tyrrell with chassis \"tyrrell 019\". So Tyrrell now has 2.\nRow 5 (1991): Chassis is \"tyrrell 020\". That's a third for Tyrrell.\n\nWait, so both Lotus and Tyrrell have three entries each.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read and understand the claim carefully: \"tyrrell racing organisation be the only entrant tohat satoru nakajima drive for 2 time\". There seems to be a typo in the claim; it should probably say \"that Satoru Nakajima drove for two times\" or something similar. So, the intended meaning is likely: \"The Tyrrell Racing Organisation was the only entrant that Satoru Nakajima drove for twice.\"\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's any mention of Satoru Nakajima as an entrant. Scanning through the 'entrant' column, I notice the entries are:\n- camel team lotus honda\n- camel team lotus\n- tyrrell racing organisation (appearing twice in 1990)\n- braun tyrrell honda\n\nThere's no mention of Satoru Nakajima in the entrant column. The claim seems to suggest that Nakajima drove for Tyrrell Racing Organisation two times, but based on this table, there's no data about drivers or who they were. \n\nMoreover, looking at the years from 1987 to 1991, the only repeated entrants are \"camel team lotus honda\" and \"tyrrell racing organisation\". The latter appears in both 1990 rows, but that's just two entries for the same year. \n\nSince there's no information about drivers like Satoru Nakajima in the table, we can't verify if he drove for Tyrrell twice or not.

Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"lotus produce more number of chassis than tyrrell and same model be use more than 2 time.\" Hmm, okay, that seems a bit complex, but let's break it down into two parts.\n\nFirst part: Lotus produces more chassis than Tyrrell.\nSecond part: Same model is used more than two times.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has information about the year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. The relevant columns here are \"entrant\" and \"chassis\".\n\nLet me count how many chassis each team produced.\n\nFor Lotus:\n- 1987: lotus 99t\n- 1988: lotus 100t\n- 1989: lotus 101\n\nSo that's three different chassis models for Lotus across the years. Each year, they have a new model.\n\nFor Tyrrell:\n- 1990: tyrrell 018 and tyrrell 019 (two different chassis in the same year)\n- 1991: tyrrell 020\n\nWait, but looking at the rows:\n\nIn 1990, there are two entries for Tyrrell racing organization:\nRow 3: tyrrell 018\nRow 4: tyrrell 019\nAnd in 1991: row5: tyrrell 020\n\nSo total for Tyrrell is three models as well. Wait, but the count of chassis produced might be different if considering multiple uses.\n\nWait no, each row represents a separate entry or perhaps a team's participation in a year with a specific chassis. So each row is one chassis. Let me recount:\n\nLotus:\n- 1987: 1\n- 1988: 1\n- 1989: 1\nTotal: 3\n\nTyrrell:\n- 1990: two different chassis (row3 and row4)\n- 1991: 1\nTotal: 3\n\nSo both Lotus and Tyrrell have three entries, but wait, in 1990, Tyrrell has two entries with different chassis. So that's two models in one year.\n\nWait, so for the first part of the claim, does it mean more in quantity or more models? The wording is \"produce more number of chassis.\" That might refer to the count of unique models. But Lotus has three models over four years (87-90), while Tyrrell also has three models but over two years (90 and 91). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about how many times each model was used. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nLotus:\n- 1987: lotus 99t appears once\n- 1988: lotus 100t appears once\n- 1989: lotus 101 appears once\n\nSo each model is used once.\n\nTyrrell:\n- 1990: tyrrell 018 (once) and tyrrell 019 (once)\n- 1991: tyrrell 020 (once)\n\nWait, so both have each model used only once. So the second part of the claim says \"same model be use more than 2 time,\" but in the table, no model is used more than once. Therefore, the second part is false.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1987: lotus 99t\n1988: lotus 100t\n1989: lotus 101\nSo each year a new model for Lotus, so three models in total, each used once.\n\nTyrrell:\n1990 has two different chassis (018 and 019) in the same year, but each is only one entry. So each of their models is also used once.\n\nTherefore, neither Lotus nor Tyrrell have any model used more than once. So the second part of the claim is false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding \"same model be use more than 2 time.\" Maybe it's whether a particular chassis was used in multiple years or entries. For example, does any single chassis appear more than twice? In this table, each chassis appears only once. So no model was used more than once, so the claim is false.\n\nBut what about the first part: \"Lotus produce more number of chassis than Tyrrell.\" Lotus has 3 models across three years (87-89), and Tyrrell has 3 models in two years (90 and 91). So same number. Therefore, Lotus didn't produce more; they produced the same number.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm counting wrong. Let me count again:\n\nLotus rows:\nRow0: 1987\nRow1: 1988\nRow2: 1989\nTotal: 3\n\nTyrrell rows:\nRow3: 1990 (chassis 018)\nRow4: 1990 (chassis 019)\nRow5: 1991 (chassis 020)\nSo Tyrrell has three entries, but two in one year. So total of three chassis models as well.\n\nThus, both have the same number of chassis produced, not more for Lotus. Therefore, first part is false.\n\nSince both parts are false, the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the second part. The claim says \"same model be use more than 2 time.\" In the table, no model is used more than once. So that's definitely false.\n\nTherefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim has two parts: Lotus producing more chassis than Tyrrell and a model being used more than twice. Both are not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"chassis\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "camel team lotus honda earn lowest amount of point in 1987 out of any entrant and year",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim states: \"camel team lotus honda earn lowest amount of point in 1987 out of any entrant and year.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It's saying that in 1987, the team named \"camel team lotus honda\" earned the lowest points among all teams for that specific year.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll start by identifying the relevant rows. The first two entries are from 1987 and 1988, both with the same entrant name: \"camel team lotus honda\". The points they have in 1987 are 7, and in 1988 it's just 1 point.\n\nWait, but the claim is about 1987. So I should focus on that year. In 1987, camel team lotus honda has 7 points. Now, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest among all entrants in 1987.\n\nLooking at the table again, I see that for each year, there's only one entry per team. But in 1990, there are two entries for \"tyrrell racing organisation\" with points 3 each. However, since we're focusing on 1987, I should check if there are other entrants in that year.\n\nWait a second, the table doesn't show any other entrant besides camel team lotus honda in 1987. So, is there only one entrant for that year? If so, then by default, they would have both the highest and lowest points because there's no comparison.\n\nBut let me double-check the table structure. The first row is 1987, and the second is 1988. There are no other rows in 1987 except for camel team lotus honda. Therefore, they didn't have any competition that year. So if there's only one team, their points can't be compared to anyone else, meaning they don't hold a \"lowest\" position because it's the only entry.\n\nHence, the claim might not hold true because there's no other data point for comparison in 1987. However, another angle is that maybe the points are the lowest when considering all years and entrants across different years. But the wording specifically says \"in 1987 out of any entrant and year.\" So it should be within 1987.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the claim is comparing camel team lotus honda's points in 1987 to their own performance across different years. Let me read that again: \"earn lowest amount of point in 1987 out of any entrant and year.\" Hmm, maybe it's saying that among all teams across all years, the camel team lotus honda in 1987 earned the lowest points.\n\nBut looking at the table:\n\n- 1987: 7 points\n- 1988: 1 point (same team)\n- 1989: 3 points (camel team lotus)\n- 1990: 3 points for each of two entries\n- 1991: 2 points\n\nSo the lowest in the entire table is 1 point, earned by camel team lotus honda in 1988. In 1987, they have 7 points, which isn't the lowest overall.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"in 1987\", so it's specifically about that year. So in 1987, the only entrant is camel team lotus honda with 7 points. Therefore, they can't have the lowest because there are no other entries to compare. Alternatively, if considering all years, their 7 points aren't the lowest.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. The claim is about 1987.\n2. The team in question: camel team lotus honda.\n3. They earned 7 points that year.\n4. We need to check if 7 is the lowest among all entrants in 1987.\n\nLooking at the table, only one entry exists for 1987. So there's no other team to compare against. Therefore, camel team lotus honda didn't have a \"lowest\" because they were the only ones. Thus, the claim is misleading or incorrect because you can't determine a lowest when there's only one data point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider all teams across all years. If that's the case, then the lowest points in the table are 1 (from 1988). Since camel team lotus honda in 1987 has 7, which is higher than 1, they didn't earn the lowest overall.\n\nBut the claim specifies \"in 1987\", so it's about that specific year. Therefore, since there are no other teams in 1987, the claim isn't accurate because you can't have a lowest when only one team is present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that camel team lotus honda earned the lowest points in 1987 among any entrant and year. However, looking at the table, there are no other teams listed for 1987 besides this one. Without comparison data from the same year, the claim cannot be validated as true because you can't determine a \"lowest\" with only one entry.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"entrant\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the honda v6 engine earn 3 less point than the cosworth v8 engine",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the honda v6 engine earn 3 less point than the cosworth v8 engine\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Honda V6 engines earned 3 fewer points compared to Cosworth V8 engines. So I need to find the total points for each of these engines and see if there's a difference of exactly 3 points in favor of Cosworth.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify which rows have the Honda V6 engine:\n\n- In row 0 (1987), entrant is Camel Team Lotus Honda, chassis is Lotus 99t, engine is Honda V6, and points are 7.\n- Row 1 (1988) also has Honda V6 with 1 point.\n\nSo the total points for Honda V6 would be 7 + 1 = 8 points.\n\nNext, let's find rows with Cosworth V8 engines:\n\n- Rows 3 and 4 in 1990 both have Cosworth V8. Each has 3 points.\n  \nAdding these up: 3 + 3 = 6 points for Cosworth V8.\n\nNow, comparing the two totals: Honda V6 has 8 points, Cosworth V8 has 6 points. The claim says Honda earned 3 less than Cosworth, which would mean Honda should have 6 - 3 = 3 points. However, Honda actually has more points (8) than Cosworth (6), so the difference is in the opposite direction.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misread the claim. It says Honda V6 earned 3 less points than Cosworth V8. That would mean Honda's points should be equal to Cosworth's minus 3. So if Cosworth has X points, Honda should have X - 3.\n\nBut in our case, Cosworth has 6 and Honda has 8. 8 is actually 2 more than 6, not 3 less. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Honda V6 engines earned more points than Cosworth V8, not fewer by three.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the ones that show the points for Honda V6 and Cosworth V8 engines.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Honda V6 engines scored a total of 8 points while Cosworth V8 engines only scored 6 points, showing that Honda actually earned more.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
