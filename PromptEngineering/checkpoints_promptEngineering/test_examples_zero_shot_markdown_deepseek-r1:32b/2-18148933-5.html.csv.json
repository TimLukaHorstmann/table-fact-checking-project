    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"david frost be from united state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. I need to carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and find out if it's supported.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The relevant information here would be under the \"player\" and \"country\" columns because the claim is about David Frost's nationality.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row mentions Paul Azinger from the United States.\n2. The second and third rows have Nick Faldo (England) and David Frost (South Africa).\n3. Subsequent rows list other players with their respective countries, but none of them are David Frost again.\n\nSo, focusing on David Frost's entry: in row index 2, under \"country,\" it says South Africa. This means the claim that he is from the United States is incorrect.\n\nTo gather the relevant cells for this conclusion, I'll note the row where David Frost is listed and check both his name and country. The player's name is in the \"player\" column at row index 2, and his country is in the \"country\" column of the same row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because David Frost is from South Africa, not the United States.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
