The claim says: \"the highest attendance be 80156 in a game against the chicago bear on september 30, 1990\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and check each part of the claim. Let's break it down into parts:\n\n1. **Highest Attendance**: The claim states that the highest attendance was 80,156. I need to find out if this is indeed the highest number in the 'attendance' column.\n\n2. **Opponent**: It mentions \"chicago bear\". Looking at the table, one of the opponents is \"chicago bears\" (I should note the plural here). So that's a possible match.\n\n3. **Date**: The claim specifies September 30, 1990. I need to check which row has this date and see what the attendance was on that day.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Week 4: September 30, 1990 vs Chicago Bears. Attendance is 80,156.\n- Now, looking at other attendances:\n   - Week 2: 61,889\n   - Week 5: 80,076 (close to 80k but slightly less)\n   - Week 4 has the highest so far. Let me check all other weeks just to be sure.\n   - Weeks 3: 50,657; Week 6:50,624; Week 7:60,569; Week 9:70,951; Week 10:50,855; Week 11:70,553; Week 12:65,710; Week 13:74,162; Week 14:72,190; Week 15:54,132; Week 16:53,899; Week 17:62,593.\n\nSo the highest attendance is indeed 80,156 in week 4 against Chicago Bears on September 30, 1990. \n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are correct.

Let's break down the claim: \"when the score be l 9 - 7 the week be 9 and the opponent be at kansas city chief\". \n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim. The main points are:\n1. The result (score) is a loss with a score of 9-7.\n2. This happened in week 9.\n3. The opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the row where the week is 9.

Let me check that row:\n\n- Week: 9\n- Date: November 4, 1990\n- Opponent: Kansas City Chiefs\n- Result: l 9 -7\n- Attendance: 70951\n\nNow, let's verify each part of the claim against this row. The result is indeed a loss (l) with the score 9-7. The week is correctly identified as 9. The opponent listed is \"kansas city chiefs\", which matches what the claim states.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other rows that might have a result of l 9-7 but different weeks or opponents, just to be thorough.

I'll start by checking if there's a row for week 8. Scanning through the weeks listed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, then jumps to 9,10,... So yeah, week 8 is missing from the table. That supports the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I need to verify week 10. Looking for row index where week is 10. The table shows that week 10 is on November 11, 1990, and the opponent is the Green Bay Packers. So both details match what the claim says about week 10.\n\nSo, since week 8 isn't present and week 10 has the specified game, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks a row for week 8, confirming no game was scheduled.

Scanning through the weeks, I see that the rows go up to week 17, so yes, week 12 is present.\n\nIn week 12 (row index starting from 0; the 13th entry in the table since it starts at week 1), the opponent is listed as Kansas City Chiefs. The result is a loss with a score of 27-24 (l 27 - 24). The attendance is indeed 65710.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"Los Angeles Raiders.\" Looking back at the table, I don't see any opponent named Los Angeles Raiders in week 12. Instead, the opponent is Kansas City Chiefs, and there's no mention of Raiders. That seems odd because the Raiders were a team in the NFL during that time, but perhaps they weren't playing against the same team as per this specific table.\n\nAlso, looking at all rows, I don't see any entry where the opponent is Los Angeles Raiders. The teams listed are Broncos, Seahawks, Steelers, Bears, Bills, Chargers, Chiefs, Packers, Dolphins, Bengals, Vikings, and others, but no Raiders.\n\nTherefore, while the score and attendance in week 12 match the claim, the opponent does not. Instead of Raiders, it's Chiefs.

I need to look through all the 'attendance' column values to find if 80076 is indeed the highest.\n   \n   Looking at the 'attendance' numbers:\n   - Week 1: 54206\n   - Week 2: 61889\n   - Week 3: 50657\n   - Week 4: 80156\n   - Week 5: 80076\n   - ... and so on.\n\n   The highest number I see is 80156 in week 4, which is higher than 80076. So the claim that 80076 is the highest is incorrect because there's a higher attendance value elsewhere.\n\n2. **Opponent**: The claim mentions \"buffalo bills.\" Checking the 'opponent' column for October 7, 1990 (week 5), it indeed lists \"buffalo bills.\" So this part of the claim is correct.\n\n3. **Date and Game Details**: The game was on October 7, 1990, against the Buffalo Bills with attendance 80076. That's accurate as per week 5 in the table.\n\nHowever, since the attendance of 80076 isn't the highest (as there's a higher number), the overall claim that it was the highest is FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The opponent and date for week 5 to confirm the game against Buffalo Bills on October 7.\n- The attendance figures across all weeks to determine the actual highest attendance.\n\nI'll list the relevant rows and columns accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the table, I see that in row index 8 (since counting starts from 0), week 9 has a result of 'l 9 - 7'. So the score part matches here.\n\nNext, the claim mentions that the week should be 10. However, in this same row where the score is 9-7, the week number is 9, not 10. That's a discrepancy right there.\n\nThen, checking the opponent for week 9: it's 'kansas city chiefs', but the claim states 'san diego charger'. So neither the week nor the opponent matches what's in the table. \n\nLooking further, I check if there are other rows with a result of 9-7. There isn't any; only row 8 has that score. Therefore, no other weeks have this specific score.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim specifies that when the score is 9-7, the week should be 10 and the opponent San Diego Chargers.

Let me list out the weeks:\n\n- Week 1\n- Week 2\n- Week 3\n- Week 4\n- Week 5\n- Week 6\n- Week 7\n- Week 9\n- Week 10\n- Week 11\n- Week 12\n- Week 13\n- Week 14\n- Week 15\n- Week 16\n- Week 17\n\nWait, I see that week 8 is missing in the table. The weeks go from 7 to 9, skipping 8. So for week 8, there's no entry at all. That means there was no game scheduled for week 8, hence no opponent.\n\nNow, checking week 10: looking at the row with week 10, I see that there is a date (November 11, 1990), an opponent (Green Bay Packers), and a result (loss). So week 10 did have a game against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWait, but the claim says both weeks 8 and 10 didn't have a game or opponent. Since week 10 does have a game and an opponent, this part of the claim is false. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE because while week 8 had no game, week 10 did.\n\nSo, compiling my findings: The relevant cells would be for weeks where there's either an entry or absence that supports the claim. For week 8, since it's missing in the table, we can infer no game. For week 10, looking at the opponent column shows a value, indicating a game was played.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Week 8: Since it's not present, maybe there's no row for it.\nWait, but how to represent that? The table doesn't have a row for week 8, so perhaps we can note that there's no entry. However, in terms of the JSON output, I need to list cells that exist.\n\nAlternatively, since week 8 isn't listed at all, maybe we don't include any cell for it because it's not present. But according to the instructions, I should check each condition against the table and identify which cells are relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For week 8: There is no row in the table with week number 8, so there's nothing in that week.\n- For week 10: The opponent is Green Bay Packers, so it exists.\n\nThus, for the claim to be TRUE, both weeks should have no game or opponent. But since week 10 has an opponent, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells would include:\n\n- For week 8: Since there's no row, maybe nothing? Or perhaps we can note that week 8 isn't present in the table.\nBut according to the instructions, I need to provide rows and columns. So for week 10, the opponent is present in column \"opponent\" at row index where week is 10.\n\nLooking back at the table structure, each row has 'week' as an integer starting from 1. Week 8 isn't listed, so no row exists. Therefore, when checking week 8, there's nothing to reference, meaning no game or opponent for that week. For week 10, we can see it's present.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For week 10: The row where week is 10, specifically the 'opponent' column.\nBut since the claim says both weeks didn't have a game, and week 10 did, that makes the claim false.\n\nIn terms of JSON output, I need to list the relevant cells. Since week 8 isn't in the table, there's no cell to reference for it. But week 10 is in the table at row index 9 (since the first row after header is index 0: week 1 is index 0, week 2 index 1, ..., week 9 would be index 8, week 10 index 9).\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For week 10: row index 9, column 'opponent'.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON output, I'll include that cell to show that week 10 did have an opponent, contradicting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while week 8 does not appear in the table (indicating no game), week 10 does have a game against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"claim_evaluation\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",
