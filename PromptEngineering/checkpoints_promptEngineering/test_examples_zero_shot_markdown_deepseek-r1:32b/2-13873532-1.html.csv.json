    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"Liu Song be not rank higher in 2007 / 2008 than in 2009 / 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table structure. The columns represent different seasons: 2004/05 to 2011/12. Each row seems to have multiple entries under each column, possibly indicating different tournaments, rankings, or statuses for Liu Song in those years.\n\nThe claim is about Liu Song's ranking being lower (not higher) in the 2007/08 season compared to 2009/10. So I need to find the relevant rows that indicate his rank in these two seasons.\n\nLooking at the table, I see numerical values in the first row of each column. For example, under 2004/05 it's 90, then 88 for 2005/06, and so on. These numbers likely represent his ranking positions. \n\nSo for 2007/08, the number is 72, and for 2009/10, it's 59. Since 72 is higher than 59 (remembering that a lower numerical rank means better position), this suggests that Liu Song's ranking was actually worse in 2007/08 compared to 2009/10.\n\nWait, the claim says he wasn't ranked higher in 2007/08 than in 2009/10. But according to these numbers, his rank went from 72 (lower position) in 2007/08 to 59 (higher position) in 2009/10. That means he improved, so the claim that he wasn't higher would be TRUE because 72 is indeed lower than 59\u2014meaning his ranking wasn't higher; it was worse.\n\nBut I should double-check if there are other rows indicating different tournaments or statuses that might affect this conclusion. However, the numerical values in the first row seem to directly represent rankings, so they're the most relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Liu Song's rank in 2007/08 (72) was lower than in 2009/10 (59), indicating he wasn't ranked higher in that period.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2007 / 08\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like Liu Song's ranking decreased from 2010/11 to 2011/12 by three ranks. So I'm looking for Liu Song's rankings in these two periods and see if the later one is indeed lower (i.e., a higher numerical value, since rank numbers increase as position decreases).\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for different years from 2004/05 up to 2011/12. Each row represents some data about tournaments or rankings.\n\nI need to find rows that mention Liu Song. However, scanning through the rows, I notice that the rows are labeled with terms like \"ranking tournaments,\" \"not held,\" \"lq,\" etc., but there's no explicit mention of a person's name, such as \"Liu Song.\" The data cells under each year column have values like 90, 88, etc., which might represent rankings or scores.\n\nWait, perhaps the rows without specific names are cumulative or category-based. For example, row 0 has numbers that could be overall rankings for a particular type of tournament. But since there's no name specified in any cell, it's unclear if Liu Song is represented here.\n\nWithout explicit identifiers like \"Liu Song\" in the table, I can't directly correlate the ranking numbers to him. The claim references specific years and rank changes, but without knowing which row corresponds to Liu Song, I can't verify his rankings for those periods.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, there's no way to confirm whether Liu Song's rank decreased by three positions between 2010/11 and 2011/12. The relevant cells don't include any information that ties a specific ranking number to Liu Song in those years.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks specific identifiers for \"Liu Song,\" making it impossible to verify the claim based on the provided data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"Liu Song's worst ranking be 90th in the season of 2004 / 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It seems to have multiple rows and columns corresponding to different seasons (e.g., 2004/05, 2005/06) and various categories like \"ranking tournaments,\" \"non-ranking tournaments,\" etc. Each cell under these columns contains values that likely represent Liu Song's performance or rankings in those specific tournaments during each season.\n\nThe claim mentions the worst ranking being 90th in the 2004/05 season. So, I need to focus on the column for 2004/05 and look for the relevant rows related to rankings.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first row under 2004/05 has a value of 90 in that column. This is probably Liu Song's ranking.\n- The second row mentions \"ranking tournaments,\" which aligns with the context of the claim about rankings.\n  \nSo, these two cells seem directly relevant to verifying the claim. There doesn't appear to be any conflicting information elsewhere in the table regarding this specific point. Therefore, since the 2004/05 season shows a ranking of 90th under \"ranking tournaments,\" the claim is supported by the data.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 1 under the 2004/05 column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2004 / 05\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2004 / 05\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are labeled with seasons: 2004/05, 2005/06, up to 2011/12. Each row under these columns seems to contain different pieces of information. Some rows have numbers like 90, 88, etc., while others have abbreviations such as \"ranking tournaments\", \"not held\", \"lq\", and so on.\n\nThe claim is about Liu Song's best ranking being 53 in the 2008/09 season. So I need to find where 53 is located in the table for that specific season.\n\nLooking at the 2008/09 column, the first row under this column has the number 53. The rows above and below it have different values like \"ranking tournaments\", \"not held\", etc. So, I think this 53 might be Liu Song's ranking for that season.\n\nNow, to confirm if this is indeed her best ranking in that season, I should check other entries under the same column to see if there are any higher or lower numbers. The rows below 53 have values like 59, 62, and so on, but these seem to be for different categories or tournaments. The first row's number is 53, which appears to be a ranking number.\n\nSince the claim specifies that her best ranking was 53 in 2008/09, and the table shows 53 under that season's column, it seems supported. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Liu Song's best ranking is 53 during the 2008/09 season. The table confirms this with a value of 53 in the relevant cell.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"Liu Song be rank 59 in 2009/2010 and 88 in 2005/2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It seems to have columns representing different years from 2004/05 up to 2011/12. Each column has multiple rows with various entries like numbers, abbreviations (like \"lq\", \"a\"), and some text indicating the type of tournament or status.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific ranks: 59 in the 2009/2010 season and 88 in the 2005/2006 season. So, I need to check if these numbers appear in their respective columns under Liu Song's row.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 2005/06: The column \"2005 / 06\" has a value of 88 in the first row (row index 0). So that part seems to match. But I need to confirm if this is indeed Liu Song's rank.\n\n- For 2009/10: The claim says rank 59. In the \"2009 / 10\" column, looking at row index 4 (since counting starts from 0), there's a 59 in that cell. Again, I need to check if this is under Liu Song's entry.\n\nWait, but how do I know which rows correspond to Liu Song? The table doesn't explicitly mention the names. It just lists various rankings and statuses for different tournaments. So perhaps each row represents a different player or participant.\n\nIn the first column (\"2004 / 05\"), the numbers start with 90, then there are several entries like \"ranking tournaments\", \"not held\", etc., followed by other abbreviations. I think the first numeric value in each column might represent the rank of a specific player. So, for example, in the 2004/05 column, row index 0 has 90, which could be Liu Song's rank that year.\n\nSimilarly, in the 2005/06 column, row index 0 is 88, and in 2009/10, row index 4 is 59. So, if the claim states that Liu Song was ranked 59 in 2009/10 and 88 in 2005/06, I need to check these positions.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In \"2005 / 06\" column, row 0 has 88. So that matches.\n- In \"2009 / 10\" column, row 4 is 59. But does this correspond to Liu Song?\n\nWait, I'm not sure because the rows might represent different tournaments or events, not individual players. Each row could be a different tournament's ranking. For example, the first few rows under \"2004 / 05\" are numbers like 90, then \"ranking tournaments\", etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each numeric entry is a rank for a particular player in that year. So if row index 0 has 88 in 2005/06 and row index 4 has 59 in 2009/10, does this mean Liu Song's ranks?\n\nBut the problem is the table doesn't explicitly state whose rank it is. It could be that each numeric value corresponds to a different player or the same player across years.\n\nGiven the claim refers specifically to Liu Song, I need to see if there are any entries in the table that indicate Liu Song's performance.\n\nLooking through the rows, after the initial numbers, there are terms like \"ranking tournaments\", \"non-ranking tournaments\", etc. But no names mentioned, so perhaps each numeric value is for a different player or perhaps it's aggregate data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row (row index 0) under each column represents Liu Song's rank. So in 2005/06, he was 88th, and in 2009/10, looking at row index 4 of that column is 59. But wait, maybe the rows are per tournament or event, so I can't be sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each column represents a different year, and within each column, the first numeric value is Liu Song's rank for that year. So in \"2005 / 06\", row index 0 is 88, which would be his rank. Similarly, in \"2009 /10\", looking at row index 4: wait, no\u2014maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the table structure:\n\nThe first column is \"2004 / 05\" with entries starting from row 0 as 90. Then rows go on with various terms like \"ranking tournaments\", \"not held\", etc. Similarly for other columns.\n\nAssuming that each column lists the rankings, perhaps in order, so row 0 could be the first player's rank, row 1 another player, and so on. So if Liu Song was ranked 88th in 2005/06, his entry would be at row 87 (since counting starts from 0). But that seems unlikely because the table only has a few rows per column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each column's first numeric value is the top rank or something else. It's unclear without more context.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, but considering the claim refers to specific ranks in specific years, I'll proceed under the assumption that the numbers in row 0 of each column represent Liu Song's rank for that year.\n\nSo:\n\n- In \"2005 / 06\", row 0 is 88. That matches.\n- In \"2009 /10\", looking at row 4, which has 59. But if we're assuming row 0 is the top rank, then perhaps row 4 in that column represents a different player or event.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for the 59 in the \"2009 /10\" column. Let me check:\n\nIn the \"2009 /10\" column, let's see the entries:\n\nRow 0: perhaps another number (but not sure as it's not shown)\nRow 4: 59\n\nIf row 4 is 59, that could be Liu Song's rank if he was 60th overall? Because in programming, indices start at 0. So 0 would be 1st place, 1 would be 2nd, etc. But this doesn't align with the claim which says \"rank 59\".\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are literal ranks, so row 4 being 59 means he was ranked 59th in that year.\n\nBut without knowing which row corresponds to Liu Song, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe each column's first numeric value is for a specific player, and subsequent rows are other players or events.\n\nGiven the lack of names, I'll proceed with the assumption that the claim refers to the numbers present in those columns at specific rows.\n\nSo:\n\n- For 2005/06: The number 88 is in row 0.\n- For 2009/10: The number 59 is in row 4.\n\nThus, if Liu Song's ranks were 88 and 59 in those years, the relevant cells are:\n\n- \"2005 / 06\" at row 0\n- \"2009 /10\" at row 4\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both numbers are present in their respective columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Liu Song was ranked 88th in 2005/06 and 59th in 2009/10. The table shows these numbers in the corresponding years at rows 0 and 4, respectively.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2005 / 06\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2009 / 10\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"liu song be rank higher in 2007 / 2008 than in 2009 / 2010.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems like each row corresponds to different tournaments and their respective rankings over several years (from 2004/05 to 2011/12). The numbers might represent ranking positions or something similar.\n\nThe claim is about Liu Song's rank in two specific periods: 2007/08 and 2009/10. So, I need to look at the rows related to these years and find where \"liu song\" is mentioned.\n\nLooking through the table, each row doesn't explicitly mention names like \"liu song.\" Instead, it has entries like 'a', 'lq', 'wr', etc., which might be abbreviations or codes for different statuses or results. For example, 'a' could stand for advanced, 'lq' for last qualifier, and so on.\n\nSince the table doesn't have names, I need to infer if \"liu song\" is associated with any specific entries. Maybe Liu Song's performance corresponds to certain rows that show higher rankings in 2007/08 compared to 2009/10.\n\nI'll examine the columns for 2007/08 and 2009/10:\n\n- In 2007/08, looking at each row under that column:\n  - The first entry is 'a', which might indicate a good performance.\n  - Other entries include 'lq' (last qualifier), 'qf' (quarter-finals), etc.\n\n- In 2009/10, the entries are similar:\n  - First entry '59' (which could be a ranking number), then 'lq', 'a', and so on.\n\nWait, actually, I see that in the first row of each column, there's a numerical value. For 2007/08 it's 72, and for 2009/10 it's 59. These might be ranking points or positions. If lower numbers indicate higher rankings (since in tennis, lower ATP rankings are better), then 59 is a better position than 72. That would mean Liu Song ranked higher in 2009/10 than in 2007/08, which contradicts the claim.\n\nBut maybe I'm misinterpreting these numbers. Perhaps higher numbers are better. In some contexts, higher points mean better performance. If that's the case, then 72 is better than 59, supporting the claim.\n\nHowever, without explicit context on what these numbers represent, it's hard to be certain. But given standard ranking systems where lower numbers are better, I think 59 is a higher rank (better) than 72.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers aren't rankings but something else. Let me check other rows for consistency. For example, in 2010/11, the number is 62, which is between 59 and 72. If Liu's ranking improved from 2007/08 to 2009/10, then 59 would be better than 72.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"rank higher in 2007/08 than in 2009/10,\" so if 72 is lower (worse) than 59, that means Liu ranked worse in 2007/08, making the claim FALSE. But I'm not sure about the interpretation of these numbers.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each row represents a different tournament or event. So, Liu Song's participation and results across different tournaments are listed here. Maybe \"a\" stands for advancement, which could indicate higher performance.\n\nLooking at 2007/08 column:\n- Rows with 'a' might mean he advanced further in those tournaments.\nIn 2009/10:\n- He has '59', then 'lq', 'a', etc. So maybe in some tournaments, he performed better in 2009/10.\n\nBut without knowing which row corresponds to Liu Song, it's tricky. Maybe the first row with the number is his overall ranking. If so, 72 vs. 59 would mean he improved, making the claim FALSE because he didn't rank higher in 2007/08 than 2009/10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each numerical value corresponds to a different aspect, like points or something else entirely. Without more context, it's hard to be certain.\n\nBut given standard ranking logic where lower numbers are better, I think the claim is FALSE because 59 (2009/10) is a higher rank than 72 (2007/08). Therefore, Liu Song ranked higher in 2009/10, so the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table's numerical values under each year likely represent ranking positions where lower numbers indicate better ranks. Comparing Liu Song's rankings: \n\n- In 2007/08, he has a rank of 72.\n- In 2009/10, his rank is 59.\n\nSince 59 is a higher position (better) than 72, the claim that Liu Song ranked higher in 2007/08 is false.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"liu song 's lowest ranking be in 2009 / 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand what each part represents. The columns are years from 2004/05 up to 2011/12, and there are multiple rows under each year with different categories like \"ranking tournaments,\" \"not held,\" \"non-ranking tournaments,\" etc.\n\nThe claim is about Liu Song's lowest ranking being in the 2009/10 season. So I need to find the relevant data for that specific time frame and see if it indeed represents the lowest point in his rankings.\n\nLooking at the table, each column corresponds to a year range, so \"2009 / 10\" is one of them. Now, under this column, there are multiple rows with various entries like numbers, abbreviations (e.g., lq, wr), and text. Since we're talking about rankings, I should focus on the numerical values as they likely represent ranking positions.\n\nIn the \"2009 / 10\" column, the first row has a value of 59.

The columns are labeled with years in a specific format: \"2004 / 05\", \"2005 / 06\", and so on up to \"2011 / 12\". Each column likely represents a season or period.\n\nThe rows seem to be categorized into different types of tournaments:\n- Ranking tournaments\n- Non-ranking tournaments\n- Variant format tournaments\n- Former ranking tournaments\n- Former non-ranking tournaments\n\nEach cell under these categories contains various abbreviations like \"a\", \"lq\", \"1r\", etc. I need to figure out what these abbreviations mean because they are crucial for understanding the rankings.\n\nLooking at the claim, it mentions Liu Song falling 5 places in the ranking between two specific periods: 2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012. So I need to check the relevant columns for these years.\n\nThe columns of interest are \"2010 / 11\" and \"2011 / 12\". Let's find their positions:\n\n- The first column after 2004/05 is 2005/06, so each subsequent column moves one year forward.\n- So, the columns in order are:\n  1. 2004 / 05\n  2. 2005 / 06\n  3. 2007 / 08 (Wait, this seems off; perhaps there's a typo or missing years? Or maybe the table skips some years)\n  \nWait, looking again at the columns:\nThe headers are: \"2004 / 05\", \"2005 / 06\", \"2007 / 08\", \"2008 / 09\", \"2009 / 10\", \"2010 / 11\", \"2011 / 12\".\n\nHmm, between 2005/06 and 2007/08, there's a jump of two years. So the table doesn't include data for all consecutive seasons; some are missing. Therefore, the periods covered in the table are:\n- 2004/05\n- 2005/06\n- 2007/08\n- 2008/09\n- 2009/10\n- 2010/11\n- 2011/12\n\nSo, the claim refers to the periods \"2010 / 2011\" and \"2011 / 2012\", which correspond to columns \"2010 / 11\" and \"2011 / 12\". Now I need to find Liu Song's ranking in these two columns.\n\nBut wait, the table is structured with multiple rows under each category. Each row represents a different tournament or event within those categories. So for example, under \"ranking tournaments\", there are several rows, each possibly representing a specific event.\n\nI'm assuming that each cell under a column (year period) indicates Liu Song's performance in that particular tournament during that season. The numbers like 90, 88, etc., might represent his ranking points or positions.\n\nLooking at the first row under \"ranking tournaments\" for the columns:\n- For \"2010 / 11\", the value is 62\n- For \"2011 / 12\", the value is 65\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if these are rankings. Alternatively, perhaps they're points or something else.\n\nBut the claim says Liu Song fell 5 places between these two periods. So his ranking in 2010/11 should be higher (better) than in 2011/12 by 5 positions.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- In \"2010 / 11\", he has 62\n- In \"2011 / 12\", he has 65\n\nIf these are ranking points, a higher number might mean worse performance. Or perhaps lower is better? That's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent his rank position. So if in 2010/11 he was ranked 62nd and in 2011/12 he was ranked 65th, that would mean he dropped by 3 places, not 5 as claimed.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rows. The first row under \"ranking tournaments\" has numbers like 90,88, etc., which might be points or something else. Maybe the actual rankings are in a different part of the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"a\", \"lq\", and other abbreviations indicate his performance, with \"a\" meaning he advanced, \"lq\" maybe lost in qualifiers, etc. The numerical values could represent his ranking position.\n\nLooking again at the rows:\n\nUnder \"ranking tournaments\":\n- Row 0: 90,88, etc.\n- Rows below have various codes like \"a\", \"lq\", \"1r\".\n\nPerhaps row 0 is the ranking points or overall rank for that period. So in \"2010 / 11\", he has 62, and in \"2011 / 12\", he has 65.\n\nIf we consider these as ranks, going from 62 to 65 would be a drop of 3 places, not 5. Therefore, the claim that he fell 5 places doesn't match this data.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the rows. Perhaps each row under \"ranking tournaments\" represents a specific tournament within that category, and the numbers are his performance in each of those tournaments.\n\nIn that case, to find his overall ranking for the season, we might need to sum points or something else, which isn't provided here. So without knowing how these individual performances translate into overall rankings, it's hard to assess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first row under each category is his total points, and the rows below are specific tournament results.\n\nGiven that, let's check:\n\nUnder \"ranking tournaments\", row 0 for \"2010 / 11\" is 62, and for \"2011 / 12\" it's 65. If these represent his total points or ranking positions, then from 62 to 65 would be a drop of 3, not 5.\n\nAlternatively, if the numbers are inverted (lower is better), then 62 being lower than 65 would mean he improved, which contradicts the claim.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding the meaning of these numbers. Maybe they're seedings or something else.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in what the numbers represent and without additional context, it's challenging to definitively say whether Liu Song fell by 5 places.\n\nHowever, based on the data provided, if row 0 under \"ranking tournaments\" is his ranking position, then from 62 to 65 is a drop of 3, not 5. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rows. Maybe the actual rankings are in different rows or categories.\n\nLooking further down, under other categories like \"variant format tournaments\" and \"former ranking tournaments\", we see numbers as well. Perhaps Liu Song's overall ranking is a combination of all these.\n\nBut without clear headers indicating what each row represents (e.g., whether they're specific tournaments or overall rankings), it's difficult to make an accurate assessment.\n\nGiven the information at hand, the most straightforward interpretation is that the first row under \"ranking tournaments\" shows his performance in those categories. So from 62 to 65 would be a drop of 3, making the claim of a 5-place fall incorrect.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2010 / 11\"}, {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2011 / 12\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"liu song be rank 40 place lower in 2009 / 2010 than in 2005 / 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that Liu Song's ranking position in the 2009/2010 period was lower (worse) by 40 places compared to his position in 2005/2006. So I need to check his rankings for these two periods and see if there is a 40-place difference.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized with years as columns: 2004/05 up to 2011/12. Each column lists different tournaments or events with various results like \"ranking tournaments,\" \"non-ranking tournaments,\" etc., and each row under these headers has codes like 'a', 'lq', 'wr', which I assume stand for things like advanced, lost in qualifying, withdrew, respectively.\n\nI need to find the rows that pertain to Liu Song's rankings. Scanning through the table, it seems there are multiple entries under \"ranking tournaments\" and others under different categories. However, without explicit mention of \"Liu Song,\" I have to infer based on typical tournament structures.\n\nWait, maybe each row represents a player or participant, but in this case, the rows don't seem to be labeled with names. The first row under each column has numbers like 90, 88, etc., which might represent rankings. For example, in the 2004/05 column, the first number is 90. Then, looking at the next rows, there are entries like 'ranking tournaments', 'not held', 'lq', and so on.\n\nSo perhaps each row represents a different player or participant's performance across these years. But without names, it's hard to be certain. The claim mentions \"Liu Song,\" but I don't see his name in the table. Therefore, this might be an issue because the table doesn't explicitly mention Liu Song.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent rankings of specific tournaments, and 'a' or other codes indicate whether the participant advanced or lost. But without knowing which row corresponds to Liu Song, it's impossible to extract his ranking data from the table.\n\nTherefore, since there is no explicit information about Liu Song in the table, I cannot verify the claim. The relevant cells needed for verification are missing because we don't know which rows pertain to him.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as the table does not contain information about \"Liu Song.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a table in markdown format and a claim about Liu Song's best ranking being in the 2008/2009 season when he made it into the top 50. My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data presented in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The columns represent different seasons: 2004/05 up to 2011/12. Each row under these columns seems to contain various rankings and statuses like 'lq' (lost in qualifiers), 'a', 'wr', etc.\n\nThe claim mentions Liu Song's best ranking was top 50 in the 2008/2009 season. So, I should focus on that specific column: \"2008 / 09\".\n\nLooking at the table, under the \"2008 / 09\" column, there are multiple entries across different rows. The numbers here include 53 and 59 in the first few rows, but also various statuses like 'lq', 'a', etc. I need to identify if any of these indicate a ranking within the top 50.\n\nThe numeric values under \"2008 / 09\" are 53 and 59. Both of these are above 50, meaning Liu Song's ranking in that season was outside the top 50. Therefore, the claim that he made it into the top 50 during this period is not supported by the data.\n\nI also need to verify if there are other cells that might support the claim elsewhere, but upon reviewing all rows under \"2008 / 09\", none of them show a ranking equal to or below 50. All numerical rankings are above 50, and the rest are non-numerical statuses which don't indicate top 50.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"2008 / 09\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
