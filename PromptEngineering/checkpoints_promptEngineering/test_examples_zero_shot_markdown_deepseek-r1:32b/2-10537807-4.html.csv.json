    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the most song release in a year be 3, which happen in 3 different year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the maximum number of song releases in any single year is three, and this maximum occurs in three distinct years. So, my task is to check two things:\n1. What is the highest number of songs released in a single year?\n2. How many different years have this maximum number?\n\nTo do this, I'll go through each row of the table and count how many songs were released each year.\n\nLooking at the \"release date\" column, which indicates the release year for each song:\n\n- 1999: Only one song (\"here it comes\") was released.\n- 2000: There are three entries. Let's check:\n  - \"the cedar room\": March 20, 2000\n  - \"catch the sun\": May 29, 2000\n  - \"the man who told everything\": October 30, 2000\n  So, three songs in 2000.\n- 2001: No entries.\n- 2002:\n  - \"there goes the fear\": April 15, 2002\n  - \"pounding\": July 22, 2002\n  - \"caught by the river\": October 14, 2002\n  That's three songs in 2002.\n- 2003: No entries.\n- 2004: No entries.\n- 2005:\n  - \"black and white town\": February 7, 2005\n  - \"snowden\": May 9, 2005\n  - \"sky starts falling\": September 12, 2005\n  Again, three songs in 2005.\n- 2006: No entries.\n- 2007: No entries.\n- 2008: No entries.\n- 2009:\n  - \"kingdom of rust\": March 30, 2009\n  - \"winter hill\": July 20, 2009\n  Two songs in 2009.\n- 2010:\n  - \"andalucia\": April 5, 2010\n  One song.\n\nSo, the counts per year are as follows:\n- 1999: 1\n- 2000: 3\n- 2002: 3\n- 2005: 3\n- 2009: 2\n- 2010: 1\n\nFrom this, the maximum number of releases in a single year is three. This happened in three different years: 2000, 2002, and 2005.\n\nNow, checking against the claim: it correctly states that the most song releases in a year are three, and these occurred in three distinct years. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are all the \"release date\" entries for each of these songs across the years 2000, 2002, and 2005.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_2\": 2, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_3\": 3, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_4\": 4, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_5\": 5, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_6\": 6, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_7\": 7, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_8\": 8, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_9\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So my task is to count how many songs in the table have \"some cities\" as their album and check if that number is exactly three.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check the 'album' column. \n\nRow 0: Album is \"here it comes ep\"\nRow 1: Album is \"lost souls\"\nRow 2: Album is \"lost souls\"\nRow 3: Album is \"lost souls\"\nRow 4: Album is \"the last broadcast\"\nRow 5: Album is \"the last broadcast\"\nRow 6: Album is \"the last broadcast\"\nRow 7: Album is \"some cities\"\nRow 8: Album is \"some cities\"\nRow 9: Album is \"some cities\"\nRow 10: Album is \"kingdom of rust\"\nRow 11: Album is \"kingdom of rust\"\nRow 12: Album is \"the places between : the best of doves\"\n\nSo, looking at row indices 7, 8, and 9, each has the album \"some cities\".

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 11 more song release on heavenly than there be on casino\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: song, release date, release info, formats, and album. Each row represents a song with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions two release labels: Heavenly and Casino. It states that there are 11 more song releases on Heavenly compared to Casino. So, my task is to count how many songs were released under each label.\n\nLooking at the \"release info\" column:\n\n- The first song's release info is casino (chip003). That's one for Casino.\n- The next entries from row 2 onwards have release info starting with heavenly (...hvn95, hvn96, etc.), except for some that might not be relevant. Let me count each occurrence of \"heavenly\" and \"casino\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: casino (chip003) \u2192 Casino count = 1\n2. Row 1: heavenly (hvn95) \u2192 Heavenly count = 1\n3. Row 2: heavenly (hvn96) \u2192 Heavenly = 2\n4. Row 3: heavenly (hvn98) \u2192 Heavenly = 3\n5. Row 4: heavenly (hvn111) \u2192 Heavenly = 4\n6. Row 5: heavenly (hvn116) \u2192 Heavenly = 5\n7. Row 6: heavenly (hvn126) \u2192 Heavenly = 6\n8. Row 7: heavenly (hvn145) \u2192 Heavenly = 7\n9. Row 8: heavenly (hvn150) \u2192 Heavenly = 8\n10. Row 9: heavenly (hvn152) \u2192 Heavenly = 9\n11. Row 10: heavenly (hvn189) \u2192 Heavenly = 10\n12. Row 11: heavenly (hvn192) \u2192 Heavenly = 11\n13. Row 12: heavenly (hvn201) \u2192 Heavenly = 12\n\nWait, but the last song's release info is \"the places between : the best of doves\". Does that count as Heavenly? The pattern before was \"heavenly (...)\", but this one doesn't start with that. So maybe only up to row 12 (index 12) are under Heavenly.\n\nWait, no: let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row's release info:\n\nRow 0: casino \u2192 Casino:1\n\nRows 1-12: all have \"heavenly\" in the release info except the last one?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe last song (row 12) has release info \"the places between : the best of doves\". That doesn't mention Heavenly or Casino. So that's neither.\n\nSo let me recount:\n\n- Casino: only row 0 \u2192 1 song\n- Heavenly: rows 1 to 11, but wait, does row 12 have Heavenly? No, it has a different release info.\n\nWait no, row indices might be from 0 to 12. Let's check each row's \"release info\":\n\nRow 0: casino (chip003) \u2192 Casino\nRows 1-11: all say \"heavenly (...)\" except perhaps some? Wait:\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRow 12 has release info \"the places between : the best of doves\". So, only rows 0 and 1-11 have either casino or heavenly. Let me count how many have casino and how many have heavenly.\n\nCasino: Only row 0 \u2192 count =1\n\nHeavenly: Rows 1 to 12 (wait, no):\n\nWait, let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: Casino\nRow 1: Heavenly\nRow 2: Heavenly\nRow 3: Heavenly\nRow 4: Heavenly\nRow 5: Heavenly\nRow 6: Heavenly\nRow 7: Heavenly\nRow 8: Heavenly\nRow 9: Heavenly\nRow 10: Heavenly\nRow 11: Heavenly\nRow 12: Not Heavenly or Casino\n\nSo, rows 1-11 have release info starting with Heavenly. That's 11 songs under Heavenly.\n\nCasino has only row 0 \u2192 1 song.\n\nSo the claim is that Heavenly has 11 more releases than Casino. Let's compute:\n\nHeavenly count: 12? Wait, no:\n\nWait, from rows 1-11 inclusive, that's 11 rows (since row indices start at 0). So 1 to 11 is 11 rows.\n\nSo Heavenly has 11 releases, Casino has 1. The difference is 11 -1 =10.\n\nBut the claim says \"11 more\", meaning 12 vs 1? Wait no: if there are 11 on Heavenly and 1 on Casino, that's a difference of 10. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, did I count correctly?\n\nHeavenly has rows 1-12 or 1-11?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 12 (total 13 songs). Rows with Heavenly are from 1 to 11 inclusive? Or up to row 12?\n\nWait no, the last song (row 12) is release info \"the places between...\", which doesn't start with \"heavenly\", so only rows 1-11 have \"heavenly\" as release info.\n\nSo:\n\nHeavenly: 11 releases\n\nCasino:1 release\n\nDifference:10. So the claim that Heavenly has 11 more than Casino is incorrect because it's actually 10 more.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nList of rows with \"heavenly\":\n\nRow 1: yes\nRow 2: yes\nRow3:yes\n4:yes\n5:yes\n6:yes\n7:yes\n8:yes\n9:yes\n10:yes\n11:yes\n\nThat's 11 rows.\n\nSo 11 vs 1. The difference is 10, not 11.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Heavenly has 11 more releases than Casino is incorrect; it's actually 10 more.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread some of the release info fields.\n\nLooking at each \"release info\":\n\nRow 0: casino (chip003) \u2192 Casino\nRow 1: heavenly (hvn95)\nRow2:hvn96\nRow3:hvn98\nRow4:hvn111\nRow5:hvn116\nRow6:hvn126\nRow7:hvn145\nRow8:hvn150\nRow9:hvn152\nRow10:hvn189\nRow11:hvn192\nRow12:the places... \u2192 neither.\n\nSo yes, 11 rows have \"heavenly\", one row has casino.\n\nThus, the number of songs on Heavenly is 11, Casino is 1. So the difference is 10, not 11. Therefore, the claim is off by one.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, does each release info correspond to one song? Yes, each row is a song.\n\nSo 11 vs 1: the difference is indeed 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Heavenly has 11 more releases than Casino is incorrect. It should be 10 more.\n\nBut the question says \"You are tasked...\". So perhaps I need to explain this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me list all rows with their release info:\n\nRow 0: casino (chip003)\nRow1: heavenly (hvn95)\nRow2:hvn96\nRow3:hvn98\nRow4:hvn111\nRow5:hvn116\nRow6:hvn126\nRow7:hvn145\nRow8:hvn150\nRow9:hvn152\nRow10:hvn189\nRow11:hvn192\nRow12:the places between...\n\nSo that's 1 casino, 11 heavenly. So difference is 10.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect by one.\n\nBut perhaps I misread row indices. Maybe rows are from 0 to 12 (inclusive) making 13 songs:\n\n- Casino:1\n- Heavenly:12? No, because row12's release info isn't heavenly.\n\nSo only rows1-11 have heavenly, which is 11 songs.\n\nThus, the difference is 11 -1=10. So the claim of \"11 more\" is wrong; it's 10 more.\n\nBut wait, maybe the last song (row12) is actually under Heavenly but with a different notation? Let me check:\n\nRow12: release info is \"the places between : the best of doves\". That seems to be an album name rather than a label. So perhaps it's not under either label.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that Heavenly has 11 releases and Casino has 1, so Heavenly has 10 more, not 11.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the claim that there are 11 more song releases on Heavenly compared to Casino is accurate, we'll count the number of songs under each label.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column:** The \"release info\" column indicates whether a song was released by Heavenly or Casino.\n2. **Count the releases for each label:**\n   - **Casino:** Only one entry in row 0 (\"casino (chip003)\").\n   - **Heavenly:** Entries from row1 to row11, which is 11 songs.\n3. **Calculate the difference:** Subtract the number of Casino releases from Heavenly releases: 11 - 1 = 10.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe claim that there are 11 more releases on Heavenly than Casino is incorrect. There are actually **10 more releases** under Heavenly.\n\nANSWER: \\boxed{10}",

Song: here it comes\n   - Release info: casino (chip003)\n   - So, casino count = 1\n\nRow 2:\n2. The cedar room\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn95)\n   - Heavenly count = 1\n\nRow 3:\n3. Catch the sun\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn96)\n   - Heavenly count increments to 2\n\nRow 4:\n4. The man who told everything\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn98)\n   - Heavenly count now at 3\n\nRow 5:\n5. There goes the fear\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn111)\n   - Heavenly count increases to 4\n\nRow 6:\n6. Pounding\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn116)\n   - Heavenly count is now 5\n\nRow 7:\n7. Caught by the river\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn126)\n   - Heavenly count reaches 6\n\nRow 8:\n8. Black and white town\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn145)\n   - Heavenly count is now 7\n\nRow 9:\n9. Snowden\n   - Release info: heavenly (hvn150)\n   - Heavenly count increments to 8\n\nRow 10:\n10. Sky starts falling\n    - Release info: heavenly (hvn152)\n    - Heavenly count goes up to 9\n\nRow 11:\n11. Kingdom of rust\n    - Release info: heavenly (hvn189)\n    - Heavenly count is now 10\n\nRow 12:\n12. Winter hill\n    - Release info: heavenly (hvn192)\n    - Heavenly count reaches 11\n\nRow 13:\n13. Andalucia\n    - Release info: heavenly (hvn201)\n    - Heavenly count increases to 12\n\nWait a minute, I realize that row 8 through row 13 all list \"heavenly\" in the release info column. So from row 8 onward, every song is released under the heavenly label.\n\nNow, summarizing:\n- Casino appears once (row 0)\n- Heavenly appears 12 times (rows 1 to 13)\n\nSo according to this count, casino has only one release, while heavenly has twelve releases.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that more songs were released through casino than heavenly. But based on the counts, the opposite is true: heavenly has significantly more releases than casino.\n\nWait, but looking back at row 0:\n- The song \"here it comes\" is under casino (chip003). So that's one for casino.\n\nRows 1 to 13 are all heavenly except row 0. Let me recount:\n\nTotal rows from the table: 14 entries (including the header), so data starts at row 0 (first song) up to row 13.\n\nRow 0: casino\nRows 1-13: all have release info starting with \"heavenly\".\n\nSo casino has only one entry, and heavenly has 13 entries. Wait no, because row 0 is the first data row, so from row index 0 (here it comes) to row index 13 (andalucia), that's 14 rows.\n\nWait, let me recount correctly:\n\nRow indexes are from 0 to 13, as the table starts with a header. So each of the 14 songs has their own row.\n\nLooking back:\n- Row 0: casino\n- Rows 1-13: all heavenly\n\nSo that's 1 for casino and 13 for heavenly. Therefore, more songs were released through heavenly than casino.\n\nWait no, because the claim is \"more song be release through casino than through heavenly\". So if casino has 1, heavenly has 13, then casino does not have more releases than heavenly. Thus, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any rows where \"casino\" might appear again.\n\nLooking back through all rows:\n\nRow 0: casino\nRows 1-13: all heavenly\n\nSo indeed, only one song is released under casino, and thirteen under heavenly. Therefore, the claim that more were released under casino than heavenly is incorrect; it's actually the opposite.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is False.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that more songs were released through the casino label than the heavenly label. By examining each row in the \"release info\" column:\n\n- Casino appears once (song: here it comes).\n- Heavenly appears twelve times (songs: the cedar room, catch the sun, the man who told everything, there goes the fear, pounding, caught by the river, black and white town, snowden, sky starts falling, kingdom of rust, winter hill, andalucia).\n\nSince 12 releases are under heavenly compared to 1 for casino, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** False",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"the number of song release by dove increase every year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nThe table has columns: song, release date, release info, formats, and album. The rows contain information about various songs released under a label, possibly by an artist named Dove since the claim mentions \"dove.\" I'll assume \"Doves\" is the artist in question here, given the context of the albums like \"The Last Broadcast\" and \"Some Cities,\" which are known to be works by Doves.\n\nFirst, I should list out all the song releases along with their release years. The relevant cells will include each row's 'song' and 'release date' since those are needed to count yearly releases.\n\nLooking at the release dates:\n- 2 august 1999 \u2192 1999\n- 20 march 2000 \u2192 2000\n- 29 may 2000 \u2192 2000\n- 30 october 2000 \u2192 2000\n- 15 april 2002 \u2192 2002\n- 22 july 2002 \u2192 2002\n- 14 october 2002 \u2192 2002\n- 7 february 2005 \u2192 2005\n- 9 may 2005 \u2192 2005\n- 12 september 2005 \u2192 2005\n- 30 march 2009 \u2192 2009\n- 20 july 2009 \u2192 2009\n- 5 april 2010 \u2192 2010\n\nNow, let's count the number of releases each year:\n- 1999: 1 release (Here It Comes EP)\n- 2000: 3 releases (The Cedar Room, Catch The Sun, The Man Who Told Everything)\n- 2002: 3 releases (There Goes The Fear, Pounding, Caught By The River)\n- 2005: 3 releases (Black And White Town, Snowden, Sky Starts Falling)\n- 2009: 2 releases (Kingdom Of Rust, Winter Hill)\n- 2010: 1 release (Andalucia)\n\nWait a minute. Let me recount to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLooking again:\n- 1999: Only \"here it comes\" \u2192 1\n- 2000: Three songs released in that year.\n- 2002: Three releases as well, same count as 2000.\n- 2005: Also three releases.\n- 2009: Two releases.\n- 2010: One release.\n\nSo the counts are:\n1999: 1\n2000: 3\n2002: 3\n2005: 3\n2009: 2\n2010: 1\n\nThe claim is that the number of song releases increases every year. Let's see if this is true.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2000, it increased from 1 to 3 \u2192 increase.\nBut then from 2000 to 2002 (skipping 2001), there are no entries for 2001. Wait, does the absence of data mean no releases in 2001? Or is this just a partial table?\n\nAssuming that the table includes all relevant releases, if 2001 had no releases, then from 2000 (3) to 2002 (3), it's not an increase. So between 2000 and 2002, the number didn't increase\u2014it stayed the same.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the counts:\n- 1999:1\n- 2000:3 \u2192 increase\nBut then from 2000 to 2002, it's still 3 each year. So no increase there.\nThen from 2005 (3) to 2009 (2), it decreased.\n\nTherefore, the number of releases doesn't increase every year; in fact, after some years, it decreases or remains constant.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE because the number does not consistently increase each year. In particular, between 2000 and 2002, it remained the same, and from 2005 to 2009, it decreased.\n</think>\n\nTo verify whether the number of song releases by Doves increases every year based on the given table:\n\n1. **Extract Release Years**: Identify each song's release year from the 'release date' column.\n2. **Count Releases Per Year**: Tally the number of songs released each year.\n3. **Analyze Trends**: Check if the count consistently increases year over year.\n\nThe counts show that releases do not increase every year; they remain constant or decrease in subsequent years. Hence, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"explanation\": \"The number of song releases does not increase every year.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"all song except 1 be release on the album some cities\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that all songs, except one, were released on the album titled \"some cities.\" So I need to check each song in the table and see if their album is \"some cities,\" making sure only one exception exists.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 14 rows of data (excluding the header). Each row represents a song with details about its release. The relevant columns for this claim seem to be \"song\" and \"album.\"\n\nI'll go through each song and note their albums:\n\n1. Here It Comes - Album: here it comes ep\n2. The Cedar Room - Album: lost souls\n3. Catch the Sun - Album: lost souls\n4. The Man Who Told Everything - Album: lost souls\n5. There Goes the Fear - Album: the last broadcast\n6. Pounding - Album: the last broadcast\n7. Caught by the River - Album: the last broadcast\n8. Black and White Town - Album: some cities\n9. Snowden - Album: some cities\n10. Sky Starts Falling - Album: some cities\n11. Kingdom of Rust - Album: kingdom of rust\n12. Winter Hill - Album: kingdom of rust\n13. Andalucia - Album: the places between: the best of doves\n\nNow, let's count how many songs are on \"some cities.\" Looking at rows 8,9, and 10 (Black and White Town, Snowden, Sky Starts Falling) all have that album. That's three songs.\n\nThe claim says only one song is not released on some cities. But looking at the data, there are multiple albums other than \"some cities,\" such as \"lost souls\" with three songs, \"the last broadcast\" with three, and others like \"kingdom of rust\" and \"the places between...\" So more than one song is not from \"some cities.\"\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread. Let me recount:\n\n- Songs on some cities: 3\n- All other albums have multiple songs:\n   - here it comes ep: 1 song\n   - lost souls: 3 songs ( Cedar Room, Catch the Sun, The Man Who Told Everything)\n   - the last broadcast: 3 songs\n   - kingdom of rust: 2 songs\n   - places between...: 1 song\n\nSo total songs not on some cities are 1+3+3+2+1=10. Since there are only three songs on \"some cities,\" that means 14-3=11 songs are not from this album. The claim says all except one, which would mean 13 should be on some cities and just one off. But in reality, it's the opposite. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait no, maybe I need to check again because perhaps the user made a typo. Let me count:\n\nRows:\nRow index (assuming starting at 0):\n\n0: here it comes ep\n1: lost souls\n2: lost souls\n3: lost souls\n4: the last broadcast\n5: the last broadcast\n6: the last broadcast\n7: some cities\n8: some cities\n9: some cities\n10: kingdom of rust\n11: kingdom of rust\n12: places between\n\nSo that's:\n\n- some cities: rows 7,8,9 (3 songs)\n- others:\n   - row0: 1\n   - rows1-3: 3\n   - rows4-6:3\n   - rows10-11:2\n   - row12:1\n\nTotal not on some cities: 1+3+3+2+1=10. So the claim that all except one are on \"some cities\" is false because more than one isn't.\n\nWait, but let me check if any other songs are on \"some cities.\" Rows7-9 are three songs. The rest (rows0,1-6,10-12) are 11 rows. So the claim says only one song is not on some cities, which would mean 13 should be on it. But that's not the case.\n\nSo the answer is FALSE because more than one song isn't from \"some cities.\"\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells for each row where the album isn't \"some cities.\" That includes all rows except 7,8,9. So their album columns are relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all songs except one were released on the album \"some cities.\" However, reviewing the table shows multiple albums with various counts of songs not being from \"some cities,\" indicating more than one exception. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"album\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"album\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"in 2009, doves release more than 5 song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that in the year 2009, the band Doves released more than five songs. So, my goal is to verify how many song releases are listed for Doves in that specific year using the given data.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: Song, Release Date, Release Info, Formats, and Album. Each row represents a different release by Doves. My focus will be on the \"Release Date\" column to find entries from 2009.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row has \"release date\" as 2 August 1999 \u2013 that's in 1999, so not relevant.\n2. Next is 20 March 2000 \u2013 also not in 2009.\n3. Then 29 May 2000 \u2013 again, not our target year.\n4. 30 October 2000 \u2013 same as above.\n5. 15 April 2002 \u2013 still before 2009.\n6. 22 July 2002 \u2013 nope.\n7. 14 October 2002 \u2013 moving on.\n8. 7 February 2005 \u2013 closer, but not 2009.\n9. 9 May 2005 \u2013 again, not our year.\n10. 12 September 2005 \u2013 still in 2005.\n11. Now we hit 30 March 2009 \u2013 this is within the target year. So that's one song released in 2009.\n12. Next is 20 July 2009 \u2013 another release in 2009, making it two songs so far.\n13. The last entry is 5 April 2010 \u2013 which is after 2009, so not relevant.\n\nFrom this examination, there are only two song releases listed for Doves in the year 2009: \"kingdom of rust\" and \"winter hill\". \n\nThe claim states that more than five songs were released. Since we've identified only two, the claim is FALSE. \n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells from the table:\n- The row indices for these two releases are 10 and 11 (assuming rows are zero-indexed, which they might be, but I'll double-check). Wait, looking back at the table structure, it's important to note that the first data row is index 0. So:\n\nRow 9: \"kingdom of rust\" \u2013 release date 30 March 2009\nRow 10: \"winter hill\" \u2013 release date 20 July 2009\n\nSo their respective row indices are 9 and 10, both under the \"release date\" column.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are rows 9 and 10 in the \"release date\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"release date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"release date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
