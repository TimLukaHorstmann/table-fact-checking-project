Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, \"rating\" refers to the quarterback rating, which is a measure of performance. So I need to look at the 'rating' column in the table for each year and find out which year had the highest rating, then check if that was 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, it's organized by year from 1993 onwards until 2008, with various stats including 'rating'. The last row is career statistics, so I can ignore that for individual seasons.\n\nLet me go through each season and note down the rating:\n\n- 1993: 57\n- 1994: 98.5\n- 1995: 95.3\n- 1996: 110.4\n- 1997: 120.3\n- 1998: 121\n- 2000: 111.7\n- 2001: 120.2\n- 2002: 115.5\n- 2003: 126.5\n- 2004: 115\n- 2005: 108.2\n- 2006: 109.8\n- 2007: 117.2\n- 2008: 116.3\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest rating is in 2003 with 126.5. I'll compare this to other years. For example, 1998 had a high of 121, which is less than 126.5. Similarly, 2007 was 117.2 and 2008 at 116.3 are both lower than 126.5.\n\nSo the claim says that his best rating was in 2003, which is accurate based on these numbers.

The user has provided a table with football statistics for different years and a claim about the number of completions in specific years. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"Sherdrick have 33 more completion in 2004 than he have in 2007.\" It seems there's a typo with \"have\" repeated, but the intended meaning is clear. The claim states that in 2004, Sherdrick had 33 more completions compared to 2007.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure. The relevant columns are 'year' and 'comp'. Each row represents a year with corresponding statistics. My goal is to find the 'comp' values for 2004 and 2007.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- For 2004: The row index needs to be identified. Counting from the top, I see that 2004 is in the 13th data row (since the first two are headers). Wait, actually, the table starts with \"year\" as the header, so each subsequent row after that represents a year. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices start at 0 for the header? Or does the first data row count as index 0? Looking back at the example provided by the user, in their sample JSON, they used row_index starting from 0 for the data rows. So I'll proceed accordingly.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Year 2004 is listed in the table. Let me find its row index. The data starts after the header, so each year corresponds to a specific row index.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all years with their respective row indices for clarity.\n\nHere's how the rows are structured (excluding the header):\n\nRow 0: 1993\nRow 1: 1994\nRow 2: 1995\nRow 3: 1996\nRow 4: 1997\nRow 5: 1998\nRow 6: 2000\nRow 7: 2001\nRow 8: 2002\nRow 9: 2003\nRow 10: 2004\nRow 11: 2005\nRow 12: 2006\nRow 13: 2007\nRow 14: 2008\nRow 15: career statistics\n\nSo, 2004 is in row index 10, and 2007 is in row index 13.\n\nNow, I'll check the 'comp' values for these rows.\n\nFor 2004 (row 10), 'comp' is 348.\nFor 2007 (row 13), 'comp' is 315.\n\nThe claim states that there are 33 more completions in 2004 than in 2007. Let's calculate the difference: 348 - 315 = 33.\n\nThat matches exactly what the claim says. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells for both years and the 'comp' column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 2004: row_index 10, column_name \"comp\"\n- For 2007: row_index 13, column_name \"comp\"\n\nThis ensures that we've checked both values used in the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"comp\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"comp\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided a table with various statistics for each year and a claim about Shadrick's performance in 2004 compared to his career total. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"In 2004, Sherdrick had a completion percentage that was 3.1% higher than his career total.\" Okay, so there are two main pieces of information here: Shadrick's 2004 completion percentage and his overall career completion percentage.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 1993 to 2008, followed by career statistics. Each row has several columns: year, comp (completions), att (attempts), comp% (completion percentage), yards, td's (touchdowns), int's (interceptions), and rating.\n\nThe first task is to find the relevant cells for both 2004 and the career total. Let me scan through the table:\n\n- For 2004: I see a row labeled \"2004\" with comp% of 64.9%. So, the completion percentage in 2004 is 64.9%.\n\n- For career statistics: The last row is labeled \"career statistics,\" and its comp% is 61.8%. This represents his overall completion percentage throughout his career.\n\nNow, I need to check if 64.9% (2004) is indeed 3.1% higher than 61.8% (career total). To verify this, I'll subtract the career comp% from the 2004 comp%: 64.9 - 61.8 = 3.1%. \n\nThe calculation shows that in 2004, Shadrick's completion percentage was exactly 3.1% higher than his career total.

The task is to determine if the claim \"in 1998 Sherdrick Bonner have 116 more yards than in 2000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what data is given. Looking at the table, it has columns for year, comp (completions), att (attempts), comp% (completion percentage), yards, td's (touchdowns), int's (interceptions), and rating. The rows correspond to different years from 1993 onwards, except there's a gap between 2005 and 2006. There's also a row for career statistics at the end.\n\nThe claim is about comparing yards in two specific years: 1998 and 2000. So I should locate these rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the year column:\n- For 1998, the row index is 6 (assuming counting starts from 0). The yards are listed as 3571.\n- For 2000, the row index is 8. The yards there are 3454.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference between these two years. So subtracting 2000's yards from 1998's: 3571 - 3454 = 117 yards. \n\nWait a minute, the claim says 116 more yards in 1998 than 2000. But according to my calculation, it's actually 117 yards more. That means the claim is off by one yard.\n\nHmm, could I have made an error in reading the table? Let me double-check:\n- 1998: 3571 yards.\n- 2000: 3454 yards.\nDifference: 3571 - 3454 = 117.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim states a difference of 116, but it's actually 117.

The columns include \"year\", \"comp\", \"att\", \"comp%\", \"yards\", \"td 's\", \"int 's\", and \"rating\".\n\nLet me find the rows for 2006 and 2005.\n\nFor 2006, I scan through the table until I reach the row with \"2006\" in the year column. Scanning down:\n\n- The 2006 row is: 295 completions, 507 attempts, 58.2 completion percentage, 3991 yards, 83 touchdowns, 16 interceptions, and a rating of 109.8.\n\nWait, the \"int 's\" column for 2006 is 16. But the claim says Sherdrick had 14 ints in 2006. That's a discrepancy here because the table shows 16.\n\nNow checking 2005: Looking at the row where year is 2005. The stats are: 189 completions, 320 attempts, 59.1 completion%, 2334 yards, 51 TDs, and in \"int 's\", it's 10.\n\nThe claim says he had 10 ints in 2005, which matches the table. So part of the claim is correct for 2005, but incorrect for 2006 because he actually had 16 interceptions, not 14.\n\nTherefore, since both parts of the claim need to be true for it to be fully supported, and one part (the 2006 season) is false, the entire claim must be FALSE.\n\nTo summarize:\n- In 2005: Correct, 10 ints.\n- In 2006: Incorrect, 16 instead of 14.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.

Scanning down the \"year\" column, I see that row at index 10: \"2003\". The comp% for that year is listed as 67.1%.\n\nNext, checking the career statistics. The last row in the table says \"career statistics\", and its comp% is 61.8%. \n\nNow, to verify if Sherdrick's 2003 comp% was 3.1% higher than his career total. Let's calculate the difference.\n\nCareer comp%: 61.8%\n2003 comp%: 67.1%\n\nDifference = 67.1 - 61.8 = 5.3%.\n\nSo, Sherdrick's completion percentage in 2003 was 5.3% higher than his career total, not 3.1%. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nCareer comp%: 61.8%\n2003 comp%: 67.1%\n\nSubtracting the two gives 5.3%, which is indeed higher than 3.1%. So yes, the claim states a smaller increase than what actually happened.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because Sherdrick's 2003 completion percentage was higher by more than 3.1% compared to his career total.\n\nLooking back at the table, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The comp% for 2003: row index 10, column \"comp%\".\n- The career comp%: row index 15 (the last row), column \"comp%\".\n\nThese two cells are needed to compute both percentages and compare them.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any other data points relevant to this claim. So the conclusion is clear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"comp%\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"comp%\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
