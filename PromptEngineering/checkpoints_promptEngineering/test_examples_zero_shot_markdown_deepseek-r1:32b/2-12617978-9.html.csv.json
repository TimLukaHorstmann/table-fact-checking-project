    "claim": "beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into parts:\n1. Two companies are mentioned: \"beach break live\" and \"cone timentrate design.\"\n2. Both are supposedly invested in by Peter Jones.\n3. The money requested is more than \u00a335,000.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go row by row to find these entries.\n\nStarting with \"beach break live\":\n- Scanning through the 'company or product name' column, I see an entry for \"beach break live\" in the first row (row_index 0). \n- The entrepreneur is Celia Norowzian & Ian Forshew.\n- Money requested: \u00a350,000.\n- Investing dragon(s): Peter Jones.\n\nSo for this company:\n- Invested by Peter Jones: Yes.\n- Request amount: \u00a350k, which is more than \u00a335k. So both conditions are met here.\n\nNext, \"cone timentrate design\":\nI'll check the 'company or product name' column again. Hmm, I don't see this exact name in any of the rows. The closest one is \"concentrate design\" in row 4 (row_index 3), but that's not the same as \"cone timentrate design.\" Maybe it's a typo? If we consider \"concentrate design,\" let's check:\n- Entrepreneurs: Mark Champkins.\n- Money requested: \u00a3100,000.\n- Investing dragon: Peter Jones.\n\nSo if they meant \"concentrate design\" instead of \"cone timentrate design,\" then:\n- Invested by Peter Jones: Yes.\n- Request amount: \u00a3100k > \u00a335k. So that condition is also met.\n\nHowever, the claim specifically mentions \"cone timentrate design.\" Since this exact name isn't present in the table, it's not directly supported. But perhaps there was a typo or mishearing of the product name.\n\nNow, looking for any other instances where Peter Jones invested with more than \u00a335k:\n- Episode 1: beach break live - \u00a350k (Peter Jones)\n- Episode 3: concentrate design - \u00a3100k (Peter Jones)\n- Episode 4: reestore and cush'n'shade. For these, the investors are Deborah M and Theo Paphitis for reestore (\u00a350k), and Deborah M and Peter Jones for cush'n'shade (\u00a3100k). Wait, that's another investment by Peter Jones with \u00a3100k.\n\nSo in total, Peter Jones invested in beach break live (\u00a350k) and cush'n'shade (\u00a3100k), both over \u00a335k. But the claim mentions two specific companies: beach break live and cone timentrate design (or concentrate design). If we consider that \"cone timentrate\" is a typo for \"concentrate,\" then both are invested by Peter Jones with more than \u00a335k.\n\nBut since \"cone timentrate design\" isn't in the table, it's ambiguous. However, if we assume it refers to \"concentrate design,\" which is present, then the claim holds true for both companies involved. But without exact matching, it might be safer to say part of the claim isn't supported.\n\nWait, let me recheck: the claim says both are invested by Peter Jones with more than \u00a335k. So if \"cone timentrate design\" is not in the table, only beach break live meets that condition. The other company (concentrate design) is present but under a different name. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because one of the companies mentioned doesn't exist in the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at each part:\n- \"beach break live\" is invested by Peter Jones with \u00a350k: True.\n- \"cone timentrate design\": Not found in the table as such.\nBut wait, episode 3 has \"concentrate design.\" If that's a possible typo, then:\n- Invested by Peter Jones: Yes.\n- Request amount: \u00a3100k > \u00a335k.\n\nSo if we accept that \"cone timentrate\" is a mistake for \"concentrate,\" then both parts are true. However, since the exact term isn't in the table, it's a bit of an assumption. But given that the user might have made a typo, perhaps I should consider it as correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"cone timentrate design\" refers to another company not listed here, but from the data given, we only have two companies invested by Peter Jones with more than \u00a335k: beach break live and concentrate design. Therefore, if the claim is about those two under different names, it's partially true.\n\nWait, no\u2014only beach break live is directly mentioned in the claim as being invested by Peter Jones with over \u00a335k. The other part of the claim mentions \"cone timentrate,\" which isn't present, so that part is false. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported because one of the companies isn't in the table.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused now. Let me outline it clearly:\n\n1. beach break live: Invested by Peter Jones, \u00a350k > \u00a335k \u2013 True.\n2. cone timentrate design: Not found in the table. So this part is False.\n\nSince the claim mentions both companies being invested by Peter Jones with more than \u00a335k, and one of them isn't present, the overall claim is False.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user might have intended \"cone timentrate design\" to refer to another company not listed here, but from the table, we only see two companies invested by Peter Jones with over \u00a335k: beach break live and concentrate design (assuming that's what they meant). So perhaps the claim is a mix-up of names. But strictly speaking, \"cone timentrate\" isn't in the data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any other company has a name similar to \"cone timentrate.\" Looking through the table:\n\n- Episode 3: concentrate design.\n- Episode 4: reestore and cush'n'shade.\n- Episode 5: None seem relevant.\n\nNo, nothing else. So \"cone timentrate\" isn't present. Therefore, only beach break live meets the condition of being invested by Peter Jones with over \u00a335k.\n\nBut the claim mentions two companies, so unless both are in the table and meet the conditions, it's not fully accurate. Hence, the claim is partially true but not entirely because one company isn't listed. Therefore, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014hold on. The way the claim is phrased: \"beach break live / cone timentrate design be invest in by peter jones with more than 35000 request.\" It could mean that both companies are invested in by Peter Jones, each with a request over \u00a335k.\n\nSince beach break live is indeed invested by Peter Jones with \u00a350k (which is >35k), but \"cone timentrate design\" isn't in the table. Therefore, only part of the claim is true. Since the claim combines two points and one is false, the entire statement is False.\n\nAlternatively, if the user made a typo and meant \"concentrate design,\" then both parts would be true. But without that assumption, I think we have to go with what's in the table.\n\nSo conclusion: The claim is FALSE because \"cone timentrate design\" isn't present in the table as invested by Peter Jones.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is partially supported. \"Beach break live\" was indeed invested by Peter Jones with a request over \u00a335k, but \"cone timentrate design\" isn't found in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"reestore request 50000 from deborah meaden & theo paphitis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for \"reestore\" in the table. Scanning through the \"company or product name\" column, I find that reestore appears in row 4 (row index starts at 0, so it's actually the fifth row if we count from zero). So the relevant cells here are:\n\n- Row 3: company or product name is \"reestore\"\n\nNext, the claim states that reestore requested 50,000. Checking the \"money requested\" column for this row, I see it's indeed 50000. That matches.\n\nNow, looking at the investors: the investing dragons are listed as \"deborah meaden  & theo paphitis\". In the table, under \"investing dragon(s)\", for reestore, it says \"deborah meaden  & theo paphitis\", which aligns with the claim. \n\nSo all parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table: the company name, the amount requested, and the investors involved. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this are:\n\n- The row where company/product name is \"reestore\" (row index 3)\n- The money requested in that row\n- The investing dragons in that same row\n\nSo I'll structure the JSON response accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"investing dragon (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"game alert ask for 200000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and comparing it with the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components. The claim mentions two things: the product/company name \"game alert\" (I think this might be a typo for \"gaming alerts\") and the amount of money requested as 200,000. My task is to see if these two pieces of information align in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I need to identify the relevant columns that would help me verify the claim. The columns are: episode, first aired, entrepreneur(s), company or product name, money requested, and investing dragons. So, for this claim, the key columns are \"company or product name\" and \"money requested\".\n\nI'll scan through each row of the table to find any mention of \"gaming alerts\". Let me go step by step:\n\n1. Episode 1: The company names are \"beach break live\" and \"goldgenie (formerly midas touch)\". Neither matches \"game alert\" or \"gaming alerts\".\n2. Episode 2: There's a company named \"youdoodoll\" and another called \"gaming alerts\". Ah, this looks promising.\n3. Checking the details for \"gaming alerts\": The entrepreneurs are Emmie Matthews & Ed Stevens, it's in episode 2 which aired on 22 October 2007. The money requested is 200,000. So that matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't miss any other entries with \"gaming alerts\". Scanning through all rows again:\n\nEpisodes 3 to 9 don't have any company named \"game alert\" or \"gaming alerts\", except for episode 2. So it seems like the only occurrence is in row index 3 (if counting from 0, so row 3 would be the fourth row? Wait no, let me recount the rows:\n\nActually, looking at the table provided, the first row is header, then data starts at row index 0.\n\nSo the first data row (index 0) is episode 1 with \"beach break live\", next row (index 1) same episode but another company. Then episode 2 starts at row index 2: \"youdoodoll\" and row index 3: \"gaming alerts\". So yes, row 3 has the company name.\n\nThe money requested in that row is indeed 200,000. Therefore, the claim is supported by this data point.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is TRUE because in episode 2 (row index 3), the company \"gaming alerts\" asked for exactly 200,000.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"company or product name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"money requested\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"in episode 7, 145000 be the highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim is saying. It mentions episode 7, so I should look for rows where the episode is 7. Then it talks about a specific amount, $145,000, being the money requested by Jerry Mantalvanos and Paul Merker.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find episode 7. Let me see:\n\nRow 0: Episode 1\nRow 1: Episode 1\nRow 2: Episode 2\nRow 3: Episode 2\nRow 4: Episode 3\nRow 5: Episode 4\nRow 6: Episode 4\nRow 7: Episode 5\nRow 8: Episode 6\nRow 9: Episode 6\nRow 10: Episode 7\nRow 11: Episode 7\nRow 12: Episode 8\nRow 13: Episode 9\n\nSo, episode 7 is in rows 10 and 11. Now, looking at row 10: the entrepreneurs are Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker. The money requested here is $100,000.\n\nIn row 11, also episode 7, the entrepreneurs are Sammy French, requesting $100,000 as well. \n\nWait a minute, the claim says that Jerry and Paul requested $145,000 in episode 7, but according to the table, they only asked for $100,000. Also, checking other rows in episode 7, the maximum amount is still $100,000. \n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because they didn't request that higher amount. Therefore, it's false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mantalvanos and Paul Merker requested \u00a3145,000 in episode 7.

The company in question is \"reestore.\" We're looking at whether reestore requested \u00a370,000 and if the investors were Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find where \"reestore\" appears. Scanning down, I see that in episode 4, there's an entry for \"max mcmurdo\" with the company/product name \"reestore.\" The amount requested here is \u00a350,000, not \u00a370,000 as the claim states.\n\nNext, checking the investing dragons for this row: it says Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis. So while the investors are correct, the money requested doesn't match\u2014\u00a350k vs. \u00a370k.\n\nSince the amount is different from what's stated in the claim, even though the entrepreneurs and investors are accurate, the total request isn't 70k but 50k.

Scanning through the table, I notice that episode 2 has an entrepreneur named Emmie Matthews & Ed Stevens with the product \"gaming alerts\". The amount requested here is \u00a3200,000.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the least amount requested. I'll go through all the rows and list out the money requested:\n\n- Episode 1: \u00a350,000 (Beach Break Live)\n- Episode 1: \u00a360,000 (Goldgenie)\n- Episode 2: \u00a335,000 (Youdoodoll)\n- Episode 2: \u00a3200,000 (Gaming Alerts)\n- Episode 3: \u00a3100,000 (Concentrate Design)\n- Episode 4: \u00a350,000 (Reestore)\n- Episode 4: \u00a3100,000 (Cush'n Shade)\n- Episode 5: \u00a3100,000 (Hungryhousecouk)\n- Episode 6: \u00a3145,000 (Steri Spray)\n- Episode 6: \u00a3100,000 (Caribbean Ready Meals)\n- Episode 7: \u00a3100,000 (Fit Fur Life)\n- Episode 7: \u00a3100,000 (JPM Eco Logistics)\n- Episode 8: \u00a3150,000 (Electroexpo)\n- Episode 9: \u00a350,000 (Red Button Design)\n\nLooking at these amounts, the smallest is \u00a335,000 requested by Sarah Lu for Youdoodoll in episode 2.
