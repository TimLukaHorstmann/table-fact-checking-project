    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the home game of essendon have a small crowd of 12865\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the table. Each row represents a match with details like home team, their score, away team, away score, venue, crowd number, and date. The claim mentions Essendon as the home team, so I should look for the row where \"home team\" is Essendon.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n- Row 0: Hawthorn vs Melbourne\n- Row 1: Footscray vs St Kilda\n- Row 2: Essendon vs Fitzroy\n\nSo, the relevant row is index 2. In this row, the \"crowd\" column shows 12865.\n\nThe claim states that the crowd was small at 12865. The question now is whether 12865 is considered a small crowd relative to other games on that day or in general for these teams. Looking at other crowd numbers:\n- Hawthorn: 14,809\n- Footscray: 16,707\n- Essendon: 12,865\n- Carlton: 32,000 (which is the highest)\n- South Melbourne: 9,307\n- Richmond: 36,423\n\nComparing these, 12,865 is lower than some but higher than South Melbourne's 9,307. It might be considered small in the context of other games listed here. However, the exact definition of \"small\" isn't provided, so I'll assume that if the crowd number matches exactly what's stated, it's true regardless of being high or low.\n\nTherefore, since the claim accurately states that Essendon's home game had a crowd of 12865, it is TRUE. The relevant cells are in row index 2 for \"crowd\" and \"home team\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"on august 28 1971 hawthorn score 18.16 at the glenferrie oval.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. Date: August 28, 1971\n2. Home team: Hawthorn\n3.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"when the home team score 17.16 , the game be play at glenferrie oval\". \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to see where the home team scored exactly 17.16. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at row 0: The home team is Hawthorn with a score of 18.16 (124). That's not 17.16, so this isn't it.\n\nRow 1: Footscray scored 10.14 (74) as the home team. Not matching.\n\nRow 2: Essendon has 12.12 (84). Nope.\n\nRow 3: Carlton's score is 16.10 (106). Still not matching.\n\nRow 4: South Melbourne scored 19.17 (131). Close, but the numbers aren't right for 17.16.\n\nRow 5: Richmond with 16.14 (110). Not a match either.\n\nWait, I don't see any home team score that's exactly 17.16 in the table. All the scores are different. So if there's no instance where the home team scored 17.16, then the claim can't be true because there's nothing to link it to Glenferrie Oval.\n\nSo since the score mentioned doesn't exist in any row as a home team score, the statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any entry where the home team score is 17.16. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the given data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"14.18 be the score for the away team while the home team score point of 16.14.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find any instances where an away team has a score of 14.18 and a home team has 16.14 on the same date or at least in the same context. \n\nLooking at the first row: Hawthorn vs Melbourne. The away team is Melbourne with a score of 8.17, which doesn't match 14.18. So this isn't relevant.\n\nThe second row is Footscray vs St Kilda. Away team St Kilda scored 12.18\u2014close but not exactly 14.18. So no match here either.\n\nThird row: Essendon vs Fitzroy. Fitzroy's away score is 13.17, which isn't 14.18.\n\nFourth row: Carlton vs Collingwood. Away team Collingwood has 13.9\u2014still not matching 14.18.\n\nFifth row: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne. North Melbourne scored 8.11 as the away team; no match here.\n\nFinally, the sixth row is Richmonds vs Geelong. Here, the home team is Richmonds with a score of 16.14 (as per the table) and the away team is Geelong with 14.18. Wait, in the claim, it's \"14.18 be the score for the away team while the home team score point of 16.14.\" So that seems to align: Geelong (away) has 14.18 and Richmonds (home) have 16.14. \n\nBut wait, looking again at the table, Richmonds' score is listed as 16.14 (110), so their total points are 110. The away team Geelong's score is 14.18 (102). So yes, that fits the claim: away team has 14.18 and home team has 16.14.\n\nSo the relevant row is the sixth one, where Richmonds are the home team with 16.14 and Geelong as away team with 14.18. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that an away team scored 14.18 while a home team scored 16.14.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"the away team score 14.18 point when the home team score 17.14 point.\" So, I'm looking for a row where the away team has a score of 14.18 and the home team has a score of 17.14.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 5 (assuming the first data row is index 0). Each row contains information about a match, including home team, their score, away team, their score, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Home team is Hawthorn with a score of 18.16 (124), away team Melbourne with 8.17 (65). The claim mentions 17.14 for the home team, which doesn't match here.\n\n- **Row 1**: Footscray (home) scored 10.14 (74); St Kilda (away) scored 12.18 (90). Neither score matches the claim.\n\n- **Row 2**: Essendon (home) with 12.12 (84); Fitzroy (away) with 13.17 (95). Again, no match.\n\n- **Row 3**: Carlton (home) scored 16.10 (106); Collingwood (away) with 13.9 (87). Still not matching the claim.\n\n- **Row 4**: South Melbourne (home) with 19.17 (131); North Melbourne (away) 8.11 (59). Close, but home team is 19.17, which is higher than 17.14 in the claim. \n\n- **Row 5**: Richmond (home) scored 16.14 (110); Geelong (away) with 14.18 (102). Here, away team has 14.18, but home team is 16.14, not 17.14 as claimed.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the last row. The claim says home team score is 17.14, which would be represented as 17 goals and 14 behinds (or points). Looking at the data:\n\nIn Row 5, the home team's score is \"16.14\" (which I think translates to 16 goals and 14 behinds, totaling 16*6 +14= 100+ points, but the exact point isn't directly relevant here). The away team has 14.18.\n\nSo, in this row, the away team scored 14.18, which matches the claim's \"away team score 14.18\". However, the home team only scored 16.14, not 17.14 as stated. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because the home team's score doesn't match.\n\nWait again\u2014maybe I misread. Let me double-check each row for any instance where the away team is 14.18 and the home team is exactly 17.14. \n\nLooking back:\n\n- Row 5: Away team Geelong with 14.18, but home team Richmond has 16.14 (not 17.14).\n\nNo other rows have away teams with 14.18 except this one. So the claim is partially correct for the away team's score but incorrect regarding the home team's score.\n\nTherefore, since both conditions must be met and they aren't in any single row, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the smallest crowd at a home game for essendon be 10865\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Essendon's home games. In the table, I should look for rows where Essendon is listed as the home team because that indicates it's a home game for them. Looking through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Hawthorn vs Melbourne\n- Row 1: Footscray vs St Kilda\n- Row 2: Essendon vs Fitzroy\n- Row 3: Carlton vs Collingwood\n- Row 4: South Melbourne vs North Melbourne\n- Row 5: Richmond vs Geelong\n\nSo, the only row where Essendon is the home team is row 2. That's the relevant game for this claim.\n\nNext, I need to check the crowd number for that particular game. The column \"crowd\" shows the attendance. For row 2, the crowd is 12865. \n\nThe claim states that the smallest crowd at a home game for Essendon was 10865. However, in the data provided, there's only one home game for Essendon, and the crowd was 12865. Since this is the only entry, it's both the highest and the lowest for that team based on the given information.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says the smallest crowd is 10865. But in the table, the crowd for Essendon's home game is higher than that at 12865. So, this would mean the claim is false because there isn't any data point where Essendon had a smaller crowd than 12865 in their home games as per the table.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe the claim refers to another row or perhaps a different team's game? No, Essendon is only listed once as the home team, so that's the only relevant data point. \n\nTherefore, since 12865 is greater than 10865 and it's the only crowd number for Essendon's home games in this table, the claim that the smallest was 10865 isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to Essendon's home game crowd. The relevant row shows a crowd of 12865, which is higher than 10865, making the claim false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
