    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the athletics win the 1929 world series against the cub , 4 game to 1\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Philadelphia Athletics won the 1929 World Series against the Chicago Cubs with a score of 4 games to 1. That means the Athletics would have won four games and lost one in the series.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists five games between the Philadelphia Athletics and the Chicago Cubs. Each row represents a game played on different dates, with details like the date, score, location, time, and attendance.\n\nI'll need to check each game's outcome to see if the Athletics indeed won four out of five games against the Cubs. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Game 1**: October 8th at Wrigley Field. The score is Philadelphia Athletics - 3, Chicago Cubs - 1. So, the Athletics won this game.\n\n- **Game 2**: October 9th at Wrigley Field. The score is Philadelphia Athletics - 9, Chicago Cubs - 3. Again, the Athletics won here.\n\n- **Game 3**: October 11th at Shibe Park. The score is Chicago Cubs - 3, Philadelphia Athletics - 1. This time, the Cubs won.\n\n- **Game 4**: October 12th at Shibe Park. The score is Chicago Cubs - 8, Philadelphia Athletics - 10. So, the Athletics won this one.\n\n- **Game 5**: October 14th at Shibe Park. The score is Chicago Cubs - 2, Philadelphia Athletics - 3. The Athletics won again here.\n\nNow, let's count the wins for each team. For the Philadelphia Athletics: Game 1, 2, 4, and 5 are wins\u2014that's four victories. The Chicago Cubs only won Game 3. So according to the table, the Athletics did indeed win four games against one loss by the Cubs.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that this is for the World Series in 1929. The claim mentions \"the 1929 world series,\" and the table has dates starting from October 8th. Typically, the World Series is played in October, so these games likely are part of it.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's any ambiguity. For instance, does the table represent all the games played? There are five games listed, which would mean a best-of-seven series (since they need to win four games). So, with four wins for the Athletics, they would have clinched the series in Game 5.\n\nAnother point to consider: the claim says \"against the cub\" singular. The team is referred to as the Chicago Cubs, so that's correct. Also, the location alternates between Wrigley Field and Shibe Park, which are home venues for each team, making sense for a World Series.\n\nSo putting it all together, based on the table provided, the Philadelphia Athletics won four games (Games 1,2,4,5) and lost one (Game3). Therefore, the claim that they won the series 4-1 is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Philadelphia Athletics won the 1929 World Series against the Chicago Cubs with a score of 4 games to 1. By examining each game's outcome in the provided table, we can verify this.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- **Row 0**: Philadelphia Athletics win.\n- **Row 1**: Philadelphia Athletics win.\n- **Row 2**: Chicago Cubs win.\n- **Row 3**: Philadelphia Athletics win.\n- **Row 4**: Philadelphia Athletics win.\n\nThis results in four wins for the Athletics and one win for the Cubs. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"all 3 of the game play at shibe park have the same record attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what each part of the claim means. The claim has two main components:\n1. There are three games played at Shibe Park.\n2. All these three games had the same attendance record.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: game number, date, score, location, time, and attendance. My first step is to identify which rows correspond to games played at Shibe Park.\n\nScanning through the 'location' column:\n- Game 1 and 2 are at Wrigley Field.\n- Games 3, 4, and 5 are at Shibe Park.\n\nSo, there are three games (rows 2, 3, and 4) played at Shibe Park. That matches the first part of the claim\u2014there are indeed three games at that location.\n\nNext, I need to check the attendance for these three games to see if they're all the same. The 'attendance' column shows:\n- Game 3: 29,921\n- Game 4: 29,921\n- Game 5: 29,921\n\nAll three have an attendance of 29,921. This means the second part of the claim is also correct\u2014each game at Shibe Park had the same attendance number.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are satisfied, so the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to compile the relevant cells that were checked for this conclusion. The rows involved are 2, 3, and 4 (since indexing starts at 0), but looking back, Game 1 is row 0, Game 2 is row 1, Game 3 is row 2, Game 4 is row 3, and Game 5 is row 4. So the relevant rows are 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe columns I need to look at are 'location' to confirm they're all Shibe Park and 'attendance' to check if the numbers match. Therefore, each of these three rows will have both 'location' and 'attendance' as relevant columns.\n\nSo compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n- The answer is \"TRUE\".\n- The relevant cells include rows 2, 3, and 4 for both 'location' and 'attendance'.\n\nI need to list each relevant cell as an object with its row index and column name. So that's six objects in total.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}, {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the 1929 world series take place over 6 days in october 1929\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure and the data it contains. The table has columns: game number, date, score, location, time, and attendance. There are five games listed with dates from October 8 to October 14, 1929.\n\nThe claim mentions that the World Series took place over six days in October 1929. So I need to check two things: the number of days and whether all those days fall within October 1929.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n- Game 1: October 8\n- Game 2: October 9\n- Game 3: October 11\n- Game 4: October 12\n- Game 5: October 14\n\nWait, that's five games spread over October 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14. So the days covered are October 8, 9 (two consecutive days), then a gap on October 10, followed by games on 11, 12, and another gap until the 14th.\n\nCounting the unique dates, there's October 8, 9, 11, 12, 14\u2014 that's five different days. The claim says six days. So according to this table, it's only five days, not six.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The games are played on these specific dates, but perhaps the World Series as a whole spanned from October 8th to October 14th, which is seven days. But the actual game days are only five days with two days in between without games (October 10 and 13). So does that count as taking place over six days?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if each day had a game or not. The table shows five games on five different dates within October 1929. There's no sixth date provided here.\n\nSo the claim is about six days in October, but according to this table, there are only five games spread over those specific dates. Therefore, the claim that it took place over six days isn't supported by the data given because we have five game dates within a span of seven calendar days (from 8th to 14th), but not every day had a game.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the number of games, there are only five listed. Typically, a World Series is a best-of-seven series, so it would require up to seven games. If this table shows only five games, perhaps the series ended in five games, meaning they didn't go all the way to seven. But that doesn't directly address the claim about the number of days.\n\nSo, focusing on the days: the dates are October 8,9,11,12,14\u2014five distinct days. The claim says six days, which is more than what's shown here. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows five games over five different days in October 1929 (October 8, 9, 11, 12, 14). The claim states six days, which is not matched by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the table is true or false. The claim says: \"the 4th game of the series be the highest scoring of all 5 games with 18 runs scored total for both teams.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided. It has five rows, each representing a different game in the series. Each row includes details like the date, score, location, time, and attendance.\n\nI need to check two things here: first, whether the fourth game is indeed the highest scoring among all five games, and second, whether the total runs scored by both teams in that game add up to 18.\n\nLooking at each game's score:\n\n- Game 1: Philadelphia Athletics - 3, Chicago Cubs - 1. Total runs here are 4.\n- Game 2: Philadelphia Athletics - 9, Chicago Cubs - 3. Total runs here are 12.\n- Game 3: Chicago Cubs - 3, Philadelphia Athletics - 1. Total runs here are 4.\n- Game 4: Chicago Cubs - 8, Philadelphia Athletics - 10. Total runs here are 18.\n- Game 5: Chicago Cubs - 2, Philadelphia Athletics - 3. Total runs here are 5.\n\nSo, the total runs for each game are as follows: 4, 12, 4, 18, and 5. That means the fourth game has the highest score with 18 runs in total.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that this is indeed correct by checking the relevant cells in the table. For Game 4 (row index 3), the \"score\" column shows Chicago Cubs - 8 and Philadelphia Athletics - 10. Adding these together gives 18, which matches the claim. Also, looking at all other games' scores, none exceed this total.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate: Game 4 is the highest-scoring game with a combined total of 18 runs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that the 4th game had the highest score (18 runs) among the five games. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look at each game's score to determine the runs scored by both teams.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Runs for Each Game:**\n   - Game 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Game 2: 9 + 3 = 12\n   - Game 3: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Game 4: 8 + 10 = 18\n   - Game 5: 2 + 3 = 5\n\n3. **Determine the Highest Scoring Game:** The highest total is 18 in Game 4.\n\n4. **Verify Claim:** Both parts of the claim are accurate\u2014Game 4 had the highest score, and the total was 18 runs.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "shibe park have considerably less crowd attendance than the 2 game play at wrigley field",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"Shibe park have considerably less crowd attendance than the 2 game play at Wrigley field.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the columns in the table that are relevant here. The key pieces of information needed are the location and attendance for each game. So, the 'location' column will tell me where the games were played, and the 'attendance' column will show how many people attended each game.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five games listed. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Game 1 was at Wrigley Field with an attendance of 50,740.\n2. **Row 1**: Game 2 was also at Wrigley Field and had an attendance of 49,987.\n3. **Row 2**: Game 3 took place at Shibe Park with 29,921 attendees.\n4. **Row 3**: Game 4 was again at Shibe Park with the same attendance as before, 29,921.\n5. **Row 4**: Game 5 was also held at Shibe Park with an attendance of 29,921.\n\nNow, let's parse the claim: it's comparing the attendance at Shibe Park to the two games played at Wrigley Field. The claim suggests that Shibe Park had \"considerably less\" crowd attendance compared to those two Wrigley games.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n- **Wrigley Field Games**: Game 1 (50,740) and Game 2 (49,987). Adding these together gives a total of 100,727 attendees over two games.\n- **Shibe Park Games**: There are three games listed at Shibe Park. Each had an attendance of 29,921. So, for each individual game, it's about 30k, which is less than the Wrigley games.\n\nWait a second\u2014does the claim refer to all games at Shibe Park compared to just two at Wrigley? Or is it comparing each game individually? The wording says \"Shibe park have considerably less crowd attendance than the 2 game play at wrigley field.\" So, I think it's comparing all the games at Shibe Park collectively against the two at Wrigley.\n\nBut actually, since there are three games at Shibe Park and only two at Wrigley, maybe we should compare each individually. Each of the Wrigley games had higher attendance than each Shibe game. \n\nSo for each game:\n\n- Game 1 (Wrigley): 50k vs. Shibe's 29k.\n- Game 2 (Wrigley): ~49k vs. 29k.\n\nIn both cases, the Wrigley games had higher attendance than any single Shibe game. Also, if we consider all three Shibe games together, their total is about 89,763, which is still less than the two Wrigley games combined (100,727). So whether comparing per game or in total, Shibe Park had lower attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Shibe Park had considerably less crowd attendance than the two games at Wrigley Field is supported by the data. The relevant cells are the 'location' and 'attendance' columns for each row where location is either Wrigley Field or Shibe Park.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the cub win the 1929 world series against the athletics in 7 game\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table. It has five games listed from October 8th to October 14th. The teams involved are the Philadelphia Athletics and the Chicago Cubs. Each row shows the date, score, location, time, and attendance for each game.\n\nThe claim says that the Cubs won in seven games. But wait, looking at the table, there are only five games listed. So if the series ended after five games, the Cubs couldn't have won it in seven games because there aren't enough games recorded here to reach seven. That's a big red flag already.\n\nLet me check each game result:\n\n- Game 1: Cubs lost (3-1)\n- Game 2: Cubs lost again (9-3)\n- Game 3: Cubs won (3-1) at Shibe Park\n- Game 4: Cubs lost (8-10)\n- Game 5: Cubs lost (2-3)\n\nWait, that's five games. So the series went to five games? Let me see if there are more games beyond what's in this table. The user didn't provide any additional information, just these five rows.\n\nAlso, looking at the attendance column, the first two games had higher attendances (around 50k) but from Game 3 onwards, it drops to about 29k and stays there. That might indicate a shift in location or something else, but not directly relevant here.\n\nThe key point is that there are only five games listed, and the Cubs lost three of them while winning two. But wait, no\u2014the series would end when one team wins four games. Let's count:\n\nCubs' wins: Game 3\nAthletics' wins: Games 1,2,4,5\n\nSo after five games, the Athletics have already won four times (assuming they needed to win four games), so the series would have ended there without going to seven games.\n\nTherefore, the claim that it went to seven games is false because based on this table, the series only had five games. Also, since the Cubs lost three and the Athletics won two more after Game 3, but actually looking at the scores, the Athletics won four games (Games 1,2,4,5) and the Cubs only one (Game3), so the series was decided in five games with the Athletics winning it.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, wait. Let me recount:\n\nIn a World Series, the first team to win four games wins the series. So let's look at each game:\n\n- Game 1: Athletics win\n- Game 2: Athletics win (now they have two wins)\n- Game3: Cubs win (Cubs have one)\n- Game4: Athletics win again? No, Game4 result is Cubs lost 8-10, so Cubs won that. Wait no\u2014the score in Game4 is Chicago Cubs -8, Philadelphia Athletics -10. So the Athletics scored more and won.\n\nSo Game4: Athletics win (they have three wins)\nGame5: Cubs lose again, so Athletics win their fourth game, making it 4-1 in favor of the Athletics. Therefore, the series ended in five games with the Athletics winning four games. The Cubs only won one game (Game3). So the series didn't go to seven games\u2014it ended in five.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the Cubs won in seven games is false because:\n\n1. There are only five games listed.\n2. The Cubs did not win enough games to take the series; instead, they lost four to one.\n3. The series was decided in five games, with the Athletics as winners.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the dates, the first game is October 8th and the fifth on October 14th. That's a span of six days for five games, which fits with ending early if one team clinches before seven games.\n\nSo all these points lead me to conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}",

Therefore, the claim that the smallest attendance was at Wrigley Field is incorrect because the lowest numbers are actually from Shibe Park. \n\nTo support this, I should highlight the relevant cells:\n- For Wrigley Field attendances: rows 0 and 1 under 'attendance'.\n- For Shibe Park's lower attendances: rows 2,3,4 under 'attendance' as well.\n\nWait, but maybe just pointing out the smallest attendance is sufficient. The claim specifically mentions \"smallest\" so only the minimum value matters.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest attendance figures are at Shibe Park, not Wrigley Field. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Look for 'attendance' and 'location' columns to assess each game's details.\n2. **Extract Attendance Figures:** From rows 0 to 4, note the attendance numbers:\n   - Wrigley Field: 50,740 (Row 0), 49,987 (Row 1)\n   - Shibe Park: 29,921 (Rows 2-4)\n3. **Determine Minimum Attendance:** The smallest figure is 29,921 at Shibe Park.\n4. **Compare with Claim:** The claim states the smallest was at Wrigley Field, which is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the 1929 world series take a week and a half to complete\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, it shows data for games from October 8th to October 14th. Let's count the number of days between these dates. \n\nOctober 8 is Game 1.\nThen Game 2 on October 9.\nNext, Game 3 is on October 11.\nGame 4 follows on October 12.\nAnd finally, Game 5 is held on October 14.\n\nCalculating the time span: from October 8 to October 14 is exactly one week. But since the games are spread over different days with some days having multiple games or not consecutive, let me check each date's day difference.\n\n- From October 8 (Monday) to October 9 (Tuesday): 1 day\n- Then there's a gap until October 11 (Thursday), which is +2 days from the previous game.\n- Then October 12 (Friday): +1 day from Oct 11.\n- Finally, October 14 (Sunday): +2 days from Oct 12.\n\nWait, actually, counting all dates: from Oct 8 to Oct 14 is 7 days in total. But how many games are played? Five games, with the last game on the 14th. So the series started on the 8th and ended on the 14th, which is exactly a week later.\n\nBut the claim says \"a week and a half.\" A week is seven days, so a week and a half would be about ten to eleven days. However, in this table, it's only covering seven days from Oct 8 to Oct 14. Therefore, the series took exactly one week, not a week and a half.\n\nWait, perhaps considering that Game 5 was on the 14th, which is Sunday, but if we consider the start date as October 8, then ending on the 14th is still within seven days. So it's about a week, not longer.\n\nThus, the claim that it took a week and a half isn't supported by this data because it only took a week to complete.\n</think>\n\nThe series completed in one week (from October 8 to October 14), which does not support the claim of taking a week and a half.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the 5th game of the series be the highest scoring with 20 run total.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each game in the table and find out how many runs were scored in each. The table has five games, from game 1 to game 5. For each game, the 'score' column lists both teams' scores. My goal is to calculate the total runs for each game by adding the two teams' scores together.\n\nStarting with Game 1: October 8th at Wrigley Field. The score is Philadelphia Athletics - 3, Chicago Cubs - 1. So, adding those together gives a total of 4 runs (3+1=4).\n\nNext, Game 2 on October 9th also at Wrigley Field. The score here is Philadelphia Athletics - 9 and Chicago Cubs - 3. Adding these, we get 12 runs in total (9+3=12).\n\nMoving on to Game 3, which took place on October 11th but this time at Shibe Park. The scores are Chicago Cubs - 3 and Philadelphia Athletics - 1. That adds up to 4 runs again (3+1=4).\n\nGame 4 is the next day, October 12th, still at Shibe Park. Here, Chicago Cubs scored 8 runs and Philadelphia Athletics scored 10. Adding those together gives a total of 18 runs (8+10=18).\n\nFinally, Game 5 on October 14th at Shibe Park shows the scores as Chicago Cubs - 2 and Philadelphia Athletics - 3. The total here is 5 runs (2+3=5).\n\nNow, looking at all these totals: 4, 12, 4, 18, and 5. The highest among these is 18 runs in Game 4. However, the claim states that Game 5 was the highest scoring with a total of 20 runs. But from my calculations, Game 5 only had 5 runs, which is much lower than Game 4's 18 and also way below 20.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the 5th game didn't have the highest score, nor did it reach a total of 20 runs. The highest scoring game was actually the 4th one with 18 runs.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Game 5 was the highest-scoring with 20 runs is false. The fifth game had only 5 runs, and the fourth game was the highest with 18.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"Shibe Park have the same attendance as Wrigley Field\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table structure. The columns are: game number, date, score, location, time, and attendance. There are five games listed here.\n\nThe claim is comparing attendances between Shibe Park and Wrigley Field. So, I need to identify which rows correspond to each of these locations and then check their attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Game 1: Location is Wrigley Field, attendance is 50740.\n- Game 2: Also Wrigley Field, attendance 49987.\n- Games 3,4,5 are all at Shibe Park. Their attendances are 29921 each.\n\nSo for Shibe Park, the attendance is consistently 29921 across three games. For Wrigley Field, it's 50740 and 49987 in two games.\n\nWait a minute, so the claim says that Shibe Park has the same attendance as Wrigley Field. But looking at the numbers, the attendances are different. Wrigley has higher numbers than Shibe. For example, the first game at Wrigley had 50,740 attendees, while Shibe only had 29,921.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table because the attendance figures for each location are different. \n\nSo, I should mark this as FALSE. The relevant cells would be all the attendances from both locations to compare them.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Shibe Park and Wrigley Field have the same attendance. By examining the attendance numbers across the respective games at each location, it's clear that they differ.
