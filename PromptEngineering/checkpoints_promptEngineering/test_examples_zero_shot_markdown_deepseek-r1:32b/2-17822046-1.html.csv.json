Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"mother , i love you and gulf stream under the iceberg be submit 1 year after the other.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the films mentioned in the claim. They are \"mother , i love you\" and \"gulf stream under the iceberg.\" Looking at the table, I need to find these film titles and their corresponding years.\n\nFrom the table:\n- \"mother , i love you\" is listed in row 4 (index starts from 0) with the year 2013.\n- \"gulf stream under the iceberg\" is in row 3 with the year 2012.\n\nThe claim suggests that these two films were submitted one year apart. The years for each are 2012 and 2013, which are consecutive years. Therefore, they were indeed submitted one year after each other.\n\nNow, checking the relevant cells in the table:\n- For \"mother , i love you,\" I need the year (column: year (ceremony)) at row index 4.\n- For \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" similarly, it's at row index 3 under the same column.\n\nThese cells confirm the submission years.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"none of the latvian submission be nominated for best foreign language film.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table shows. It lists films submitted by Latvia (given that the original titles are in Latvian) along with their English nominations, directors, and whether they were nominated or not.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. 1992 (65th ceremony): \"The Child of Man\" was not nominated.\n2. 2008 (81st): \"Defenders of Riga\" also wasn't nominated.\n3. 2010 (83rd): \"Hong Kong Confidential\" didn't get a nomination either.\n4. 2012 (85th): \"Gulf Stream Under the Iceberg\" was not nominated.\n5. 2013 (86th): \"Mother, I Love You\" has a result marked as \"tbd,\" which I assume means it's yet to be determined or maybe hasn't been decided yet.\n\nThe claim is about whether any of these submissions were nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. From the table, all entries except the last one have a result of \"not nominated.\" The last entry has an unknown status because it's marked as \"tbd.\"\n\nBut wait, since \"Mother, I Love You\" hasn't had its result determined yet, does that mean it might still be considered? If the claim is about submissions up until now, then except for the 2013 entry, all others were not nominated. However, if we consider the 2013 submission as part of the \"none\" in the claim, then technically, since one is TBD, we can't say for sure that none have been nominated.\n\nBut maybe the claim refers to past submissions only, excluding the upcoming or TBD ones. In that case, all prior submissions (from 1992 up to 2012) were not nominated. So if the claim is about those years, then it's TRUE because none of them were nominated.\n\nAlternatively, if \"tbd\" means it might still be a possibility, but since the table shows that up to that point, all submissions except one are \"not nominated,\" and the last one hasn't been decided yet, perhaps the claim is considering only known results. So in that case, since none have been nominated so far, the claim would hold as TRUE.\n\nWait, no\u2014the claim says \"none of the latvian submission be nominated.\" It doesn't specify a time frame beyond what's in the table. If we include all entries, including the 2013 one which is TBD, then it's not yet certain that none were nominated because the last entry might still get a nomination.\n\nBut looking at the data again, only the result for 2013 is \"tbd,\" but perhaps the claim refers to whether any have been nominated in the past. If we consider only known results, all are \"not nominated.\" Therefore, regardless of the TBD status, the claim would be TRUE because none were actually nominated.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim includes the TBD entry as part of its scope, then since it's not yet determined, we can't say for certain that none were nominated. But I think in this context, the claim is about whether any have been nominated so far, based on the given data. Since all known results are \"not nominated,\" the answer should be TRUE.\n\nSo, to verify each row:\n\n- Rows 0,1,2,3: All have \"result\" as \"not nominated.\"\n- Row 4: Result is TBD, but since it's not confirmed, perhaps we can't include it in the count of nominations. So, based on known data, none were nominated.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"2 of the 5 films be directed by j\u0101nis nords\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has five columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. There are five rows corresponding to different years from 1992 to 2013.\n\nThe claim states that two out of these five films were directed by J\u0101nis Nords. To verify this, I need to check the \"director\" column for each row and count how many times J\u0101nis Nords is listed as the director.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 0 (1992): Director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\n- Row 1 (2008): Director is Aigars Grauba.\n- Row 2 (2010): Director is M\u0101ris Martinsons.\n- Row 3 (2012): Director is Yevgeni Pashkevich.\n- Row 4 (2013): Director is J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nFrom this, only the last row lists J\u0101nis Nords as the director.

The claim says: \"defender of riga be submit more than a decade after the previous submission.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Defenders of Riga\" is one of the films in the table. The claim is talking about when this film was submitted for nomination compared to the previous submission.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two relevant rows:\n\n1. 2008 (81st ceremony): \"defenders of riga\" with director Aigars Grauba and result as \"not nominated.\"\n2. The other row is from 1992 (65th ceremony), but that's for a different film, \"The Child of Man.\"\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"the previous submission.\" So I need to check if there was another submission before 2008 by Aigars Grauba or maybe by Latvia in general. But looking at the table, it only shows five entries, so perhaps \"defenders of riga\" is the first submission by this director, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, actually, in the table, there's a 1992 entry for \"The Child of Man,\" directed by J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds. So that was a previous submission before 2008. The claim says that \"defenders of riga\" was submitted more than a decade after this previous one.\n\nLet me calculate the time between 1992 and 2008. From 1992 to 2008 is exactly 16 years, which is more than a decade (which is 10 years). So according to that, the claim would be TRUE because it's submitted more than a decade after.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that both submissions are from the same country and possibly same director or category. The table lists all as different films with different directors, so \"defenders of riga\" is the first submission by Aigars Grauba, but there was another submission in 1992 by a different director.\n\nSo if we consider any previous submission before 2008, then yes, it's more than a decade later. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted more than a decade after the previous submission.

Let's break down the claim and compare it against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"5 latvian films in 21 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse this claim. It mentions five Latvian films over a span of 21 years being submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The table lists five entries with different years and results. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The earliest year is 1992 (65th ceremony).\n- The latest year listed is 2013 (86th ceremony). \n- The span between 1992 and 2013 is 21 years, which matches the claim's timeframe.\n\nEach row in the table represents a film submitted by Latvia. All five films are from different years within this 21-year period. The result column shows that most were \"not nominated,\" but one is listed as \"tbd\" (to be determined), which might imply it was considered or submitted.\n\nThe claim specifies that these films were submitted for the Academy Award, and the table's results indicate whether they were nominated or not. Since all five are from Latvia, and each year falls within a 21-year span, the claim is supported by the data provided.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- Each row corresponds to a film submission, so all rows (0 through 4) are relevant.\n- The \"year (ceremony)\" column is crucial as it shows the years over which the submissions occurred, confirming the 21-year span.\n- The \"film title used in nomination\" and \"original title\" columns confirm that these are Latvian films submitted for consideration.\n\nThus, all cells across these rows and columns support the claim.

My focus is on the \"director\" column since the claim is about Aigars Grauba directing two films out of five.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0 (1992 ceremony):** The director is J\u0101nis Strei\u010ds.\n2. **Row 1 (2008 ceremony):** The director is Aigars Grauba.\n3. **Row 2 (2010 ceremony):** The director is M\u0101ris Martinsons.\n4. **Row 3 (2012 ceremony):** The director is Yevgeni Pashkevich.\n5. **Row 4 (2013 ceremony):** The director is J\u0101nis Nords.\n\nNow, counting how many times Aigars Grauba appears as the director: only in Row 1.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"mother , i love you and defender of riga be submit 1 year after the other.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It mentions two films: \"mother, I love you\" and \"defenders of Riga.\" The claim states that these two films were submitted one year apart from each other. So, I need to check if there's a submission where these two films were entered into the ceremony in consecutive years.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the relevant rows for each film. \n\nStarting with \"mother , i love you,\" I see it's listed in the row with row_index 4. The year is 2013 (86th ceremony). The result is marked as 'tbd,' which probably means to be determined or not yet decided.\n\nNext, \"defenders of riga\" appears in row_index 1. That film was nominated in 2008 at the 81st ceremony and the result was 'not nominated.'\n\nNow, I need to check if these two films were submitted one year after each other. The years for these entries are 2008 and 2013. Let's calculate the difference: 2013 minus 2008 is 5 years. That means there's a five-year gap between the nominations, not just one year apart.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider other aspects. The claim could be interpreted as being submitted in consecutive ceremonies regardless of the actual calendar years. Let me check the ceremony numbers. \"Defenders of Riga\" was at the 81st (2008), and \"mother , i love you\" is at the 86th (2013). The difference in ceremonies is also five, so they're not consecutive either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to submission rather than nomination. But according to the table, both films were submitted but not necessarily both nominated. However, the key point here is the time between their submissions. Since there's a 5-year gap, they weren't submitted one year apart.\n\nAnother angle: maybe I'm misunderstanding \"submit.\" Perhaps it refers to being considered in consecutive ceremonies regardless of the actual years. But even then, five years apart isn't just one year after each other.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is incorrect because the two films were not submitted one year apart; there's a five-year gap between their submissions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mother , i love you\" and \"defenders of riga\" were submitted one year apart.

The key elements here are:\n\n1. **Defenders of Riga**: This refers to a film listed in the table.\n2. **Submit more than a decade before the next submission**: This suggests that there's another submission after \"Defenders of Riga\" and that it occurred over ten years later.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two films related to Riga:\n- **Row 1 (2008)**: Title is \"defenders of riga,\" submitted in the 81st ceremony.\n- **Row 3 (2012)**: Title is \"gulf stream under the iceberg,\" but there's no mention of Riga here, so it might not be relevant.\n\nWait, actually, only one film is directly named as \"Defenders of Riga\" in 2008. The next submission after that would be in 2013 (Row 4). Let me check the years:\n\n- 2008 to 2013 is a span of five years. Since a decade is ten years, five years is less than a decade.\n\nSo, the claim says \"more than a decade before,\" but there's only a five-year gap between 2008 and 2013. Therefore, the submission after 2008 isn't more than a decade later; it's actually quite recent.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Does \"the next submission\" refer to the subsequent entry in the table? The table lists multiple submissions from Latvia over different years. After 2008, the next one is in 2010 (Row 2), then 2012, and finally 2013.\n\nSo, after \"Defenders of Riga\" in 2008, the next submission was in 2010. The gap between 2008 and 2010 is two years, which is definitely not more than a decade.\n\nAlternatively, if considering the time until another film with a similar theme or from the same country, but in this table, only one \"Defenders of Riga\" exists. Therefore, there's no next submission for it beyond 2008 within the data provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim is about whether \"defender of riga\" was submitted more than a decade before the next submission. So, if \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted in 2008, the next submission after that would be in 2010 (Hong Kong Confidential). The time between them is two years, which isn't more than a decade.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data. Hence, it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"defender of riga\" was submitted more than a decade before the next submission. Checking the table:\n\n- \"Defenders of Riga\" was submitted in 2008 (Row 1).\n- The next submission after 2008 is in 2010 (\"Hong Kong Confidential\"), which is only two years later.\n\nSince the gap is less than a decade, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"5 latvian films in 11 year be submit for the academy award best foreign language film.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this. It seems like there are five Latvian films submitted over an 11-year period for the Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film category.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it has columns: year (ceremony), film title used in nomination, original title, director, and result. Each row represents a submission. \n\nThe claim mentions 5 films, so let's check how many rows there are. There are five rows, each corresponding to a different year: 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013.\n\nNow, the years span from 1992 to 2013. To find out how many years that is, subtract 1992 from 2013: 2013 - 1992 = 21 years. But wait, maybe it's counting inclusive? So from 1992 to 2013 is actually 22 years if you include both start and end. However, the claim says \"11 year,\" which doesn't align with this calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of submissions. There are five films over these years: each submission is in a different year, so that's five films over approximately 21-22 years. The claim says 5 films over 11 years, but according to the table, it's more than double that time frame.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the \"11 year.\" Perhaps it refers to the number of years between the first and last submission? Let me check: from 1992 to 2013 is indeed about 21 years. So 5 films over 21 years don't fit into an 11-year span.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The claim says \"in 11 year,\" which might mean the time period during which all five submissions happened. If they are spread out over more than 11 years, then the claim is incorrect.\n\nLooking at the years: 1992, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013. The earliest submission is in 1992 and the latest in 2013, so the span is from 1992 to 2013, which is more than 20 years apart. Therefore, five films submitted over a period longer than 11 years would make the claim false.\n\nWait, but maybe it's not about the total span, but the actual number of years between submissions. Let me see: from 1992 to 2008 is 16 years, then to 2010 is 2 more years, making it a total of 18 years? That still doesn't fit into an 11-year window.\n\nSo the claim says five films in 11 years, but according to the table, they span over at least 21 years. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that five Latvian films were submitted for the Academy Award over an 11-year period. However, based on the table, the submissions occurred from 1992 to 2013, which spans more than 21 years. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year (ceremony)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
