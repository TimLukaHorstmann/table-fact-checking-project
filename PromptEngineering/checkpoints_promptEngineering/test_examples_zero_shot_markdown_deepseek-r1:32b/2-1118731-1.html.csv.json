    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the power of the 1972 engine be not give in hp (kw)\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the power for the 1972 engine isn't given in horsepower (hp) or kilowatts (kw). So, essentially, it's claiming that there are no values for hp or kw provided for the 1972 engine in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like \"generation,\" \"years,\" \"engine,\" \"power,\" and \"torque.\" The claim is about the power not being given, so I should focus on the \"power\" column entries related to the 1972 model year.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to find where the years include 1972. Let's see:\n\n- Row 0: Years are 1971. Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Years are 1971 - 1973. This includes 1972, so this is a potential candidate.\n- Row 2: Years are 1972. Direct hit here.\n- Rows beyond row 2 might also include 1972, but looking at the data:\n\nRow 0: i | 1971\nRow 1: i | 1971 - 1973\nRow 2: i | 1972\nRows after that start with later years or different generations.\n\nSo rows 1 and 2 are relevant because they include the year 1972. Now, let's check their \"power\" column entries.\n\nFor row 1, the power is listed as \"-\". Similarly, for row 2, it's also \"-\". In row 0, power is \"n/a\", but that doesn't directly affect our claim since we're focusing on 1972. So both relevant rows show \"-\" in the power column.\n\nThe table uses \"-\" to denote missing or unspecified values. Since neither of these entries provides a numerical value for power (either in hp or kw), it supports the claim that the power isn't given in those units.\n\nI should also check if there are other representations or possible columns where power might be listed, but looking at the table, the only column related to power is \"power,\" and both rows relevant to 1972 have \"-\" there. There's no mention of hp or kw elsewhere for these entries.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because the table doesn't provide any numerical value for the engine's power in 1972 in either hp or kw.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both rows containing the year 1972 have \"-\" under the \"power\" column, indicating that no power values are provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"power\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"power\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
