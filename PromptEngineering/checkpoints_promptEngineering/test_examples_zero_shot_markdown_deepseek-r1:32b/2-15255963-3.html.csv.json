    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"on march 13 1990 be play against dundee and result in 3 - 1\".\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's talking about a game played on March 13, 1990, against Dundee with a result of 3-1.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to find the one that matches March 13, 1990. Scanning through:\n\nRow 0: January 26, 1990\nRow 1: January 29, 1990\nRow 2: February 23, 1990\nRow 3: March 13, 1990 \u2013 this is the one.\n\nNow, let's check the details in row 3. The opponent is Dundee (matches). The result is 3-1, which matches the claim. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. I need to list the relevant cells that support this conclusion. \n\nThe date is under the \"date\" column in row 3. The opponent is in the \"opponent\" column same row. The result is in the \"result\" column same row.\n\nSo the relevant_cells will include these three columns from row 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the result when dundee be the opponent be 3 - 4\".\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked here. It seems like the user is saying that when the opponent was Dundee, the result of the match was 3-4.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find where the opponent is Dundee.\n\nLet's check each row one by one:\n\n1. The first row has East Fife as the opponent.\n2. The second row also has East Fife.\n3. Third row: Airdrieonians are the opponents.\n4. Fourth row: Here, the opponent is Dundee. Let me look at the result for this match. It says 3-1. So the team won 3 goals and lost 1 goal.\n\nWait, but the claim says the result was 3-4 when the opponent was Dundee. But according to the table, the result was 3-1 against Dundee, not 3-4. \n\nSo that means the claim is incorrect because the actual result wasn't a loss by 3-4; instead, it was a win of 3-1.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cell here is the row where the opponent is Dundee (row index 3) and specifically looking at the \"result\" column for that row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 3,\n       \"column_name\": \"result\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",
