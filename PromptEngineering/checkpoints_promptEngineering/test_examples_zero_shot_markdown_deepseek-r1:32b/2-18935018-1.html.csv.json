    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"there be 2 school who have a location of greensburg\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has columns like school, location, mascot, enrollment, etc. Each row represents a different school with its respective details.\n\nThe claim states that there are two schools located in Greensburg. So my goal is to check how many schools have 'greensburg' as their location.\n\nLooking at the table:\n1. The first row is Eastern Hancock located in Charlottesville.\n2. Indian Creek is in Trafalgar.\n3. Knightstown's location is Knightstown.\n4. Milan is in Milan.\n5. North Decatur is in Greensburg.\n6. South Decatur is also in Greensburg.\n\nSo, North Decatur and South Decatur both have their locations listed as Greensburg. That makes two schools.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two schools located in Greensburg according to the table.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for verification:\n- For North Decatur: row index 4, column 'location'\n- For South Decatur: row index 5, column 'location'\n\nThese are the cells that confirm both schools are indeed in Greensburg.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be more school whose primary conference be mid  - hoosier , than any other conference.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that the number of schools in the 'mid-hoosier' conference is greater than any other conference listed in the table. So, I need to count how many schools are in each conference and see if mid-hoosier has the most.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a school with various attributes including the primary conference. The column I'm interested in is 'primary conference.'\n\nLet me list out the conferences:\n\n1. Eastern Hancock: Mid-Hoosier\n2. Indian Creek: Mid-Hoosier\n3. Knightstown: Mid-Hoosier\n4. Milan: Ohio River Valley\n5. North Decatur: Mid-Hoosier\n6. South Decatur: Mid-Hoosier\n\nWait, that's six schools in total. Let me recount:\n\n- Eastern Hancock is row 0.\n- Indian Creek is row 1.\n- Knightstown is row 2.\n- Milan is row 3 (different conference).\n- North Decatur is row 4.\n- South Decatur is row 5.\n\nSo, how many are in Mid-Hoosier? Let's see:\n\nRows 0,1,2,4,5 all have 'mid-hoosier' as their primary conference. That's five schools.\n\nMilan (row 3) is the only one in a different conference: Ohio River Valley.\n\nSo, the count for Mid-Hoosier is 5, and Ohio River Valley has just 1 school.\n\nTherefore, Mid-Hoosier definitely has more schools than any other conference. Since there's only one other conference with fewer schools, the claim holds true.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: each row where 'primary conference' is listed needs to be checked. So that would be all rows from 0 to 5 in the 'primary conference' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because five out of six schools are in the Mid-Hoosier conference, which is more than any other conference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The 'primary conference' column determines each school's conference.\n2. **Count Schools per Conference:**\n   - Mid-Hoosier: Rows 0,1,2,4,5 (5 schools)\n   - Ohio River Valley: Row 3 (1 school)\n3. **Compare Counts:** Since 5 > 1, Mid-Hoosier has more schools than any other conference.\n\n**Answer: TRUE**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"north decatur do not have ohio river valley as their primary conference\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: school, location, mascot, enrollment, ihsaa class, county, and primary conference. Each row represents a different school with its respective details.\n\nThe claim is about \"north decatur\" and whether their primary conference is not the ohio river valley. So, I need to find the row corresponding to north decatur in the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n1. eastern hancock\n2. indian creek\n3. knightstown\n4. milan\n5. north decatur\n6. south decatur\n\nSo, north decatur is the fifth row (index 4 if starting from 0). Let me check what their primary conference is. According to the table, in the 'primary conference' column for north decatur, it's listed as \"mid  - hoosier\". \n\nNow, the claim states that north decatur does NOT have ohio river valley as their primary conference. Since the table shows their primary conference as mid-hoosier, this aligns with the claim because ohio river valley isn't mentioned there.\n\nTo confirm, I'll cross-check other entries to make sure no other schools are in the ohio river valley conference except milan. Yes, milan is the only one listed under that conference, and north decatur is under mid-hoosier. So the claim holds true based on the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified against the table, confirming that north decatur's primary conference is not ohio river valley.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"primary conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So the claim that Indian Creek has the highest enrollment is correct.\n\nNext, I'll identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion.

The rows list different schools with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about two specific schools: north decatur and south decatur.

Its enrollment is 397.\n- South Decatur is in row index 5. Its enrollment is 316.\n\nNow, I'll calculate the difference between north decatur and south decatur enrollments: 397 - 316 = 81. So yes, the enrollment of north decatur is exactly 81 students higher than that of south decatur.\n\nThe relevant cells for this calculation are the 'enrollment' column for both schools.

I need to determine whether the claim \"indian creek be 1 of 3 school in greensburg\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It states that Indian Creek is one out of three schools located in Greensburg. To verify this, I should look into the 'location' column and check how many schools are listed as being in Greensburg.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row is Eastern Hancock, located in Charlottesville.\n2. The second row is Indian Creek, located in Trafalgar.\n3. The third row is Knightstown, located in Knightstown.\n4. The fourth row is Milan, located in Milan.\n5. The fifth row is North Decatur, located in Greensburg.\n6. The sixth row is South Decatur, located in Greensburg.\n\nFrom this, I can see that Indian Creek's location is Trafalgar, not Greensburg. Therefore, it's not one of the schools in Greensburg. Instead, only North Decatur and South Decatur are listed as being in Greensburg. That means there are only two schools in Greensburg, not three.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other school in Greensburg. Scanning through each row again, yes, only the fifth and sixth rows have Greensburg as their location. So that's two schools, not three. Indian Creek is actually in Trafalgar, so it doesn't count towards the total.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Indian Creek is one of three schools in Greensburg is incorrect because there are only two schools listed in Greensburg according to the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE.
