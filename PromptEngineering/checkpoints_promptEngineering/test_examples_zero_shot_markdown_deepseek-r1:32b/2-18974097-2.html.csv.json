    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"3 of the team be from the same county (orange)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in markdown format. It has columns for school, location, mascot, size, ihsaa class, and county. There are seven rows, each representing a different school with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim states that three teams are from the same county, specifically orange. So my task is to check how many schools have their county listed as \"59 orange\" or simply \"orange\". \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row is Crawford County in Marengo with mascot Wolfpack. The county column shows \"13 crawford\", so that's not orange.\n2. Mitchell is next, located in Mitchell with Bluejackets. Its county is \"47 lawrence\" \u2013 still not orange.\n3. Orleans is the third row. It's in Orleans, and the county is listed as \"59 orange\". That's our first match.\n4. Paoli comes fourth, located in Paoli. The county here is also \"59 orange\". Second match.\n5. Perry Central is next, located in Leopold with Commodores. Their county is \"62 perry\" \u2013 not orange.\n6. Springs Valley is sixth, based in French Lick. Its county is \"59 orange\", making that the third school from Orange County.\n7. Lastly, West Washington in Campbellsburg has Senators and its county is \"88 washington\".\n\nSo I've identified three schools: Orleans, Paoli, and Springs Valley, all listed under county \"59 orange\". Each of these corresponds to row indices 2, 3, and 5.\n\nTherefore, the claim that three teams are from Orange County is supported by the data. So the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells include rows 2, 3, and 5 in the 'county' column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are three schools (Orleans, Paoli, Springs Valley) listed under county \"59 orange\". The relevant cells are from the 'county' column in rows 2, 3, and 5.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"county\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"all of the mascot except west washington's be base on animal.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It seems the claim is saying that all mascots are based on animals except for West Washington's. So I should check each school's mascot to see if they are indeed animals, and specifically confirm that West Washington's isn't an animal.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Crawford County: Mascot is Wolfpack. Wolves are animals, so this fits.\n2. Mitchell: Bluejackets. That sounds like a naval term, not an animal. Wait, but sometimes jackets can refer to animals in mascots? Or maybe it's referring to bluejays, which are birds. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe \"bluejackets\" is the name of a sports team and not necessarily an animal.\n3. Orleans: Bulldogs. Bulls are animals, so yes.\n4. Paoli: Rams. Rams are animals.\n5. Perry Central: Commodores. This seems like a naval term or related to ships, not an animal. So that's another non-animal mascot.\n6. Springs Valley: Blackhawks. Hawks are birds, which are animals.\n7. West Washington: Senators. That doesn't sound like an animal at all; it refers to political figures.\n\nWait, but according to the claim, only West Washington's mascot isn't based on an animal. However, looking through the list, I see that Mitchell and Perry Central also have mascots that don't seem to be animals. So if the claim is that all except West Washington are animals, this would be false because there are other exceptions.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I made a mistake with Mitchell's mascot. Bluejackets could refer to bluejays, which are birds, so perhaps it is an animal. Let me clarify:\n\n- Bluejackets: Could be a play on words between \"blue\" and \"jackets,\" but more likely referring to bluejays.\n- Commodores: This definitely isn't an animal; it's related to the navy or ships.\n\nSo if that's correct, then Mitchell's is an animal (Bluejays), but Perry Central's is not. So the claim states only West Washington is non-animal, but there's another one, so the claim is false.\n\nTherefore, I should mark the answer as FALSE and identify the relevant cells where the mascots are either animals or not. The relevant cells would be all the mascot columns across each row because I need to check each one.\n\nSo, relevant_cells will include every \"mascot\" column for each school.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all mascots except West Washington's are based on animals. Upon reviewing each mascot:\n\n- Wolfpack (animal)\n- Bluejackets (possibly animal - bluejays)\n- Bulldogs (animal)\n- Rams (animal)\n- Commodores (not an animal)\n- Blackhawks (animal)\n- Senators (not an animal)\n\nSince both Perry Central and West Washington have non-animal mascots, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"mitchell, orleans and paoli be the name of school and also the town the relevant school be in.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that for each of these three schools\u2014Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli\u2014the name of the school is the same as the name of the town where they're located. So, I'm looking at whether the \"school\" column matches the \"location\" column for each of these three entries.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. For Mitchell: The school is listed as \"mitchell,\" and the location is also \"mitchell.\" So that's a match.\n2. For Orleans: The school is \"orleans,\" and the location is \"orleans.\" That matches too.\n3. For Paoli: The school is \"paoli,\" but the location is \"paoli.\" Wait, in the table, the location for Paoli is \"paoli\" as well. So that's also a match.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table:\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Mitchell is row 1: School mitchell, Location mitchell.\n- Orleans is row 2: School orleans, Location orleans.\n- Paoli is row 3: School paoli, Location paoli.\n\nSo all three have matching school and location names. Therefore, the claim seems to hold true for each of these schools.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells that support this conclusion. For each school mentioned:\n\n- Mitchell: Check school name and location.\n- Orleans: Same as above.\n- Paoli: Same again.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Mitchell:\nRow 1 (index starts at 0?), so row index is 1? Wait, looking back, the table has row indices starting from 0. Let me recount:\n\nThe table rows are indexed as follows:\n\n0: crawford county\n1: mitchell\n2: orleans\n3: paoli\n4: perry central\n5: springs valley\n6: west washington\n\nWait, no\u2014the first row after the header is crawford county (row 0), then mitchell (row 1), orleans (row 2), paoli (row 3), etc. So:\n\nMitchell is at row index 1.\nOrleans at 2.\nPaoli at 3.\n\nFor each, I need to check the \"school\" and \"location\" columns.\n\nSo for Mitchell:\n- Row 1, column \"school\": mitchell\n- Row 1, column \"location\": mitchell\n\nSame for Orleans: row 2, both are orleans.\n\nPaoli: row 3, both paoli.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor Mitchell:\n{\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"school\"}\n{\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"location\"}\n\nSimilarly for Orleans:\n{\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"school\"}\n{\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"location\"}\n\nAnd for Paoli:\n{\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"school\"}\n{\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"location\"}\n\nSo the relevant_cells array should include all these six entries.\n\nBut wait, in the example provided earlier, each object had either one column per row. So perhaps I need to list each cell individually for each check.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So each school's name and location are two cells each, so total 6 relevant cells.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli schools are located in towns with the same names as their respective schools.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\":\"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\":\"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about Mitchell being the sole school in a specific category: having an AAA IHSAA classification. So, I should look into the \"ihsaa class\" column to see which schools fall under that category.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Crawford County: The IHSAA class is AA.\n2. Mitchell: The IHSAA class is AAA.\n3. Orleans: Class A.\n4. Paoli: AA.\n5. Perry Central: AA.\n6. Springs Valley: A.\n7. West Washington: A.\n\nFrom this, it seems like Mitchell is the only school with an AAA classification in the \"ihsaa class\" column. All other schools have either AA or A. \n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any rows and that there are no typos or alternative spellings of AAA elsewhere. Scanning again, none of the other entries mention AAA except for Mitchell.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Mitchell is indeed the only school listed with an AAA IHSAA class.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mitchell is the only school with an AAA IHSAA classification.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"all of the team be from different country\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that each school's team comes from a different country. But looking at the table, I don't see a column labeled \"country.\" Instead, there are columns like \"location,\" \"mascot,\" \"size,\" \"ihsaa class,\" and \"county.\"\n\nSince the claim mentions \"country,\" but the table doesn't have that information, I might be misunderstanding something. Maybe it's referring to different counties? The table does have a \"county\" column with entries like \"13 crawford,\" \"47 lawrence,\" etc.\n\nIf the claim is about being from different countries and there's no country data, then I can't verify it. But if we interpret it as each team coming from a different county, let's check that.\n\nLooking at the \"county\" column:\n- crawford county\n- mitchell (county 47 lawrence)\n- orleans (county 59 orange)\n- paoli (county 59 orange)\n- perry central (county 62 perry)\n- springs valley (county 59 orange)\n- west washington (county 88 washington)\n\nI see that counties like \"orange\" (59) appear multiple times. For example, orleans and paoli are both in county 59 orange. So if the claim is about countries but meant counties, then it's not true because some teams are from the same county.\n\nAlternatively, if \"country\" was a typo and should be \"county,\" the answer would still be FALSE since there are duplicates. If it's truly about different countries with no data provided, then the claim can't be supported either way.\n\nSince the table doesn't have country information, but has county info which shows duplicates, the claim is likely FALSE based on available data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to teams being from different countries, but the table only provides county information.

The claim states: \"mitchell, orleans and paoli be the name of school and also the mascot of the relevant school.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each school mentioned in the claim: Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli. For each, I need to check two things: is their school name matching the entry in the \"school\" column, and does their mascot's name match the school's name?\n\nStarting with Mitchell. Looking at the table, the first row after the header is Crawford County. The second row is Mitchell, located in Mitchell with a mascot called Bluejackets. So, the school name is Mitchell, and the mascot is Bluejackets. Are they the same? No, because the mascot isn't Mitchell; it's Bluejackets. So that doesn't match.\n\nNext up, Orleans. Checking the third row: Orleans is located in Orleans with a mascot named Bulldogs. Again, the school is Orleans, but the mascot is Bulldogs, not Orleans. So no match here either.\n\nLastly, Paoli. The fourth row shows Paoli located in Paoli with a mascot called Rams. School name is Paoli, mascot is Rams\u2014different again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says each of these schools has their name as both the school and the mascot. So for Mitchell, does that mean the school's name is Mitchell and the mascot is also Mitchell? From the table, Mitchell's mascot is Bluejackets, so no. Similarly, Orleans' mascot isn't Orleans but Bulldogs, and Paoli's mascot isn't Paoli but Rams.\n\nTherefore, none of these schools have their names as mascots. The claim is asserting that for each school (Mitchell, Orleans, Paoli), both the school name and mascot are the same. But according to the table, this isn't true. All three have different mascots.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because all three cases don't meet the condition where the school's name equals the mascot.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mitchell, Orleans, and Paoli each have their names as both the school and the mascot.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it means that all the mascots listed in the table are based on animals, including West Washington's mascot. So, each school's mascot should represent an animal.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"mascot\". The rows go from 0 to 6, as there are seven schools listed. I need to check each mascot to see if it's an animal-based one.\n\nLet me list out the mascots:\n\n1. Wolfpack (Crawford County)\n2. Bluejackets (Mitchell)\n3. Bulldogs (Orleans)\n4. Rams (Paoli)\n5. Commodores (Perry Central)\n6. Blackhawks (Springs Valley)\n7. Senators (West Washington)\n\nNow, evaluating each mascot:\n\n- Wolfpack: Wolves are animals.\n- Bluejackets: Wait, that's a bit tricky. \"Bluejacket\" is more of a military term or a type of uniform, not an animal. So this might be an issue because the claim says all mascots are based on animals.\n- Bulldogs: Bulls are animals, so Bulldogs are based on them.\n- Rams: Again, rams are male sheep, which are animals.\n- Commodores: This refers to a rank in some naval forces, not an animal. So this is another non-animal mascot.\n- Blackhawks: Hawks are birds, so that's an animal.\n- Senators: This seems like it's based on a title or position (like senators in government), not an animal.\n\nSo from the list, at least three mascots (Bluejackets, Commodores, and Senators) don't seem to be based on animals. Therefore, the claim that all mascots, including West Washington's (Senators), are based on animals is FALSE.\n\nTo support this, I'll note the relevant cells where the mascots aren't animal-based. Those would be rows 1 (Bluejackets), 4 (Commodores), and 6 (Senators) in the \"mascot\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all mascots, including West Washington's, are based on animals.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"mitchell be 1 of the 2 school list with an aaa ihsaa class\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It says that Mitchell is one of two schools listed in the table that have an AAA classification under the IHSAA class column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school along with various attributes like location, mascot, size, etc. The relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"ihsaa class\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check which schools have the IHSAA class as AAA.\n\nRow 0: crawford county - ihsaa class is AA.\nRow 1: mitchell - ihsaa class is AAA. So Mitchell is one school with AAA classification.\nRow 2: orleans - A\nRow 3: paoli - AA\nRow 4: perry central - AA\nRow 5: springs valley - A\nRow 6: west washington - A\n\nFrom this, only Mitchell has an AAA classification. Therefore, there's only one school with AAA in the IHSAA class column.\n\nSince the claim says there are two schools with AAA, but according to the table, there is only Mitchell, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"orleans be exactly less than half the size of mitchell\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant information needed from the table. We need the sizes of Orleans and Mitchell. Let me look through the rows:\n\n- For Orleans: Looking at the row where school is \"orleans\", the size is listed as 258.\n- For Mitchell: The row for \"mitchell\" shows a size of 620.\n\nNext, I'll compute half of Mitchell's size to see if Orleans' size is exactly less than that. Half of Mitchell's size (620) is 310. \n\nNow, comparing the two sizes:\n- Orleans: 258\n- Half of Mitchell: 310\n\nIs 258 less than 310? Yes, it is. Therefore, the claim holds true.\n\nI'll also note down which cells from the table were used for this comparison. The relevant cells are:\n1. The size of Orleans found in row index 2 under the \"size\" column.\n2. The size of Mitchell found in row index 1 under the \"size\" column.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are those two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"size\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"size\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
