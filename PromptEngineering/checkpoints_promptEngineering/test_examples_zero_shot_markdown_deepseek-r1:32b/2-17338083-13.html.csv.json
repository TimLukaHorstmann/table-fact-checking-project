    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house, and from (which probably indicates the year). There are multiple rows with different states listed as 'sovereign'.\n\nThe claim mentions two names: xi and xian, both associated with the state 'jin'. So I need to check if either of these names appear when the state is 'jin' in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Scanning through each row where the state is 'jin'. Let's see:\n  - Row index 7: jin | sovereign | xi | marquis | ji | 840 bc\n  - Row index 8: jin | sovereign | xian | marquis | ji | 822 bc\n\nSo, for both entries under state 'jin', the names are indeed 'xi' and 'xian'. That matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, since both xi and xian are present as names when the state is jin, the claim holds true. \n\nNow, to note the relevant cells:\n- For row 7 (index starting at 0), we have the name 'xi' under column 'name'.\n- For row 8, the name 'xian' is listed.\n\nSo these two rows and their respective 'name' columns are the ones supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that when the state is jin, the names xi or xian are present. Checking the table confirms both names under state jin.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"from 830 bc, the state be song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems a bit unclear, but it likely means that in the year 830 BC, the state was Song. So I need to check if there's an entry in the table where the 'from' column is 830 BC and the 'state' column is Song.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'state', 'type', 'name', 'title', 'royal house', and 'from'. My focus will be on the 'state' and 'from' columns for this claim.\n\nI'll go through each row to find any where 'from' is 830 BC. Let's see:\n\nRow indices start at 0. \n\n- Row 0: from is 837 BC \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 1: 835 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 2: 826 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 3: 831 BC \u2192 Close but not 830.\n- Row 4: 837 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 5: 827 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 6: 821 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 7: 840 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 8: 822 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 9: 854 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 10: 825 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 11: 850 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 12: 824 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 13: 845 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 14: 822 BC \u2192 No.\n- Row 15: 830 BC \u2192 Yes! This is the row in question.\n\nLooking at row 15, 'from' is indeed 830 BC. The 'state' column here is Song. So this supports the claim that in 830 BC, the state was Song.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's a direct match in the table where from=830 BC and state=song.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 830 BC, the state was Song. Checking the table, row index 15 has 'from' as 830 BC and 'state' as song.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"from\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's stating. It seems like the claim is saying that the name 'yi' occurs under two specific conditions: the royal house is 'ji' and the state is 'cai'. So, essentially, we're looking for a row in the table where the state is cai, the royal house is ji, and the name is yi.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The columns are: state, type, name, title, royal house, from.\n- Each row represents a sovereign with specific attributes.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row to check for these conditions. \n\nStarting from row 0:\n- State: cai\n- Royal house: ji\n- Name: yi\n\nThis seems to match all three conditions. The name is 'yi', the royal house is 'ji', and the state is 'cai'. Therefore, this row supports the claim.\n\nI'll check other rows just to be thorough, but since we've already found a matching row, it's sufficient for determining the answer as TRUE. However, examining all rows ensures there are no inconsistencies or multiple entries that might affect the conclusion.\n\nLooking at subsequent rows:\n- Rows 1 and 2 have state cao, which doesn't match cai.\n- Row 3: state chen, not relevant.\n- Rows 4,5,6: state chu, not relevant.\n- Rows 7,8: state jin; royal house ji but name is xi and xian. These don't match 'yi'.\n- Rows 9,10: state lu; royal house ji but names are shen and wu. Not matching.\n- Row 11: qi, not relevant.\n- Rows 12,13: qi again, so no.\n- Rows 14,15: qin, different royal house (ying).\n- Rows 16,17: song and wey; no match for state cai or royal house ji with name yi.\n- Rows 18,19: yan; not relevant.\n\nSo the only row that satisfies all three conditions is row 0. Therefore, the claim holds true based on this data.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows where state is cai and royal house is ji but the name isn't yi. But in this table, there's only one entry for cai: row 0, which has the correct name. Thus, no conflicting information exists.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there's a matching record where all specified conditions are met.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"state\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"xi or xian be the name when the state be jin and the title be duke.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its conditions. It seems that the claim is checking for two possibilities:\n\n1. When the state is 'jin' and the title is 'duke', does the name equal 'xi'? OR\n2. When the state is 'jin' and the title is 'duke', does the name equal 'xian'? \n\nSo, I need to check all rows in the table where the state is 'jin' and the title is 'duke' and see if either of these names appears.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: State is cai, so skip.\n- Row 1: Cao, not jin.\n- Row 2: Cao again.\n- Row 3: Chen, nope.\n- Row 4: Chu, not relevant.\n- Row 5: Chu again.\n- Row 6: Still Chu.\n- Row 7: Jin. Title is marquis, so doesn't meet 'duke' condition.\n- Row 8: Jin, title is marquis again.\n- Rows 9-21 don't have state as jin.\n\nWait a minute, I didn't see any row where the state is 'jin' and the title is 'duke'. Both entries for Jin (rows 7 and 8) have titles as 'marquis', not 'duke'.\n\nSince there are no rows where state is 'jin' and title is 'duke', neither 'xi' nor 'xian' appear under these conditions. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim requires checking if either \"xi\" or \"xian\" are names when the state is 'jin' and title is 'duke'. Reviewing all rows for state 'jin', titles are marquis, not duke. No relevant cells match the condition.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai and the year be 826\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The name should be 'yi'.\n2. The royal house should be 'ji'.\n3. The state should be 'cai'.\n4. The year should be 826 BC.\n\nI'll need to check each of these conditions against the table entries.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has columns: state, type, name, title, royal house, from (which I assume is the year). So, each row represents a sovereign with their details.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: cai, sovereign, yi, marquis, ji, 837 bc.\n   - Name is 'yi' \u2714\ufe0f\n   - Royal house is 'ji' \u2714\ufe0f\n   - State is 'cai' \u2714\ufe0f\n   - Year is 837 BC \u274c (doesn't match 826)\n\nSo this row doesn't satisfy the year condition.\n\nNext, I'll check if there are any other rows where state is cai, royal house is ji, and year is 826.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 1: cao, sovereign, you, count, -, 835 bc.\n- Row 2: cao, sovereign, dai, count, -, 826 bc. (state is cao, so not cai)\n- Row 3: chen, sovereign, li, duke, -, 831 bc.\n- Row 4: chu, sovereign, xiong yan the younger, viscount, mi, 837 bc.\n- Row 5: chu, sovereign, xiong shuang, viscount, mi, 827 bc.\n- Row 6: chu, sovereign, xiong xun, viscount, mi, 821 bc.\n- Row 7: jin, sovereign, xi, marquis, ji, 840 bc.\n- Row 8: jin, sovereign, xian, marquis, ji, 822 bc.\n- Row 9: lu, sovereign, shen, duke, ji, 854 bc.\n- Row 10: lu, sovereign, wu, duke, ji, 825 bc.\n- Row 11: qi, sovereign, wu, duke, jiang, 850 bc.\n- Row 12: qi, sovereign, li, duke, jiang, 824 bc.\n- Row 13: qin, sovereign, qin zhong, ruler, ying, 845 bc.\n- Row 14: qin, sovereign, zhuang, duke, ying, 822 bc.\n- Row 15: song, sovereign, hui, duke, -, 830 bc.\n- Row 16: wey, sovereign, li, marquis, -, 855 bc.\n- Row 17: yan, sovereign, hui, marquis, -, 864 bc.\n- Row 18: yan, sovereign, li, marquis, -, 826 bc.\n\nLooking at row 18: state is yan, so not cai. Year is 826 bc, but the state isn't cai and royal house is '-', not ji. So that doesn't help.\n\nSo, only row 0 has state 'cai', royal house 'ji', name 'yi' but year is 837 bc. None of the rows have all four conditions: state cai, royal house ji, name yi, and year 826 bc.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the table; it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that when the state is 'cai', the royal house is 'ji', and the year is 826 BC, the name should be 'yi'.

I need to determine whether the claim \"when the from be 830 bc , the state be wey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table and understand its structure. The columns are: state, type, name, title, royal house, and from.
