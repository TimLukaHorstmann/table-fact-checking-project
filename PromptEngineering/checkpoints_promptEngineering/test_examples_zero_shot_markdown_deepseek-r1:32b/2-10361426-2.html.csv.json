    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the green bay packer be the opponent 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It says that Green Bay Packers were opponents two times. So, my task is to check how many times they appear as an opponent in the \"opponent\" column of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it's a markdown with several columns: week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The relevant column here is \"opponent\". I'll go through each row and note down every occurrence where the opponent is Green Bay Packers.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Week 1: Opponent is Oakland Raiders.\n- Week 2: Chicago Bears.\n- Week 3: Green Bay Packers. That's one occurrence.\n- Week 4: Detroit Lions.\n- Week 5: San Francisco 49ers.\n- Week 6: Philadelphia Eagles.\n- Week 7: Los Angeles Rams.\n- Week 8: Cleveland Browns.\n- Week 9: Detroit Lions again.\n- Week 10: Atlanta Falcons.\n- Week 11: Chicago Bears again.\n- Week 12: Cincinnati Bengals.\n- Week 13: Green Bay Packers. That's the second occurrence.\n- Week 14: New York Giants.\n\nSo, I found two instances where the opponent is Green Bay Packers: week 3 and week 13. Therefore, the claim that they were opponents twice is correct.\n\nNow, to map this into the required JSON format, I need to list the relevant cells. Each occurrence corresponds to a row in the table. The rows are zero-indexed, so week 3 is row 2 (since counting starts at 0), and week 13 is row 12.\n\nEach relevant cell will have \"row_index\" as an integer and \"column_name\" as \"opponent\". So the two cells are:\n- {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant_cells list includes these two entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for games where the opponent was the Los Angeles Rams because the claim mentions them. Scanning through the table, I find that row 7 (0-indexed) has \"los angeles rams\" as the opponent. The result here is \"w 10 - 9\", which means the team won by a score of 10 to 9 against the Rams.\n\nThe claim says it was the fewest points scored against the Rams, so I need to check if there are any other games against them in the table. Looking through all rows, row 7 is the only one where the opponent is the Los Angeles Rams. Since there's only one game against them, this must be both the highest and lowest scoring game against that team based on the data provided.\n\nTherefore, since it's the only occurrence, the claim holds true because there are no other games to compare for points scored against the Rams.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about the earliest date being September 16, 1973. I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has columns for week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. Each row represents a different game or event that occurred during those weeks in 1973.\n\nThe claim states that \"the earliest date be september 16, 1973.\" My task is to verify if this date is indeed the earliest one listed in the table. To do this, I'll need to look at all the dates provided and compare them to find out which one comes first chronologically.\n\nLooking through the 'date' column:\n- Week 1: September 16, 1973\n- Week 2: September 23, 1973\n- Week 3: September 30, 1973\n- Week 4: October 7, 1973\n- Week 5: October 14, 1973\n- Week 6: October 21, 1973\n- Week 7: October 28, 1973\n- Week 8: November 4, 1973\n- Week 9: November 11, 1973\n- Week 10: November 19, 1973\n- Week 11: November 25, 1973\n- Week 12: December 2, 1973\n- Week 13: December 8, 1973\n- Week 14: December 16, 1973\n\nFrom this list, September 16, 1973 is the first date. All other dates occur after this one. Therefore, the earliest date in the table is indeed September 16, 1973.\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed anything, I'll double-check each week's date to confirm that none of them are earlier than September 16. Weeks start at 1 and go up to 14, with dates progressing month by month from September through December. There's no week 0 or any prior weeks before week 1.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the attendance numbers and other columns isn't necessary for this specific claim since it only concerns the date. However, if there were any discrepancies in the data, such as a duplicate date or an incorrectly entered value, that could affect the outcome. But based on the information given, everything seems consistent.\n\nIn conclusion, after reviewing all the dates provided in the table, September 16, 1973 is clearly the earliest one listed. This means the claim made by the user is accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that December 16, 1973, had the highest attendance among all the games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column named \"attendance\" which shows the number of people who attended each game on different weeks and dates. My goal is to find out if the attendance figure for December 16 is indeed the largest.\n\nI'll start by locating December 16, 1973 in the table. Scanning through the 'date' column, I see that week 14 corresponds to this date. The attendance listed there is 70,041. \n\nNext, I need to compare this number with all other attendances in the table to verify if it's the highest.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column named \"attendance\" which lists numbers under each week. The claim mentions that the smallest attendance is 44818, so I need to check if this value is indeed the lowest in the \"attendance\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the attendance figures:\n\n- Week 1: 44,818\n- Week 2: 52,035\n- Week 3: 48,176\n- Week 4: 49,549\n- Week 5: 56,438\n- Week 6: 47,478\n- Week 7: 47,787\n- Week 8: 46,722\n- Week 9: 47,911\n- Week 10: 56,519\n- Week 11: 46,430\n- Week 12: 57,859\n- Week 13: 53,830\n- Week 14: 70,041\n\nNow, I'll sort these numbers to find the smallest. The lowest number here is 46,430 from Week 11. Since 46,430 is less than 44,818 (the claim's value), the claim that the smallest attendance is 44,818 is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and I need to identify all rows where the attendance was lower than 44,818. From my list, Week 6 has 47,478; Week 7: 47,787; Week 8: 46,722; Week 9: 47,911; and Week 11: 46,430.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the green bay packer be the opponent 4 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It appears that there might be a typo in the claim. \"Be\" should probably be \"were,\" making it grammatically correct: \"the Green Bay Packers were the opponent 4 times.\" So, the claim is asserting that the Green Bay Packers faced off against another team (I assume the team in question here is the Minnesota Vikings, given the venue details) four times during this period.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a game played by a team. The relevant columns for this claim are \"opponent\" and potentially \"week.\" My goal is to count how many times the Green Bay Packers appear as the opponent in the \"opponent\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Week 1: Opponent is Oakland Raiders \u2013 not Packers.\n2. Week 2: Opponent is Chicago Bears \u2013 not Packers.\n3. Week 3: Opponent is Green Bay Packers \u2013 this counts as one occurrence.\n4. Week 4: Opponent is Detroit Lions \u2013 not Packers.\n5. Week 5: Opponent is San Francisco 49ers \u2013 not Packers.\n6. Week 6: Opponent is Philadelphia Eagles \u2013 not Packers.\n7. Week 7: Opponent is Los Angeles Rams \u2013 not Packers.\n8. Week 8: Opponent is Cleveland Browns \u2013 not Packers.\n9. Week 9: Opponent is Detroit Lions again \u2013 not Packers.\n10. Week 10: Opponent is Atlanta Falcons \u2013 not Packers.\n11. Week 11: Opponent is Chicago Bears again \u2013 not Packers.\n12. Week 12: Opponent is Cincinnati Bengals \u2013 not Packers.\n13. Week 13: Opponent is Green Bay Packers \u2013 this is the second occurrence.\n14. Week 14: Opponent is New York Giants \u2013 not Packers.\n\nFrom this, I can see that the Green Bay Packers appear as opponents only in weeks 3 and 13. That's a total of two times, not four. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they were opponents only twice, not four times.\n\nAs for the relevant cells, these are the rows where the opponent was the Green Bay Packers:\n- Row index 2 (Week 3)\n- Row index 12 (Week 13)\n\nEach of these entries has the \"opponent\" column indicating the Green Bay Packers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the fewest points be scored against the green bay packer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe phrase seems a bit unclear because of the grammar issues. It might mean that the Green Bay Packers were the team with the fewest points scored against them, i.e., they had the lowest defense allowing the least points. Alternatively, it could be misphrased and maybe intended to say \"the fewest points were scored by the Green Bay Packers,\" which would relate to their offense scoring fewer points. But given the wording, I think it's more about defensive performance.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with an opponent, result (win or loss), and the scores. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. So for each game, we can see the points scored by our team (the one whose schedule this is) versus the opponent.\n\nWait, actually, I'm not sure which team's perspective this table is showing. It lists opponents like Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears, etc., but it doesn't specify who is playing them. Since all the results are wins except for two rows where it says 'l' (lose), perhaps this is from a specific team's schedule, and we need to see how many points they gave up against each opponent.\n\nBut wait, in the table, each row shows the result as either \"w\" or \"l\" followed by scores. For example, the first row: \"w 24 - 16\". So that means our team won with 24 points against the Raiders who scored 16. Similarly, other rows follow this format.\n\nSo for each game, the first number is the team's score (the one whose schedule we're looking at), and the second is the opponent's score. Therefore, to find out how many points were scored by the opponents, I need to look at the numbers after the hyphen in the result column.\n\nThe claim is about \"the fewest points be scored against the green bay packer.\" If it's about defensive performance (points allowed), then we need to see when Green Bay Packers were the opponent and how many points they scored against our team. Wait, no\u2014if the table shows games from our team's perspective, then when the opponent is Green Bay, their score would be after the hyphen.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each row represents a game where our team (let's say it's the Minnesota Vikings because the first venue is Metropolitan Stadium, which I think was their home stadium at that time) played against an opponent. The result shows W or L followed by two scores: ours and the opponent's.\n\nSo for example, in week 3, they played Green Bay Packard? No, opponent is \"green bay packers\". So the row would be our team (Vikings) playing against the Packers. The result was a win with 11-3. So the Packers scored 3 points that game.\n\nSo the claim is about the fewest points being scored against Green Bay. Wait, perhaps it's phrased as \"the fewest points were scored against\" them, meaning how many times they allowed the least points? Or maybe it's the other way around: the fewest points scored by our team against them.\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. The claim says \"the fewest point be score against the green bay packer.\" Maybe it means that in the games against Green Bay, they (our team) scored the fewest points? Or perhaps that the Packers allowed the fewest points?\n\nHmm, I think I need to clarify what exactly is being claimed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to whether the game(s) against the Green Bay Packers resulted in the lowest opponent scores for our team. That is, how many points did the Packers score when they played against us.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find all games where the opponent was Green Bay Packers.\n\nIn week 3: result is \"w 11 - 3\". So the Packers scored 3 points.\n\nIn week 13: opponent is Green Bay again. The result is \"w 31 -7\". So in that game, the Packers scored 7 points.\n\nSo against Green Bay, our team allowed 3 and 7 points.\n\nNow, to check if this was the fewest points scored against them (i.e., whether these are the lowest opponent scores), we need to look at all other opponents' scores in other games.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nWeek 1: vs Raiders - 16\nWeek 2: vs Bears -13\nWeek 3: vs Packers -3\nWeek4: vs Lions -9\nWeek5: vs 49ers -13\nWeek6: vs Eagles -21\nWeek7: vs Rams -9 (wait, result is \"w 10-9\", so opponent scored 9)\nWait no, week7 result is \"w 10-9\" meaning our team scored 10 and the Rams 9. So opponent's score is 9.\n\nThen week8 would be, but wait the table given only has up to week13? Wait let me count:\n\nWeeks are from 1 to 13 in the table provided?\n\nWait looking back at the data, no\u2014actually, the user hasn't provided the full table. The initial description says \"You are tasked with...\", then some context, and ends with \"Please reason step by step...\" So perhaps I need to assume that the table is as given up to week 13.\n\nSo for each opponent's score:\n\nWeek 1: Raiders -16\nWeek2: Bears -13\nWeek3: Packers -3\nWeek4: Lions -9\nWeek5: 49ers -13\nWeek6: Eagles -21\nWeek7: Rams -9\nWeek8: Let me check week8 opponent is probably another team, but in the data given, perhaps not. Wait I need to count the rows.\n\nLooking at the user's table:\n\nThey provided up to \"result Venue attendance\", and then rows:\n\nw 24-16 Oakland Raiders Metropolitan Stadium 57103\n\nBut no\u2014the actual table wasn't fully pasted here. Hmm, maybe it's a placeholder.\n\nWait actually, looking back: The initial prompt says \"You are tasked with...\" but doesn't provide the full table. So perhaps I need to consider that in my response.\n\nAlternatively, if this is an example or something, perhaps the user has another table they didn't paste here. Hmm, maybe I should proceed based on what's given.\n\nWait no\u2014since it's a hypothetical question, let me assume that the table includes all necessary data for determining points against each opponent.\n\nSo to find out if Green Bay Packers were the opponents with the fewest points scored against our team (i.e., they allowed the least), I need to compare their scores in their games to other opponents' scores.\n\nFrom what's given:\n\n- Against Raiders: 16\n- Bears: 13\n- Packers:3 and7\n- Lions:9\n- 49ers:13\n- Eagles:21\n- Rams:9\n\nSo the lowest opponent score is 3 (against Packers in week3), then 7,9, etc. So in that case, the fewest points scored against our team by any opponent was 3, which happened against Green Bay.\n\nBut does that mean the claim is TRUE? Because the claim might be saying that Green Bay allowed the fewest points, but actually, it's about how many they scored against us, which is low. Alternatively, maybe the claim is misphrased and should say \"the fewest points were scored by the Packers against us.\"\n\nAlternatively, if the table is from the perspective of the Packers, then it would be different. But given that all opponents are listed as others (Raiders, Bears, etc.), I think it's safe to assume this is another team's schedule.\n\nTherefore, in our team's games, the Packers scored 3 and 7 points. The fewest points any opponent scored against us was 3, which happened against Green Bay. So if the claim is that \"the fewest points were scored against Green Bay,\" meaning that when playing them, they gave up the least, then yes, it's true because in those games, our team allowed only 3 and 7 points.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting correctly. The claim says: \"You are tasked with... determining whether the statement 'the fewest point be score against the green bay packer' is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\"\n\nSo perhaps it's about how many points were scored against the Packers in their games, meaning the total points other teams scored against them. But since this table only shows our team's schedule, we can't directly see the Packers' overall performance.\n\nWait no\u2014the claim might be from a different perspective. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking whether Green Bay was the opponent that allowed the fewest points in their games.\n\nBut without knowing the other teams' schedules, it's impossible to say. So perhaps this table only shows our team's games, and we can't assess overall performance of the Packers against all opponents.\n\nWait but given the context, I think the user wants us to consider within this specific schedule: whether in games where they played Green Bay, the points scored by Green Bay were among the lowest compared to other opponents.\n\nSo from our team's perspective, when we played Green Bay, they scored 3 and7. Other opponents had higher scores, like Raiders (16), Eagles (21). So yes, those are lower than many others. But perhaps there was a game where another opponent scored fewer points?\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nWeek3: Packers -3\nWeek7: Rams -9\n\nSo 3 is the lowest, then 9.\n\nTherefore, in our games, Green Bay was the team that scored the fewest against us (3). So if the statement is \"the fewest points were scored against the Green Bay Packers,\" it's TRUE because they only scored 3 and7 against us, which are lower than other opponents' scores.\n\nWait but perhaps the user meant whether the Packers allowed the fewest points in their own games. That would require a different table\u2014their schedule.\n\nBut given that we have our team's schedule, I think the intended interpretation is that when we played Green Bay, they scored fewer points compared to other teams we played against.\n\nTherefore, based on this data, the statement is TRUE because against Green Bay, we allowed only 3 and7 points, which are lower than scores from Raiders (16), Bears(13), Eagles(21), etc.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"the fewest points were scored against the Green Bay Packers\" is TRUE based on the provided data. In our team's games against the Packers, they scored 3 and 7 points, which are lower than the points scored by other opponents we faced.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is TRUE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the earliest date be november 4  , 1973\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that November 4, 1973, is the earliest (or first) date in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row has a 'week' number and corresponding 'date'. The weeks go from week 1 to week 14. Week 1 is on September 16, 1973, which is clearly earlier than November 4, 1973. So, if the claim is saying that November 4 is the earliest date, that would be incorrect because there are dates in earlier weeks.\n\nTo verify this, I should check all the dates in the table to find the earliest one. Starting from week 1:\n\n- Week 1: September 16, 1973\n- Week 2: September 23, 1973\n- Week 3: September 30, 1973\n- Week 4: October 7, 1973\n- Week 5: October 14, 1973\n- Week 6: October 21, 1973\n- Week 7: October 28, 1973\n- Week 8: November 4, 1973\n\nSo the earliest date is actually September 16, 1973, which is in week 1. Therefore, the claim that November 4 is the earliest date must be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. The claim refers to dates, so I'll look at each 'date' column entry across all rows. Each row's 'date' needs to be checked against the claim.\n\nRelevant cells would include every row under the 'date' column since checking them shows that earlier dates exist before November 4. This means the earliest date is not November 4, so the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe earliest date in the table is September 16, 1973, which is earlier than November 4, 1973. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the smallest attendance be 56438\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the smallest attendance in the given data is 56,438. To verify this, I'll have to look at all the attendance numbers in the table and check if 56,438 is indeed the smallest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an \"attendance\" column which shows the number of people who attended each game. Let's list out these attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 44,818\n- Week 2: 52,035\n- Week 3: 48,176\n- Week 4: 49,549\n- Week 5: 56,438\n- Week 6: 47,478\n- Week 7: 47,787\n- Week 8: 46,722\n- Week 9: 47,911\n- Week 10: 56,519\n- Week 11: 46,430\n- Week 12: 57,859\n- Week 13: 53,830\n- Week 14: 70,041\n\nNow, I'll go through each of these numbers to find the smallest one. Starting from the top:\n\nWeek 1 has 44,818 which is pretty low. Then Week 2 with 52,035 is higher than that. Week 3 drops again to 48,176, which is lower than Week 2 but still higher than Week 1's attendance.\n\nMoving on, Week 4 has 49,549 \u2013 also higher than Week 1. Then in Week 5, it jumps up to 56,438. So that's higher than the previous numbers except for some later weeks.\n\nLooking further down, Week 6 is 47,478 which is lower than Week 5 but not as low as Week 1. Weeks 7 and 8 have attendances of 47,787 and 46,722 respectively \u2013 both are higher than Week 1's number.\n\nWeek 9 has 47,911, still higher than Week 1. Then Week 10 shows 56,519, which is again higher than Week 5 but not relevant for the smallest. \n\nWeeks 11 through 14 have attendances ranging from 46,430 to 70,041. The lowest in this range is 46,430 (Week 11), which is lower than 56,438.\n\nWait a minute, so Week 11 has an attendance of 46,430, which is smaller than the 56,438 mentioned in the claim. That means 56,438 isn't actually the smallest; there's a week with even lower attendance.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the smallest attendance be 56438\" is FALSE because there are weeks where the attendance was less than that number.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the smallest attendance is 56,438. However, examining all the attendances in the table reveals that Week 11 had an even lower attendance of 46,430. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the largest attendance be on september 16, 1973\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that the highest number of attendees occurred on September 16, 1973. To verify this, I should look at the attendance numbers for each date in the table and see if September 16 has the largest figure.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: week, date, opponent, result, venue, and attendance. The relevant column here is \"attendance,\" which shows how many people attended each game on those dates.\n\nLet me go through each row to check the attendance:\n\n- Week 1: September 16, 1973, Attendance: 44,818\n- Week 2: September 23, 1973, Attendance: 52,035 \u2192 This is higher than week 1.\n- Week 3: September 30, 1973, Attendance: 48,176\n- Week 4: October 7, 1973, Attendance: 49,549\n- Week 5: October 14, 1973, Attendance: 56,438 \u2192 Even higher.\n- Week 6: October 21, 1973, Attendance: 47,478\n- Week 7: October 28, 1973, Attendance: 47,787\n- Week 8: November 4, 1973, Attendance: 46,722\n- Week 9: November 11, 1973, Attendance: 47,911\n- Week 10: November 19, 1973, Attendance: 56,519 \u2192 Also higher than week 1.\n- Week 11: November 25, 1973, Attendance: 46,430\n- Week 12: December 2, 1973, Attendance: 57,859 \u2192 The highest so far.\n- Week 13: December 8, 1973, Attendance: 53,830\n- Week 14: December 16, 1973, Attendance: 70,041 \u2192 This is the highest attendance in the entire table.\n\nSo, looking at all the attendances, the largest number is 70,041 on December 16, 1973. The claim mentions September 16 with an attendance of 44,818, which isn't the maximum. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll quickly recap: The highest attendance was in week 14 on December 16, not on September 16. So, the claim that the largest attendance was on September 16 is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the highest attendance occurred on a different date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_13\", \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to adjust the row indices correctly. The table has rows starting from week 1 as index 0 up to week 14 as index 13. The highest attendance is in week 14 (index 13). So the correct JSON should list the relevant cells for September 16 and December 16.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut since the answer is FALSE, I need to ensure that all attendances are considered. So perhaps list all attendance cells:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut that's too lengthy. Alternatively, just include the maximum cell.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nThis shows that the attendance on September 16 (44,818) is less than the maximum on December 16 (70,041).",
