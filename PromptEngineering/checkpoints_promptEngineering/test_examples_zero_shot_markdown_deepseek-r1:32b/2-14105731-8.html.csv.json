    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the format of season 6 be q145\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.\n\nFirst, the claim is about the format associated with season 6. The table has several columns: episode, season, format, title, and original airdate. So I need to look at the rows where the season is 6 and check the corresponding 'format' value.\n\nLooking through the table, each row represents an episode with its respective details. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Episode 217: Season 1, format h75\n- Episode 218: Season 2, format h76\n- Episode 219: Season 3, format q143\n- Episode 220: Season 4, format q144\n- Episode 221: Season 5, format h77\n- Episode 222: Season 6, format q145\n- Episode 223: Season 7, format q146\n- ... and so on.\n\nSo, I see that for season 6 (row index 5), the format is indeed listed as 'q145'. That seems to directly support the claim. \n\nI should also check if there are any other rows in season 6 just to make sure, but looking at the table, each row has a unique episode number and only one entry for season 6 with format q145. Therefore, it's consistent.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because the format for season 6 in the table is 'q145'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"season 6.0 have q245 as its format\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that for season number 6, the format is q245. So, I should look through the table to see if there's any entry where the season is 6 and the format is q245.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: episode, season, format, title, original airdate. The rows are indexed from 0 to 16 (since it's zero-based indexing).\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Season 1, format h75 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Row 1: Season 2, format h76 \u2192 No match.\n- Row 2: Season 3, format q143 \u2192 No.\n- Row 3: Season 4, format q144 \u2192 Still not matching.\n- Row 4: Season 5, format h77 \u2192 Nope.\n- Row 5: Season 6, format q145 \u2192 Oh, season 6 is here but the format is q145, not q245. So this doesn't match.\n  \nContinuing further:\n\n- Row 6: Season 7, format q146 \u2192 Not relevant.\n- Rows beyond that are for seasons 8 to 16, none of which have season 6.\n\nSo, in the entire table, I only find one entry for season 6 (row index 5), and its format is q145. There's no row where season is 6 with a format of q245.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any data in the table. The correct answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells: I need to point out the cell(s) that were checked. Since only row 5 had season 6, the relevant cells are row 5's 'season' and 'format' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"format\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"223 be the only episode number with q147 format\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The relevant columns for this claim are \"episode\", which lists the episode numbers, and \"format\", which shows the formats associated with each episode.\n\nThe claim states that episode number 223 is the only one with the format q147. So, my task is to check all rows in the table to see how many times the format q147 appears and whether it corresponds exclusively to episode 223.\n\nLooking at the \"episode\" column:\n\n- Episode numbers start from 217 up to 232.\n  \nNow, I'll scan through each row's \"format\" to find all instances of q147.\n\nRow by row analysis:\n1. Row 0: Episode 217, Format h75 \u2192 Not q147\n2. Row 1: Episode 218, Format h76 \u2192 Not q147\n3. Row 2: Episode 219, Format q143 \u2192 Close but not q147\n4. Row 3: Episode 220, Format q144 \u2192 No\n5. Row 4: Episode 221, Format h77 \u2192 No\n6. Row 5: Episode 222, Format q145 \u2192 No\n7. Row 6: Episode 223, Format q146 \u2192 Wait, no, actually looking again... Oh wait, row 6 has episode 223 with format q146? Or did I miscount?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check the rows to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Row 0: Episode 217 (Season 1) \u2192 Format h75\n- Row 1: Episode 218 (Season 2) \u2192 Format h76\n- Row 2: Episode 219 (Season 3) \u2192 Format q143\n- Row 3: Episode 220 (Season 4) \u2192 Format q144\n- Row 4: Episode 221 (Season 5) \u2192 Format h77\n- Row 5: Episode 222 (Season 6) \u2192 Format q145\n- Row 6: Episode 223 (Season 7) \u2192 Format q146\n- Row 7: Episode 224 (Season 8) \u2192 Format h78\n- Row 8: Episode 225 (Season 9) \u2192 Format q147\n- Row 9: Episode 226 (Season 10) \u2192 Format h79\n- Row 10: Episode 227 (Season 11) \u2192 Format h80\n- Row 11: Episode 228 (Season 12) \u2192 Format q148\n- Row 12: Episode 229 (Season 13) \u2192 Format q149\n- Row 13: Episode 230 (Season 14) \u2192 Format q150\n- Row 14: Episode 231 (Season 15) \u2192 Format h81\n- Row 15: Episode 232 (Season 16) \u2192 Format h82\n\nWait, now I see that the claim mentions \"q147\" format. Looking through each row's format:\n\n- Only in row 8 is the format q147. So, episode number 225 has format q147.\n\nBut the claim says that episode 223 is the only one with q147. However, from the table, it's episode 225 (row 8) that has q147, not 223. Episode 223 in row 6 has format q146.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n- The format q147 appears only once, but it's for episode 225, not 223.\n- Additionally, no other episode besides 225 has the q147 format, so there are zero instances of q147 in episode 223.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE because episode 223 does not have the q147 format; instead, it's q146. Moreover, episode 225 is the one with q147.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that episode number 223 is the only one with the q147 format. Upon reviewing the table:\n\n- Episode 223 (row index 6) has a format of q146.\n- The format q147 appears in episode 225 (row index 8).\n\nSince neither does episode 223 have the q147 format nor is it unique to any other episode, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"episode_number\": 223,\n  \"format\": \"q146\",\n  \"is_unique_q147\": false\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is FALSE.",
