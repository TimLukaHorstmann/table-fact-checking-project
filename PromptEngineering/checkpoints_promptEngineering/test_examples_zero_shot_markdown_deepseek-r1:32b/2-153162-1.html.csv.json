    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"All of the subsidiary and associate of Malaysia Airlines be incorporated in Malaysia, except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which be incorporate in India.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the table represents. The columns are 'company', 'type', 'principal activities', 'incorporated in', and 'group's equity shareholding'. \n\nThe claim is about the incorporation locations of all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines. So, I should look at each row where the type is either \"subsidiary\" or \"associate\" and check their 'incorporated in' country.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The first company, malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd, is a subsidiary incorporated in Malaysia.\n2. ge engine services malaysia is a joint venture (which isn't a subsidiary or associate), so I can ignore this for now.\n3. maswings sdn bhd is a subsidiary in Malaysia.\n4. firefly sdn bhd is also a subsidiary in Malaysia.\n5. mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd, another subsidiary, incorporated in Malaysia.\n6. mas golden holidays sdn bhd: same here, a subsidiary in Malaysia.\n7. malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd: subsidiary in Malaysia.\n8. mas academy sdn bhd: subsidiary in Malaysia.\n9. abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd: another subsidiary in Malaysia with 80% shareholding.\n10. taj madras air catering limited is an associate, and it's incorporated in India. This matches the exception mentioned in the claim.\n11. mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd is a subsidiary in Malaysia.\n12. lsg sky chefs is an associate, but it's incorporated in Malaysia as well.\n\nSo, all subsidiaries are indeed in Malaysia except for taj madras air catering limited, which is in India. The associates other than that one are also in Malaysia. Therefore, the claim holds true because only Taj Madras is the exception.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have 100% equity in 7 of their 9 different subsidiary\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the table contains. It lists various companies, their type (subsidiary, joint venture, associate), principal activities, incorporation location, and group's equity shareholding.\n\nThe claim mentions that Malaysia Airlines has a 100% equity in 7 of their 9 subsidiaries. So, I need to verify two things: how many of the listed entities are subsidiaries, and out of those, how many have a 100% equity share.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRows:\n0: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n1: ge engine services malaysia - joint venture, 30%\n2: maswings sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n3: firefly sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n4: mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n5: mas golden holidays sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n6: malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n7: mas academy sdn bhd - subsidiary, 100%\n8: abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary, 80%\n9: taj madras air catering limited - associate, 20% \n10: mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - subsidiary, 60%\n11: lsg sky chefs - associate, 30%\n\nSo, first, identify all the subsidiaries. Let's list them:\n\nRow 0: subsidiary\nRow 2: subsidiary\nRow 3: subsidiary\nRow 4: subsidiary\nRow 5: subsidiary\nRow 6: subsidiary\nRow 7: subsidiary\nRow 8: subsidiary (but 80%)\nRow 10: subsidiary\n\nSo total subsidiaries are rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10. That's 9 subsidiaries.\n\nNow, how many of these have 100% equity? Let's check each:\n\n- Row 0: 100%\n- Row 2: 100%\n- Row 3: 100%\n- Row 4: 100%\n- Row 5: 100%\n- Row 6: 100%\n- Row 7: 100%\n- Row 8: 80% \u2192 not 100%\n- Row 10: 60% \u2192 not 100%\n\nSo, out of these 9 subsidiaries, rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7 have 100%, that's 7 subsidiaries. Rows 8 and 10 don't.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Malaysia Airlines has 100% equity in 7 out of their 9 subsidiaries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"Malaysia Airline works with 2 different companies for catering: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) SDN BHD.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of this statement against the table. Let's break it down.\n\nThe subject is Malaysia Airlines, which might not be directly listed in the table but perhaps as a parent company or group since many subsidiaries are listed under 'Malaysia' incorporation. The claim mentions two specific companies related to catering: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) SDN BHD.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if these companies are present.\n\n1. **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited**: Scanning the 'company' column, yes, it's listed in the 9th row. The type is 'associate', principal activities are catering, incorporated in India, and group's equity shareholding is 20%. So, this company is involved in catering.\n\n2. **MAS Cater (Sarawak) SDN BHD**: This company appears in the 10th row. It's a subsidiary with principal activities in catering, incorporated in Malaysia, and has an equity shareholding of 60%.\n\nNow, checking if both these companies are under\u9a6c\u6765\u897f\u4e9a\u822a\u7a7a\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u8303\u7574\u3002\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\uff0cTaj Madras\u662fassociate\uff0c\u800cMAS Cater\u662fsubsidiary\uff0c\u90fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\nThe claim mentions that Malaysia Airlines works with two different companies for catering. From the table, we can confirm that both Taj Madras and MAS Cater are involved in catering services under Malaysia's incorporation, but Taj is incorporated in India. \n\nSo, does this mean they work together? The table shows equity shareholdings, which suggests that Malaysia Airlines (or its group) holds shares in these companies. Since both are listed as either associate or subsidiary with equity shareholding, it implies a business relationship.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems to hold true because both companies are involved in catering services and are associated with Malaysia's group through shareholding.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table entries for both Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and MAS Cater (Sarawak) SDN BHD, confirming Malaysia Airlines' association with two different catering companies.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"company\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"company\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"malaysia airline have 30% equity shareholding in both lsg sky chef and ge engine service malaysia , which both be not subsidiary.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. Malaysia Airlines has a 30% equity shareholding in both LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Services Malaysia.\n2. Neither of these companies is a subsidiary.\n\nI'll start by checking each company mentioned in the claim: LSG Sky Chef and GE Engine Services Malaysia.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find rows where \"company\" matches either of these names.\n\n1. **GE Engine Services Malaysia**:\n   - Found in row 1.\n   - The equity shareholding is listed as 30% under \"group's equity shareholding.\"\n   - The type is \"joint venture,\" which means it's not a subsidiary since subsidiaries typically have majority ownership (usually 50% or more).\n\n2. **LSG Sky Chefs**:\n   - Found in row 10.\n   - The equity shareholding is listed as 30% under \"group's equity shareholding.\"\n   - The type is \"associate,\" which indicates a minority stake and not a subsidiary.\n\nSo, both companies have exactly 30% equity shareholding by Malaysia Airlines.

The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"All of the subsidiary and associate of Malaysia Airlines be incorporate in India except Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, which be not from India.\" Hmm, that's a bit of broken English, but I think it means all subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in India except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. The relevant columns here are \"type\" (to identify if they're subsidiaries or associates) and \"incorporated in\" (to check their country of incorporation).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Malaysia Airlines Cargo SDN BHD** - Type: Subsidiary, Incorporated in: Malaysia. So, this is a subsidiary but not incorporated in India.\n2. **Ge Engine Services Malaysia** - Type: Joint Venture (so not subsidiary or associate), Incorporated in: Malaysia.\n3. **Maswings SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n4. **Firefly SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n5. **MAS Aerotechnologies SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n6. **MAS Golden Holidays SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n7. **Malaysian Aerospace Engineering SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n8. **MAS Academy SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n9. **Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n10. **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited** - Associate, Incorporated in India. Wait, the claim says this one is not from India, but according to the table, it's incorporated in India. That seems contradictory.\n11. **MAS Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD** - Subsidiary, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n12. **LSG Sky Chefs** - Associate, Incorporated in Malaysia.\n\nWait a second, let me check row 9 again: \"Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia)\" is incorporated in Malaysia with an 80% equity shareholding. So it's a subsidiary but not in India.\n\nLooking back at the claim, it says all subsidiaries and associates are incorporated in India except Taj Madras Air Catering. But according to the table:\n\n- All subsidiaries except Abacus Distribution Systems (which has 80% share) are 100% owned, but their incorporation is Malaysia.\n- The only associate incorporated in India is Taj Madras, which actually is incorporated there.\n\nWait no, the claim says that all subsidiary and associates are incorporated in India except Taj Madras. But looking at the table:\n\n- Subsidiaries:\n  - Most are incorporated in Malaysia (rows 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11)\n  \n- Associates:\n  - Taj Madras is in India\n  - LSG Sky Chefs is in Malaysia\n\nSo, according to the table, most subsidiaries and at least one associate (LSG) are incorporated in Malaysia. Only Taj Madras is in India.\n\nThe claim says that all except Taj Madras are in India, which contradicts because actually, only Taj Madras is in India, and others are in Malaysia.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all subsidiaries and associates of Malaysia Airlines are incorporated in India except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. However, upon examining the table:\n\n- Most companies listed as subsidiaries are incorporated in Malaysia.\n- The associate company, Taj Madras Air Catering Limited, is incorporated in India.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because only one associate is in India, and all others are in Malaysia. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"incorporated in\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user provided a table in markdown format and a claim about it. They want me to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"of all the subsidiary of malaysia airline malaysia airline have the lowest equity shareholding in ma catering (sarawak) sdn bhd\". Hmm, okay. So, it's saying that among all subsidiaries, Malaysia Airlines has the lowest equity share in MAS Catering (Sarawak) SDN BHD.\n\nWait, let me parse this carefully. The claim is about subsidiaries of \"malaysia airline\" and their equity shareholdings. It says that malaysia airline holds the lowest equity in MAS Catering Sarawak. So I need to check two things: first, which companies are subsidiaries of Malaysia Airlines? Second, what are their respective equity percentages?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The column \"type\" tells us whether each company is a subsidiary, joint venture, etc.\n2. For each row where type is 'subsidiary', we can note the company and its equity shareholding.\n\nSo let's list all subsidiaries first:\n\n- malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd: 100%\n- maswings sdn bhd: 100%\n- firefly sdn bhd: 100%\n- mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd: 100%\n- mas golden holidays sdn bhd: 100%\n- malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd: 100%\n- mas academy sdn bhd: 100%\n- abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd: 80%\n- mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd: 60%\n\nWait, but mas catering sarawak is a subsidiary with 60% equity. Are there any other subsidiaries with lower than 60%? Let's see.\n\nLooking at all the rows:\n\nRow indices 0 to 8 are subsidiaries except row 8 (abacus) which is also a subsidiary but with 80%, which is higher than 60%. Then, looking further down:\n\nRows 10: mas catering sarawak sdn bhd - that's a subsidiary with 60% equity. So among all subsidiaries, the equity percentages are mostly 100%, except for abacus (80%) and mas catering sarawak (60%).\n\nSo, is 60% the lowest? Let me check:\n\nSubsidiaries:\n- malaysia airlines cargo: 100%\n- maswings: 100%\n- firefly: 100%\n- mas aerotechnologies: 100%\n- mas golden holidays: 100%\n- aerospace engineering: 100%\n- academy: 100%\n- abacus: 80%\n- mas catering sarawak:60%\n\nYes, 60% is the lowest equity share among all subsidiaries. So the claim says that malaysia airline has the lowest in mas catering sarawak. But wait, does the table indicate who holds the shares? The 'group's equity shareholding' column shows the percentage of each company owned by the group (which I assume is Malaysia Airlines).\n\nSo yes, for mas catering sarawak sdn bhd, the group's share is 60%, which is lower than all other subsidiaries. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other subsidiaries with less than 60%. Looking again:\n\n- All other subsidiaries have either 100% or 80%. So yes, 60% is indeed the lowest.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all the equity shareholding percentages for subsidiaries. The claim specifically mentions mas catering sarawak, so that row (index 9) and the column 'group's equity shareholding'. Also, to confirm it's a subsidiary, we check its type in the same row.\n\nAdditionally, I need to ensure that among all subsidiaries, this is the lowest. So relevant cells would include all the equity percentages of subsidiaries. But for brevity, maybe just the ones with the lower percentages and the claim's specific one.\n\nWait, but according to instructions, I should list all relevant cells used to verify the claim. So for each subsidiary, we check their equity shareholding. That means rows 0-8 (subsidiaries except mas catering sarawak), row 9 (mas catering sarawak) and also the associate companies? Wait no, because the claim is about subsidiaries only.\n\nSo relevant cells are all 'group's equity shareholding' for each row where type is 'subsidiary'. So rows 0-8 (from malaysia airlines cargo to mas academy), abacus (row 8: index 8?), wait let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table, row indices start from 0.\n\nRows:\n0: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - subsidiary\n1: ge engine services malaysia - joint venture\n2: maswings sdn bhd - subsidiary\n3: firefly sdn bhd - subsidiary\n4: mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - subsidiary\n5: mas golden holidays sdn bhd - subsidiary\n6: malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - subsidiary\n7: mas academy sdn bhd - subsidiary\n8: abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - subsidiary\n9: taj madras air catering limited - associate\n10: mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - subsidiary\n11: lsg sky chefs - associate\n\nSo rows 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 are subsidiaries.\n\nFor each of these, we need to check the 'group's equity shareholding' column. So for row indices 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- For each subsidiary, their equity percentage: so in column \"group's equity shareholding\".\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all these rows and that column.\n\nBut the claim is about whether mas catering sarawak has the lowest. So we need to confirm that 60% is lower than all other subsidiaries' percentages.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE because 60% is indeed the lowest among all subsidiary equity shareholdings.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"malaysia airline have 100% equity in each of their subsidy , like taj madras air catering limit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that Malaysia Airlines owns 100% equity in each of their subsidiaries, using Taj Madras Air Catering Limited as an example. So, two main points to verify: \n1. Whether all subsidiaries listed in the table have 100% equity held by Malaysia Airlines.\n2. The specific case of Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and its equity share.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the relevant columns are \"company\", \"type\", and \"group's equity shareholding\". The rows list various companies with their respective types (subsidiary, joint venture, associate) and equity percentages.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Malaysia Airlines Cargo SDN BHD**: Type is subsidiary, equity 100%.\n2. **GE Engine Services Malaysia**: Joint venture, 30%. Not a subsidiary, so this isn't relevant for the claim about subsidiaries.\n3. **MASWings SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 100%.\n4. **Firefly SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 100%.\n5. ** MAS Aerotechnologies SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 100%.\n6. **MAS Golden Holidays SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 100%.\n7. **Malaysian Aerospace Engineering SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 100%.\n8. **MAS Academy SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 100%.\n9. **Abacus Distribution Systems (Malaysia) SDN BHD**: Subsidiary, 80%. Wait, this is only 80%, not 100%. This contradicts the claim that all subsidiaries have 100% equity.\n10. **Taj Madras Air Catering Limited**: Type is associate, equity 20%. The claim mentions this company as an example of a subsidiary with 100% equity, but in reality, it's an associate with only 20% ownership.\n\nSo, two issues here: Abacus Distribution Systems has less than 100%, and Taj Madras is not even a subsidiary. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n\nNext, I'll note down the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- For each subsidiary, the \"group's equity shareholding\" was examined. Specifically:\n  - Row 0 (Malaysia Airlines Cargo): 100%\n  - Row 2 (MASWings): 100%\n  - Row 3 (Firefly): 100%\n  - Row 4 (MAS Aerotechnologies): 100%\n  - Row 5 (MAS Golden Holidays): 100%\n  - Row 6 (Malaysian Aerospace Engineering): 100%\n  - Row 7 (MAS Academy): 100%\n  - Row 8 (Abacus Distribution Systems): 80% (contradiction)\n  \n- Additionally, the row for Taj Madras Air Catering (row 9) shows it's an associate with 20% equity, which is not a subsidiary and doesn't have full ownership.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because not all subsidiaries are 100%, and Taj Madras isn't even a subsidiary.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"malaysia airline work with all subsidiary for cater except taj madras air catering limit\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It says that Malaysia Airlines works with all their subsidiaries in the catering sector except for Taj Madras Air Catering Limited. So, I need to check which companies are classified as subsidiaries under the \"type\" column and involved in catering, then see if they're all except Taj Madras.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Identify rows where the type is 'subsidiary' and principal activities include 'catering'.\n   - mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd: subsidiary, catering, 60% equity.\n   - Other subsidiaries don't have 'catering' listed except for mas catering sarawak.\n\n2. Now check if there are other subsidiaries involved in catering besides Taj Madras. From the table:\n   - The only subsidiary with catering is mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd.\n   - Taj Madras Air Catering Limited is an associate, not a subsidiary.\n\nWait, the claim says they work with all subsidiaries except Taj Madras. But Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary; it's an associate. So does that mean Malaysia Airlines works with their only catering subsidiary (mas catering sarawak) and doesn't include Taj Madras because it's not a subsidiary? \n\nThe table shows mas catering sarawak is a 60% subsidiary, so it's a separate entity from Taj Madras, which is an associate in India. So the claim that they work with all subsidiaries except Taj Madras would be incorrect because Taj isn't a subsidiary\u2014they don't exclude a non-sub affiliate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood. The claim might mean that Malaysia Airlines works with all their own subsidiaries (which are 100% owned) except for one. But in the table, mas catering sarawak is a 60% subsidiary\u2014so perhaps it's not fully owned. Wait, but the equity shareholding for mas catering sarawak is 60%, so it's still a subsidiary as per type.\n\nWait no: looking at the 'group's equity shareholding' column:\n\n- For mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd, it's 60%. So Malaysia Airlines owns 60% of this subsidiary. \n\nBut regardless of ownership percentage, since its type is 'subsidiary', it counts as a subsidiary.\n\nNow, the claim says they work with all subsidiaries for catering except Taj Madras. But Taj Madras isn't a subsidiary; it's an associate in India. So Malaysia Airlines would be working with their own subsidiary (mas catering sarawak) and not Taj Madras because it's not their subsidiary. Thus, the claim is accurate.\n\nWait no\u2014maybe I got confused. The claim says \"work with all subsidiary for cater except taj madras\". Since taj madras isn't a subsidiary, they don't work with them as a subsidiary, which fits the claim.\n\nBut wait, looking again: in the table, mas catering sarawak is a 60% subsidiary, so it's part of their subsidiaries. Therefore, Malaysia Airlines works with this subsidiary for catering and does not work with Taj Madras because it's an associate elsewhere.\n\nHence, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"company\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"principal activities\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table lists various companies with their type, principal activities, incorporation details, and group's equity shareholding. Each row represents a different company.\n\nThe claim states that Malaysia Airlines has an equal equity share in each of its subsidiaries. So I should check the equity shareholding for each subsidiary to see if they are all 100%.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd: 100%\n- ge engine services malaysia: 30% (but this is a joint venture, not a subsidiary)\n- maswings sdn bhd: 100%\n- firefly sdn bhd: 100%\n- mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd: 100%\n- mas golden holidays sdn bhd: 100%\n- malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd: 100%\n- mas academy sdn bhd: 100%\n- abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd: 80% (subsidiary)\n- taj madras air catering limited: 20% associate, incorporated in India\n- mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd: 60% subsidiary\n- lsg sky chefs: 30% associate\n\nNow, focusing only on the subsidiaries:\n\nRow 0: malaysia airlines cargo sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 2: maswings sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 3: firefly sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 4: mas aerotechnologies sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 5: mas golden holidays sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 6: malaysian aerospace engineering sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 7: mas academy sdn bhd - 100%\nRow 8: abacus distribution systems (malaysia) sdn bhd - 80% (subsidiary)\nRow 10: mas catering (sarawak) sdn bhd - 60%\n\nWait, so not all subsidiaries have 100% equity. For example, row 8 has 80%, and row 10 has 60%. Therefore, the claim that Malaysia Airlines has equal equity in each subsidy is false because some subsidiaries don't have a 100% shareholding.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the ones showing different equity percentages for subsidiaries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says Malaysia Airlines has a 30% equity shareholding in none of their associates. So, we're looking for any row where the company type is 'associate' and check if Malaysia Airlines owns exactly 30% in those.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two associate companies: Taj Madras Air Catering Limited and LSG Sky Chefs. \n\nFor Taj Madras, the equity shareholding is 20%, which isn't 30%. For LSG Sky Chefs, it's also 30%. Wait, so the claim says they have 30% in none of the associates, but here LSG Sky Chefs shows a 30% share. That means the claim is incorrect because there is at least one associate with a 30% holding.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row indexes 10 and 11, specifically looking at 'group's equity shareholding' for both associates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"group 's equity shareholding\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
