    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if a specific claim about the given table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"5 - 4 (ot) be the score that have a location and attendance of montreal forum and the date after may 10.\" \n\nBreaking this down:\n- The score in question is \"5 - 4 (OT)\".\n- This game should be located at \"montreal forum\" with some attendance figure.\n- Additionally, it should occur on a date that comes after May 10.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to find any row that matches these criteria.\n\nLooking through each row:\n1. April 26: Score is 4-2, location Montreal Forum. Date is before May 10.\n2. April 28: Score 5-2, same location. Also before May 10.\n3. May 1: Score 1-2 at Boston Garden. Doesn't match the score or location.\n4. May 3: Score 3-4 at Boston Garden. Again, not matching.\n5. May 5: Score 5-1 at Montreal Forum. The date is before May 10, so it doesn't meet the 'date after May 10' condition.\n6. May 8: Score 2-5 at Boston Garden. Doesn't fit.\n7. May 10: Score 5-4 (OT) at Montreal Forum.\n\nWait a minute, May 10 is the date of the last game in the table. The claim states \"date after may 10,\" which would be any date later than May 10. Since the latest date in the table is May 10, there's no row with a date after that.\n\nAlso, checking if the score matches: The only row with 5-4 (OT) is on May 10 at Montreal Forum. But since May 10 isn't \"after\" May 10, this doesn't satisfy the claim's condition.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table that has a score of 5-4 (OT), location Montreal Forum, and a date after May 10. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
