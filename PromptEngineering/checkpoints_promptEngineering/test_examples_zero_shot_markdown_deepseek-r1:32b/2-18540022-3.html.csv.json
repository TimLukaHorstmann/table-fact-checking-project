    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the romaji title regatta~kimi to ita eien~ have the fewest episode of 9 in total.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions a specific romaji title, which is \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\". I should look for this title in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'romaji title' column, I see that \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" appears in row 7 (assuming rows are zero-indexed; actually, counting from 0, let's check: row indices start at 0. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: sapuri\nRow 1: fushin no toki...\nRow 2: kekkon dekinai otoko\nRow 3: dandori~dance\u2606drill~\nRow 4: dare yorimo mama wo ai su\nRow 5: hanayome wa yakudoshi!\nRow 6: taiyou no uta\nRow 7: regatta~kimi to ita eien~\nYes, row 7 is correct.\n\nNow, the claim says this title has \"the fewest episode of 9 in total.\" So I need to check two things: does this title have 9 episodes, and is that the fewest among all titles?\n\nLooking at row 7 under 'episodes', it's indeed 9. Now, are there any other shows with fewer than 9 episodes? Let's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: 11\nRow 1: 12\nRow 2: 12\nRow 3: 11\nRow 4: 11\nRow 5: 12\nRow 6: 10\nRow 7: 9\nRow 8: 9 (shimokita sundays)\nRow 9: 11\nRow 10: 10\n\nWait, row 8 is \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\" with 9 episodes as well. So both row 7 and row 8 have 9 episodes.\n\nTherefore, the claim that regatta has the fewest (i.e., it's unique in having the least) isn't accurate because another show also has 9 episodes. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are row 7 for the romaji title and its episode count, as well as any other rows with 9 episodes to confirm if it's the fewest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"romaji title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3! be the japanese title of hanayome wa yakudoshi!\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. The claim states that the Japanese title \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" corresponds to the romaji title \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\". I need to check if this mapping exists in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are two relevant columns: \"japanese title\" and \"romaji title\". Each row has entries for both. So, my task is to find a row where the \"japanese title\" matches \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" and the corresponding \"romaji title\" is \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\".\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: japanese title is \"\u30b5\u30d7\u30ea\", romaji is \"sapuri\". Doesn't match.\nRow 1: japanese title is \"\u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e\", romaji is \"fushin no toki ~woman wars~\". Not matching.\nRow 2: japanese title is \"\u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537\", romaji is \"kekkon dekinai otoko\". No match here either.\nRow 3: japanese title is \"\u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e\", romaji is \"dandori~dance\u2606drill~\". Not relevant.\nRow 4: japanese title is \"\u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059\", romaji is \"dare yorimo mama wo ai su\". Still not matching.\nRow 5: japanese title is \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\", romaji is \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\". This looks like the one we're looking for. The claim says that \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" is the Japanese title of \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\", and here in row 5, both match exactly.\nRow 6: japanese title is \"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\", romaji is \"taiyou no uta\". Not relevant.\nRows 7-10 don't have the matching titles either.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim is TRUE because in row 5, the Japanese title and romaji title match exactly what's stated in the claim. The relevant cells are the japanese title and romaji title columns for that specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!\" corresponds to \"hanayome wa yakudoshi!\".

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"when the average rating be 10.3%, the average episode be more than 10.0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that if a show has an average rating of exactly 10.3%, then the number of episodes for that show should be more than 10.0. So I'm looking for any rows in the table where the \"average ratings\" column is exactly 10.3%. For each such row, I need to check if the corresponding \"episodes\" value is greater than 10.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first row has an average rating of 14.2%, which doesn't match.\n2. The second row has 12.9%, no match.\n3. Third row: 17.1% \u2013 not a match.\n4. Fourth row: 8.9% \u2013 nope.\n5. Fifth row: 10.4% \u2013 close, but not exactly 10.3%.\n6. Sixth row: 12.0% \u2013 no match.\n7. Seventh row: 10.3% \u2013 this matches the condition. Now I check the episodes here. It has 10 episodes. The claim says it should be more than 10, but 10 is not greater than 10; it's equal.\n\nSo in the only row where average ratings are exactly 10.3%, the number of episodes is 10, which doesn't satisfy \"more than 10.0\". Therefore, the claim isn't supported by this data point. \n\nSince there's no other row with an average rating of 10.3%, and the only one that does have it doesn't meet the episode condition, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells: The seventh row has both the average rating (10.3%) and episodes (10), so I need to include both these columns for this row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"average ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim in question is: \"the romanji title regatta~kimi to ita eien~ have the highest episode at 20 in total.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It mentions the romaji title \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" and states that this show has the highest number of episodes, which is 20. So, my goal is to check two things: does the table contain a row with this romaji title, and if so, how many episodes does it have? Also, I need to confirm whether 20 is indeed the highest in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are several rows listed. The columns include Japanese title, Romaji title, TV station, Episodes, and Average Ratings. Each row corresponds to a different TV show with its details filled out.\n\nI'll start by searching for the romaji title mentioned in the claim: \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~.\" Scanning through each row's romaji title:\n\n- The first few rows are about Fuji TV shows, none of which match the given romaji.\n- Then I see a row with romaji title \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" in the 8th position (if counting starts at 0). Let me double-check: yes, that's row index 7. \n\nNow, checking the episodes for this show: according to the table, it has 9 episodes. The claim says 20 episodes, so that's a discrepancy right there.\n\nBut I shouldn't stop here. I need to make sure that 9 is indeed the highest number of episodes in the entire table. So, I'll go through each row and note down the episode counts:\n\n1. \u30b5\u30d7\u30ea: 11\n2. \u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e: 12\n3. \u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537: 12\n4. \u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e: 11\n5. \u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059: 11\n6. \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3!: 12\n7. \u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f: 10\n8. \u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e: 9\n9. \u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba: 9\n10. ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063!: 11\n11. \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc: 10\n\nThe highest number of episodes here is 12, which occurs for the shows \"\u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e\" and \"\u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537.\" So, not only does \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" have only 9 episodes, but even those aren't the highest in the table.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: the episode count is way lower than claimed (9 vs. 20), and it's not the highest as other shows have more episodes.\n\nSo, putting this together, the relevant cells to check are:\n\n- The romaji title \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" in row index 7 under column \"romaji title.\"\n- The corresponding episode count for that row, which is 9, found under the \"episodes\" column.\n\nSince both aspects of the claim don't hold true, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"romaji title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Are there any other shows that also have less than 11 episodes?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different TV show with details like Japanese title, romaji title, TV station, number of episodes, and average ratings.\n\nLet me go through each entry's episode count:\n\n- \u30b5\u30d7\u30ea (sapuri) has 11 episodes.\n- \u4e0d\u4fe1\u306e\u3068\u304d\uff5e\u30a6\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30fb\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e (fushin no toki ~woman wars~) has 12 episodes.\n- \u7d50\u5a5a\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u7537 (kekkon dekinai otoko) has 12 episodes.\n- \u30c0\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u3002\uff5edance\u2606drill\uff5e (dandori~dance\u2606drill~) has 11 episodes.\n- \u8ab0\u3088\u308a\u3082\u30de\u30de\u3092\u611b\u3059 (dare yorimo mama wo ai su) has 11 episodes.\n- \u82b1\u5ac1\u306f\u5384\u5e74\u30c3! (hanayome wa yakudoshi!) has 12 episodes.\n- \u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f (taiyou no uta) has 10 episodes.\n- \u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e (regatta~kimi to ita eien~) has 9 episodes.\n- \u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba (shimokita sundays) has 9 episodes.\n- ca\u3068\u304a\u547c\u3073\u3063! (ca to oyobbi!) has 11 episodes.\n- \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc (my\u2606boss my\u2606hero) has 10 episodes.\n\nNow, the claim is that \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" is the only title with less than 11 episodes. But looking at the table:\n\n- taiyou no uta and my\u2606boss my\u2606hero both have 10 episodes.\n- shimokita sundays also has 9 episodes, same as regatta.\n\nWait, so regatta has 9 episodes, which is less than 11. However, there are other shows with episode counts less than 11: taiyou no uta (10), my\u2606boss my\u2606hero (10), and shimokita sundays (9). \n\nTherefore, \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" is not the only title with fewer than 11 episodes. There are multiple shows that meet this criterion. So the claim isn't accurate because there are other titles that also have less than 11 episodes.\n\nTo verify, I'll list all relevant rows:\n\n- Row index 7: \"\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30bf\uff5e\u541b\u3068\u3044\u305f\u6c38\u9060\uff5e\" with 9 episodes.\n- Row index 6: \"\u30bf\u30a4\u30e8\u30a6\u306e\u3046\u305f\" with 10 episodes.\n- Row index 8: \"\u4e0b\u5317\u30b5\u30f3\u30c7\u30fc\u30ba\" with 9 episodes.\n- Row index 10: \"\u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30dc\u30b9 \u30de\u30a4\u2606\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\" with 10 episodes.\n\nThese all have episode counts below 11, which means the claim is FALSE because regatta isn't alone in having fewer than 11 episodes.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other shows. Scanning through again: No, those are the only ones with less than 11 episodes.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"regatta~kimi to ita eien~\" is the sole title with fewer than 11 episodes, but the table shows multiple entries (rows 6,7,8,10) each having episode counts below 11. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"episodes\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
