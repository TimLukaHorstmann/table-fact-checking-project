The claim says: \"the texas longhorns women's basketball table show game vs different team show score on different location.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Different Teams**: The table should have entries for Texas Longhorns (UT) against various opponents.\n2. **Scores in Different Locations**: For each opponent, there should be scores recorded at different locations such as Austin (home), the opponent's venue, and neutral sites.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n- The first column lists opponents like Baylor, Colorado, etc.\n- There are columns for \"austin\", \"opponent's venue\", and \"neutral site\" which indicate where the games were played.\n- Each of these location columns shows scores, e.g., \"ut 27 -5\" means Texas won 27-5 at Austin.\n\nChecking each opponent row:\n- For example, Baylor: Scores in Austin (UT 27-5), Opponent's venue (UT 22-13), Neutral site (UT 7-2). This shows different scores for different locations.\n- Similarly, Colorado has scores in Austin (6-1), Opponent's venue (6-2), and Neutral site (2-1).\n\nEach opponent row provides scores across all three locations. Therefore, the table does show games against different teams with scores in various locations.\n\nSince every relevant cell confirms that for each team, there are scores at Austin, the opponent's venue, and neutral sites, the claim is supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with baylor , iowa state , nebraska and oklahoma state.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what each part means. The claim mentions a current streak of 'l 2' for these four teams: Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State.

Under \"current streak\", it shows 'l 2'. So this matches the claim.\n\n2. **Iowa State**: Their row's current streak is also 'l 2'. This supports the claim.\n\n3. **Nebraska**: Checking Nebraska's row, the current streak is listed as 'l 2' again. That aligns with the claim.\n\n4. **Oklahoma State**: For Oklahoma State, the current streak is 'l 2' as well.

The format in this column seems to be [team abbreviation], [score]. For example, \"tied, 4-4\" would indicate a tie at the opponent's venue.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific ties:\n1. Against Kansas with a score of 4-4.\n2. Against Oklahoma with a score of 7-7.\n\nI'll check each row for these opponents to see if their \"opponent's venue\" column matches the claim.\n\nStarting with the row for Kansas (row index 3, assuming rows are zero-indexed):\n- The \"opponent's venue\" cell says \"tied, 4-4.\" This matches the first part of the claim about a 4-4 tie against Kansas. So this is correct.\n\nNext, looking at Oklahoma's row (row index 7):\n- The \"opponent's venue\" here is listed as \"tied, 7-7.\" This aligns with the second part of the claim about an Oklahoma game tied 7-7.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"in the last 10 meeting, the score be tie, 5 - 5 4 time and 2 time at ut, 8 - 2.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what each part of the claim is saying. It mentions two things about the last 10 meetings:\n\n1. The score was tied (5-5) four times.\n2. There were two instances where the score was 8-2 in favor of UT.\n\nNow, I need to check these against the table. Let me go through each row and look at the \"last 10 meetings\" column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different opponent (like Baylor, Colorado, etc.), and under \"last 10 meetings,\" it shows the outcome for those matchups.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Opponent: Baylor\n- Last 10 meetings: tied, 5-5\n\nSo that's one tie at 5-5. I'll note this as a relevant cell (row index 0).\n\nNext row is Colorado:\n- Last 10 meetings: ut, 8-2\n\nThis fits the second part of the claim. So that's two times for the 8-2 score in favor of UT.\n\nMoving on to Iowa State:\n- Last 10 meetings: tied, 5-5\n\nThat's another tie at 5-5 (row index 2).\n\nKansas has:\n- Last 10 meetings: ut, 7-3. Doesn't match either part.\n\nKansas State:\n- Last 10 meetings: ksu, 6-4. Not matching.\n\nMissouri:\n- Last 10 meetings: ut, 9-1. Doesn't fit.\n\nNebraska:\n- Last 10 meetings: ut, 8-2. That's another instance of the second part (row index 6).\n\nOklahoma:\n- Last 10 meetings: tied, 5-5. Another tie at 5-5 (row index 7). Now that's four ties.\n\nOklahoma State:\n- Last 10 meetings: ut, 7-3. Doesn't match.\n\nTexas A&M:\n- Last 10 meetings: tied, 5-5. That would be the fifth tie if we count all, but the claim says only four times. Hmm, maybe I need to recount.\n\nWait, let's list them again:\n\nBaylor: tied (row 0)\nIowa State: tied (row 2)\nOklahoma: tied (row 7)\nTexas A&M: tied (row 9)\n\nThat makes four ties at 5-5, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nFor the second part, looking for ut,8-2:\n\nColorado: ut,8-2 (row1)\nNebraska: ut,8-2 (row6)\n\nSo that's two instances, matching the claim.\n\nWait a minute, earlier I thought Texas A&M was another tie, but in row 9, it says \"tied,5-5\" under last 10 meetings. So that would make five ties, but the claim only mentions four times. Is there an error here?\n\nWait no, let me recount:\n\nBaylor: tied (row0) \u2013 count as one\nIowa State: tied (row2) \u2013 two\nOklahoma: tied (row7) \u2013 three\nTexas A&M: tied (row9) \u2013 four\n\nAh, okay, that's four ties. So the fifth row is not there; Texas A&M is row 9, which I included as the fourth tie.\n\nSo total of four ties at 5-5 and two instances where UT won 8-2.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the last 10 meetings, there were four instances of a tied score (5-5) and two instances where UT won with an 8-2 score. Checking each row under the \"last 10 meetings\" column:\n\n1. **Baylor**: Tied at 5-5.\n2. **Colorado**: UT wins 8-2.\n3. **Iowa State**: Tied at 5-5.\n4. **Oklahoma**: Tied at 5-5.\n5. **Nebraska**: UT wins 8-2.\n\nThis results in four ties and two wins for UT, matching the claim exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"ut  , 6  -  2 be the result on the game at austin  , texas v iowa state and kansa state\".\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems like the claim is stating that in games held at Austin (Texas), the results against Iowa State and Kansas State were both \"ut, 6-2\". \n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are:\n1. texas vs\n2. overall record\n3. austin\n4. opponent's venue\n5. neutral site\n6. last 5 meetings\n7. last 10 meetings\n8. current streak\n\nEach row corresponds to a different opponent, such as Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions two teams: Iowa State and Kansas State (I'll check if it's \"kansa state\" or perhaps a typo for \"kansas state\"). \n\nFor each of these opponents, I need to look at the \"austin\" column because the games are said to be held at Austin. The \"austin\" column in the table shows the results when Texas played these teams in Austin.\n\nLet's start with Iowa State (row index 2). Looking at the \"austin\" column for this row, it says \"ut , 6 - 2\". That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNext, let's check Kansas State. The opponent is listed as \"kansas state\" in row index 4. In the \"austin\" column for this row, the result is also \"ut , 6 - 2\". So that also matches the claim.\n\nSince both entries under the \"austin\" column for Iowa State and Kansas State are \"ut, 6-2\", the claim is supported by the table data. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells are those in the \"austin\" column for both the Iowa State (row 2) and Kansas State (row 4) rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"austin\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the current streak of l 2 be the score with only baylor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two main things: a \"current streak of l 2\" and that this streak is \"only\" associated with Baylor.\n\nLooking at the table, the columns include \"texas vs,\" which lists various teams like Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, etc. There's also a column named \"current streak.\" Each row under \"current streak\" shows either a team abbreviation followed by a number, or something like \"l 2,\" \"w 1,\" etc.\n\nSo the claim is saying that the current streak of \"l 2\" applies exclusively to Baylor. Let me check each row in the table to see where the current streak is \"l 2.\"\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. **Baylor**: The current streak is listed as \"l 2.\"\n2. **Colorado**: Current streak is \"w 1.\" So not l 2.\n3. **Iowa State**: Current streak is \"l 2.\"\n4. **Kansas**: Current streak is \"w 1.\" Not l 2.\n5. **Kansas State**: Current streak is \"l 1.\" Close, but not l 2.\n6. **Missouri**: Current streak is \"w 8.\" Definitely not l 2.\n7. **Nebraska**: Current streak is \"l 2.\"\n8. **Oklahoma**: Current streak is \"w 1.\" Not l 2.\n9. **Oklahoma State**: Current streak is \"l 2.\"\n10. **Texas A&M**: Current streak is \"l 3.\" Close, but not exactly l 2.\n11. **Texas Tech**: Current streak is \"w 2.\"\n\nWait a minute, so Baylor has \"l 2,\" but so do Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State. That means multiple teams have the same current streak of losing twice in a row.\n\nThe claim says that this streak (\"l 2\") is only for Baylor. But looking at the table, at least four teams (Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, Oklahoma State) have an \"l 2\" streak. Therefore, the claim isn't correct because it's not exclusive to Baylor; other teams also share this streak.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all rows where the current streak is \"l 2.\" That includes Baylor (row index 0), Iowa State (index 2), Nebraska (index 6), and Oklahoma State (index 8). Each of these entries in the \"current streak\" column is \"l 2,\" which contradicts the claim that it's only Baylor.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because multiple teams have the same current streak, not just Baylor.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only Baylor has a current streak of \"l 2.\" However, upon reviewing the table, I found that multiple teams including Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State all have an \"l 2\" streak. This means the claim is incorrect because it's not exclusive to Baylor.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"current streak\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim: \"the texas longhorns woman's basketball table show game vs only 1 team show score on different location.\" \n\nFirst, understanding what each part means. The claim suggests that in the Texas Longhorns women's basketball schedule, there is only one team against which they have games with scores at different locations.\n\nLooking at the table structure: Each row represents a team (like Baylor, Colorado, etc.), and columns include overall record, Austin, opponent's venue, neutral site, last 5 meetings, last 10 meetings, current streak. The \"Austin\" column seems to represent home games for Texas, while \"opponent's venue\" would be away games, and \"neutral site\" is neutral locations.\n\nThe claim mentions that there's only one team where the scores are shown at different locations. So I'm looking for a row where in both Austin (home) and either opponent's or neutral site columns, there are scores recorded. If such a row exists with multiple entries across these location-based columns, then it would mean they've played against that team on different sites.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Baylor: Home record is UT 27-5, Opponent's venue is UT 22-13, Neutral site is UT 7-2. So, games were played in all three locations against Baylor.\n- Colorado: All columns are under UT except \"opponent's venue\" where it's also UT. Wait, that seems odd. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the abbreviations. Let me clarify:\n   - The table uses abbreviations like UT (University of Texas), BU (Baylor University), etc., but in this case, for Colorado, all columns except \"neutral site\" are under UT. Neutral site is CU 2-1? Or wait, no\u2014looking at the data: under opponent's venue, it says ut, 6-2. So it seems that for each opponent, the \"Austin\" column shows how many times Texas has beaten them in Austin (home), and the opponent's venue shows Texas's record when playing at the opponent's site.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider whether a team has games listed in both Austin and other locations. For example, if a team appears only once with scores in different locations, that would indicate multiple game sites against that team.\n\nLooking for rows where in the \"Austin\", \"opponent's venue\", or \"neutral site\" columns there are entries beyond just one location. So any row where more than one of these columns has data (i.e., not all in Austin) suggests games were played at different venues.\n\nChecking each opponent:\n\n- Baylor: Austin, Opponent's, Neutral \u2014 multiple locations.\n- Colorado: All under UT except Opponent's. Wait, no\u2014opponent's venue for Colorado is ut 6-2? That doesn't make sense because it should be the opponent's record when at home. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps \"Austin\" is Texas's record in Austin against each team. So, if a team has both an Austin entry and another location entry (like Opponent's venue or Neutral), that means they've played multiple games across different sites.\n\nLooking for opponents where the Texas Longhorns have more than one location with scores.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Baylor: Has entries in Austin, opponent's, neutral. So multiple locations.\n- Colorado: In Austin, it's UT 6-1; Opponent's venue is UT 6-2 (wait, that doesn't make sense because if Texas plays at Colorado, the opponent's venue should be Colorado's home. Maybe the data represents Texas's record in each location.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row is an opponent. The columns show Texas's record against them in different locations. So \"Austin\" would be Texas's home games (UT wins/losses), \"Opponent's venue\" is when they played at the opponent's place, and \"Neutral site\" is neutral games.\n\nSo for each opponent, if there are multiple entries across these columns, that means Texas has played them in different locations. The claim states that only one such team exists where this is true.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Baylor: Austin (UT 27-5), Opponent's (UT 22-13), Neutral (UT 7-2). So multiple locations.\n- Colorado: Austin (UT 6-1), Opponent's (UT 6-2) \u2014 that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the data.\n\nWait, maybe \"opponent's venue\" is the opponent's record when at home against Texas? No, that doesn't fit because it says UT in those columns. Maybe the entire table is from Texas's perspective, so all entries are UT's records in each location against each opponent.\n\nIn that case, for each opponent:\n\n- If both Austin and Opponent's venue have data (e.g., non-zero games), then they've played multiple times across locations.\n\nLooking again:\n\nBaylor: Austin 27-5, Opponent's 22-13. So Texas has played Baylor at home and away.\nColorado: Austin 6-1, Opponent's 6-2. Similarly, multiple venues.\nSimilarly, checking other opponents:\n\nFor example, looking for teams where only one location is present.\n\nWait, if the claim says \"only one team shows score on different locations,\" but in reality, many teams have games across multiple locations (like Baylor and Colorado), then the claim would be FALSE because there's more than one such team.\n\nSo, since multiple opponents have entries in both Austin and opponent's venue columns, indicating multiple game sites, the claim that only one team has scores on different locations is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one team against which the Texas Longhorns women's basketball team has games at different locations.

The claim states: \"In the first 10 meeting, the score be tie, 5-5 four times and two times at UT, 8-2.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the table represents. Looking at the columns, there's \"last 5 meetings,\" \"last 10 meetings,\" etc. The claim is about the first 10 meetings, so the relevant column here would be \"last 10 meetings.\"\n\nNext, let me check the values in the \"last 10 meetings\" column for each row:\n\n1. Baylor: tied, 5-5\n2. Colorado: ut, 8-2 (I think this means University of Texas won 8-2)\n3. Iowa State: tied, 5-5\n4. Kansas: ut, 7-3\n5. Kansas State: ksu, 6-4 (KSU is Kansas State's abbreviation)\n6. Missouri: ut, 9-1\n7. Nebraska: ut, 8-2\n8. Oklahoma: tied, 5-5\n9. Oklahoma State: ut, 7-3\n10. Texas A&M: tied, 5-5\n11. Texas Tech: ttu, 6-4 (TTU is Texas Tech)\n\nWait, there are more than 10 teams listed here. The table includes rows for Baylor through Texas Tech, which is 11 entries. However, the claim refers to \"the first 10 meetings,\" so perhaps I should consider only the first 10 rows.\n\nLooking at the first 10 rows:\n\n- Row indices from 0 to 9 (since counting starts at 0). So rows 0 to 9 are Baylor, Colorado, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and Texas A&M.\n\nNow, checking each of these in the \"last 10 meetings\" column:\n\n- Baylor: tied, 5-5\n- Colorado: ut, 8-2\n- Iowa State: tied, 5-5\n- Kansas: ut, 7-3\n- Kansas State: ksu, 6-4\n- Missouri: ut, 9-1\n- Nebraska: ut, 8-2\n- Oklahoma: tied, 5-5\n- Oklahoma State: ut, 7-3\n- Texas A&M: tied, 5-5\n\nNow, count the number of times the score was \"tied, 5-5\" and \"ut, 8-2.\"\n\nLooking through these:\n\n\"Tied, 5-5\" occurs in Baylor (row 0), Iowa State (row 2), Oklahoma (row 7), and Texas A&M (row 9). That's four times, which matches the claim.\n\nNow for \"ut, 8-2\": Checking each row, I see Colorado (row1) has ut,8-2 and Nebraska (row6) also has ut,8-2. So that's two instances, which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"at opponent's venue, the score be tie on only 1 game, 4-4 against kansas.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim means. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Opponent's Venue**: This refers to games where Texas is playing at their opponents' venues.\n2. **Score Tie**: There should be a tie in the score during these games.\n3. **Only 1 Game**: The tie should occur only once in such games.\n4. **4-4 Against Kansas**: Specifically, this tied game was against Kansas with a score of 4-4.\n\nNow, I need to check each row in the table to see if there's any information that matches these conditions.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n- The relevant column is \"opponent 's venue.\"\n\nGoing through each opponent:\n\n1. **Baylor**: Opponent's venue record is ut, 22 - 13. No tie here.\n2. **Colorado**: Opponent's venue score is ut, 6 - 2. Not a tie.\n3. **Iowa State**: Their venue shows isu, 5 - 2. Again, no tie.\n4. **Kansas**: The opponent's venue record is tied, 4-4. This matches the claim of a tied game at 4-4 against Kansas.\n5. **Kansas State**: Opponent's venue score is ksu, 4 - 3. No tie here.\n6. **Missouri**: ut, 5 - 1. Not a tie.\n7. **Nebraska**: ut, 4 - 3. Still no tie.\n8. **Oklahoma**: Tied at 7-7 in opponent's venue. Wait, that's another tied game. But the claim says only one game was tied.\n9. **Oklahoma State**: ut, 7 - 4. No tie.\n10. **Texas A&M**: ut, 23 - 8. Not a tie.\n11. **Texas Tech**: ut, 17 - 13. Also not a tie.\n\nSo, I found two instances where the score was tied at opponent's venues: one against Kansas (4-4) and another against Oklahoma (7-7). This means that there are more than just one game with a tie at the opponent's venue, which contradicts the claim stating it's only 1 game.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are two tied games in opponent venues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent 's venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"ut  , 58  - 15 be the result on the game at austin  , texas v iowa state and kansa state.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems to mention that the score \"ut, 58-15\" is the result of a game in Austin between Texas versus Iowa State and Kansas State. Wait, actually, upon closer reading, it says \"texas v iowa state and kansa state.\" That might be a typo, perhaps meaning either one or the other? Or maybe the claim is that both games resulted in this score.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows, each representing a game between Texas (UT) and another team. The columns include \"overall record,\" \"austin,\" \"opponent's venue,\" etc. The row for Iowa State shows that in Austin, UT has a 6-2 record. Similarly, Kansas State's row under Austin shows UT with a 6-2 record as well.\n\nThe claim mentions the score \"58-15\" at Austin against these opponents. Let me check the \"Austin\" column for both Iowa State and Kansas State rows. For Iowa State (row index 2), the Austin column is \"ut, 6-2.\" Similarly, for Kansas State (row index 4), it's also \"ut, 6-2.\" There's no mention of a score like 58-15 in either of these entries.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other rows, Texas A&M has an Austin record of 28-4 and Texas Tech with 25-6. The highest score mentioned under Austin is 28 for Texas A&M. Nowhere in the table do I see a game where UT scored 58 against these teams in Austin.\n\nTherefore, since neither Iowa State nor Kansas State have an Austin record that includes a 58-15 result for UT, the claim doesn't hold true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"austin\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"austin\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
