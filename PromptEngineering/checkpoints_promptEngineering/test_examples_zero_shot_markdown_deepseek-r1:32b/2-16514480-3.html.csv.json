The claim states: \"greg norman and nick faldo be list on place 1 and 2 , respectively.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions two players, Greg Norman and Nick Faldo, and their respective places in the table. So I need to check if Greg Norman is in place 1 and Nick Faldo is in place 2.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The first two rows are:\n\nRow 0:\n- place: 1\n- player: greg norman\n\nRow 1:\n- place: 2\n- player: nick faldo\n\nSo Greg Norman is indeed in place 1, as per row index 0. Nick Faldo is in place 2, as per row index 1. \n\nTherefore, the claim is correct. Both players are listed correctly under their respective places.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n\n- For Greg Norman: Check the 'place' and 'player' columns in row 0.\n- For Nick Faldo: Check the 'place' and 'player' columns in row 1.\n\nBut since each cell in a row can be considered individually, I'll list each column that confirms their placement. So for Greg, it's place (row 0) being 1 and player (row 0) is Greg Norman.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Greg Norman is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says, \"Greg Norman be list to have be play for Australia, and have -12 stroke to par.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. It seems like there are two parts to the claim: \n1. Greg Norman plays for Australia.\n2. He has a score of -12 strokes to par.\n\nI'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it's a markdown table with columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. The rows list different players and their performance data.\n\nFor Greg Norman, he is listed in the first row (row index 0). Let me look at his details:\n- Player name: Greg Norman\n- Country: Australia\n- To par: -12\n\nSo, for the first part of the claim, it says Greg plays for Australia. Checking the \"country\" column for Greg Norman's row, it indeed says Australia. That matches.\n\nNext, checking the \"to par\" score for Greg Norman is -12. The table shows exactly that in his row under the \"to par\" column. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n\nI should also note which cells were checked to support this conclusion. For the country, it's the \"country\" column in row 0. For the to par score, it's the \"to par\" column in the same row.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because both pieces of information are accurately represented in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that Greg Norman plays for Australia and has a -12 score to par, as verified by the data in rows 0 under the respective columns. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me read through the problem again.\n\nThe claim is: \"david frost be the only player list who be play for south africa, while vijay singh be play for fiji.\" \n\nWait, the grammar here seems a bit off, but I think it's saying that David Frost is the only player from South Africa listed in the table, and Vijay Singh plays for Fiji. So two parts to this claim.\n\nFirst, let me check if David Frost is indeed the only South African player. Looking at the 'country' column:\n\nRow 2: david frost - south africa\nThen I'll go through each row:\n- Row 0: Australia\n- Row 1: England\n- Row 2: South Africa (David Frost)\n- Rows t3, t5, t7, etc., all seem to be from the United States except for Vijay Singh in Fiji and Ian Woosnam from Wales.\n\nSo yes, David Frost is the only player listed from South Africa. That part checks out.\n\nNext, checking if Vijay Singh plays for Fiji. Looking at row 8: vijay singh - fiji. So that's correct too.\n\nAre there any other players from Fiji? No, just Vijay Singh. So both parts of the claim are accurate based on the table.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells for each part. For David Frost being the only South African:\n\nRow 2 has 'david frost' and 'south africa' in columns 'player' and 'country'.\n\nFor Vijay Singh playing for Fiji:\n\nRow 8 has 'vijay singh' and 'fiji' under the same columns.\n\nSo relevant_cells will include row 2, columns player and country, and row 8, columns player and country.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about it. The task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"only 3 of the player list be play for the united state\". Hmm, there's a typo here\u2014it should probably say \"play\" instead of \"be play\", so I think the intended meaning is that only three players are from the United States. \n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective details. The relevant column here is \"country\" since we need to check how many players are from the United States.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Greg Norman** - Australia\n2. **Nick Faldo** - England\n3. **David Frost** - South Africa\n4. **Phil Mickelson** - United States (count 1)\n5. **Lee Janzen** - United States (count 2)\n6. **Bob Tway** - United States (count 3)\n7. **Scott Hoch** - United States (Wait, this would be count 4 if we include all US players)\n8. **Scott McCarron** - United States (count 5)\n9. **Vijay Singh** - Fiji\n10. **Corey Pavin** - United States (count 6)\n11. **Ian Woosnam** - Wales\n\nWait a second, I think I might have made a mistake here. The claim says \"only 3\" US players, but from my count, there are actually more than three. Let me recount:\n\n- Phil Mickelson: Yes\n- Lee Janzen: Yes\n- Bob Tway: Yes\n- Scott Hoch: Yes (that's four)\n- Scott McCarron: Yes (five)\n- Corey Pavin: Yes (six)\n\nSo that's six players from the United States, not three. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification. Specifically, each row where the country is \"united states\" would be relevant. So rows 4 through 9 (assuming indexing starts at 0) have players from the US. \n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3: Phil Mickelson\n- Row 4: Lee Janzen\n- Row 5: Bob Tway\n- Row 6: Scott Hoch\n- Row 7: Scott McCarron\n- Row 9: Corey Pavin\n\nWait, but actually, looking back at the table:\n\nThe rows are as follows (with row indices starting at 0):\n\nRow 0: Greg Norman - Australia\nRow 1: Nick Faldo - England\nRow 2: David Frost - South Africa\nRow 3: Phil Mickelson - United States\nRow 4: Lee Janzen - United States\nRow 5: Bob Tway - United States\nRow 6: Scott Hoch - United States\nRow 7: Scott McCarron - United States\nRow 8: Vijay Singh - Fiji\nRow 9: Corey Pavin - United States\nRow 10: Ian Woosnam - Wales\n\nSo the rows where country is \"united states\" are rows 3,4,5,6,7,9. That's six players, not three.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only three players are from the US is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only three players are from the United States.

The claim says: \"bob tway be the only player list who be play for england, while corey pavin be play for wale.\" Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to check each part of the claim against the table. Let's start with Bob Tway being the only player from England. Looking at the \"country\" column, I'll go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Greg Norman is from Australia.\n- Row 1: Nick Faldo is from England.\n- Row 2 and 3: David Frost and Phil Mickelson are from South Africa and the US respectively.\n- Rows 4 and 5: Lee Janzen and Bob Tway are both from the United States. Wait, so Bob Tway isn't from England? That's different from what the claim says.\n\nSo already, I can see that Bob Tway is listed as being from the US, not England. The claim incorrectly states he's from England and the only one there. Also, Nick Faldo is actually the player from England in the table.\n\nNext part: Corey Pavin playing for Wales. Let me look at the \"country\" column again:\n\n- Rows 9 and 10: Corey Pavin is listed as from the United States, while Ian Woosnam is from Wales. So Corey isn't from Wales; it's Ian who is.\n\nPutting this together, both parts of the claim are incorrect. Bob Tway isn't from England, and Corey Pavin isn't from Wales either.

Checking the table:\n\n- Bob Tway is listed as playing for the United States (row 5).\n- Corey Pavin is also listed as playing for the United States (row 9), while Ian Woosnam is from Wales.\n\nThus, both statements in the claim are incorrect, making it FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

According to the claim, David Frost should be in 1st place, and Scott McCarron in 2nd place.\n\nI'll check each player's position in the table:\n\n- For David Frost: I scan through the 'place' column looking for his name.

The claim says: \"ian woosnam be the only player list who be play for south africa, while lee janzen be play for fiji.\" Hmm, that's a bit awkwardly phrased, but I'll take it as meaning Ian Woosnam is the only South African player, and Lee Janzen plays for Fiji.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the table. Let me go row by row. \n\nLooking at the \"player\" and \"country\" columns:\n\n1. Greg Norman from Australia.\n2. Nick Faldo from England.\n3. David Frost from South Africa.\n4. Phil Mickelson from United States.\n5. Lee Janzen from United States. Wait, here's Lee Janzen listed as from the US, not Fiji. So that part of the claim is wrong.\n\n6. Bob Tway from the US.\n7. Scott Hoch from the US.\n8. Scott McCarron from the US.\n9. Vijay Singh from Fiji. Oh, he's from Fiji, but the claim says Lee Janzen is from Fiji, which isn't correct.\n\n10. Corey Pavin from the US.\n11. Ian Woosnam from Wales. So here's Ian Woosnam listed as playing for Wales, not South Africa. The claim said he's the only one from South Africa, but actually David Frost is from South Africa.\n\nWait, let me check again: \n\nLooking at the \"country\" column:\n\n- Greg Norman: Australia\n- Nick Faldo: England\n- David Frost: South Africa\n- Phil Mickelson: US\n- Lee Janzen: US (so he's not from Fiji)\n- Bob Tway: US\n- Scott Hoch: US\n- Scott McCarron: US\n- Vijay Singh: Fiji\n- Corey Pavin: US\n- Ian Woosnam: Wales\n\nSo, according to the table:\n\n- David Frost is the only player from South Africa.\n- Lee Janzen is from the US, not Fiji.\n- Ian Woosnam is from Wales.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts that are incorrect. First, Ian Woosnam isn't playing for South Africa; he's from Wales. Second, Lee Janzen isn't from Fiji; he's from the US. So both parts of the claim are false. Therefore, the entire statement should be evaluated as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows David Frost as the only player from South Africa and Ian Woosnam representing Wales. Lee Janzen is listed as from the United States, not Fiji.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
