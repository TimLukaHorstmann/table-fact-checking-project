    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 12 driver that complete 46 lap, while only 11 driver complete 45 lap\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the structure of the table. It has columns for name, team, laps, grid, and points. The claim specifically mentions the number of drivers who completed 46 laps and those who completed 45 laps. So, my focus will be on the \"laps\" column to count these occurrences.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table:\n\n1. Lee Holdsworth: 46 laps\n2. Garth Tander: 46 laps\n3. Russell Ingall: 46 laps\n4. Jamie Whincup: 46 laps\n5. Steven Richards: 46 laps\n6. Jason Richards: 46 laps\n7. Andrew Jones: 46 laps\n8. Steve Owen: 46 laps\n9. Max Wilson: 46 laps\n10. Paul Dumbrell: 46 laps\n11. Todd Kelly: 46 laps\n12. Steven Johnson: 46 laps\n\nThat's 12 drivers with 46 laps each, which matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, I'll check for drivers who completed 45 laps:\n\n13. Jason Bargwanna: 45 laps\n14. Craig Lowndes: 45 laps\n15. Rick Kelly: 45 laps\n16. Will Davison: 45 laps\n17. Simon Wills: 45 laps\n18. Jack Perkins: 45 laps\n19. John Bowe: 45 laps\n20. Shane Price: 45 laps\n21. Paul Morris: 45 laps\n22. Greg Murphy: 45 laps\n23. Shane van Gisbergen: 45 laps\n\nThat's 11 drivers with 45 laps each, which aligns with the second part of the claim.\n\nI should also verify that there are no other entries beyond these in the table to ensure accuracy. Scanning further, I see Mark Winterbottom and Cameron McConville have 43 laps, Fabian Coulthard has 34, Mark Skaife has 31, Alan Gurr has 29, Dean Canto has 27, Jason Bright has 22, and James Courtney has 17 laps. These don't affect the counts for 45 or 46 laps.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the most lap that any driver complete during the race be 46.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for name, team, laps, grid, and points. The relevant column here is \"laps\" because it tells me how many laps each driver completed.\n\nI'll scan through the \"laps\" column to find the maximum number. Starting from the top:\n\n- Lee Holdsworth: 46\n- Garth Tander: 46\n- Russell Ingall: 46\n- Jamie Whincup: 46\n- Steven Richards: 46\n- Jason Richards: 46\n- Andrew Jones: 46\n- Steve Owen: 46\n- Max Wilson: 46\n- Paul Dumbrell: 46\n- Todd Kelly: 46\n- Steven Johnson: 46\n- Jason Bargwanna: 45\n- Craig Lowndes: 45\n- Rick Kelly: 45\n- Will Davison: 45\n- Simon Wills: 45\n- Jack Perkins: 45\n- John Bowe: 45\n- Shane Price: 45\n- Paul Morris: 45\n- Greg Murphy: 45\n- Shane Van Gisbergen: 45\n- Mark Winterbottom: 43\n- Cameron McConville: 43\n- Fabian Coulthard: 34\n- Mark Skaife: 31\n- Alan Gurr: 29\n- Dean Canto: 27\n- Jason Bright: 22\n- James Courtney: 17\n\nLooking through these numbers, the highest value is 46. Multiple drivers have this number of laps, such as Lee Holdsworth, Garth Tander, and others.\n\nSo, the claim says that the most laps any driver completed was 46. Since there are multiple entries with exactly 46 laps and no higher numbers in the \"laps\" column, the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells for this determination are all the rows where the 'laps' value is 46.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"garth tander completed 24 more laps than jason bright during the race\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to locate both Garth Tander and Jason Bright in the table. Scanning through the names, I see Garth Tander listed in one row and Jason Bright in another. \n\nNext, I'll check their respective laps. For Garth Tander, under the 'laps' column, it's 46. For Jason Bright, also looking at the 'laps' column, his number is 22.\n\nNow, the claim says Garth completed 24 more laps than Jason. So let me calculate the difference: 46 (Garth) minus 22 (Jason) equals 24 laps. That seems to match exactly what the claim states.\n\nTherefore, based on these numbers, the claim appears to be true. I should make sure there's no confusion with other columns or rows. Both their names are clearly in separate rows, so there's no overlap or mix-up here. \n\nJust to double-check, I'll look at their grid positions and points too, but since the claim only pertains to laps, those other details aren't necessary for this particular verification.\n\nSo, everything lines up correctly. Garth Tander did indeed complete 24 more laps than Jason Bright.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying: it states that there are two drivers from the Holden Racing Team participating in the race.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the 'team' column to find all entries that match \"holden racing team\". Scanning each row:\n\n- Row 0: Garry Rogers Motorsport\n- Row 1: Toll HSV Dealer Team\n- Row 2: Stone Brothers Racing\n- Row 3: Teamvodafone\n- Row 4: Ford Performance Racing\n- Row 5: Tasman Motorsport\n- Row 6: Team Boc\n- Row 7: Autobarn Racing\n- Row 8: WPS Racing\n- Row 9: Supercheap Auto Racing\n- Row 10: Holden Racing Team \u2192 This is a match.\n- Row 11: Jim Beam Racing\n- Row 12: WPS Racing\n- Row 13: Paul Cruickshank Racing\n- Row 14: Jack Daniel's Racing\n- Row 15: Team Kiwi Racing\n- Row 16: Ford Performance Racing\n- Row 17: Supercheap Auto Racing\n- Row 18: Tasman Motorsport\n- Row 19: Team Sirromet Wines\n- Row 20: Hold on, I already saw Holden Racing Team at row 10. Let me check the rest to see if there's another one.\n- Rows 21 onwards don't show \"holden racing team\" again.\n\nWait a minute, only Todd Kelly is from the Holden Racing Team as per row 10. There doesn't seem to be a second driver from that team in the table. So the claim says two drivers, but I can only find one.\n\nI should also check if any other rows might have \"holden racing team\" spelled differently or in another form. Looking through all the teams again, it's consistently \"holden racing team\" for row 10 and no others. \n\nSo, since there's only one driver from Holden Racing Team (Todd Kelly), the claim is FALSE because it mentions two drivers when only one exists in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are two drivers competing for the Holden Racing Team. Upon reviewing the table, only Todd Kelly is listed under \"holden racing team\" at row 10. No other entries match this team name.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 9 driver that complete 46 lap and 11 driver that complete 45 lap.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse what this means. It's saying there are 9 drivers who finished exactly 46 laps, and 11 drivers who finished exactly 45 laps. My task is to verify these numbers against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a driver with details like name, team, laps completed, grid position, and points. The relevant column for this claim is the \"laps\" column because that's where the number of laps each driver completed is listed.\n\nSo I'll go through each row and count how many drivers have 46 laps and how many have 45 laps.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Lee Holdsworth: 46 laps.\n2. Garth Tander: 46\n3. Russell Ingall: 46\n4. Jamie Whincup: 46\n5. Steven Richards: 46\n6. Jason Richards: 46\n7. Andrew Jones: 46\n8. Steve Owen: 46\n9. Max Wilson: 46\n10. Paul Dumbrell: 46\n\nWait, that's 10 drivers with 46 laps so far. Let me count again to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nContinuing:\n\n11. Todd Kelly: 46 \u2013 that makes 11 drivers.\n12. Steven Johnson: 45\n13. Jason Bargwanna: 45\n14. Craig Lowndes: 45\n15. Rick Kelly: 45\n16. Will Davison: 45\n17. Simon Wills: 45\n18. Jack Perkins: 45\n19. John Bowe: 45\n20. Shane Price: 45\n21. Paul Morris: 45\n\nWait, that's 21 rows. Let me check how many have 46 and 45.\n\nFrom the first 11 entries (rows 0 to 10), all have 46 laps except for row 9 which I think is still 46. Wait no, let me list them again:\n\nRow 0: 46\nRow 1: 46\nRow 2: 46\nRow 3: 46\nRow 4: 46\nRow 5: 46\nRow 6: 46\nRow 7: 46\nRow 8: 46\nRow 9: 46 (Max Wilson)\nRow 10: 46 (Paul Dumbrell)\n\nSo that's 11 drivers with 46 laps. Then starting from row 12:\n\nRow 12: Jason Bargwanna \u2013 45\nRow 13: Craig Lowndes \u2013 45\nRow 14: Rick Kelly \u2013 45\nRow 15: Will Davison \u2013 45\nRow 16: Simon Wills \u2013 45\nRow 17: Jack Perkins \u2013 45\nRow 18: John Bowe \u2013 45\nRow 19: Shane Price \u2013 45\nRow 20: Paul Morris \u2013 45\nRow 21: Greg Murphy \u2013 45\nRow 22: Shane van Gisbergen \u2013 45\n\nWait, that's 11 drivers with 45 laps. Let me count:\n\nRows 12 to 22 inclusive is 11 rows, each with 45 laps.\n\nSo according to this, there are 11 drivers who completed 46 laps and 11 drivers who completed 45 laps. But the claim says 9 drivers for 46 and 11 for 45. So that would make the claim false because it's actually 11 drivers with 46 laps, not 9.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me recount:\n\nRows with 46 laps:\n- Lee Holdsworth (0)\n- Garth Tander (1)\n- Russell Ingall (2)\n- Jamie Whincup (3)\n- Steven Richards (4)\n- Jason Richards (5)\n- Andrew Jones (6)\n- Steve Owen (7)\n- Max Wilson (8)\n- Paul Dumbrell (9)\n- Todd Kelly (10) \u2013 Wait, no. Todd Kelly is row 10 or 11?\n\nWait the table shows that after Paul Dumbrell (row 9), comes Todd Kelly at row 10 with 46 laps? Or is it 45?\n\nLooking back: The rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: Lee Holdsworth \u2013 46\nRow 1: Garth Tander \u2013 46\nRow 2: Russell Ingall \u2013 46\nRow 3: Jamie Whincup \u2013 46\nRow 4: Steven Richards \u2013 46\nRow 5: Jason Richards \u2013 46\nRow 6: Andrew Jones \u2013 46\nRow 7: Steve Owen \u2013 46\nRow 8: Max Wilson \u2013 46\nRow 9: Paul Dumbrell \u2013 46\nRow 10: Todd Kelly \u2013 45? Wait, no. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait in the original table provided by the user, after Paul Dumbrell (row 9), comes Todd Kelly at row 10 with 45 laps. So rows 0-9 are 46 laps except for Todd Kelly who is row 10 with 45. Wait no, let me look:\n\nThe original table as per the user's message shows that after Paul Dumbrell (row 9), the next entries start at row 10: \"Todd Kelly\" with 45 laps. So rows 0-9 have 46 laps except for Todd Kelly who is row 10.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe table starts as:\n\nRow 0: Lee Holdsworth \u2013 46\nRow 1: Garth Tander \u2013 46\n...\nRow 9: Paul Dumbrell \u2013 46\nRow 10: Todd Kelly \u2013 45\nSo that's 10 rows (0-9) with 46 laps, and starting from row 10 onwards, some have 45.\n\nWait no, let me recount properly. The table is as follows:\n\nRow Index | Laps\n--- | ---\n0 | 46\n1 | 46\n2 | 46\n3 | 46\n4 | 46\n5 | 46\n6 | 46\n7 | 46\n8 | 46\n9 | 46\n10 | 45 (Todd Kelly)\n11 | 45 (Steven Johnson)\n12 | 45 (Jason Bargwanna)\n13 | 45 (Craig Lowndes)\n14 | 45 (Rick Kelly)\n15 | 45 (Will Davison)\n16 | 45 (Simon Wills)\n17 | 45 (Jack Perkins)\n18 | 45 (John Bowe)\n19 | 45 (Shane Price)\n20 | 45 (Paul Morris)\n21 | 45 (Greg Murphy)\n22 | 45 (Shane van Gisbergen)\n23 | 45 (James) \u2013 Wait no, the last row is \"James\" with 0 laps?\n\nWait wait, looking back at the table provided by the user:\n\nThe table goes up to row 23? Let me check.\n\nActually, in the user's message, after row 19: Shane Price, it continues as:\n\nRow 20: Paul Morris \u2013 45\nRow 21: Greg Murphy \u2013 45\nRow 22: Shane van Gisbergen \u2013 45\nAnd then there are some other rows beyond that with laps less than 45.\n\nWait no, looking back, the user's table ends at row 23:\n\nRow 23: James (probably a typo for another name) \u2013 0 laps?\n\nBut in any case, focusing on the 46 and 45 lap rows:\n\nRows 0-9: 10 rows with 46 laps.\n\nThen from row 10 onwards:\n\nRow 10: Todd Kelly \u2013 45\nRow 11: Steven Johnson \u2013 45\nRow 12: Jason Bargwanna \u2013 45\nRow 13: Craig Lowndes \u2013 45\nRow 14: Rick Kelly \u2013 45\nRow 15: Will Davison \u2013 45\nRow 16: Simon Wills \u2013 45\nRow 17: Jack Perkins \u2013 45\nRow 18: John Bowe \u2013 45\nRow 19: Shane Price \u2013 45\nRow 20: Paul Morris \u2013 45\nRow 21: Greg Murphy \u2013 45\nRow 22: Shane van Gisbergen \u2013 45\n\nWait that's 13 rows from row 10 to row 22 inclusive, each with 45 laps.\n\nSo total:\n\nRows with 46 laps: 10 (rows 0-9)\nRows with 45 laps: 13 (rows 10-22)\n\nBut the claim is that there are 9 drivers who completed 46 laps and 11 who completed 45. So according to this, the numbers don't match; thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait but perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all rows with 46 laps:\n\nFrom row 0 to row 9: that's 10 drivers (indices 0-9 inclusive).\n\nRows with 45 laps start at row 10 and go up to row 22, which is 13 drivers.\n\nSo the claim says 9 for 46 and 11 for 45. Actual counts are 10 and 13 respectively. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back at the user's message, the table starts as:\n\nRow numbers aren't explicitly given, but from the way it's written, each line represents a row. So counting:\n\nLine 1: Lee Holdsworth \u2013 46\nLine 2: Garth Tander \u2013 46\n...\nUp to Paul Dumbrell at line 10 (row index 9) \u2013 46.\n\nThen next is Todd Kelly \u2013 45, which would be row 10.\n\nSo rows 0-9 (indices 0-9): 10 drivers with 46 laps.\n\nRows 10 onwards:\n\nTodd Kelly \u2013 45\nSteven Johnson \u2013 45\nJason Bargwanna \u2013 45\nCraig Lowndes \u2013 45\nRick Kelly \u2013 45\nWill Davison \u2013 45\nSimon Wills \u2013 45\nJack Perkins \u2013 45\nJohn Bowe \u2013 45\nShane Price \u2013 45\nPaul Morris \u2013 45\nGreg Murphy \u2013 45\nShane van Gisbergen \u2013 45\n\nThat's 13 drivers with 45 laps.\n\nSo the counts are 10 and 13, not 9 and 11 as per the claim. Therefore, the answer would be that the claim is incorrect; there are more than 9 who completed 46 laps and more than 11 who completed 45.\n\nWait but perhaps I'm miscounting because some of those with 45 may have more than one entry? No, each row represents a single driver. So the counts are as above.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that 9 drivers completed 46 laps and 11 drivers completed 45 laps. However, upon examining the data:\n\n- **Drivers who completed 46 laps**: There are 10 drivers (rows 0\u20139).\n- **Drivers who completed 45 laps**: There are 13 drivers (rows 10\u201322).\n\nSince both numbers exceed the claim, it is incorrect. \n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; more than 9 drivers completed 46 laps and more than 11 completed 45 laps.",

    "claim": "the most lap that any driver complete during the race be 47",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the most lap that any driver complete during the race be 47\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that the highest number of laps completed by any driver in the race was 47. My task is to verify if this is accurate using the data given in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: name, team, laps, grid, and points. The column we're interested in is \"laps\" because that's where the number of laps each driver completed is recorded.\n\nNow, I'll scan through the \"laps\" column to find the maximum value. Let's go row by row:\n\n1. Lee Holdsworth: 46 laps\n2. Garth Tander: 46 laps\n3. Russell Ingall: 46 laps\n4. Jamie Whincup: 46 laps\n5. Steven Richards: 46 laps\n6. Jason Richards: 46 laps\n7. Andrew Jones: 46 laps\n8. Steve Owen: 46 laps\n9. Max Wilson: 46 laps\n10. Paul Dumbrell: 46 laps\n11. Todd Kelly: 46 laps\n12. Steven Johnson: 46 laps\n13. Jason Bargwanna: 45 laps\n14. Craig Lowndes: 45 laps\n15. Rick Kelly: 45 laps\n16. Will Davison: 45 laps\n17. Simon Wills: 45 laps\n18. Jack Perkins: 45 laps\n19. John Bowe: 45 laps\n20. Shane Price: 45 laps\n21. Paul Morris: 45 laps\n22. Greg Murphy: 45 laps\n23. Shane Van Gisbergen: 45 laps\n24. Mark Winterbottom: 43 laps\n25. Cameron McConville: 43 laps\n26. Fabian Coulthard: 34 laps\n27. Mark Skaife: 31 laps\n28. Alan Gurr: 29 laps\n29. Dean Canto: 27 laps\n30. Jason Bright: 22 laps\n31. James Courtney: 17 laps\n\nFrom this, I can see that the highest number of laps completed is 46. Several drivers have 46 laps, which appears to be the maximum. The next lower numbers are 45, and then it goes down from there.\n\nThe claim states that the most laps were 47. Since none of the entries in the \"laps\" column reach 47, this claim is not supported by the data provided. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for this determination, I need to highlight all instances where the laps are at their maximum value, which is 46. Each driver who completed 46 laps is a relevant cell because they contribute to determining that 47 is not the highest lap count.\n\nLooking back at the table, rows 0 through 12 (indexes starting from 0) all have 46 laps. So each of these rows under the \"laps\" column is relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the maximum number of laps was 47, but the data shows the highest was 46. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"laps\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"laps\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that Garth Tander completed 10 more laps than Jason Bright during the race.\n\nFirst, I need to verify this claim by checking the relevant data in the table. So, I should look for the rows corresponding to Garth Tander and Jason Bright and check their lap counts.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each name until I find Garth Tander. From the table, his row is: \n\nGarth Tander with team Toll HSV Dealer Team, 46 laps, grid position 19, 20 points.\n\nNext, I need to find Jason Bright in the table. Scanning further down, I see:\n\nJason Bright with Britek Motorsport, but wait, in the table it's spelled \"britek motosport\" (missing an 'r'), and he has 22 laps, grid position 16, 0 points.\n\nNow, comparing their lap counts: Garth Tander has 46 laps, Jason Bright has 22 laps. The difference is 46 - 22 = 24 laps.\n\nThe claim says Garth completed 10 more laps than Jason, but according to the table, it's actually 24 more laps.

Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 10: Todd Kelly's team is listed as \"holden racing team\".\n- Continuing down, I check if any other drivers are under this team name.\n\nLooking further, I don't see any other entries for \"holden racing team\" in the 'team' column.

But the claim says there are 20 such drivers. That's a discrepancy.\n\nHold on, maybe I missed some rows or made an error in counting. Let me recount more carefully.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows 16 to 31 (indices 15 to 30) all have \"points\" as zero except for row 14 which is Craig Lowndes with 3 points.

But the table has more than that. Let me check the total number of rows.\n\nCounting all rows, starting at index 0:\n\nRow indices go up to 31 (since JavaScript uses zero-based indexing). So there are 32 rows in total.\n\nWait no, actually, looking back, the last row is James Courtney at index 31. So that's 32 rows. But earlier, I counted only 16 drivers with zero points. That would mean the claim of 20 is false because only 16 have zero points.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list each driver and their points again:\n\n1. Lee Holdsworth: 24\n2.

Since 16 \u2260 20, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the \"points\" entries for these 16 drivers, each at row indices 16 to 31 and column \"points\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE with the relevant cells being those 16 rows in the points column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 29, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
