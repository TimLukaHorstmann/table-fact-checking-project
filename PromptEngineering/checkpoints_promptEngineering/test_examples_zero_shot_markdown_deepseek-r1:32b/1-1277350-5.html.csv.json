    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the word friday in the polish language be pi\u0105tek\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns represent days of the week, starting from Monday as the first day up to Sunday as the seventh day. Each row corresponds to a different language or notation system. My task is to check if the Polish word for Friday is indeed \"pi\u0105tek.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant rows and columns in the table that pertain to Friday and the Polish language.\n\nLooking at the column headers, Friday is labeled as \"friday fifth day.\" So I need to find the row where the language is Polish and see what word is listed under the Friday column.\n\nScrolling through the rows, I spot a row with \"polish\" as the first entry. Under that row, each subsequent cell corresponds to the respective days in Polish. Specifically, the Friday column should have the Polish word for Friday.\n\nIn the table, the Polish row shows:\n- monday: poniedzia\u0142ek\n- tuesday: wtorek\n- wednesday: \u015broda\n- thursday: czwartek\n- friday: pi\u0105tek\n- saturday: sobota\n- sunday: niedziela\n\nSo under the Friday column for Polish, it's \"pi\u0105tek.\" That matches exactly with the claim made. \n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells that might affect this conclusion. For instance, I'll verify if any other rows mention Friday in Polish or have a different term. But looking through all the rows, each language has its own set of terms, and the Polish entry is consistent.\n\nTherefore, since the table explicitly lists \"pi\u0105tek\" as the Polish word for Friday under the correct column, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that \"pi\u0105tek\" is the Polish word for Friday. The relevant cell in the table confirms this.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"friday fifth day\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the word saturday in the croatian language be subota\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are days from Monday to Sunday, and each row represents a different language along with its translations for those days. My goal is to find where Croatian translates Saturday.\n\nThe claim mentions \"saturday\" in Croatian as \"subota\". So, I should check the row for Croatian (Croatian) under the Saturday column.\n\nLooking at the table, the rows are: ISO 8601, Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Polish, Kashubian, Luo, Slovak, Czech, Slovene, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Hungarian, Estonian, S Chinese (in pinyin), Mongolian (numerical), Mongolian (tibetan), Turkish.\n\nSo the row for Croatian is there. The columns are: monday first day, tuesday second day, ..., saturday sixth day, sunday seventh day.\n\nI'll locate the Saturday column in the Croatian row. Scanning through, under 'saturday sixth day', the Croatian entry is \"subota\". \n\nThat matches exactly with the claim. So the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Language Row:** Look for the row labeled \"Croatian\" in the table.\n\n2. **Locate Saturday's Column:** Find the column named \"saturday sixth day\".\n\n3. **Check the Croatian Entry for Saturday:** Under this column, the word listed is \"subota\".\n\n4. **Compare with the Claim:** The claim states that Saturday in Croatian is \"subota\", which matches exactly.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since the table confirms the claim, it's TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"saturday sixth day\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "subota be the mongolian word for sunday",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"subota be the mongolian word for sunday\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says that \"subota\" is the Mongolian word for Sunday. So I should look into the table under the 'sunday seventh day' column to find the Mongolian entries.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two rows related to Mongolian: one labeled as mongolian (numerical) and another as mongolian (tibetan). \n\nFor the numerical row:\n- The entry for Sunday is \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\". This doesn't match \"subota\".\n\nFor the Tibetan row:\n- The entry is \"\u043d\u044f\u043c nyam\". Again, this doesn't match.\n\nNow, I'll check other languages to see if \"subota\" appears elsewhere. \n\nLooking through the table:\n- In Polish, it's \"sobota\".\n- In Ukrainian, it's \"\u0441\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 subota\".\n- Other Slavic languages like Belarusian and Bulgarian also have similar forms.\n\nSo \"subota\" is actually the word for Saturday in several Slavic languages, but not in any Mongolian entries. Therefore, the claim that it refers to Sunday in Mongolian is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"subota\" is the Mongolian term for Sunday, but checking the relevant cells shows it's used for Saturday in other languages and doesn't appear as a Mongolian Sunday term.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. The claim is about the Mongolian word for Sunday being \"subota\".\n2. Checking the table under the 'sunday seventh day' column:\n   - Mongolian (numerical): \"\u0431\u04af\u0442\u044d\u043d \u0441\u0430\u0439\u043d \u04e9\u0434\u04e9\u0440 b\u00fcten sayn \u00f6d\u00f6r\"\n   - Mongolian (tibetan): \"\u043d\u044f\u043c nyam\"\n3. Neither entry is \"subota\".\n4. However, in other languages like Polish and Ukrainian, \"sobota\" or \"\u0441\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 subota\" refers to Saturday.\n5. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"Sunday seventh day\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 31, \"column_name\": \"Sunday seventh day\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
