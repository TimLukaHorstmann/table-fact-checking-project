So I need to check if both these dates have entries in the table under the \"Kirin Cup\" category.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'date' column, a 'comp' (competition) column, and other details. The relevant columns here are 'date' and 'comp'.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check for any entries where the competition is \"kirin cup\".\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 5: date is 1998-05-17, comp is kirin cup. So May 17th has a Kirin Cup game.\n- Next, looking further down:\n- Row 6: date is 1998-05-21, comp is kirin cup. So May 21st also has a Kirin Cup game.\n\nNow I check if both these dates are present in the table under the Kirin Cup competition.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the world cup have 4 game throughout june 1998, all of which be in france\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components:\n1. **Number of World Cup games in June 1998:** The claim states there are 4 games.\n2. **Location of these games:** All must be held in France.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to verify both aspects.\n\n**Step 1: Identifying Relevant Rows**\nI'll look through each row to find entries where the 'comp' column is \"world cup\". This will help me focus on only the relevant matches for the World Cup.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first few rows have 'comp' as \"f\" or \"kirin cup\", which I assume stands for friendly matches and a different tournament.\n- Rows 10, 11, 12, and 13 (starting from row index 9 since counting starts at 0) have the 'comp' column set to \"world cup\".\n\nSo, these are the four World Cup games in June 1998.\n\n**Step 2: Checking the Dates**\nThe claim specifies that all four games occurred throughout June 1998. I'll verify each of the identified rows:\n\n- Row 9 (index 9): Date is 1998-06-12\n- Row 10 (index 10): Date is 1998-06-19\n- Row 11 (index 11): Date is 1998-06-24\n- Row 12 (index 12): Date is 1998-06-28\n\nAll dates fall within June 1998, so the number of games checks out.\n\n**Step 3: Verifying Locations**\nThe claim states all four games were in France. I'll check each 'venue' column for these rows:\n\n- Row 9 (index 9): stade de la mosson montpellier, france\n- Row 10 (index 10): stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne, france\n- Row 11 (index 11): stade de toulouse toulouse, france\n- Row 12 (index 12): stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens, france\n\nEach venue is indeed located in France.

I need to determine whether the claim \"neither team score for the first 2 game of the world cup in france\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It states that neither team scored in the first two games of the World Cup held in France. So, I'm looking for matches during the World Cup in France where both teams didn't score any goals in those initial two games.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table to find all entries related to the World Cup in France. Scanning through each row, I see that the 'comp' column indicates \"world cup\" starting from row index 10 onwards:\n\n- Row 10: stade de la mosson montpellier, score 0-0\n- Row 11: stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne, score 0-0\n- Row 12: stade de toulouse toulouse, score 1-3\n- Row 13: stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens, score 0-0 (with aet)\n\nThe claim refers to the first two games of the World Cup in France. So, I need to check rows 10 and 11.\n\nLooking at row 10 (index 10), the score is 0-0. This means neither team scored; that's one game where both teams didn't score.\n\nThen, row 11 (index 11) also shows a score of 0-0. Again, neither team scored in this match.\n\nSo, both the first two World Cup games in France had scores where neither team scored goals. This aligns with the claim made.\n\nI should ensure there are no other entries before these that might be considered part of the World Cup in France. Looking back at earlier rows (indices 0-9), all competitions listed are either 'f' or 'kirin cup', so they don't pertain to the World Cup in France.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the first two World Cup games in France indeed had scores where neither team scored. The claim is supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that neither team scored in the first two World Cup games held in France.

I'll go through each row to find matches for these dates.\n\nStarting with June 18, 1998:\n\n- Scanning the date column:\nRow indices are from 0 to 13 (since there are 14 rows).

The closest is June 19 in row 11.\n\nSo, there's no game listed for June 18, which means part of the claim might be incorrect.\n\nNext, checking June 28, 1998:\n\nLooking through the dates:\n- Row 12: June 24\n- Row 13: June 28, 1998\n\nYes, row 13 has the date June 28. Let's check its score.\n\nIn row 13, the 'score' column shows \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\". So the final score is 0-0 with a 1-0 after extra time. The claim says both games have a score of 1-1, which doesn't match this game's score.\n\nSince June 18 isn't present in the table and June 28 has a different score than claimed, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying relevant cells:\n\nFor June 28 (row 13), checking 'date' and 'score':\n- row_index:13, column_name:'date'\n- row_index:13, column_name:'score'\n\nSince there's no entry for June 18, we don't have relevant cells for that part.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the world cup have 3 game throughout july 1998 , all of which be in japan\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns: date, venue, score, comp, and report. Each row represents a different match with details about when it was played, where, the result, the competition it's part of, and some report number or identifier.\n\nThe claim mentions three World Cup games in July 1998, all in Japan. So I need to check two things: how many World Cup games were there in July 1998, and whether their venues are in Japan.\n\nLooking at the 'comp' column, the entries labeled as \"world cup\" are from rows 10 to 13 (assuming counting starts at 0). Let's see each of these:\n\n- Row 10: Date is June 12, 1998. Venue is in France.\n- Row 11: Date is June 19, 1998. Venue is in France.\n- Row 12: Date is June 24, 1998. Venue is in France.\n- Row 13: Date is June 28, 1998. Venue is in France.\n\nWait a second, all these dates are in June, not July. So there's no World Cup game listed in July according to this table. Therefore, the claim that there were three games throughout July is incorrect because none of them took place in July as per the data provided.\n\nAdditionally, even if there had been any games in July, I'd need to check their venues. But since all relevant entries are in June and in France, it's clear that the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because:\n\n1. There are no World Cup games listed for July 1998.\n2. All World Cup games in the table took place in France, not Japan.\n\nThe relevant cells to check would be rows 10 through 13 under the 'date' and 'venue' columns since they pertain to the World Cup matches.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"Netherlands and Romania have a game on June 24 and 28, respectively, in 1998\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two specific dates: June 24 and June 28, 1998, and it states that the Netherlands played Romania on those dates. So, I need to check if there are entries in the table corresponding to these dates where either the Netherlands or Romania was involved.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a date, venue, score, competition type (comp), and report number. The key columns here are 'date' and 'venue' since they contain information about when and where games took place.\n\nLet me start by identifying all rows with dates in June 1998. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- June 12: Row index 10\n- June 19: Row index 11\n- June 24: Row index 12\n- June 28: Row index 13\n\nSo, rows 12 and 13 are the ones with dates June 24 and June 28. Now, let's examine these two rows to see which teams were involved.\n\nRow 12 (June 24):\n- Venue: Stade de Toulouse, France\n- Score: 1 - 3\n- Competition: World Cup\n\nI don't see any mention of the Netherlands or Romania here. The competition is a World Cup match in France, but without knowing which teams played, I can't confirm if they're involved.\n\nRow 13 (June 28):\n- Venue: Stade F\u00e9lix Bollaert, Lens, France\n- Score: 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\n- Competition: World Cup\n\nAgain, the venue is in France, and it's another World Cup match. No direct mention of the Netherlands or Romania.\n\nNext, I'll look through all rows to find any games involving the Netherlands or Romania.\n\nFor the Netherlands:\nLooking at 'venue' entries for 'philips stadion eindhoven', which is in the Netherlands (row index 7). This game was on June 1, 1998, against an opponent not specified here. However, this doesn't align with the claim's dates of June 24 or 28.\n\nFor Romania:\nLooking at 'steaua stadium bucharest' in row index 8, which is a game on June 3, 1998. Again, this date doesn't match the claim.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other entries for these countries beyond their home venues might be tricky because the table only lists one match per country unless they played multiple times. However, from the given data, I don't see any matches on June 24 or 28 involving either the Netherlands or Romania.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the table, there's no evidence that the Netherlands and Romania had games on June 24 and 28, respectively.

Rows 10-13: These are World Cup matches.\n\nLooking at row 10:\n- Date: 1998-06-12\n- Venue: stade de la mosson montpellier, france\n- Score: 0 - 0\n\nThis is the first World Cup match in France listed. The score is indeed 0-0, meaning neither team scored.\n\nBut wait, row 11:\n- Date: 1998-06-19\n- Venue: stade geoffroy-guichard saint-\u00c9tienne, france\n- Score: 0 - 0\n\nRow 12:\n- Date: 1998-06-24\n- Venue: stade de toulouse toulouse, france\n- Score: 1 - 3\n\nAnd row 13:\n- Date: 1998-06-28\n- Venue: stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens, france\n- Score: 0 - 0 (with a penalty shootout result)\n\nSo the first World Cup match in France is on June 12, 1998. The score was 0-0, meaning neither team scored. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because only that game had a 0-0 score where both teams didn't score.\n\nWait, but I should check if all World Cup matches in France had 0-0 scores. No, row 12 shows a score of 1-3, so not all were 0-0. But the claim specifically mentions \"only the first game.\" So as long as the first game was 0-0 and others weren't necessarily, but the key point is that in the first game, neither team scored.\n\nSo yes, the claim holds true because the first World Cup match listed has a score of 0-0. Thus, TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that neither team scored in only the first World Cup game held in France. The relevant data shows this game had a 0-0 score, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"comp\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"the game on june 18 and 28, both have a score of 2 - 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has several columns: date, venue, score, comp (which I assume stands for competition), and report. The rows list various games with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific dates: June 18 and June 28. Looking at the 'date' column in the table, I need to find any entries that match these dates.\n\nStarting with June 18, 1998. Scanning through the dates:\n\n- The first few rows are from February, March, April, May, and early June.\n- Then, on row index 10 (assuming we start counting at 0), there's a date of 1998-06-12.\n- Next, row 11 is 1998-06-19.\n- Row 12 is 1998-06-24.\n- Row 13 is 1998-06-28.\n\nWait, the claim mentions June 18, but I don't see a date in the table that corresponds to 1998-06-18. The closest are June 19 and June 24, which might be around that time, but not exactly June 18. So, it seems there's no game on June 18 in this table.\n\nNext, checking June 28, 1998. That date is present in row index 13. The score for that game is listed as \"0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)\". The claim states the score should be 2-0, but here it's 0-0 with an after extra time score of 1-0. So, the score doesn't match the claim.\n\nSince there's no entry for June 18 and the June 28 game has a different score than claimed, both parts of the statement are incorrect. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells that were checked:\n\n- For June 18: Since it wasn't found, I didn't have to extract any cell data for this part.\n- For June 28: The row index 13 was examined, specifically checking both the 'date' and 'score' columns.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 13, column 'date'\n- Row 13, column 'score'\n\nThese checks confirm that the claim is not supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two games on June 18 and June 28 both had a score of 2-0. Upon examining the table:\n\n1. **June 18, 1998**: No game exists in the table for this date.\n2. **June 28, 1998**: The game's score was 0-0 (with extra time resulting in 1-0), not 2-0.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE as neither date has a score of 2-0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
