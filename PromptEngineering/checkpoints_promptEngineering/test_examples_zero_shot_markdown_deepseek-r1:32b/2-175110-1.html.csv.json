    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the user has given me a table in markdown format and a claim about Rhodesia's medal counts. I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, and total medals. Each row corresponds to a different country. My task is to check the claim against the data provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"rhodesia have 2 bronze medal, 5 silver medal, and 10 gold medal.\" I'll break this down into three parts\u2014bronze, silver, and gold\u2014to verify each one individually.\n\nStarting with Rhodesia's row. Looking at the table, Rhodesia is listed as rank 5. Let me check the numbers under each medal category for that row. The bronze column shows a value of 2, which matches the claim. Next, silver: it says 5, which also aligns with what the claim states. Finally, gold medals are listed as 10, which again matches the claim exactly.\n\nSince all three parts of the claim\u2014bronze, silver, and gold\u2014are accurate according to the table, the overall claim should be TRUE. I need to make sure that each part is correctly referenced in the relevant cells so that it's clear where the data comes from.\n\nSo, for the bronze medal count, the cell is in row 4 (since rows are zero-indexed, so rank 5 is index 4) under 'bronze'. Similarly, silver is in the same row under 'silver', and gold is under 'gold' in that row. I'll note each of these cells to support my answer.\n\nI should also remember to return only a JSON object with \"answer\" and \"relevant_cells\", ensuring there are no extra keys or text. The relevant cells list needs to include all the parts of the table used to verify the claim, which in this case are three separate cells for each medal type.\n\nPutting it all together, I can confidently say that the claim is TRUE because each part of it corresponds exactly with the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"bronze\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}",
