    "claim": "2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from australia",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"2 player in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from australia\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the claim: it's saying that two players who were nightwatchmen in cricket are from Australia. The term \"nightwatchman\" refers to a player who comes into bat at the end of the day to protect other batters, often someone with more experience or known for their batting skills.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I need to check each row to see which players are from Australia and if they fit the nightwatchman role. The relevant columns here would be \"player\" (to identify who they are) and \"team\" (to confirm their nationality). Additionally, the \"score\" might indicate their performance, but since the claim is about being a nightwatchman, I should look for signs of experienced or defensively strong players.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Nasim-ul-Ghani from Pakistan with a score of 101 against England in 1962. He's from Pakistan, so not relevant to Australia.\n\n2. **Row 1**: Tony Mann from Australia with a score of 105 against India in 1977. Being an Australian player, this could be one potential candidate for the nightwatchman role. His high score suggests he might have been experienced enough to hold the position.\n\n3. **Row 2**: Syed Kirmani from India with a score of 101 not out against Australia in 1979. He's Indian, so not relevant here.\n\n4. **Row 3 and 4**: Mark Boucher from South Africa with scores 125 against Zimbabwe in 1999 and 108 against England in 1999. Both are from South Africa, so they don't fit the Australian requirement.\n\n5. **Row 5**: Jason Gillespie from Australia with a score of 201 not out against Bangladesh in 2006. Another Australian player with an impressive score, which might indicate he was experienced and possibly a nightwatchman.\n\nNow, I need to verify if both Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie were indeed known as nightwatchmen. From my knowledge, nightwatchmen are typically senior players who can bat defensively. Tony Mann is a well-known cricketer from Australia, but I'm not sure about his specific role. Similarly, Jason Gillespie was a pace bowler and occasional batsman, so it's less likely he was primarily a nightwatchman.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check their roles. Tony Mann did play as a nightwatchman in some matches, especially given his experience. Jason Gillespie, while a good all-rounder, wasn't primarily known for that role. So perhaps only one of them fits the description, but according to the table alone, both are from Australia with high scores.\n\nBut the claim is about two players being nightwatchmen from Australia. If the table's data indicates their nationalities and performance, which could suggest experience, then based solely on this information, we have two Australian players: Tony Mann (Row 1) and Jason Gillespie (Row 5). \n\nSo, even if in reality only one might fit the role, according to the given data, it appears that there are two players from Australia. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two Australian players with significant scores: Tony Mann and Jason Gillespie. Based on their presence and scores, they could be considered as nightwatchmen.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"england play 2 time in the nightwatchman (cricket)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. The term \"nightwatchman\" in cricket typically refers to a batsman who comes in late in the day to protect the wickets when the light is fading. So, the claim suggests that England played as the nightwatchman twice.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check how many times England was involved in matches where they might have had a nightwatchman role. The relevant column here would be \"versus\" since it indicates which team they were playing against.\n\nIn the table:\n- Row 0: England is listed as the opponent (versus) for Pakistan.\n- Row 4: England is again listed as the opponent for South Africa.\n\nSo, there are two instances where England was the opposing team. Each of these matches could have involved an England player batting as a nightwatchman. Therefore, the claim that England played twice in this role seems to be supported by the data.\n\nThe relevant cells are the \"versus\" column for both rows 0 and 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"versus\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"versus\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are player, team, score, versus, and year. Each row represents a player's performance in a specific match against another team in a particular year.\n\nThe claim is comparing Mark Boucher's score with Tony Mann's. So, I need to find the relevant rows for both players and extract their scores.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Mark Boucher appears twice: once in 1999 against Zimbabwe with a score of 125, and again in 1999 against England with a score of 108.\n- Tony Mann is listed once, playing for Australia against India in 1977 with a score of 105.\n\nNow, I'll compare the scores. Mark Boucher's highest score is 125, while Tony Mann scored 105. Since 125 is higher than 105, the claim that Mark Boucher has a higher score is TRUE.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells in the table for each player. For Mark Boucher, I'll consider both his entries because they both show his scores. For Tony Mann, only his single entry applies. So, the relevant rows are row 3 (125 against Zimbabwe) and row 4 (108 against England) for Mark Boucher, and row 1 for Tony Mann.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells listed as specified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"jason gillespie have the highest score out of all the player.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify the scores for each player.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n1. Nasim ul Ghani scored 101 against England in 1962.\n2. Tony Mann scored 105 against India in 1977.\n3. Syed Kirmani scored 101 not out against Australia in 1979.\n4. Mark Boucher has two entries: one with 125 against Zimbabwe in 1999 and another with 108 against England in 1999.\n5. Jason Gillespie scored 201 not out against Bangladesh in 2006.\n\nNow, I need to find the highest score among all these players.\n\nComparing the scores:\n\n- 101 (Nasim)\n- 105 (Tony)\n- 101 (Syed)\n- 125 (Mark Boucher)\n- 108 (Mark Boucher again)\n- 201 (Jason)\n\nLooking at these, 201 is the highest. So Jason Gillespie's score of 201 not out is indeed higher than all other scores listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"jason gillespie have the highest score\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Jason Gillespie has the highest score of 201 not out compared to all other players in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table in markdown format with information about cricket players and their scores against different teams in various years. The claim is that \"syed kirmani and nasim  ul ghani have the same score.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the relevant cells in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to locate both players in the table. Looking at the 'player' column, I see two entries: \"nasim  - ul  - ghani\" and \"syed kirmani\". \n\nNext, I'll check their respective scores from the 'score' column. For nasim ul ghani, his score is listed as 101. Syed Kirmani's score is given as \"101 not out.\" \n\nNow, considering what these scores mean: in cricket, a score followed by \"not out\" means that the player wasn't dismissed and remained at the crease when the innings ended. So while both have a numerical score of 101, one is marked as \"not out.\" Does this affect whether their scores are considered the same?\n\nThe claim doesn't specify anything about being not out; it simply states they have the same score. Depending on how we interpret 'score'\u2014whether just the number or including dismissal status\u2014the answer might vary. However, in most contexts when people talk about scores without additional qualifiers, they usually refer to the numerical value.\n\nSo both players have a numerical score of 101 each, even though one is not out and the other isn't specified as such (assuming nasim ul ghani's dismissal status isn't provided). Therefore, their scores are numerically the same. \n\nThus, the claim should be considered TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"jason gillespie's score be more than double that of nasim  - ul  - ghani 's\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to locate both players in the table. Looking at the table, I see Jason Gillespie and Nasim-ul-Ghani each have their own rows.\n\nFor Jason Gillespie:\n- His score is listed as \"201 not out\" under the \"score\" column in row 5 (since indexing starts at 0, that's row index 5).\n\nFor Nasim-ul-Ghani:\n- His score is \"101\" in the \"score\" column of row 0.\n\nNow, the claim says Jason's score is more than double Nasim's. So, let me calculate both scores:\n\nJason Gillespie's score: 201\nNasim-ul-Ghani's score: 101\n\nDouble of Nasim's score would be 2 * 101 = 202.\n\nSo, the question is whether Jason's 201 is more than double (which is 202). Since 201 is less than 202, it's not more than double. Therefore, the claim should be FALSE.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if \"not out\" affects the score comparison. The table shows Jason's score as \"201 not out,\" which means he was still batting and didn't get out. However, in terms of numerical value, it's 201, so when comparing, we just take the numbers without considering whether they're \"out\" or \"not out.\"\n\nSo, confirming again: 201 is less than 202, hence Jason's score isn't more than double Nasim's. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, the relevant cells are both players' scores. So, I need to include row indices and column names for these entries.\n\nJason Gillespie is in row 5, \"score\" column.\nNasim-ul-Ghani is in row 0, \"score\" column.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells list should have these two entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"2 players in the nightwatchman (cricket) come from pakistan\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a \"nightwatchman\" means in cricket. Typically, a nightwatchman is a player who comes in late in the day's play to protect other batsmen until the end of the day, often when light conditions are poor. They might not necessarily be top-order players but can vary depending on team strategy.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: player, team, score, versus, and year. The claim is about two players from Pakistan being nightwatchmen. So I should check if any of the Pakistani players listed could have been used as nightwatchmen based on their scores.\n\nThe relevant rows with players from Pakistan are:\n1. Nasim-ul-Ghani, Pakistan, 101, versus England, year 1962.\n2. No other Pakistani players in the table.\n\nWait, there's only one player from Pakistan listed here: Nasim-ul-Ghani. The claim says \"2 players,\" but according to this table, there's only one. Therefore, even if he was a nightwatchman, which isn't explicitly stated, we don't have information about another Pakistani player being a nightwatchman.\n\nAdditionally, the scores provided are quite high (101 and 201 not out), suggesting that these players were in top form, possibly top-order batsmen rather than nightwatchmen who might have lower scores or different roles.\n\nSo based on the table data, there's only one player from Pakistan. Therefore, the claim of two such players is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about cricket matches between England and Pakistan. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. There are six rows of data, each representing a player's performance in different years against various teams. The columns include \"player\", \"team\", \"score\", \"versus\", and \"year\".\n\nThe claim states: \"england play pakistan 2 time in the nightwatchman (cricket)\". I need to break this down. It seems like the user is saying that England played Pakistan twice in a match where someone acted as a night watchman. A night watchman in cricket refers to a player who comes in late to bat, often when there's low light, and their primary role is to survive until more players come in.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find instances where both teams are England and Pakistan. Let's scan through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Player nasim ul ghani from Pakistan scored 101 against England in 1962. This shows a match between Pakistan and England.\n2. **Row 1**: Tony mann from Australia vs India, so not relevant here.\n3. **Row 2**: Syed Kirmani from India vs Australia, again not relevant.\n4. **Row 3**: Mark Boucher from South Africa vs Zimbabwe, no connection to the claim.\n5. **Row 4**: Same player as above but against England in 1999. So another match involving England and South Africa, but not Pakistan.\n6. **Row 5**: Jason Gillespie from Australia vs Bangladesh, again not relevant.\n\nFrom this analysis, I only found one instance where England played against Pakistan (Row 0). There's no other row showing a match between these two teams in the table. Therefore, the claim that they played twice isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nI should also consider if any other rows might imply another match indirectly, but looking at the \"versus\" column, all other matches are against different opponents. Hence, there's only one recorded match involving England and Pakistan.\n\nSo, based on the table, the claim that they played twice is incorrect. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"versus\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"versus\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"syed kirmani and nasim - ul - ghani tie for the highest score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table data. The table has columns: player, team, score, versus, and year. There are six rows of data here.\n\nThe claim mentions two players: syed kirmani and nasim ul ghani. Let's find their scores in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: nasim - ul - ghani played for pakistan against england in 1962, scoring 101.\n2. Row 1: tony mann from australia scored 105 against india in 1977.\n3. Row 2: syed kirmani from india scored 101 not out against australia in 1979.\n4. Rows 3 and 4 are about mark boucher, scoring 125 and 108 respectively.\n5. Row 5: jason gillespie scored 201 not out against bangladesh in 2006.\n\nNow, let's extract the scores:\n\n- nasim - ul - ghani: 101\n- syed kirmani: 101 not out\n\nOther scores are higher: 105, 125, 201. The highest score in the table is 201 by jason gillespie.\n\nSo, both syed kirmani and nasim ul ghani have a score of 101 each. But since there are other players with higher scores (like 105, 125, and especially 201), their 101 is not the highest. Therefore, they don't tie for the highest score; instead, the highest is held by someone else.\n\nThus, the claim that they tie for the highest is FALSE.\n\nTo support this, I need to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For nasim ul ghani: row 0, score column.\n- For syed kirmani: row 2, score column.\n- The highest scorer's cell: jason gillespie in row 5, score column. Although not mentioned in the claim, this is necessary to determine that their scores aren't the highest.\n\nWait, but according to the instructions, I should only include cells relevant to verifying the claim. The claim is about syed and nasim tying for the highest. So we need to check both their scores and see if any other score is higher than 101.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: player (to confirm it's nasim), score.\n- Row 2: player (syed), score.\n- Rows with scores higher than 101: rows 1,3,4,5. Specifically, their 'score' column.\n\nWait, but the claim is whether they tie for the highest. So if any other player has a higher score, then it's false.\n\nSo perhaps I should include all relevant cells that have scores to check against.\n\nBut maybe in this case, the only necessary cells are those of syed and nasim because once their scores are both 101, but since there are others with higher scores (like jason gillespie's 201), it's enough to know that they don't tie for the highest. But I'm not sure if the instructions require including all cells or just those of the claimants.\n\nThe problem says: \"Carefully check each condition in the claim against the table and determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the only necessary cells are those of syed kirmani and nasim ul ghani. However, since their scores aren't the highest, we need to identify that there's a higher score elsewhere.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't have to include all higher scores, just any one higher than 101 would be sufficient.\n\nSo let me think: if in the table, someone else has a higher score, then syed and nasim cannot tie for the highest. Therefore, perhaps we need to look at their scores (rows 0 and 2) as well as the maximum score in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relevant cells are only those of the two players mentioned in the claim. But I think it's necessary to check if any other player has a higher score than them, so that would require looking at all the 'score' column.\n\nBut perhaps for brevity, we can include just their scores and one example of someone with a higher score. Or maybe all the higher ones.\n\nWait, but the instruction says: \"determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim.\" So if the claim is that syed and nasim tie for the highest, then we need to check:\n\n1. What are their scores?\n2. Is there any other player with a higher score?\n\nSo, to do this, I need to look at all 'score' columns.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of the answer, it's sufficient to list only the cells related to the two players and one cell showing a higher score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just their scores are enough because if we can see that both have 101, but then there's someone else with a higher number, which makes the claim false. But perhaps in the JSON response, I don't include all those cells, only the ones directly relevant to the claimants and any higher score.\n\nBut looking back at the example provided:\n\nIn the sample, the answer was TRUE or FALSE, and the relevant_cells included specific rows and columns that were checked.\n\nSo for this problem, I think the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: score (101)\n- Row 2: score (101 not out)\n\nBut also, perhaps we need to include at least one row where the score is higher than 101, like row 5's 201.\n\nAlternatively, since the claim is about syed and nasim tying for the highest, their scores are 101 each. But if any other player has a higher score, then it's false.\n\nSo perhaps the relevant cells include all players' scores to check if any exceed 101. Or maybe just enough to show that someone has a higher score.\n\nBut considering the problem statement says to \"determine which cells are relevant to verify the claim\", I think including their own scores and at least one other's higher score is sufficient.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nRow 0: score\nRow 2: score\nRow 5: score (since it's the highest)\n\nBut let me see. The highest score is 201, so that would be row 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should include all rows where the score is higher than 101 to confirm that they don't tie for the highest.\n\nSo rows 1 (105), 3 (125), 4 (108), and 5 (201). But that's a lot of cells. Maybe in this case, just including row 0, row 2, and row 5 is sufficient because row 5 has the highest score.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to include all rows where the score exceeds 101. Because each higher score contributes to the fact that syed and nasim don't have the highest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just list all the relevant cells for both players mentioned in the claim, which are row 0 (player and score) and row 2 (player and score). But that might not be sufficient because without checking other scores, we can't confirm whether they tie for the highest or not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to include all rows where the score is higher than 101 as well. So:\n\nRow 0: player and score\nRow 2: player and score\nRows 1,3,4,5: scores\n\nBut that would be a lot of cells in the JSON.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only their own scores are necessary because we can infer that if others have higher scores, it's false. But to verify the claim, we need to know all the relevant data points.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should include the player names and scores for both syed and nasim, as well as at least one example of someone with a higher score.\n\nBut in any case, perhaps it's better to list all cells where the 'score' column has values that are higher than 101, along with the two mentioned players' scores. But perhaps I should also include their names to confirm who they are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just their scores and one example of a higher score would suffice for brevity.\n\nWait, let's look at the sample given in the problem:\n\nThe user provided an example where the answer was TRUE, but that was not part of this specific task. However, the structure was JSON with an \"answer\" and \"relevant_cells\".\n\nSo perhaps in our case, since the claim is false because there are higher scores, we need to include those.\n\nBut I'm not sure how detailed it needs to be. Maybe for this problem, just including the two players' rows (0 and 2) as well as row 5's score would suffice.\n\nBut let me think again: the task is to determine whether syed and nasim tie for the highest score. So their scores are both 101, but if there exists any other player with a higher score, then it's false.\n\nTherefore, in order to verify this, we need to check all players' scores.\n\nBut perhaps that would require including all 'score' columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just their own scores and at least one higher score is sufficient.\n\nIn the interest of time, I'll proceed under the assumption that the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: player (to confirm it's nasim) and score\n- Row 2: player (syed) and score\n- Any row where the score exceeds 101, e.g., row 5.\n\nSo, in JSON, this would be:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": False,\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row\": 0, \"column\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row\": 0, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"player\"},\n        {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 5, \"column\": \"score\"}\n    ]\n}\n\nBut wait, row 5 is the last one with score 201.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should include all higher scores. But that would be more cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only their own scores and one example of a higher score to show it's not a tie.\n\nSo:\n\nrow 0: score\nrow 2: score\nrow 5: score\n\nBecause row 5 has the highest score.\n\nBut perhaps including all four (rows 1,3,4,5) is more accurate because each contributes to making their scores not the highest.\n\nHmm. I'm a bit unsure here, but I think the key points are:\n\n- The claim is about two players' scores being the highest.\n- To verify this, we need to check if any other player has a higher score than them.\n\nSo perhaps in the JSON response, it's sufficient to list all cells where the score exceeds 101, as well as the two players in question.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": False,\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row\": 0, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 1, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 3, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 4, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 5, \"column\": \"score\"}\n    ]\n}\n\nBut this includes all scores.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the two players' cells and one higher score cell. But I think to be thorough, we should include all higher scores because any of them invalidates the claim.\n\nIn conclusion, for the JSON response:\n\n- The answer is False.\n- Relevant cells are:\n   - Row 0, score (101)\n   - Row 2, score (101)\n   - Rows 1,3,4,5 with scores 102, 103, 104, 201 respectively.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n{\n    \"answer\": false,\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row\": 0, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 1, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 3, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 4, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 5, \"column\": \"score\"}\n    ]\n}\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the two players mentioned tie for the highest score, we need to check all relevant scores.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the scores of the two players in question.\n2. Check if any other player has a higher score than these two.\n3. If at least one player has a higher score, then the claim is false.\n4. If no other player has a higher score, then they tie for the highest.\n\nGiven that there are players with scores higher than 101, the answer is False.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": false,\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row\": 0, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 1, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 3, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 4, \"column\": \"score\"},\n        {\"row\": 5, \"column\": \"score\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify all the rows that mention Mark Boucher. Scanning down the 'player' column, I see two entries for him:\n\n1. In row 3: Mark Boucher scored 125 against Zimbabwe in 1999.\n2. In row 4: He also scored 108 against England in the same year.\n\nNow, to determine if he has the highest score, I need to compare his scores with all other players' scores in the 'score' column.\n\nLooking at the other scores:\n- Nasim-ul-Ghani scored 101 against England in 1962.\n- Tony Mann scored 105 against India in 1977.\n- Syed Kirmani scored 101 not out against Australia in 1979.\n- Jason Gillespie has the highest score here at 201 not out against Bangladesh in 2006.\n\nComparing all these, Mark Boucher's scores are 125 and 108. The highest among these is 125, but Jason Gillespie's score of 201 is significantly higher. Therefore, Mark Boucher does not have the highest score.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}",
