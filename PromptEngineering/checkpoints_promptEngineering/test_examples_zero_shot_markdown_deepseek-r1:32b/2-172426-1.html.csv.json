    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the task is to determine whether the claim \"princess anne of elizabeth the ii have have 2 husband\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Princess Anne, who is the daughter of Elizabeth II, has had two husbands. So I'm looking for information about Princess Anne's marital history in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it lists several princesses royals with their details including parents, marriage dates, and husbands. Each row corresponds to a different princess. I should focus on finding the row where the parent is Elizabeth II because that would be Princess Anne.\n\nGoing through the rows one by one:\n\n- Row 1: Mary, daughter of Charles I.\n- Row 2: Anne, daughter of George II.\n- Row 3: Charlotte, daughter of George III.\n- Row 4: Victoria, daughter of Victoria (the queen).\n- Row 5: Louise, daughter of Edward VII.\n- Row 6: Mary, daughter of George V.\n- Rows 7 and 8: Anne, daughter of Elizabeth II.\n\nSo rows 7 and 8 are about Princess Anne. Now, looking at these two rows:\n\nRow 7 has:\n- Name: Anne, princess royal 1950 -\n- Parent: Elizabeth ii 1926 -\n- Date married: 1973 - 1992\n- Husband: mark phillips 1948 -\n\nRow 8 also refers to the same Princess Anne:\n- Same name and parent.\n- Date married: 1992\n- Husband: sir timothy laurence 1955 -\n\nWait, but in row 7, the \"date married\" is listed as 1973 - 1992. That could imply that her marriage to Mark Phillips ended in 1992. Then, in row 8, she was married again in 1992 to Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\nSo this suggests two marriages: one from 1973 to 1992 and another starting in 1992. Therefore, Princess Anne has indeed had two husbands.\n\nBut let me double-check the columns. The \"date married\" column for row 7 is 1973 - 1992, which likely indicates the duration of her first marriage to Mark Phillips. Then, in row 8, she was married again starting in 1992 to Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\nSo both rows are relevant because they show two separate marriages for Princess Anne under Elizabeth II. Each row represents a different husband and the corresponding marriage dates.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Princess Anne has had two husbands is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the table shows Princess Anne having two husbands: Mark Phillips from 1973 to 1992 and Sir Timothy Laurence starting in 1992. The relevant cells are those under the \"husband dates\" column for both rows related to Princess Anne.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"princess louise do not married until she be around 38 year old\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully. It states that Princess Louise didn't marry until she was about 38 years old. So, we're checking her age at marriage and comparing it to 38.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row where the name is \"louise, princess royal\". Scanning through the names:\n\nRow 5: louise, princess royal 1867 - 1931. Okay, that's the one.\n\nNow, let's extract the relevant information from this row. The columns we're interested in are 'date married' and her birth year to calculate her age at marriage.\n\nFrom Row 5:\n- Name: louise, princess royal\n- Date married: 1889\n- Her birth date is given as 1867 - 1931, so she was born in 1867.\n\nCalculating her age when she married in 1889: 1889 minus 1867 equals 22 years old. So, Princess Louise married at the age of 22.\n\nThe claim says she didn't marry until around 38. But according to the table, she married much earlier, at 22. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells in the table that support this conclusion:\n- The row index for Princess Louise is 5 (since counting starts from 0, but looking back, actually, the rows are numbered starting from 1? Wait, no, in the markdown, it's listed as row 5 with order number 5. So row index would be 4 if we start from 0 or 5 as per the given structure. Wait, let me check the table again.\n\nWait, the table has rows labeled from 1 to 7, but when converted into a JSON array, they might be zero-indexed. However, in the provided example, row indices are starting at 0. So for the first row (order 1), it's index 0, order 2 is index 1, etc.\n\nSo Princess Louise is in the fifth data row under 'order' number 5, which would be row index 4 if zero-based or row_index:5 as per the example given in the instructions. Wait, no, looking at the initial table:\n\nThe first row after headers is order 1, so that's row index 0.\n\nSo for Princess Louise (order 5), it should be row index 4.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRows:\nOrder 1: row_index 0\nOrder 2: row_index 1\nOrder 3: row_index 2\nOrder 4: row_index 3\nOrder 5: row_index 4\nOrder 6: row_index 5\nOrder 7: row_index 6 (since there are two entries for order 7, but in the table, they are separate rows. So each row is a separate entry.)\n\nWait no, looking back at the markdown, Order 7 has two rows because Princess Anne has two husbands. So actually, row indices would be:\n\nRow 0: Mary, order 1\nRow 1: Anne, order 2\nRow 2: Charlotte, order3\nRow3: Victoria, order4\nRow4: Louise, order5\nRow5: Mary, order6\nRow6: Anne, first husband (order7)\nRow7: Anne, second husband (order7)\n\nWait that's a bit confusing. But in the table, each row is an individual entry regardless of order number. So for Princess Louise, she's in row 4 (0-based) because the rows are ordered as follows:\n\n0: Mary, order1\n1: Anne, order2\n2: Charlotte, order3\n3: Victoria, order4\n4: Louise, order5\n5: Mary, order6\n6: Anne, first husband\n7: Anne, second husband\n\nBut wait, the table in markdown has two rows for order 7 (Anne), so they are separate rows. So total of 8 rows? Let me count:\n\n1. order1 - row0\n2. order2 - row1\n3. order3 - row2\n4. order4 - row3\n5. order5 - row4\n6. order6 - row5\n7. order7 (first) - row6\n8. order7 (second) - row7\n\nSo for Louise, it's row index 4.\n\nNow, the columns needed are:\n\n- 'name dates' to get her birth year.\n- 'date married' to find when she married.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps checking 'parent' or other info isn't necessary here.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n- row_index: 4, column_name: \"name dates\" (to get birth year)\n- row_index:4, column_name: \"date married\"\n\nWait, but the instructions in the example used row indices starting at 0, so perhaps that's correct.\n\nThus, the two cells needed are:\n\n1. From Louise's row, her name and date to find birth year.\n2. Her marriage date.\n\nSo in the JSON response, we need to specify these as relevant cells.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". So perhaps I don't need to structure it as a full JSON but just provide the conclusion that the claim is false because she married at 22.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the user's initial instruction was about being tasked with this and to explain my thought process step by step, then put final answer in boxed{}.\n\nBut looking back, the initial instructions were:\n\n\"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nSo perhaps I need to conclude whether the claim is true or false. Since she married at 22, the claim that she didn't marry until around 38 is false. So the answer would be False.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the user expects more detailed analysis, but likely it's just a True/False conclusion based on whether she married around 38 or not.\n\nWait, perhaps I should present both pieces of information: her age at marriage and the claim. But given that the question is about verifying the claim, the answer is False because she married at 22, not 38.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{False}\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Princess Louise married around the age of 38, we need to examine her birth year and marriage date. \n\nFrom the table, Princess Louise's details are as follows:\n- Name: louise, princess royal\n- Birth year: 1867\n- Marriage date: 1889\n\nCalculating her age at marriage:\n\\[ 1889 - 1867 = 22 \\]\n\nSince she married at the age of 22, the claim that she didn't marry until around 38 is false.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{False}",

The claim is: \"princess anne of elizabeth be the only princess of the list to have get a divorce.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure and the data it contains. The table lists seven princess royals with various details like their names, dates as princess royal, parents, marriage dates, and husbands.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Mary (row 0): Married in 1641 to William II. No indication of divorce.\n2. Anne (row 1): Married in 1734 to William IV. No mention of divorce here either.\n3. Charlotte (row 2): Married in 1797, no info on divorce.\n4. Victoria (row 3): Married in 1858; nothing about divorce.\n5. Louise (row 4): Married in 1889. Her husband's dates end in 1912, but that doesn't necessarily mean a divorce.\n6. Mary (row 5): Married in 1922; no info on divorce.\n7. Anne (rows 6 and 7): She is the only one listed twice because she was married twice. Her first marriage to Mark Phillips ended in 1992, and then she remarried Timothy Laurence in 1992. So, this suggests a divorce from her first marriage.\n\nNow, checking for other princesses who might have been divorced. Looking at all rows except Anne (rows 0-5), none of them show any indication of being divorced. Their husbands' dates don't suggest anything about the marriages ending before their own deaths, and there's no mention of remarriage except in Anne's case.\n\nTherefore, Princess Anne is indeed the only princess in the list who got a divorce.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"prince mary of charles i die before age 40\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It mentions \"prince mary,\" but looking at the table, all entries are for princesses royal, not princes. That could be a typo, so perhaps it's referring to Mary, Princess Royal.\n\nLooking at the first row of the table:\n- The name is \"mary , princess royal 1631 - 1660.\"\n- Her father is Charles I (1600 - 1649).\n- She was married in 1641 to William II, Prince of Orange.\n\nSo Mary lived from 1631 to 1660.

She died at 29, which is indeed before 40.\n\nNow, checking the relevant cells:\n- The name and dates are in the \"name dates\" column of row 1.\n- Her death date is included there as well.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE based on Mary's lifespan recorded in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"princess mary marry her husband william ii after her 12th birthday\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It states that Princess Mary married William II when she was older than 12 years old.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are two entries for princesses named Mary:\n\nRow 0: mary, princess royal 1631-1660\nRow 6: mary, princess royal 1897-1965\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me check again. The first row is order 1, which is Mary with dates 1631-1660. The last two rows are both about Anne from 1950, so maybe I should look at the other entries.\n\nRow 6 is actually under order 6: mary, princess royal 1897-1965, married in 1922 to Henry Lascelles. But the claim mentions William II as her husband. So the first Mary in row 0 has a husband named William II, Prince of Orange.\n\nSo let's focus on row 0:\n\nName: mary, princess royal 1631-1660\nDate married: 1641\nHusband: william ii, prince of orange 1626-1650\n\nNow, we need to check if Mary was older than 12 when she married in 1641. Her birth year is 1631.\n\nSo subtracting 1631 from 1641 gives 10 years old. Wait, that means she was 10 when she married in 1641. The claim says after her 12th birthday, which would be age 12 or older.\n\nBut according to this, she was only 10 when she married William II. So the claim is incorrect because she married at age 10, not after her 12th birthday.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the date of birth (from name dates) and the date married for row 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Mary married William II after her 12th birthday.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"princess louise marry edward vii before the age of 20\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which row in the table corresponds to Princess Louise. Looking at the table, I see that there are multiple entries for princesses, but only one with the name \"louise\". That's row 5: \n\n| 5 | louise, princess royal 1867 - 1931 | 1905 - 1931 | edward vii 1841 - 1910 | 1889 | alexander duff, 1st duke of fife 1849 - 1912 |\n\nSo, row index is 5.\n\nNext, the claim says that Princess Louise married Edward VII before the age of 20. Let's check when she was born and when she married. \n\nHer dates are given as 1867 - 1931, so she was born in 1867. The date she married is listed as 1889. To find out her age at marriage, I subtract 1867 from 1889: 1889 - 1867 = 22 years old. \n\nSo, she was 22 when she married, which means the claim that she married before the age of 20 is false.\n\nAdditionally, checking the parent column in row 5, her parent is Edward VII (1841-1910), so Princess Louise is his daughter. However, in the table, it's stated that she became princess royal from 1905 to 1931, but her marriage was in 1889, which was before she became princess royal.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"princess louise marry edward vii\". Wait, no\u2014Edward VII is her parent. So actually, Princess Louise married Alexander Duff, not Edward VII. That's another point: the claim incorrectly states that she married Edward VII, but according to the table, her husband was Alexander Duff.\n\nSo, two issues here:\n\n1. The age at marriage: 22 vs before 20.\n2. She didn't marry Edward VII; he's her father.\n\nTherefore, both aspects make the claim FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are in row 5 for name dates (to get her birth year) and date married (to calculate age). Also, the parent column shows that Edward VII is her father, not her husband.\n\nSo, compiling the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 5, \"name dates\" gives her birth year.\n- Row 5, \"date married\" to determine when she married.\n- Maybe also check \"husband dates\" to confirm who she married, but since it's a claim about Edward VII, the parent column is crucial.\n\nBut focusing on what's needed: age and marriage details. So relevant cells are:\n\nRow 5, \"name dates\": to get her birth year (1867) and marriage date (1889).\nRow 5, \"date married\": shows 1889.\nAlso, the parent column in row 5 is Edward VII, which clarifies he's her father.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n{\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date married\"}\n\nWait, but the parent is Edward VII, so that's important to show she didn't marry him. So including that cell makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the name dates and date married are enough to determine age, while parent clarifies who Edward VII was in her life.\n\nSo including all three would be thorough.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Louise married Edward VII before the age of 20.

Single husband listed; no divorce.\n- Row 5: Louise, Princess Royal (1867-1931) - Married Alexander Duff in 1889. One husband only; no mention of divorce.\n- Row 6: Mary, Princess Royal (1897-1965) - Married Henry Lascelles in 1922. Only one husband listed; no divorce indicated.\n- Rows 7 and 8: Anne, Princess Royal (1950-) - Here, there are two entries. She was married to Mark Phillips from 1973 to 1992 and then to Sir Timothy Laurence starting in 1992. The presence of two husbands suggests that her first marriage ended in divorce.\n\nNow, checking how many princesses have a divorce:\n- Only Princess Anne has two marriages listed, which implies at least one divorce. There are no other instances where a princess is shown with more than one husband or any explicit mention of divorce elsewhere in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she is one out of three is incorrect because only she has a recorded divorce. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are three princesses with divorces, but only Princess Anne shows multiple marriages indicating a divorce.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date married\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"husband dates\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"princess mary of charles i die before she turn 25\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Princess Mary, who was the daughter of Charles I, died before reaching 25 years old. My task is to verify this using the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows with princesses named Mary and Anne. Specifically, row 1 mentions \"mary, princess royal 1631 - 1660\" as the daughter of Charles I. So that's the relevant entry for Princess Mary of Charles I.\n\nI need to check her lifespan. The table shows she was born in 1631 and died in 1660. Let me calculate how old she was when she died. Subtracting her birth year from the death year: 1660 - 1631 = 29 years old. So, Princess Mary lived to be 29.\n\nWait a minute, that's more than 25. The claim says she died before turning 25, but according to this, she was 29 when she passed away. Therefore, the claim is not accurate based on the data provided in the table.\n\nNow, I should also check if there are any other entries for Princess Mary that might affect this conclusion. Looking through the rows, I see another entry under row 6: \"mary, princess royal 1897 - 1965.\" But her parent is George V, not Charles I. So that's a different person and doesn't pertain to the claim.\n\nSo, focusing back on row 1, since she died in 1660 at age 29, the claim that she died before 25 is false.\n\nAdditionally, the relevant cells for this determination are her name and parent to identify her correctly, as well as her lifespan. The columns needed are \"name dates,\" \"parent,\" and \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\" which show her birth and death years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Princess Mary of Charles I died before turning 25. According to the table, she was born in 1631 and died in 1660, making her 29 when she passed away. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name dates\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"parent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"princess royal from (date) to (date)\"}\n   ]\n}",
