    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"when arsenal be the opponent , the attendance record be the highest\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that whenever Arsenal was the opponent in a match, the attendance for those matches holds the highest record compared to other opponents.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five rows of data. Each row represents a different match with details like date, round, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows where the opponent is Arsenal. Scanning through the 'opponent' column:\n\n- Row 0: Middlesbrough\n- Row 1: Shrewsbury Town\n- Row 2: Stoke City\n- Row 3: Arsenal\n- Row 4: Arsenal\n\nSo, Arsenal appears as the opponent in rows 3 and 4. Now, I need to check the attendance for these matches.\n\nFor row 3 (date: 8 march 2003), the attendance is 38,104.\nFor row 4 (date: 25 march 2003), the attendance is 41,456.\n\nNow, I need to find out if these are the highest attendances in the table. Let's look at all the attendances:\n\n- Row 0: 2,796\n- Row 1: 7,950\n- Row 2: 26,615\n- Row 3: 38,104\n- Row 4: 41,456\n\nComparing these numbers, the highest attendance is in row 4 with 41,456. So, when Arsenal was the opponent (rows 3 and 4), one of those matches had the highest attendance. However, it's not both; only row 4 is higher than all others.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"when arsenal be the opponent , the attendance record be the highest.\" It doesn't specify that all such games must have the highest attendance, just that when they are opponents, their attendances are the highest. So in this case, Arsenal's matches include both 38,104 and 41,456. The highest overall is 41,456, which occurs when Arsenal was the opponent.\n\nBut then I realize that row 2 has a higher attendance than row 3 but lower than row 4. So, the maximum attendance (41,456) is indeed from an Arsenal match, making it the highest.\n\nWait another thing: Is there any other row with higher attendance than 41,456? No, because that's the last one and it's the highest in the list. Therefore, the claim holds true because when Arsenal was the opponent, at least one of those matches had the highest attendance.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because when Arsenal was the opponent, the attendance reached 41,456, which is the highest in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"Chelsea win all their match in January 2003 and keep a clean sheet as well\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table provided. The table has five rows with details of Chelsea's matches in early 2003. Each row includes the date, round, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Chelsea won all their matches in January 2003.\n2. They kept a clean sheet as well (meaning they didn't concede any goals in those matches).\n\nI need to check each of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the dates first: The first row is on 4 January 2003, and the second on 26 January 2003. These are both in January. The other rows are February and March, so they fall outside our scope for this claim.\n\nNow checking the results:\n- For the match on 4 January: Result is 1 - 0 (Chelsea scored once, opponent zero). So Chelsea won this match.\n- For the match on 26 January: Result is 4 - 0. Again, Chelsea won with a score of four goals to none.\n\nSo both matches in January resulted in wins for Chelsea. That covers the first part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking if they kept a clean sheet. A clean sheet means Chelsea didn't concede any goals. Looking at the results:\n- Both matches have opponent scores as 0 (1 - 0 and 4 - 0). So yes, they didn't let in any goals in either match.\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: They won all their January matches (there were two) and kept clean sheets in those games. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI'll need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion.\n\nThe relevant rows are the first and second ones (indexes 0 and 1). The columns I need to look at for each are 'result' and 'date'. \n\nSo the relevant_cells list will include:\n- Row index 0, column 'date' to confirm it's January.\n- Row index 0, column 'result' to show they won without conceding.\n- Row index 1, column 'date' again to check it's still in January.\n- Row index 1, column 'result' for the same reason.\n\nThat covers both matches in January and confirms their outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about Chelsea's matches in February 2003. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"chelsea have only 1 match in february 2003 which be against stoke city and chelsea lose to stoke city.\" So there are two main points here. The first part states that Chelsea had only one match in February 2003, and it was against Stoke City. The second part says that Chelsea lost that match.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided. Let's go through each row and check for matches in February 2003. \n\nLooking at the first row: date is 4 January 2003. That's in January, so it doesn't fall into February.\n\nSecond row: 26 January 2003. Again, that's still in January, not February.\n\nThird row: 16 February 2003. This falls within February, so this is relevant. The opponent here is Stoke City, and the result is 0-2. Since Chelsea scored 0 and the opponent scored 2, Chelsea lost this match.\n\nFourth row: 8 March 2003. That's in March, so not relevant for February.\n\nFifth row: 25 March 2003. Also in March, so again, not part of February matches.\n\nSo from the table, there is only one match in February 2003, which was against Stoke City, and Chelsea lost that match. That aligns perfectly with both parts of the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other rows that might fall into February. Scanning through, I can confirm that all other dates are either before or after February. \n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the claim step by step. The claim states: \"terry score both match against arsenal but chelsea win non of the match.\" So there are two main parts here: whether Terry scored in both matches against Arsenal and whether Chelsea won none of those matches.\n\nFirst, I'll look for all matches where the opponent is Arsenal. Scanning through the table, I see two entries with \"arsenal\" as the opponent. The first one is on March 8, 2003, in the quarter-finals (qf) at an away venue, and the second is a replay on March 25, 2003, at home.\n\nLooking at the scorers for these matches:\n\n1. For the first match (row index 3), Terry scored once.\n2. In the replay (row index 4), Terry also scored once.\n\nSo, Terry did score in both matches against Arsenal. That part of the claim checks out.\n\nNext, checking the results to see if Chelsea won any of these matches:\n\n1. The first match on March 8 ended in a draw with a result of 2-2.\n2. The replay on March 25 resulted in a loss for Chelsea with a score of 1-3.\n\nTherefore, Chelsea did not win either of the two matches against Arsenal. This part of the claim is also accurate.\n\nSince both conditions of the claim are supported by the data in the table, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"scorers\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"scorers\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"Chelsea play more away matches between 26 January 2003 and 8 March 2003\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the dates mentioned in the claim: from 26 January 2003 to 8 March 2003. So, any matches within this timeframe are relevant. The table has five rows, each representing a different match with various details like date, round, opponent, venue, result, attendance, and scorers.\n\nNext, I'll identify the rows that fall between these dates. Looking at the 'date' column:\n\n1. 4 January 2003: This is before 26 January, so it's outside the timeframe.\n2. 26 January 2003: This is exactly the start date, so it's included.\n3. 16 February 2003: This falls within the timeframe.\n4. 8 March 2003: Exactly the end date, included.\n5. 25 March 2003: After the end date, so excluded.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are indexes 1 (26 Jan), 2 (16 Feb), and 3 (8 Mar).\n\nNow, focusing on these three matches, I need to check how many of them were away games. The 'venue' column indicates whether it's a home ('h') or away ('a') game.\n\nLooking at each relevant row:\n\n- Row 1: Venue is 'a', so it's an away match.\n- Row 2: Venue is 'a', another away match.\n- Row 3: Venue is 'a', third away match.\n\nSo, all three matches within the specified timeframe were played away. There are no home games in this period based on the table provided.\n\nTherefore, Chelsea played more away matches (three) than home matches (zero) between those dates.

The claim is: \"when stoke city be the opponent , the attendance record be the lowest.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim states that when Stoke City was the opponent in a match, the attendance for that game was the lowest among all the games listed.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to identify which opponents are Stoke City and check their corresponding attendances.\n\nThe table has five rows:\n\n1. 4 January 2003: Opponent is Middlesbrough. Attendance is 2796.\n2. 26 January 2003: Opponent is Shrewsbury Town. Attendance is 7950.\n3. 16 February 2003: Opponent is Stoke City. Attendance is 26615.\n4. 8 March 2003: Opponent is Arsenal. Attendance is 38104.\n5. 25 March 2003: Opponent is Arsenal again. Attendance is 41456.\n\nNow, I'm specifically interested in the row where the opponent is Stoke City. That's row index 2 (since indexing starts at 0). The attendance for that match was 26,615.\n\nNext, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest attendance. Comparing all attendances:\n\n- Middlesbrough: 2796\n- Shrewsbury Town: 7950\n- Stoke City: 26615\n- Arsenal (8 March): 38104\n- Arsenal (25 March): 41456\n\nWait a second, the attendance for Middlesbrough was only 2796, which is much lower than Stoke City's 26615. So, the lowest attendance wasn't when Stoke City was the opponent but actually when they played against Middlesbrough.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Stoke City being the opponent resulted in the lowest attendance is incorrect. The relevant cell here is row index 2, column \"attendance\" because that's where Stoke City's attendance is listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"chelsea lose all their match in 8 march 2003 and keep a clean shit as well.\" Hmm, first off, let's parse this sentence carefully.\n\nI notice that the user wrote \"lose all their match\" \u2013 I think they meant Chelsea lost a specific match on March 8, 2003. Also, the phrase \"keep a clean shit\" seems a bit odd; maybe it was a typo or slang. But in the context of sports, especially football/soccer, a \"clean sheet\" means that the team didn't concede any goals in the match. So I think they meant Chelsea kept a clean sheet.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the row corresponding to March 8, 2003. Scanning the 'date' column, yes, there's an entry on 8 march 2003. Let's see what that row says.\n\nThe relevant cells here are:\n- date: 8 march 2003\n- result: 2 - 2\n- scorers: terry, lampard\n\nSo the result is 2-2. That means both Chelsea and Arsenal scored two goals each. Wait a second \u2013 if the result is 2-2, that's a draw, not a loss for Chelsea. So the first part of the claim says Chelsea lost all their match on that date, which isn't correct because they drew.\n\nNext, about keeping a clean sheet. A clean sheet would mean Chelsea didn't concede any goals. But in this case, Arsenal scored two goals, so Chelsea did concede. Therefore, they definitely didn't keep a clean sheet; in fact, the opposite happened.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are incorrect. They didn't lose (they drew), and they didn't keep a clean sheet because they conceded twice. \n\nTherefore, the entire claim is FALSE.

Venue is 'a' (away), so again, not a home game.\n4. **Row 3**: Date is 8 March 2003. This falls within the period. Venue is 'a' (away).\n5. **Row 4**: Date is 25 March 2003. That's after 10 March, so it doesn't count.\n\nNow, counting home matches between 25 Jan and 10 March:\n- No rows in that timeframe have a venue marked as 'h'. \n\nTherefore, Chelsea did not play any home matches during the specified period, making the claim FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
