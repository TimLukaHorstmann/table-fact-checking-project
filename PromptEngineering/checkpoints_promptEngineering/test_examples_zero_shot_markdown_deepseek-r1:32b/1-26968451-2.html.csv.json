    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"michael lembeck direct series number 39, fly solo\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Michael Lembeck as the director. Looking at the table, I see that there's a column labeled \"directed by :\". All entries in this column are Michael Lembeck except for maybe some typos or variations, but looking through the data, every row under \"directed by :\" is indeed Michael Lembeck. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the claim talks about series number 39. I should look at the \"series\" column to find which row has series number 39. Scanning down the table, I see that row index 12 (since counting starts from 0) corresponds to series number 39. The title for that series is \"flying solo\", which matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo putting it together: Series number 39 is directed by Michael Lembeck and has the title \"flying solo\". Both parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any details. Let me double-check each part:\n\n- Directed by: Yes, it's Michael Lembeck.\n- Series number: 39 is correct.\n- Title: \"flying solo\" matches exactly.\n\nNo discrepancies found. So the claim holds true based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"directed by :\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"series number 39 be write by michael lembeck\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is about series number 39 and whether it was written by Michael Lembeck. From the table headers, I see columns for \"series,\" \"written by,\" and others.\n\nI should start by finding the row where the series number is 39. Looking at the table, each row starts with a series number. Scanning down, I find that series number 39 is in row 12 (counting from 0). Let me confirm: rows go from 0 to 48? Wait, no, actually, looking back, the table has multiple entries starting from series 27 up to 49. So each row represents a different episode or season.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let's recount:\n\nRow 0: Series 27\nRow 1: Series 28\n...\nEach subsequent row increments the series number by one. So series 39 should be at row index 12 because 39 - 27 = 12, so row 12.\n\nNow, looking at row 12 (series 39), I need to check who wrote it. The \"written by\" column in that row is Lesley Rieder. So the writer for series 39 is not Michael Lembeck but Lesley Rieder.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm looking at the right columns. The table has the following columns: series, season, title, directed by, written by, original airdate.\n\nSo in row 12 (series 39), \"written by\" is Lesley Rieder. Therefore, Michael Lembeck did not write this episode; he was the director as per the \"directed by\" column.\n\nTherefore, the claim that series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck is false because the writer listed is someone else.\n\nSo to sum up, the relevant cells are in row 12 for both \"series\" and \"written by\". The series matches (39), but the writer does not match Michael Lembeck.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that series number 39 was written by Michael Lembeck. Checking the table, series 39 is in row 12. The \"written by\" column for this row shows Lesley Rieder, not Michael Lembeck.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Row:** Look for the row where \"series\" equals 39.\n   - Found at row index 12 (since series starts at 27 in row 0).\n\n2. **Check Writer Information:**\n   - The \"written by\" column in this row lists Lesley Rieder.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Michael Lembeck is not listed as the writer, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant Cells:**\n- Row 12, \"series\"\n- Row 12, \"written by\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
