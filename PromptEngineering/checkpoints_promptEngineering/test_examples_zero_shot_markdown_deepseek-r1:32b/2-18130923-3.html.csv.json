So they are indeed tied for fifth position together.\n\nNext, checking their scores: both have a total score of 283 and a to par of -5. This confirms that their performance is identical in terms of the metrics provided in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'money' column, both players have $60,000, which indicates they are tied not just in placement but also in earnings for that position.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by all these data points.

His total score is 282.\n- John Huston is tied for 7th place (t7). His total score is 284.\n\nWait a second, higher number score means a larger numerical value? Or does it mean better performance in golf where lower scores are better? Since the claim says \"higher number score,\" I think it refers to the actual numerical value. So 284 is higher than 282.\n\nSo according to that, John Huston's score (284) is indeed higher numerically than Kenny Knox's score (282). Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut let me double-check the table again to ensure I didn't mix up any numbers. Yes, Kenny has 282 and John has 284. So the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that John Huston received a higher numerical score than Kenny Knox. From the table, John Huston's total score is 284, while Kenny Knox's is 282.

Looking at the place column, Kenny Knox is in row 3 with a score of 282, while John Huston is in row 7 (tied for 7th place) with a score of 284.\n\nNow, I need to compare their scores. The claim says that Kenny's score is higher than John's. But according to the table, Kenny has 282 and John has 284. Since 282 is less than 284, Kenny actually has a lower score. Wait, but in golf, a lower score is better because it means fewer strokes. However, the claim is about the numerical value of the scores, not their ranking or quality.\n\nSo, numerically, 282 is less than 284. Therefore, Kenny's score isn't higher; John's is higher. This makes the claim false.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells: for Kenny Knox, it's row 3 under 'score,' and for John Huston, it's row 7 under 'score.'

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"steve pate represent a different country than craig stadler\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying.
