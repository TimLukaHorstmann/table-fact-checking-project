    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the friendly competition on 26 may 1999 take place at lugo , emilia - romagna\". \n\nFirst, I'll look for rows in the table where the date matches 26 May 1999. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- Row 10: 8 June 1995\n- Row 17: 26 May 1999 (found a match)\n- Other rows have different dates.\n\nSo, row 17 is the relevant one. Now, checking the details in this row:\n\n- 'goal': 17? No, it's actually goal=17? Wait, no\u2014looking again, the goal column for row 17 is 17, but that's probably not important here.\n- Date: 26 May 1999 (matches)\n- Venue: lugo , emilia - romagna (as per the claim)\n- Competition: friendly\n\nThe claim mentions a \"friendly\" competition, which aligns with the 'competition' column in row 17. The venue also matches exactly.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. So, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"lugo  , emilia  - romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 may 1999 and the result be 2  - 4.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Venue**: lugo, emilia-romagna\n2. **Competition**: friendly\n3. **Date**: 26 May 1999\n4. **Result**: 2-4\n\nNow, I need to check these details against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has columns: goal, date, venue, result, competition, scored. There are 28 rows listed (indexes 0 to 27).\n\nLet's go through each relevant part:\n\n- **Date**: The claim mentions 26 May 1999. I'll scan the 'date' column for this exact date.\n  \n  Scanning down:\n  \n  Row 17: Date is \"26 may 1999\". That's a match.\n\nNow, let's check the other details for row 17 (assuming rows start at index 0):\n\n- **Venue**: The claim says \"lugo , emilia - romagna\". Looking at row 17's 'venue' column: it's listed as \"lugo , emilia  - romagna\". That matches exactly.\n\n- **Competition**: The claim states the competition was a friendly. Checking row 17's 'competition' column: it says \"friendly\". Correct.\n\n- **Result**: Claimed result is 2-4. Looking at the 'result' column in row 17, it shows \"1 - 4\". Wait, that's different. The claim says 2-4, but the table shows 1-4.\n\nWait a minute, there might be confusion here. Let me double-check:\n\nRow index 17 (assuming zero-based indexing) would actually correspond to row number 18 in the table as presented because counting starts from 0. Wait no, let's recount properly.\n\nLooking back at the table structure provided, it's presented with rows starting from \"goal\" as the first data row, which is index 0. Let me list them numerically:\n\nRow 0: goal=3, date=25 sep 1993...\nRow 1: goal=5, date=6 nov 1993...\n... up to Row 27.\n\nSo for the date \"26 may 1999\", let me find which row that is. Looking through each 'date' in order:\n\n- Row 0: 25 sep 1993\n- ...\n- Row 10: 8 june 1995\n- Row 11: 19 nov 1995\n- Row 12: 23 may 1998\n- Row 13: 13 sep 1998\n- Row 14: 11 oct 1998\n- Row 15: 26 may 1999\n\nAh, so Row 15 is the one with date \"26 may 1999\".\n\nNow checking Row 15:\n\n- Venue: \"lugo , emilia - romagna\" \u2013 matches.\n- Competition: \"friendly\" \u2013 correct.\n- Result: According to the table, it's listed as \"1 - 4\". The claim says \"result be 2 - 4\", which is different.\n\nTherefore, the result in the table doesn't match the claim. Since one of the conditions (the result) isn't satisfied, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are those from Row 15 for date, venue, competition, and result.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while the venue, competition, and date match, the result in the table is \"1-4\" instead of the claimed \"2-4\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
