    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"justin rose be from the united state\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by carefully examining the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there's a column labeled \"player\" and another labeled \"country.\" The claim is about Justin Rose's nationality, so I should check where his row is in the table.\n\nI see that Justin Rose is listed in the fifth row (row index 4 if we start counting from zero). Under the country column, it says \"england.\" Hmm, wait a minute. The claim says he's from the United States, but according to this table, his country is England. That means the claim isn't correct based on the information provided.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check the relevant cells. Justin Rose's row has \"justin rose (a)\" under player and \"england\" under country. So, both pieces of information are clear. There's no conflicting data elsewhere in the table regarding his nationality; all other entries have their countries listed accordingly.\n\nTherefore, since the claim states he is from the United States but the table shows England, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells to support this conclusion are Justin Rose's player name and his country of origin.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"danish thomas bj\u00f8rn rank lower than tiger wood\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify the relevant columns for this claim. The key pieces of information needed are the players' ranks and their nationalities to ensure we're talking about the correct Thomas Bj\u00f8rn.\n\nLooking at the \"place\" column, I see that Thomas Bj\u00f8rn is listed in row 6 with a place of t6, which stands for tied for 6th position. Tiger Woods is also listed in the same place (t6) in row 9. So both are tied at rank 6.\n\nNext, checking their nationalities: Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's country is Denmark, as shown in row 6 under the \"country\" column. Tiger Woods is from the United States, according to row 9.\n\nNow, the claim states that Danish Thomas Bj\u00f8rn has a lower rank than Tiger Woods. However, since both are listed with the same place (t6), their ranks are equal, not one higher or lower than the other. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because they have the same rank, not a lower one for Bj\u00f8rn.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I'll note the relevant cells from the table:\n- Thomas Bj\u00f8rn's place: row 6, \"place\" column.\n- Tiger Woods' place: row 9, \"place\" column.\n- Nationalities to confirm identity: row 6 and 9 under \"country\".\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is FALSE because their ranks are equal, not lower for Thomas Bj\u00f8rn.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"place\"}\n   ]\n}",
