    "claim": "the blazer have a record of 9 - 5 during this stretch",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the blazer have a record of 9 - 5 during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the Blazers (a basketball team, likely the Portland Trail Blazers) had a win-loss record of 9 wins and 5 losses during this particular stretch of games as shown in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like the date, opponent, score, high points, rebounds, location attendance, and the team's record after that game. The relevant column here is \"record,\" which shows the win-loss record after each game.\n\nI need to examine all the games listed in the table and sum up how many wins (W) and losses (L) the Blazers have. Each row's \"score\" indicates whether it was a win or loss with a 'w' for win and 'l' for loss. However, the claim is about their overall record during this stretch, so I should look at each game result to count the number of wins and losses.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 33: Lost (L) \u2192 Loss\n2. Game 34: Lost (L) \u2192 Loss\n3. Game 35: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n4. Game 36: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n5. Game 37: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n6. Game 38: Lost (L) \u2192 Loss\n7. Game 39: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n8. Game 40: Lost (L) \u2192 Loss\n9. Game 41: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n10. Game 42: Lost (L) \u2192 Loss\n11. Game 43: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n12. Game 44: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n13. Game 45: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n14. Game 46: Won (W) \u2192 Win\n\nNow, counting the wins and losses:\n\nWins: Let's count each 'w' in the score column.\n- Game 35: W\n- Game 36: W\n- Game 37: W\n- Game 39: W\n- Game 41: W\n- Game 43: W\n- Game 44: W\n- Game 45: W\n- Game 46: W\n\nThat's a total of 9 wins.\n\nLosses: Each 'l' in the score column.\n- Game 33: L\n- Game 34: L\n- Game 38: L\n- Game 40: L\n- Game 42: L\n\nThat's a total of 5 losses.\n\nSo, adding these up, the Blazers have 9 wins and 5 losses in this stretch. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to determine which cells are relevant for verification, I need to look at each row's \"score\" and \"record\" columns because they indicate whether it was a win or loss and how it affected their overall record. However, since the claim is about the total record during the stretch, looking at all the games' results (each 'w' or 'l') in the \"score\" column is sufficient to count the total wins and losses.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should identify which cells are relevant. Each row has a \"record\" column that shows their cumulative record after each game. The last row (Game 46) ends with a record of 29-17, but looking at all rows isn't necessary because we can count from the 'w' and 'l's.\n\nWait, actually, to accurately determine if the Blazers have a 9-5 record during this stretch, I need to know how many games they won and lost in total. The \"record\" column is cumulative, so each row shows their standing after that game. But looking at all rows might not be necessary; instead, just count from each game's result.\n\nHowever, since the user instruction says to check which cells are relevant, I think it refers to the 'score' column indicating win or loss for each game. So, each cell in the \"score\" column (each row) is relevant because we need to sum up all wins and losses across these games.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be every row's \"score\" column since each one tells us whether it was a win or loss contributing to their overall record during this stretch.\n\nTherefore, my answer is TRUE with all 14 rows' \"score\" columns being relevant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"joel pryzbilla have more rebound in 1 game (17) than any other blazer player.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is saying. It's asserting that Joel Przybilla had a single game where he grabbed 17 rebounds, and that this number is higher than any other rebound total by any Blazer player in any of their games during these 46 games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, team played against, score, high points, high rebounds, location attendance, and record. The columns relevant here are \"high rebounds\" for each game since that's where we can find the highest rebound counts by Blazer players in each game.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the \"high rebounds\" column:\n\n1. Game 33: lamarcus aldridge (10)\n2. Game 34: lamarcus aldridge (11)\n3. Game 35: joel przybilla (7)\n4. Game 36: greg oden (8)\n5. Game 37: greg oden (13)\n6. Game 38: lamarcus aldridge, joel przybilla (9)\n7. Game 39: joel przybilla (11)\n8. Game 40: joel przybilla (10)\n9. Game 41: greg oden (15)\n10. Game 42: joel przybilla (15)\n11. Game 43: greg oden (14)\n12. Game 44: joel przybilla (8)\n13. Game 45: greg oden (14)\n14. Game 46: joel przybilla (17)\n\nFrom this, I notice that in game 46, Joel Przybilla had 17 rebounds, which is the highest number listed for any single game by a Blazer player.\n\nNow, to check if there's any other player with 17 or more rebounds. Looking through all games, no other player has even reached 17 rebounds in a single game except for Przybilla in game 46. The next closest is Greg Oden with 15 and 14 rebounds in different games.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds because Joel Przybilla did have more rebounds (17) in one game than any other Blazer player had in any of their games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Joel Przybilla achieved the highest rebound count of 17 in a single game, surpassing all other Blazer players' rebounds in each respective game.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 45, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the lowest attendance figure for any game is 13824\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the table.\n\nFirst, the table has a column called \"location attendance.\" This is where I should look to find the attendance figures for each game. The claim says that 13824 is the lowest attendance figure in any of these games. So my task is to go through each row and check the value in the \"location attendance\" column to see if 13824 is indeed the smallest number.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start from the top. The first few rows have attendances like 20708, 18997, 20644, etc. These are all higher than 13824. As I move down, on row 7 (which is index 6 because counting starts from 0), I see the attendance is 13824 at the Izod Center against New Jersey. That seems like a candidate for the lowest.\n\nBut to be thorough, I'll check all the other rows. Let's see: after that, there are attendances of 17482, 20580, 20632, 20566, 16570, 20380, and 20593. Wait a minute\u2014oh no, I think I might have made a mistake here because one of these numbers is actually lower than 13824. Looking again at row 7 (index 6), it's 13824. But looking further down, in row 45 (which is index 44 if starting from 0?), no, wait the rows are listed as games 33 to 46, so let me count properly.\n\nWait, actually, I should clarify: the table starts with game 33 on January 2 and goes up to game 46 on January 31. So row indices go from 0 to 12 (since there are 14 games). Let's recount:\n\nRow 0: game 33, attendance 20708\nRow 1: game 34, 18997\nRow 2: game 35, 20644\nRow 3: game 36, 20687\nRow 4: game 37, 18996\nRow 5: game 38, 14561\nRow 6: game 39, 13824\nRow 7: game 40, 17482\nRow 8: game 41, 20580\nRow 9: game 42, 20632\nRow 10: game 43, 20566\nRow 11: game 44, 16570\nRow 12: game 45, 20380\nRow 13: game 46, 20593\n\nWait a second, in row 5 (game 38), the attendance is 14561. That's actually lower than 13824? No, wait no\u201414561 is higher than 13824 because 14k vs 13k. So row 6 has the lowest so far with 13824.\n\nBut then looking further down, in row 11 (game 44), it's 16570\u2014that's still higher than 13824. Wait no\u2014wait, 16570 is higher than 13k but lower than some others. So the lowest is 13824.\n\nWait, did I miss any other number? Let me check all attendances:\n\n20708 (row 0)\n18997 (row1)\n20644 (row2)\n20687 (row3)\n18996 (row4)\n14561 (row5)\n13824 (row6)\n17482 (row7)\n20580 (row8)\n20632 (row9)\n20566 (row10)\n16570 (row11)\n20380 (row12)\n20593 (row13)\n\nSo yes, 13824 is the smallest number among all these. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because 13824 is indeed the lowest attendance figure in any of the games listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance was 13824. By examining each game's attendance in the \"location attendance\" column, we find that the smallest value is indeed 13824 at row index 6.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, my task is to check each game and see if Brandon Roy's rebounds were higher than anyone else on his team for that particular game.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the \"high rebounds\" column because that indicates who led the team in rebounds for each game.

So Brandon Roy isn't listed here.\n- **Row 6 (Game 39):** joel prybibilla has 11 rebounds.\n- **Row 7 (Game 40):** joel prybibilla leads with 10.\n- **Row 8 (Game 41):** greg oden tops with 15 rebounds.\n- **Row 9 (Game 42):** joel prybibilla has 15, the highest for that game.\n- **Row 10 (Game 43):** greg oden led with 14.\n- **Row 11 (Game 44):** joel prybibilla leads with 8 rebounds.\n- **Row 12 (Game 45):** greg oden tops with 14 again.\n- **Row 13 (Game 46):** joel prybibilla has the highest at 17.\n\nIn none of these rows does Brandon Roy appear under the \"high rebounds\" column.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the blazer have fewer win and more loss during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like 'game', 'date', 'team', 'score', etc., but the most relevant column for determining wins and losses is probably the 'record' column. The 'record' shows the team's win-loss record after each game.\n\nI notice that in the 'record' column, each entry is in the format \"wins - losses\". For example, row 0 has \"20 - 13\", which means 20 wins and 13 losses up to that point. As we go down the rows, the numbers change incrementally.\n\nTo assess if there are more losses than wins during this stretch, I'll need to look at how the record changes from game to game. Let's examine each row:\n\n- Game 33: Record is 20-13 (wins > losses)\n- Game 34: 20-14 (wins still greater, but losses increased by 1)\n- Game 35: 21-14 (still more wins)\n- Game 36: 22-14\n- Game 37: 23-14\n- Game 38: 23-15 (wins still lead, but losses increased by 1 again)\n- Game 39: 24-15\n- Game 40: 24-16\n- Game 41: 25-16\n- Game 42: 25-17\n- Game 43: 26-17\n- Game 44: 27-17\n- Game 45: 28-17\n- Game 46: 29-17\n\nLooking through each game, the wins consistently increase or stay ahead of losses. At no point in this stretch do the losses exceed the number of wins. The final record after all these games is 29 wins and 17 losses, which clearly shows more wins than losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"the blazer have fewer win and more loss during this stretch\" is FALSE because throughout the games listed, the Blazers have more wins than losses.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Blazers had fewer wins and more losses, but examining each game's record shows consistent increases in wins over losses. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"Joel Prazybilla have the highest rebound in game 36 than any other blazer player.\" \n\nFirst, I'll check which row corresponds to Game 36. Looking at the 'game' column, I see that game 36 is on row index 3 (since rows are zero-indexed). The row for game 36 has the following details: date january 10, team golden state, score w 113-100 (ot), high points lamarcus aldridge (26), high rebounds greg oden (8), location attendance rose garden 20687, record 22-14.\n\nThe claim mentions Joel Prazybilla. Wait, in the table, I see 'joel przybilla' spelled that way. So there might be a typo in the claim; perhaps it's meant to refer to him.\n\nLooking at the 'high rebounds' column for game 36, it says greg oden (8). That means Greg Oden had the highest rebounds with 8. Joel Przybilla is mentioned in other games but not in this one. For example, in game 35, his rebounds were 7, and in game 37, he didn't have high rebounds listed.\n\nSo in game 36, Greg Oden had the highest rebounds (8). Therefore, Joel Przybilla did not have the highest rebounds; someone else did. So the claim is FALSE because it's incorrect that he had the highest rebounds in that game compared to others on the Blazers team.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because, according to the table, Greg Oden had the highest rebounds (8) in Game 36.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the lowest attendance figure for any game be less than 13824\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, location attendance, and record. So, the relevant column here is \"location attendance.\"\n\nI need to check each row's attendance figure to find the lowest one. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0 (game 33): Rose Garden with 20708\nRow 1 (game 34): Staples Center with 18997\nRow 2 (game 35): Rose Garden with 20644\nRow 3 (game 36): Rose Garden with 20687\nRow 4 (game 37): United Center with 18996\nRow 5 (game 38): Wachovia Center with 14561\nRow 6 (game 39): Izod Center with 13824\nRow 7 (game 40): Time Warner Cable Arena with 17482\nRow 8 (game 41): Rose Garden with 20580\nRow 9 (game 42): Rose Garden with 20632\nRow 10 (game 43): Rose Garden with 20566\nRow 11 (game 44): Staples Center with 16570\nRow 12 (game 45): Rose Garden with 20380\nRow 13 (game 46): Rose Garden with 20593\n\nLooking at these numbers, the smallest attendance is in row 6, which is 13824. The claim states that the lowest attendance should be less than 13824. Since 13824 is equal to the figure mentioned, not less than, the claim isn't true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there's no game with attendance lower than 13824; the lowest is exactly that number.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows the location attendances for each game. The smallest value is 13824 in row 6 (game 39). Since 13824 is not less than 13824, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"Brandon Roy score the fewest point of any other player\" is true or false based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that Brandon Roy scored fewer points than any other player mentioned in the table. So, I should check all the high points entries and see if Brandon's points are indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"high points\" column which shows the top scorer for that game along with their points. Let me go through each game to note down the players and their scores:\n\n- Game 33: Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez (19)\n- Game 34: LaMarcus Aldridge (22)\n- Game 35: LaMarcus Aldridge (26)\n- Game 36: LaMarcus Aldridge (26)\n- Game 37: Travis Outlaw (33)\n- Game 38: Brandon Roy (27)\n- Game 39: Brandon Roy (29)\n- Game 40: LaMarcus Aldridge (21)\n- Game 41: Greg Oden (24)\n- Game 42: Brandon Roy (23)\n- Game 43: Brandon Roy (22)\n- Game 44: Brandon Roy (33)\n- Game 45: LaMarcus Aldridge (25)\n- Game 46: Brandon Roy (30)\n\nNow, let's compile all the points for each player:\n\n- Brandon Roy scored in games 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, and 46 with points: 27, 29, 23, 22, 33, 30.\n- LaMarcus Aldridge has several high point entries: 19, 22, 26, 26, 21, 25. Wait, in game 34 he scored 22, and that's higher than some of Brandon's scores. So for example, when Roy scored 27, Aldridge had 22 earlier.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. In each game, the high points are listed, so if LaMarcus Aldridge is listed with 19 in game 34, that means he was the top scorer for that game. But Brandon Roy's scores in his games: like in game 38, he had 27, but in other games, he had lower and higher scores.\n\nWait no, actually, the claim is about whether Brandon Roy scored the fewest points compared to any other player across all high point entries. So I need to see if all of Brandon's high points are the lowest among all players listed.\n\nLooking at each occurrence:\n\n- Game 38: Brandon 27 vs others? In this game, he was the top scorer with 27.\n- Game 39: 29\n- Game 42: 23\n- Game 43: 22 (this is lower than some of his other scores)\n- Game 44: 33\n- Game 46: 30\n\nNow, looking at all high points across the table:\n\nThe lowest point in any game's high points was 19 by Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez. So Brandon Roy didn't score 19; he scored higher than that.\n\nWait no, actually, let me check each player's highest and lowest scores from their high point entries.\n\nBrandon Roy's high points: 27, 29, 23, 22, 33, 30. So the minimum is 22 in game 43.\n\nOther players:\n\n- Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez: only once at 19.\n- LaMarcus Aldridge: his scores include 19 (game 33?), wait no, let me check each row again.\n\nLooking back at the table rows:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 13. Let's map them properly:\n\nRow 0: Game 33 - Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez (19)\nRow 1: Game 34 - LaMarcus Aldridge (22)\nRow 2: Game 35 - LaMarcus Aldridge (26)\nRow 3: Game 36 - LaMarcus Aldridge (26)\nRow 4: Game 37 - Travis Outlaw (33)\nRow 5: Game 38 - Brandon Roy (27)\nRow 6: Game 39 - Brandon Roy (29)\nRow 7: Game 40 - LaMarcus Aldridge (21)\nRow 8: Game 41 - Greg Oden (24)\nRow 9: Game 42 - Brandon Roy (23)\nRow 10: Game 43 - Brandon Roy (22)\nRow 11: Game 44 - Brandon Roy (33)\nRow 12: Game 45 - LaMarcus Aldridge (25)\nRow 13: Game 46 - Brandon Roy (30)\n\nSo, from this:\n\nBrandon's high points are in rows 5-6-9-10-11-13.\n\nHis scores are: 27, 29, 23, 22, 33, 30. So his minimum is 22.\n\nOthers:\n\nRudy Fern\u00e1ndez only has 19 (row 0).\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge has 22 (row1), 26 (row2), 26 (row3), 21 (row7), 25 (row12). So his scores include 21, which is lower than Brandon's minimum of 22.\n\nTravis Outlaw: only 33 in row4.\n\nGreg Oden: 24 in row8.\n\nSo, looking at all high points across the table:\n\nThe lowest score is 19 by Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez. Then LaMarcus Aldridge has a 21 (row7). Brandon's minimum is 22 (row10).\n\nTherefore, Brandon Roy did not have the fewest points because others scored lower than him in some games.\n\nSo, the claim says \"Brandon Roy score the fewest point of any other player.\" But since others like Rudy and LaMarcus have lower scores in their respective games, this is false.\n\nTo answer correctly, I need to check if Brandon's high points are always higher than all others. Since he has a 22 as his lowest, but others scored lower (19,21), the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because other players like Rudy Fern\u00e1ndez and LaMarcus Aldridge scored fewer points in their respective games compared to Brandon Roy's minimum of 22.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"joel przybilla do not lead the team in rebound in any game\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each column represents in the table. The columns are: game number, date, opponent team, score (with result), high points, high rebounds, location and attendance, and record. So, the key columns here for checking the claim are \"high rebounds\".\n\nThe claim is about Joel Przybilla not leading the team in rebounds in any of these games. To verify this, I need to check each game's \"high rebounds\" column and see if Joel is listed there.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Game 33: High rebounds by Lamarcus Aldridge (10)\n2. Game 34: Again, Lamarcus Aldridge with 11\n3. Game 35: High rebounds here are by Joel Przybilla with 7\n   - Wait a minute, this is the first instance where Joel leads in rebounds.\n\nSo immediately, I see that in game 35, Joel did lead in rebounds. That directly contradicts the claim, so the claim should be false.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check all other games:\n\n4. Game 36: Greg Oden with 8\n5. Game 37: Greg Oden again (13)\n6. Game 38: Both Lamarcus Aldridge and Joel Przybilla share with 9 each.\n   - Hmm, does sharing count as leading? If the claim is about being the sole leader, then maybe not. But if it's about at least leading in any capacity (including ties), then this might still matter.\n\nWait, the claim says \"do not lead\", so if he led even once, the claim is false. So from game 35 alone, we can conclude that the claim is false because he did lead in rebounds there.\n\nLooking further:\n\n7. Game 39: Joel again with 11\n8. Game 40: Joel leads with 10\n9. Game 41: Greg Oden (15)\n10. Game 42: Joel with 15\n11. Game 43: Greg Oden (14)\n12. Game 44: Joel Przybilla with 8\n13. Game 45: Greg Oden (14)\n14. Game 46: Joel leads with 17\n\nSo in multiple games, Joel led the team in rebounds. Therefore, the claim is definitely false.\n\nThe relevant cells are where Joel's name appears under \"high rebounds\". Each of these rows shows that he did lead in rebounds at least once.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
