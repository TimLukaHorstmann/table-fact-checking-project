    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the team with 3 loss have 0 tie\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for each team's games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for, and goals against. The claim mentions teams with 3 losses having 0 ties. So my task is to check each row in the table where the number of losses is 3 and see if their ties are indeed 0.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Montreal Hockey Club: They have 5 wins, 3 losses, and 0 ties.\n2. Ottawa Hockey Club: Also has 5 wins, 3 losses, and 0 ties.\n3. Montreal Victorias: Same here\u20145 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties.\n4. Quebec Hockey Club: Again, 5 wins, 3 losses, 0 ties.\n5. Montreal Crystals: This team stands out with 8 losses, so they don't fit the claim.\n\nSo for each of the first four teams, when they have 3 losses, their ties are indeed 0. The fifth team has more than 3 losses and isn't relevant to this claim.\n\nTherefore, since all teams with exactly 3 losses have 0 ties, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because every team listed with exactly 3 losses has 0 ties.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ties\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"losses\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"ties\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
