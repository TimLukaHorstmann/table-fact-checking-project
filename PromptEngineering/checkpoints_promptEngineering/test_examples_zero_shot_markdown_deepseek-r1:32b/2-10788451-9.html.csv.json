    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"fitzroy be 1 of 2 home team that have a home team score of 9.7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim to understand what needs to be verified. The claim states two main points:\n1. Fitzroy is one of the home teams.\n2. There are exactly two home teams with a home team score of 9.7.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it's divided into several columns: \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", etc. My focus will be on the \"home team\" and \"home team score\" columns to verify the claim.\n\nStarting with point 1: Identifying if Fitzroy is a home team. I'll scan through each row under the \"home team\" column.\n- Row 0: Hawthorn\n- Row 1: South Melbourne\n- Row 2: Essendon\n- Row 3: Melbourne\n- Row 4: Footscray\n- Row 5: Fitzroy\n\nSo, in row 5, the home team is Fitzroy. This confirms that Fitzroy is indeed a home team.\n\nNext, moving to point 2: Checking how many home teams have a score of 9.7.\nI'll look at each \"home team score\" value:\n- Row 0: 14.10 (94)\n- Row 1: 20.9 (129)\n- Row 2: 7.12 (54)\n- Row 3: 9.7 (61)\n- Row 4: 9.11 (65)\n- Row 5: 9.7 (61)\n\nFrom this, I can see that both row 3 and row 5 have a home team score of 9.7. That makes two instances where the home team scored 9.7.\n\nNow, cross-referencing with the claim: Fitzroy is one of these two home teams. In row 5, Fitzroy's score is indeed 9.7. Therefore, the claim holds true as there are exactly two home teams (Melbourne and Fitzroy) with a score of 9.7.\n\nTo sum up:\n- The relevant cells to verify the claim are those in rows 3 and 5 under the \"home team\" and \"home team score\" columns.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table in markdown format and a claim about it. The claim is: \"melbourne be not 1 of the home team on 12 june 1965\". My task is to determine whether this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It seems to state that Melbourne was not one of the home teams on June 12, 1965. To verify this, I need to look into the table for any matches on that date where Melbourne is listed as the home team.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are seven columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The rows represent individual matches with their respective details.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the 'date' column for June 12, 1965, and then see if Melbourne is listed as the home team in those rows.\n\nStarting from the first row:\n- Home team: Hawthorn\n- Date: 12 june 1965\n\nNext row:\n- Home team: South Melbourne\n- Date: 12 june 1965\n\nThird row:\n- Home team: Essendon\n- Date: 12 june 1965\n\nFourth row:\n- Home team: Melbourne\n- Date: 14 june 1965\n\nFifth row:\n- Home team: Footscray\n- Date: 14 june 1965\n\nSixth row:\n- Home team: Fitzroy\n- Date: 14 june 1965\n\nSo, for the date 12 June 1965, there are three matches. Checking each of these, I see that Melbourne is not listed as a home team on this date. The home teams on 12 June are Hawthorn, South Melbourne, and Essendon.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"melbourne be not 1 of the home team on 12 june 1965\" holds true because Melbourne was indeed not a home team on that specific date.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Melbourne isn't listed as a home team on June 12, 1965.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning the 'venue' column:\n\n- At row 0, the venue is Glenferrie Oval.\n- At row 5, the venue is Brunswick Street Oval.\n\nNext, I'll check the dates for these two venues. The 'date' column shows that both games took place on either June 12 or 14, 1965.\n\nFor Glenferrie Oval (row 0), the date is 12 June 1965. For Brunswick Street Oval (row 5), the date is also 12 June 1965. \n\nSince both games were on the same day, one didn't happen earlier than the other based solely on the date provided in the table.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"collingwood and st kilda have an average away team score of 15.14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the relevant information about Collingwood and St Kilda as away teams. The table has columns for \"away team\", \"away team score\", and other details, but I'm focusing on the scores.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about Hawthorn vs North Melbourne. Not relevant since neither Collingwood nor St Kilda are here.\n2. Second row: South Melbourne vs Geelong. Again, not relevant.\n3. Third row: Essendon vs Collingwood. Here, Collingwood is the away team with a score of 12.14 (86). So I note this as one data point for Collingwood's away score.\n4. Fourth row: Melbourne vs St Kilda. St Kilda is the away team here, scoring 18.14 (122).\n5. Fifth row: Footscray vs Richmond. Not relevant.\n6. Sixth row: Fitzroy vs Carlton. Also not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, Collingwood's away score is 12.14 and St Kilda's away score is 18.14. Now I need to calculate their average. \n\nTo find the average, I add both scores together and divide by two. The calculation would be:\n\n(12.14 + 18.14) / 2 = (30.28) / 2 = 15.14\n\nWait, but looking at the numbers, the actual away team scores are given as points in parentheses. For Collingwood, it's 86 points, and St Kilda has 122 points. Let me double-check if I should be using the total points or the combined score (like goals and behinds). The claim mentions an average of 15.14, which seems to refer to goals and behinds notation, where 15.14 would mean 15 goals and 14 behinds.\n\nBut wait, in the table, Collingwood's away team score is listed as 12.14 (86), which means 12 goals and 14 behinds totaling 86 points. St Kilda has 18.14 (122), so that's 18 goals, 14 behinds for 122 points.\n\nSo if I'm calculating the average of their away team scores in terms of goals and behinds, it would be:\n\nCollingwood: 12.14\nSt Kilda: 18.14\n\nAdding these together gives 30.28 (since 12+18=30 and 14+14=28). Dividing by two teams gives an average of 15.14.\n\nSo the claim is that their average away score is exactly 15.14, which matches my calculation. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI'll note the relevant cells as the \"away team\" and \"away team score\" columns for Collingwood and St Kilda's respective rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"fitzroy be the only home team that score 9.7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that Fitzroy is the sole home team with a score of 9.7 in their match. So, I need to check each row where Fitzroy is the home team and ensure no other home teams have the same score.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Let me go through each one:\n\n1. The first row shows Hawthorn as the home team with a score of 14.10 (94). That's different from 9.7, so this doesn't affect the claim.\n2. The second row has South Melbourne as the home team scoring 20.9 (129), which is higher than 9.7. No match here either.\n3. The third row lists Essendon with a score of 7.12 (54). Again, not matching 9.7.\n4. The fourth row is Melbourne vs St Kilda at the MCG. Melbourne's score is 9.7 (61), but here Melbourne is the home team. Wait, that means there are two home teams with a 9.7 score: Fitzroy and Melbourne? That would make the claim false.\n5. The fifth row is Footscray vs Richmond at Western Oval. Footscray's score is 9.11 (65), which isn't exactly 9.7, so no issue here.\n6. The sixth row is Fitzroy as the home team with a score of 9.7 (61). So, this is one instance where the claim holds true.\n\nBut wait, in the fourth row, Melbourne is the home team and their score is also 9.7. That means there are at least two home teams with that score: Fitzroy and Melbourne. Therefore, Fitzroy isn't the only one, making the original claim FALSE.\n\nI should note down the relevant cells to support this analysis. The fourth row's \"home team\" and \"home team score\" show Melbourne as the home team with a 9.7, which contradicts the claim that Fitzroy is the sole one. Similarly, the sixth row confirms Fitzroy's score but doesn't make them unique since another entry exists.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at mcg be the game that have the second largest crowd\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim is stating two things: \n\n1. There's a game played at the MCG.\n2. This game has the second-largest crowd among all the games listed in the table.\n\nTo verify this, I'll need to look through the table and extract the necessary information.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd size, etc. The relevant columns for this claim are \"venue\" and \"crowd\".\n\nI should start by identifying which rows have the venue as MCG. Scanning through the \"venue\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Glenferrie Oval\n- Row 1: Lake Oval\n- Row 2: Winda Hill\n- Row 3: MCG\n- Row 4: Western Oval\n- Row 5: Brunswick Street Oval\n\nSo, only row 3 has the venue as MCG. Now, I'll check the crowd size for this game, which is in the \"crowd\" column of row 3. The value here is 72114.\n\nNext, I need to determine if this crowd size (72114) is indeed the second-largest among all games listed. To do this, I'll list out the crowd sizes from each row:\n\n- Row 0: 11000\n- Row 1: 32260\n- Row 2: 34900\n- Row 3: 72114 (MCG game)\n- Row 4: 25345\n- Row 5: 20140\n\nNow, I'll order these crowd numbers from largest to smallest:\n\n1. 72114 (Row 3 - MCG)\n2. 34900 (Row 2 - Winda Hill)\n3. 32260 (Row 1 - Lake Oval)\n4. 25345 (Row 4 - Western Oval)\n5. 20140 (Row 5 - Brunswick Street Oval)\n6. 11000 (Row 0 - Glenferrie Oval)\n\nWait, that's not correct because the next largest after 72114 is actually 34900, then 32260, and so on. So when ordered, the crowd sizes are:\n\n- 72114 (Row 3) - Largest\n- 34900 (Row 2) - Second largest\n- 32260 (Row 1) - Third largest\n\nSo according to this, the MCG game has the largest crowd, not the second-largest. Therefore, the claim that it's the second-largest is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in ordering. Let me double-check:\n\nList of crowds: 72114, 34900, 32260, 25345, 20140, 11000.\n\nSorted descendingly: 72114 (MCG), then next is 34900, which is Row 2. So the second-largest crowd would be 34900 at Winda Hill. The MCG game has the highest attendance, so it's not the second; it's first.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the MCG game had the second-largest crowd is false.\n</think>\n\nThe MCG game had the largest crowd with 72114 attendees, making the claim about it being the second-largest incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The second row is Lake Oval with 32,260 people.\n3. The third game took place at Windy Hill, attracting 34,900 spectators.\n4. The fourth row mentions the MCG with a crowd of 72,114.\n5.

Let me look through the table:\n\n- For Glenferrie Oval: Scanning down the \"venue\" column, I see that row 0 has \"glenferrie oval\". The date for this game is listed under the \"date\" column as \"12 june 1965\".\n\n- For Brunswick Street Oval: Looking further down, I find it in row 5. The venue is \"brunswick street oval\", and the date here is also \"14 june 1965\".\n\nNow, comparing the dates: 12 June vs. 14 June. Since both are in the same month and year, I can compare just the day numbers. 14 comes after 12, so the game at brunswick street oval did happen later than the one at glenferrie oval.\n\nI should note down the relevant cells to support this conclusion. For Glenferrie Oval, it's row 0 with the venue and date columns. For Brunswick Street Oval, it's row 5 again with the same columns.\n</think>\n\nThe game at brunswick street oval (14 June) happened after the one at glenferrie oval (12 June).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"melbourne play at home on june 12 1965\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries related to Melbourne and the date June 12, 1965.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- Row 0: Hawthorn vs North Melbourne, date is 12 June 1965. Home team is Hawthorn, not Melbourne.\n- Row 1: South Melbourne vs Geelong, same date. Home team is South Melbourne.\n- Row 2: Essendon vs Collingwood, same date. Home team is Essendon.\n- Row 3: Melbourne vs St Kilda, date is 14 June 1965. So this is a different date than the claim.\n- Rows 4 and 5 are on 14 June as well.\n\nSo, in row 0,1,2 from June 12th, none have Melbourne as the home team. The only Melbourne game is on June 14th. Therefore, the claim that Melbourne played at home on June 12 is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are in rows where date is \"12 june 1965\" and checking if 'melbourne' is the home team there.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
