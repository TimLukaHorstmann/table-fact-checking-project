    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim about Mark Taylor is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says, \"mark taylor have 113 match with 110 inning an average of 32.23.\" I should break this down into three parts: matches, innings, and average.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll find Mark Taylor's row. Scanning through the names, I see that the last few rows are about different players, and near the bottom, there's a player named \"mark taylor.\" Let me check his details.\n\nIn Mark Taylor's row, the matches column shows 113. That matches the claim exactly. Next, the innings column for him is 110, which also aligns with what's stated. Finally, the average is listed as 32.23, which again matches the claim perfectly.\n\nI should make sure I'm looking at the correct row. The table lists several players, so it's essential to confirm that \"mark taylor\" is indeed the one we're focusing on and not another player with a similar name. Looking through the rows, I don't see any other Mark Taylor entries, so this must be the correct one.\n\nAdditionally, I'll cross-verify each figure to ensure there are no discrepancies. The matches are 113, innings 110, and average exactly as claimed. All three pieces of information align with what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, since all parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table data for Mark Taylor, I can confidently conclude that the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"matches\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 161 inning for person that have 5088 run score\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It states that there is a player with 161 innings and exactly 5088 runs scored. So, my task is to find if any row in the table has both \"innings\" equal to 161 and \"runs scored\" equal to 5088.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns for \"name\", \"career\", \"matches\", \"innings\", \"not out\", \"runs scored\", \"high score\", \"50s\", \"100s\", and \"average\". The rows contain data about different cricket players.\n\nI'll go through each row to check these two conditions:\n\n1. **Innings = 161**\n2. **Runs Scored = 5088**\n\nStarting from the top, I see that the first few rows have innings counts of 364, 278, 236, etc., which are all higher than 161. Moving down, I notice that some players like \"damien martyn\" and \"michael hussey\" don't meet the innings requirement either.\n\nWhen I reach the row for **andrew symonds**, I see that under the \"innings\" column, there's a value of 161. That matches the first condition. Now, checking the \"runs scored\" column for this row, it says 5088. This exactly matches the second part of the claim.\n\nSo, both conditions are satisfied by andrew symonds: he has 161 innings and scored 5088 runs. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo ensure I didn't miss any other possible candidates, I'll quickly scan through the rest of the table. No other player has exactly 161 innings with 5088 runs. Thus, the claim is correctly supported by andrew symonds' data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because Andrew Symonds has 161 innings and scored 5088 runs.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The user provided a table in markdown format with various cricket players' statistics and a specific claim: \"the most run score be 13589 by ricky ponting.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It states that Ricky Ponting scored the highest number of runs, which is 13,589. To verify this, I should look at two things: whether Ricky Ponting's runs are indeed the maximum in the table and whether there are any other players with higher run scores.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a player with their respective statistics. The relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"runs scored.\" So, for each player, I'll check how many runs they have.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Ricky Ponting has 13,589 runs.\n- Adam Gilchrist: 9,595\n- Mark Waugh: 8,500\n- Steve Waugh: 7,569\n- Michael Clarke: 7,375\n- Michael Bevan: 6,912\n- Allan Border: 6,524\n- Matthew Hayden: 6,131\n- Dean Jones: 6,068\n- David Boon: 5,964\n- Michael Hussey: 5,442\n- Damien Martyn: 5,346\n- Andrew Symonds: 5,088\n- Shane Watson: 4,796\n- Geoff Marsh: 4,357\n- Mark Taylor: 3,514\n- Darren Lehmann: 3,078\n\nComparing all these numbers, Ricky Ponting's 13,589 is clearly the highest. No other player comes close to that number. Therefore, the claim is accurate.\n\nNext, I need to identify which cells are relevant for this verification. For each player, their \"runs scored\" value was checked against Ricky Ponting's. However, since the claim specifically mentions Ricky Ponting and his run score, the most directly relevant cell is his entry in the \"runs scored\" column. All other rows were checked to ensure no one has a higher total, but the key supporting evidence comes from Ricky Ponting's row.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 0 (Ricky Ponting) under \"name\" and \"runs scored.\"\n\nThis confirms that the claim is TRUE as per the data provided.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in markdown format with various cricket players and their statistics, and I need to determine whether the claim \"mark taylor participate in more than 113 match\" is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. The claim states that Mark Taylor participated in more than 113 matches. So, my task is to check his number of matches from the table and see if it's greater than 113.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player. I need to find the row corresponding to \"mark taylor\". Scanning through the rows:\n\n- ricky ponting\n- adam gilchrist\n- mark waugh\n- steve waugh\n- michael clarke\n- michael bevan\n- allan border\n- matthew hayden\n- dean jones\n- david boon\n- michael hussey\n- damien martyn\n- andrew symonds\n- shane watson\n- geoff marsh\n- mark taylor\n- darren lehmann\n\nYes, there's a row for \"mark taylor\". Now, I need to look at the number of matches he played. The columns in the table are: name, career, matches, innings, not out, runs scored, high score, 50s, 100s, average.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"matches\". So, for Mark Taylor's row, I'll check the value under the \"matches\" column. According to the table, mark taylor has 113 matches.\n\nNow, the claim says he participated in more than 113 matches. Since his total is exactly 113, it's not more than that. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I need to identify which cells are relevant. The row index for mark taylor can be determined by counting the rows from top to bottom. Starting at 0, the first row is ricky ponting (index 0), and so on until mark taylor, which is the 15th row (since we start counting from 0). So, his row index is 15.\n\nThe column name relevant here is \"matches\". Therefore, the relevant cell is at row index 15 under the \"matches\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"matches\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim about Andrew Symonds is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Andrew Symonds have the highest scored run total 5088 with less than 161 inning participation.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the two parts of this claim:\n1. Andrew Symonds has the highest scored runs.\n2. He achieved this with less than 161 innings.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by locating Andrew Symonds' row. Scanning through the names, I find him listed in the second-to-last row. His runs scored are 5088, and his innings are 161.\n\nNow, to check if he has the highest runs, I need to compare his runs with all other players in the table. Let's go through each player:\n\n- Ricky Ponting: 13589 runs (much higher than Symonds)\n- Adam Gilchrist: 9595\n- Mark Waugh: 8500\n- Steve Waugh: 7569\n- Michael Clarke: 7375\n- Michael Bevan: 6912\n- Allan Border: 6524\n- Matthew Hayden: 6131\n- Dean Jones: 6068\n- David Boon: 5964\n- Michael Hussey: 5442\n- Damien Martyn: 5346\n- Andrew Symonds: 5088\n- Shane Watson: 4796\n- Geoff Marsh: 4357\n- Mark Taylor: 3514\n- Darren Lehmann: 3078\n\nComparing these, I see that Ricky Ponting has the highest runs with 13589. So Symonds isn't even close to having the highest.\n\nNext, checking the innings part of the claim. The claim states \"less than 161 inning participation.\" In the table, Andrew Symonds has exactly 161 innings. Since 161 is not less than 161, this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nPutting it together: The claim says Symonds has both the highest runs and did so with fewer than 161 innings. But he neither has the highest runs nor does he have less than 161 innings; he's exactly at 161. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nSo, the answer should be \"FALSE.\" The relevant cells are the runs scored by Andrew Symonds and his innings. Additionally, since we need to confirm that someone else has a higher run total, looking at Ricky Ponting's runs is necessary.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Andrew Symonds does not have the highest runs (Ricky Ponting has more) and he didn't participate in fewer than 161 innings; he had exactly 161.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"runs_scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"innings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runs_scored\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the total number of run score be less than 13589\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It says that the total runs scored should be less than 13,589. So I need to calculate the sum of all the \"runs scored\" in the table and check if it's below 13,589.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"runs scored\" column. There are multiple players listed with their respective run scores. My task is to add up all these numbers.\n\nI'll start by listing out each player's runs scored:\n\n- Ricky Ponting: 13,589\n- Adam Gilchrist: 9,595\n- Mark Waugh: 8,500\n- Steve Waugh: 7,569\n- Michael Clarke: 7,375\n- Michael Bevan: 6,912\n- Allan Border: 6,524\n- Matthew Hayden: 6,131\n- Dean Jones: 6,068\n- David Boon: 5,964\n- Michael Hussey: 5,442\n- Damien Martyn: 5,346\n- Andrew Symonds: 5,088\n- Shane Watson: 4,796\n- Geoff Marsh: 4,357\n- Mark Taylor: 3,514\n- Darren Lehmann: 3,078\n\nNow I'll add these numbers one by one. To ensure accuracy, I might break it down into parts.\n\nStarting with the larger numbers:\n\n13,589 (Ponting) + 9,595 (Gilchrist) = 23,184\nAdding Mark Waugh's 8,500: 23,184 + 8,500 = 31,684\nSteve Waugh's 7,569: 31,684 + 7,569 = 39,253\nMichael Clarke's 7,375: 39,253 + 7,375 = 46,628\n\nNext, Michael Bevan's 6,912: 46,628 + 6,912 = 53,540\nAllan Border's 6,524: 53,540 + 6,524 = 60,064\nMatthew Hayden's 6,131: 60,064 + 6,131 = 66,195\n\nDean Jones' 6,068: 66,195 + 6,068 = 72,263\nDavid Boon's 5,964: 72,263 + 5,964 = 78,227\nMichael Hussey's 5,442: 78,227 + 5,442 = 83,669\n\nDamien Martyn's 5,346: 83,669 + 5,346 = 89,015\nAndrew Symonds' 5,088: 89,015 + 5,088 = 94,103\nShane Watson's 4,796: 94,103 + 4,796 = 98,899\n\nGeoff Marsh's 4,357: 98,899 + 4,357 = 103,256\nMark Taylor's 3,514: 103,256 + 3,514 = 106,770\nDarren Lehmann's 3,078: 106,770 + 3,078 = 109,848\n\nSo the total runs scored by all players is 109,848. Now I compare this to the claim which states that the total should be less than 13,589. Clearly, 109,848 is much larger than 13,589.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because the total runs are way more than 13,589.\n</think>\n\nThe total runs scored across all players in the table amount to 109,848. Since this value exceeds 13,589, the claim that the total is less than 13,589 is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"runs scored\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
