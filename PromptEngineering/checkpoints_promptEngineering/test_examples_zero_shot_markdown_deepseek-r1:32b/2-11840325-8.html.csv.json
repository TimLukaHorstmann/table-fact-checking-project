    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"In 2012, the oakland raiders lose to the kansas city chief at arrowhead stadium with a result of 15-0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and check it against the table.\n\nThe year is 2012. Let's look through the table rows where the year is 2012. From the table, there are two entries for 2012:\n\nRow 4: October 28, Oakland Raiders win 26-16 against Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.\nRow 5: December 16, Oakland Raiders win 15-0 against Kansas City Chiefs at O.co Coliseum.\n\nWait a second, in both these rows, the winner is the Oakland Raiders. The claim says that the Raiders lost to the Chiefs, which would mean the winner should be the Chiefs. But according to the table, both times the Raiders won.\n\nLooking specifically at the result mentioned: 15-0. In row 5, the result is indeed 15-0, but it's a win for Oakland Raiders, not a loss. So the claim states that Oakland lost with this score, which contradicts the table.\n\nAdditionally, the location in row 4 is Arrowhead Stadium, but the game there resulted in a Raiders victory. The other 2012 game at O.co Coliseum also had a Raiders win, so none of the 2012 games list the Chiefs as winners with a score of 15-0.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Oakland lost to Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0 in 2012 is false. The relevant cells are row 4 (since it's 2012 and mentions Arrowhead) and row 5 (which has the 15-0 score but for a Raiders win).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Oakland Raiders lost to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium in 2012 with a result of 15-0. Checking the table, there are two games in 2012:\n\n- In row 4 (October 28), the Raiders won 26-16 at Arrowhead.\n- In row 5 (December 16), the Raiders won 15-0 at O.co Coliseum.\n\nNeither game shows a loss for Oakland with a 15-0 score. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
