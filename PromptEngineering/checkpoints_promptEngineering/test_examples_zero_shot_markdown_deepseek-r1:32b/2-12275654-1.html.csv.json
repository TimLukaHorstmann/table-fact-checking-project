    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"helle nielsen marie roepke play together in the women's double 2 year in a row.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should check the table for the years where Helle Nielsen and Marie Roepke are listed as partners in Women's Doubles. Looking at each row under the \"women's doubles\" column:\n\n- 2008: helle nielsen marie roepke\n- 2009: helle nielsen marie roepke\n\nSo, they played together in both 2008 and 2009. That's two consecutive years.\n\nWait, are there any other years? Let me check the rest to make sure. Looking through all rows from 1988 onwards:\n\n- In 2008, they're listed together.\n- In 2009, again together.\n- In 2010 and beyond, it's different pairs.\n\nSo yes, two consecutive years: 2008 and 2009. That means the claim is TRUE because they did play together for two years in a row.\n\nI need to note which cells are relevant. The claim refers to the \"women's doubles\" column. For each year where they played together, I'll add their respective rows.\n\nSo, the relevant rows are 2008 (row index 13) and 2009 (row index 14), both under \"women's doubles.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, with the two cells from those rows.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"women's doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether the claim \"xu huaiwen play in the women's single from 2003 to 2006\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand its structure. It seems to be a list of years with various categories: men's singles, women's singles, and so on. Each year has entries for different events.\n\nThe claim mentions xu huaiwen playing in women's singles from 2003 to 2006. So I need to check each year from 2003 to 2006 under the \"women 's singles\" column and see if xu huaiwen is listed there for all those years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 2003: The women's singles champion is xu huaiwen. So that's a match.\n- For 2004: Again, xu huaiwen is in women's singles.\n- For 2005: She is also listed there.\n- For 2006: Hmm, in the table, 2006 shows xu huaiwen under women's singles as well. Wait, no\u2014let me double-check. Oh wait, in 2006, the entry under women's singles is xu huaiwen? Let me look again.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the years:\n\n- 2003: Xu Huaiwen is listed.\n- 2004: Yes, she's there too.\n- 2005: She appears again.\n- 2006: Oh no, in 2006, under women's singles, it's xu huaiwen as well? Or am I misreading?\n\nWait, looking at the table structure. The columns are \"men 's singles\", \"women 's singles\", etc. So for each year, I check the women's singles column.\n\nYes:\n\n- 2003: Xu Huaiwen\n- 2004: Xu Huaiwen\n- 2005: Xu Huaiwen\n- 2006: Wait, looking at the 2006 row, under women's singles, it says xu huaiwen. So that would mean she played in all four years.\n\nWait no\u2014wait a second. Let me check again because I might have made a mistake. For each year from 2003 to 2006:\n\n- 2003: Women's singles is xu huaiwen.\n- 2004: Yes, same.\n- 2005: Yes, same.\n- 2006: Wait, the table shows for 2006 under women's singles, it's xu huaiwen. So she is listed every year from 2003 to 2006 inclusive.\n\nSo the claim says she played from 2003 to 2006 in women's singles, and according to the table, that's exactly what happened. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nWait but let me cross-verify because sometimes there might be a typo or I could have misread. Let's go through each year:\n\nLooking at row indices starting from 0:\n\nRow index for 2003: Let's count. The table starts in 2003? Wait no, looking back, the first few rows are up to 2013.\n\nWait let me get the correct row indexes.\n\nThe table is structured as follows:\n\n- Each row represents a year starting from... Let's check the years listed:\n\nLooking at the \"Year\" column (but wait, actually, each row starts with a year. Wait no\u2014the first column is the year? Or is it the first cell of each row the year?\n\nWait looking back: The table's columns are \"men 's singles\", \"women 's singles\", etc., but each row starts with a year. So for example, in the first row, the first cell is 2003, then men's singles, women's singles, etc.\n\nWait no\u2014the user didn't specify that the table has a Year column. Looking back at the initial description: It says \"You are tasked to verify a claim against a table,\" but the table provided doesn't have headers; each row starts with a year and then lists the champions in various categories.\n\nSo for example:\n\nRow 0: 2003, [men's singles], [women's singles], etc.\nRow 1: 2004, etc.\n\nWait no\u2014the actual structure is that each row represents a single year. Let me check the table again.\n\nWait no, looking at the JSON in the initial problem, the columns are \"men 's singles\", \"women 's singles\", and so on, but each row seems to be a year, like 2003, 2004, etc. So for example:\n\nRow index 12: 2013, then in women's singles, it's nichaon jindapon.\n\nWait no\u2014let me count the rows properly.\n\nWait the table is presented with each row having a year as the first element. For example:\n\n- The first few rows are 2003, 2004, etc., up to 2013.\n\nSo for each year from 2003 to 2013, there's a row. So to check 2003 to 2006:\n\n- Year 2003: women's singles is xu huaiwen.\n- Year 2004: same.\n- Year 2005: same.\n- Year 2006: same.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she played from 2003 to 2006 in women's singles is correct. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nWait but I just noticed that in the table, for 2006, under women's singles, it's xu huaiwen. Yes, so she is listed every year from 2003 to 2006 inclusive. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that xu huaiwen played in the women's singles event from 2003 to 2006. By examining each relevant row and column in the table, we confirm her presence in all those years.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are 'year', \"men's singles\", \"women's singles\", \"men's doubles\", \"women's doubles\", and \"mixed doubles\". So, the relevant column for this claim is \"men's doubles\".\n\nThe claim mentions that Michael S\u00f8gaard played in men's doubles with both Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp. To verify this, I need to check each row under \"men's doubles\" to see if there are entries where Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with these two players.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For the year 2000: Men's doubles is \"michael s\u00f8gaard joachim fischer nielsen\". So here, Michael S\u00f8gaard played with Joachim Fischer Nielsen.\n  \n- In 2001: Men's doubles are \"michael s\u00f8gaard michael lamp\". Here, Michael S\u00f8gaard is paired with Michael Lamp.\n\nSo, in two different years (2000 and 2001), Michael S\u00f8gaard was part of the men's doubles team with Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Michael Lamp respectively. This means he did play with both players in men's doubles, just not in the same year.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because it doesn't specify that they played together in the same year, only that he played with each at some point.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"katrin schmidt and pi hongyan both play 2 time in the women 's single.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It's a markdown table with columns for year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The rows go from 1988 to 2013, each listing champions in these categories.\n\nThe claim is about two individuals: katrin schmidt and pi hongyan. It says they both play twice in the women's singles category. So I need to check how many times each of them appears in the \"women 's singles\" column.\n\nStarting with katrin schmidt:\n- Looking through the years, I see her name in 1988 and 1989 under women's singles. That's two entries, so she does play twice.\n\nNext, checking pi hongyan:\n- Scanning the same column, I find pi hongyan in 2001, 2002, and 2003. That's three times, which is more than twice.\n\nSince the claim says both played twice, but pi hongyan actually played three times, the claim isn't fully accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- For katrin schmidt: she appears in row 0 (1988) and row 1 (1989) under women's singles.\n- For pi hongyan: she is in rows 5 (2001), 6 (2002), and 7 (2003). Although the claim only requires two, since she has three, these cells are relevant to show more than twice.\n\nSo compiling these into the required JSON format, I'll list each occurrence for both players.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women 's singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So each row represents a year with the corresponding champions in each category.\n\nThe claim is about Katrin Schmidt playing mixed doubles with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin. I need to check if in any given year, Katrin Schmidt was paired with both of these players in mixed doubles.\n\nLooking at the mixed doubles column:\n\n- 1988: Markus keck katrin schmidt\n- 1989: chen jin katrin schmidt\n- 2003 onwards don't have Katrin Schmidt in mixed doubles as per a quick glance.\n\nSo, in 1988, she played with Markus Keck. In 1989, she played with Chen Jin. \n\nWait, the claim says \"play with both markus keck chen jin in the mixed double.\" So does that mean she played in the same year with both? Or just at some point in different years?\n\nLooking back, in 1988, it's Markus and Katrin. In 1989, Chen Jin and Katrin. So in different years, not the same year.\n\nBut the claim doesn't specify the same year; it just says she played with both of them in mixed doubles at any time. So technically, yes, she did play with both, but not in the same year.\n\nWait, does that mean the claim is TRUE? Because she played with Markus Keck in 1988 and Chen Jin in 1989. \n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For 1988 mixed doubles: row index 0\n- For 1989 mixed doubles: row index 1\n\nTherefore, both pairs exist in different years, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Katrin Schmidt played mixed doubles with Markus Keck in 1988 and with Chen Jin in 1989.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is about men's doubles, so that's where I should focus.\n\nLooking through the men's doubles column:\n\n- 1988: markus keck robert neumann\n- 1989: stefan frey robert neumann\n- 1998: michael keck christian mohr\n- 1999: quinten van dalm dennis lens\n- 2000: michael s\u00f8gaard joachim fischer nielsen\n- 2001: michael s\u00f8gaard michael lamp\n- 2002: simon archer flandy limpele\n- 2003: micha\u0142 \u0142ogosz robert mateusiak\n- 2004: simon archer anthony clark\n- 2005: tony gunawan halim haryanto\n- 2006: micha\u0142 \u0142ogosz robert mateusiak\n- 2007: mathias boe carsten mogensen (appears multiple times)\n- 2008: same as above\n- 2009: rupesh kumar sanave thomas\n- 2010: same as earlier entries\n- 2011: bodin isara maneepong jongjit\n- 2012 onwards don't seem to have the names in question.\n\nNow, the claim mentions michael s\u00f8gaard playing with both sanave thomas and maneepong jongjit. Let's see if there are any rows where michael s\u00f8gaard is paired with these two.\n\nLooking at 2000: michael s\u00f8gaard with joachim fischer nielsen. Not Thomas or Jongjit.\nIn 2001: again, michael s\u00f8gaard with michael lamp. Still not the others.\n\nSanave Thomas appears in 2009 as part of rupesh kumar's doubles team. But Michael S\u00f8gaard isn't there. Similarly, maneepong jongjit is in 2011 with bodin isara. No Michael S\u00f8gaard there either.\n\nSo, from the table, Michael S\u00f8gaard only appears in men's doubles in 2000 and 2001 with specific partners, not including Sanave Thomas or Maneepong Jongjit. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"katrin schmidt play with both markus keck chen jin in the men's double\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states that Katrin Schmidt played with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin in men's doubles. So, I need to check if both these partnerships exist in the men's doubles category for any year.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"men  's doubles\" since that's where partnerships for men's doubles would be listed. Let me go through each row and check who was paired with Katrin Schmidt in men's doubles.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- **1988**: The entry is \"markus keck robert neumann\". Here, Markus Keck is paired with Robert Neumann, not Katrin Schmidt. So, no relevant information here.\n  \n- **1989**: The entry is \"stefan frey robert neumann\". Again, no mention of Katrin Schmidt or Markus Keck. Not relevant.\n\nWait a minute, I just realized that the men's doubles column in 1988 shows Markus Keck and Robert Neumann as partners. However, the claim mentions Katrin Schmidt playing with Markus Keck. Since men's doubles should be between two men, but Katrin Schmidt is female (as seen from women's singles entries), this doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I need to check mixed doubles instead because that's where a man and woman can pair up.\n\nLooking at the \"mixed doubles\" column for 1988: It shows \"markus keck katrin schmidt\". So, Markus Keck did partner with Katrin Schmidt in mixed doubles, not men's doubles. This is relevant to the claim but not exactly as it's a different category.\n\nNow, checking if Chen Jin played with Katrin Schmidt in mixed doubles:\n- **1989**: The mixed doubles entry is \"chen jin katrin schmidt\". So, here Chen Jin and Katrin Schmidt were partners in mixed doubles.\n\nThe claim says that both Markus Keck and Chen Jin played with Katrin Schmidt in men's doubles. But from the table, it appears they played with her in mixed doubles instead. Men's doubles are between two males, so having a female like Katrin Schmidt wouldn't fit there.\n\nThus, the claim is incorrect because while Katrin Schmidt did partner with both Markus Keck and Chen Jin, it was in mixed doubles, not men's doubles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
