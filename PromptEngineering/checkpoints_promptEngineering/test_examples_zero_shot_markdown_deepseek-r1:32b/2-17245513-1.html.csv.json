    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"t7 be the place of peter oosterhuis, who win 7500\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It has two parts:\n1. Peter Oosterhuis is in position t7.\n2. He won $7500.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row for Peter Oosterhuis's name. \n\nI find him in row index 7 (assuming rows start counting from 0). His place is listed as t7, which matches the first part of the claim. That seems correct so far.\n\nNext, checking his \"money\" column, it shows 7500. So both parts of the claim are supported by the table: he's in t7 and earned $7500.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the 'place' and 'money' columns for Peter Oosterhuis's row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis , who have 10875\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim into parts and check each against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that Peter Oosterhuis is in position t7. Looking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find where Peter Oosterhuis is listed. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- The first two are t1, then t3 with four players, then t7 starts at row 6 and 7. Row 6 has Jack Nicklaus in t7, and row 7 has Peter Oosterhuis also in t7. So yes, Peter is listed as t7.\n\nNext, the claim says he \"have 10875\". This likely refers to the money column. Checking the money column for Peter's row: it shows 7500, not 10875. \n\nSo while his position is correct (t7), the amount of money he has is incorrect according to the table. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because the money value doesn't match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Peter Oosterhuis is in t7 with $10,875, but the table shows he's in t7 with $7,500. Hence, FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"money\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
