    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here with different schools and their details. The claim is about whether both the Bellevue Bruins and the York Panthers play in the Midland conference. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where the Bellevue Bruins are located in the table. Looking at the 'mascot' column, the first row has \"bellevue bruins\". So that's row 0. Now, checking the 'conference' for this row, it says 'midlands'. Hmm, but the claim mentions 'Midland conference', which is a slightly different name. I should note if these are considered the same or not.\n\nNext, looking at York Panthers, their mascot is in the last row (row 8). The conference listed there is also 'midlands'. So again, the same term as before. \n\nWait, so both teams are in the 'midlands' conference according to the table. But the claim says they're in the 'Midland conference'. I need to confirm if these are the same. Typically, conferences might have similar names but different designations, like plural versus singular. However, without additional context, it's safer to assume that 'midlands' and 'Midland' refer to the same conference, especially since they're both under the same heading in the table.\n\nSo based on this, both mascots are listed under the same conference category, which supports the claim as TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both the Bellevue Bruins (row 0) and York Panthers (row 8) are listed in the 'midland' conference according to the table. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"according to date of founding, peru state college be the oldest\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for school, mascot, conference, national titles, and founded. The 'founded' column likely contains the year each institution was established.\n\nThe claim states that Peru State College is the oldest based on the founding date. To verify this, I need to check the 'founded' years of all schools listed in the table and see which one has the earliest year.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University: Founded in 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary: 1923\n3. Concordia University: 1894\n4. Doane College: 1872\n5. Hastings College: 1882\n6. Midland University: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n8. Peru State College: 1865\n9. York College: 1890\n\nNow, comparing these founding years, the oldest institution should be the one with the earliest year. Scanning through, I see that Peru State College was founded in 1865, which is earlier than all other entries.\n\nWait a moment\u2014Doane College was founded in 1872, which is later than 1865. So, Peru State's founding year of 1865 is indeed the earliest among those listed. Therefore, according to the table, Peru State College is the oldest school based on the founding date.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Peru State College is the oldest according to the founding dates in the table. By examining each 'founded' year, Peru State College was established in 1865, which is earlier than all other institutions listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim states: \"with a total of 0, the lowest number of national title belongs to the college of saint mary.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It says that College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles and that this is the lowest count among all the schools listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with details about their mascot, conference, number of national titles, year founded, etc. The column relevant here is \"national titles.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to check the \"national titles\" value:\n\n1. Bellevue University has 14.\n2. College of Saint Mary has 0.\n3. Concordia University has 1.\n4. Doane College has 10.\n5. Hastings College has 3.\n6. Midland University has 2.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University has 19.\n8. Peru State College has 2.\n9. York College has 28.\n\nFrom this, the lowest number of national titles is indeed 0, which belongs to the College of Saint Mary. I'll also check if any other school has a lower count than 0, but since national titles can't be negative in this context, 0 is confirmed as the minimum.\n\nSo, the claim correctly states that College of Saint Mary has the lowest number with 0 national titles. The relevant cell here is in row index 1 (since counting starts at 0) under the \"national titles\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately identifies that the College of Saint Mary holds the lowest number of national titles, which is 0.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 school, york college, have won more than 20 titles\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The relevant columns here are \"school\" and \"national titles.\" My goal is to check how many schools have more than 20 national titles.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University: They have 14 national titles. That's less than 20, so they don't qualify.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles, which is way below 20.\n3. Concordia University: Just 1 title, not more than 20.\n4. Doane College: They have 10 titles. Still under 20.\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles, so no.\n6. Midland University: 2 titles, which is also below 20.\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles here. Hmm, 19 is close but still less than 20.\n8. Peru State College: Only 2 titles, not relevant.\n9. York College: They have 28 national titles, which is definitely more than 20.\n\nWait a second, the claim says \"only 1 school,\" but when I look at the data, only York College has over 20. The others are all under or equal to 20. So that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check each row to be sure I didn't miss any:\n\n- Bellevue: 14 \u2192 no\n- Saint Mary: 0 \u2192 no\n- Concordia: 1 \u2192 no\n- Doane: 10 \u2192 no\n- Hastings: 3 \u2192 no\n- Midland: 2 \u2192 no\n- Nebraska Wesleyan: 19 \u2192 still under 20\n- Peru State: 2 \u2192 no\n- York: 28 \u2192 yes\n\nSo, only York College meets the condition of having more than 20 national titles. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells. I need to list each cell in the \"national titles\" column that's over 20. That would be York College's row (index 8) and the column \"national titles.\" Wait, but actually, since we're checking all rows, perhaps listing each one is necessary? Or maybe just the ones that meet the condition.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should include all relevant cells used in verifying the claim. That includes checking each school's national titles. So for thoroughness, every row's \"national titles\" column is considered. But since only York exceeds 20, perhaps we can list just that one cell as the supporting evidence.\n\nWait, but to confirm whether any other schools have more than 20, I need to check all of them. Therefore, each school's national titles are relevant. So for each row, I should note the \"national titles\" column because they were checked in the process.\n\nBut let me think again: the claim is about only York having over 20. To validate that no others exceed this number, I have to check all schools. Therefore, every cell in the \"national titles\" column is relevant for verification.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be each row's \"national titles.\" That would include rows 0 through 8.\n\nWait, but perhaps the correct approach is to list only the cells that meet the condition as well as any others that were checked. So, since all rows are checked for their national titles to confirm if they're above 20, each cell in that column is relevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just the ones where the value was considered (i.e., those who have titles over 20). But according to the instructions, I think it's better to list all cells in the \"national titles\" column since each was checked for the claim.\n\nBut perhaps another way: only York meets the condition, so that row is relevant. The others don't meet the condition but are still checked, so their cells are also part of the verification process. Therefore, including all rows' national titles columns would make sense.\n\nWait, but in the example provided, when the answer was TRUE, it listed specific cells. So perhaps I should include all the \"national titles\" for each school because they were all evaluated to confirm that only York has over 20.\n\nBut maybe not. The claim is about how many schools have more than 20, so checking each row's national titles is necessary to ensure that no others do. Therefore, the relevant cells are indeed all the \"national titles\" entries for each school.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that Bellevue University is the youngest school in terms of its founding date. So, I need to check the 'founded' year for each school and see if Bellevue has the most recent (i.e., the largest) founded year.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The schools are listed with their founding years as follows:\n  - Bellevue University: 1966\n  - College of Saint Mary: 1923\n  - Concordia University: 1894\n  - Doane College: 1872\n  - Hastings College: 1882\n  - Midland University: 1883\n  - Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n  - Peru State College: 1865\n  - York College: 1890\n\nI'll list them in order from oldest to youngest based on the founded year:\n\nPeru State College (1865) \u2192 Doane College (1872) \u2192 Concordia University (1894) \u2192 York College (1890) [Wait, 1890 is earlier than 1894? Wait no, 1890 comes before 1894. So order would be:\n\nPeru State College: 1865\nDoane College: 1872\nHastings College: 1882\nMidland University: 1883\nNebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\nYork College: 1890\nConcordia University: 1894\nCollege of Saint Mary: 1923\nBellevue University: 1966\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me sort them correctly.\n\nLooking at the founded years:\n\n- Peru State: 1865 (oldest)\n- Doane: 1872\n- Hastings: 1882\n- Midland: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan: 1887\n- York: 1890\n- Concordia: 1894\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Bellevue University: 1966 (youngest)\n\nSo, indeed, Bellevue University was founded in 1966, which is the latest year among all listed schools. Therefore, it's the youngest.\n\nNow, I need to identify the relevant cells from the table that support this conclusion. The 'founded' column for each school is crucial because it provides the founding years needed to compare and find the youngest.\n\nSo, for each row, the 'founded' value is important. Thus, all rows have their 'founded' cell as a relevant cell in determining the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bellevue University is the youngest based on its founding date.

The claim says, \"peru state college be the last institution found in the 19th century.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the 'founded' column for each school. The 19th century runs from 1801 to 1900. So any school founded between those years would fit.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Bellevue University: Founded in 1966 (20th century)\n- College of Saint Mary: 1923\n- Concordia University: 1894\n- Doane College: 1872\n- Hastings College: 1882\n- Midland University: 1883\n- Nebraska Wesleyan University: 1887\n- Peru State College: 1865\n- York College: 1890\n\nNow, all the schools except Bellevue and Saint Mary were founded in the 19th century. The claim says Peru State is the last one found in that century. So I need to check which of these has the latest founding year.\n\nLooking at the years:\n\nThe highest founding year in the 19th century among them is York College (1890), then Nebraska Wesleyan (1887), Midland (1883), Hastings (1882), Doane (1872), and Peru State (1865).\n\nSo the last institution founded in the 19th century would be York College, not Peru State.

The claim is: \"the bellevue bruin be the only nebraska team to play in the midland conference.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It says that Bellevue Bruins are the ONLY Nebraska team in the Midland Conference. So, my task is to check if any other schools from Nebraska are also part of the Midland Conference.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it has several columns: school, mascot, conference, national titles, founded year. The rows include various colleges and universities with their respective details.\n\nI need to focus on two things here: \n1. Which teams are in the Midland Conference.\n2. Whether those teams are from Nebraska.\n\nStarting with the conference column, I'll go through each row to see which schools are listed under the \"midlands\" conference. \n\nRow 0: Bellevue University \u2013 mascot is Bellevue Bruins, conference is midlands. So that's one team from Nebraska in Midland Conference.\nRow 1: College of Saint Mary \u2013 also in midlands conference. Is this a Nebraska school? Yes, I believe so; College of Saint Mary is located in Nebraska.\nRow 2: Concordia University \u2013 great plains conference, so not relevant here.\nRow 3: Doane College \u2013 great plains, again, not part of Midland Conference.\nRow 4: Hastings College \u2013 great plains, same as above.\nRow 5: Midland University \u2013 great plains. Hmm, wait, the name \"Midland\" might be confusing here, but their conference is great plains, so they're not in midlands.\nRow 6: Nebraska Wesleyan University \u2013 great plains conference again. So that's another Nebraska school but in a different conference.\nRow 7: Peru State College \u2013 midlands conference. Is Peru State located in Nebraska? Yes, I think it's in Peru, Nebraska. So another Nebraska team in Midland Conference.\nRow 8: York College \u2013 midlands conference. York, Nebraska is the location of York College.\n\nWait a minute, so if I list all schools in the Midland Conference:\n- Bellevue University (row 0)\n- College of Saint Mary (row 1)\n- Peru State College (row7)\n- York College (row8)\n\nThat's four teams from Nebraska in the Midland Conference. So the claim that Bellevue Bruins are the ONLY team is clearly false because there are others.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I need to collect the relevant cells to support this conclusion. The relevant information comes from the \"conference\" column for each row where the conference is midlands and the school is in Nebraska.\n\nSo, the rows involved are:\n- Row 0: conference\n- Row1: conference\n- Row7: conference\n- Row8: conference\n\nThese cells show that besides Bellevue University, there are other Nebraska schools (College of Saint Mary, Peru State College, York College) also in the Midland Conference. Therefore, the relevant cells to disprove the claim include these four rows under the \"conference\" column.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps I should check if all these schools are indeed from Nebraska because the claim is about Nebraska teams. Looking at the school names: Bellevue University, College of Saint Mary, Peru State College, and York College\u2014all are Nebraska-based institutions. So their presence in Midland Conference confirms that they're other teams besides Bellevue.\n\nSo compiling this information, the relevant cells are rows 0,1,7,8 with the column \"conference.\" \n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, as there are multiple Nebraska teams in the Midland Conference.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because there are multiple Nebraska teams (Bellevue University, College of Saint Mary, Peru State College, and York College) listed under the Midland Conference.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"conference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"conference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to check the table for their national titles.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns relevant here are \"school\" and \"national titles.\"\n\nSo, I'll go through each row:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 national titles. Not more than 20.\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles. No.\n3. Concordia University: 1 title. No.\n4. Doane College: 10 titles. Less than 20.\n5.

Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it incorrectly includes Peru State and also overstates the number of schools meeting the condition.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, with relevant cells being the national titles for both York College (row 8) and Peru State College (row 7).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only two schools have won more than 20 times. Checking the table:\n\n- **York College** has 28 national titles.\n- **Peru State College** has only 2.\n\nSince only York College meets the condition, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine if the claim \"the college of saint mary hold the highest number of national title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the College of Saint Mary has the most national titles among all the schools listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists several colleges with their respective mascots, conferences, number of national titles, and founding years. The column that's relevant here is \"national titles\" because the claim is about the highest number there.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the values in the \"national titles\" column:\n\n1. Bellevue University: 14 titles\n2. College of Saint Mary: 0 titles\n3. Concordia University: 1 title\n4. Doane College: 10 titles\n5. Hastings College: 3 titles\n6. Midland University: 2 titles\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University: 19 titles\n8. Peru State College: 2 titles\n9. York College: 28 titles\n\nFrom this, I can see that York College has the highest number of national titles with 28. The College of Saint Mary actually has 0, which is the lowest. Therefore, the claim that they hold the highest number is incorrect.\n\nSo, to verify this, I need to look at each school's \"national titles\" value and compare them. The relevant cells are all in the \"national titles\" column for each row, but especially focusing on College of Saint Mary (which has 0) and York College (which has the highest at 28).\n\nThis means the claim is FALSE because there's another institution with a much higher number of national titles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the College of Saint Mary has 0 national titles, while other colleges have more.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"national titles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the claim is: \"bellevue university be the first college found in the 20th century.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and see which columns are relevant here. The columns we have are \"school,\" \"mascot,\" \"conference,\" \"national titles,\" and \"founded.\" Since the claim is about when Bellevue University was founded relative to others in the 20th century, I'll focus on the \"founded\" column for all schools.\n\nThe table lists several colleges with their founding years. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Bellevue University - Founded: 1966\n2. College of Saint Mary - Founded: 1923\n3. Concordia University - Founded: 1894\n4. Doane College - Founded: 1872\n5. Hastings College - Founded: 1882\n6. Midland University - Founded: 1883\n7. Nebraska Wesleyan University - Founded: 1887\n8. Peru State College - Founded: 1865\n9. York College - Founded: 1890\n\nNow, the claim states that Bellevue University was the first college founded in the 20th century. To verify this, I need to check if any other colleges were founded between the years 1901 and 1966, which is the time frame of the 20th century.\n\nLooking at the founding years:\n\n- College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923.\n- Bellevue University was founded in 1966.\n\nAll other colleges listed were founded before 1900. So, within the given data, College of Saint Mary was founded earlier than Bellevue University in the 20th century (1923 vs. 1966). Therefore, Bellevue University is not the first college founded in the 20th century according to this table.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because there's another institution, College of Saint Mary, which was founded earlier in the 20th century than Bellevue University.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false. Bellevue University was founded in 1966, but College of Saint Mary was founded in 1923, making it the first college in the table to be established in the 20th century.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"founded\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"founded\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
