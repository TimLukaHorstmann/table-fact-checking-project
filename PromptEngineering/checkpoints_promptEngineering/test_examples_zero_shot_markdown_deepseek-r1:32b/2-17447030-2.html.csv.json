    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents.\n\nThe table has several columns: res (result), record, opponent, method, event, round, and location. The claim is about the number of fighters with a specific record of 5-3. So I need to focus on the \"record\" column in each row to check how many times this exact record appears.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match outcome for a fighter. Each entry in the \"record\" column shows the fighter's overall win-loss record after that particular fight. For example, the first row has a record of 6-4 (1), which I believe means 6 wins and 4 losses with 1 draw or something similar.\n\nNow, let me go through each row one by one to check for the 5-3 record:\n\n1. Row 0: Record is 6-4 (1) \u2192 Not 5-3.\n2. Row 1: Record is 5-4 (1) \u2192 Close but not exactly 5-3.\n3. Row 2: Record is 5-3 (1) \u2192 This matches the claim.\n4. Row 3: Record is 5-2 (1) \u2192 Not matching.\n5. Row 4: Record is 4-2 (1) \u2192 No.\n6. Row 5: Record is 3-2 (1) \u2192 No.\n7. Row 6: Record is 3-1 (1) \u2192 No, but this row is marked as 'nc' which I think stands for no contest, so the record might not reflect actual wins or losses.\n8. Row 7: Record is 3-1 \u2192 No.\n9. Row 8: Record is 5-0 \u2192 Not matching.\n10. Row 9: Record is 2-0 \u2192 No.\n11. Row 10: Record is 1-0 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed something. Let me recount the rows to ensure accuracy. The table has 11 entries (rows 0 through 10). \n\nLooking again:\n\n- Only row 2 has a record of 5-3 (1). So that's one occurrence.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other rows with 5-3. Looking at each row carefully:\n\nRow 0: 6-4\nRow 1: 5-4\nRow 2: 5-3 \u2192 yes\nRow 3: 5-2\nRow 4: 4-2\nRow 5: 3-2\nRow 6: 3-1 (but it's a no contest, so maybe not counted)\nRow 7: 3-1\nRow 8: 5-0\nRow 9: 2-0\nRow 10: 1-0\n\nSo only row 2 has a record of 5-3. Therefore, the claim that \"only 1 fighter have a 5 - 3 record\" is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cell for this determination is in row 2 under the \"record\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided. The table is in markdown format, and I need to carefully check each condition in the claim against the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"when the opponent be dan severn , the method be submission (arm triangle choke) and the event be ufc japan : ultimate japan\". So, the claim is making two specific assertions about a particular row in the table where the opponent is Dan Severn.\n\nNow, I'll look at each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Opponent is Dan Severn**: I need to find all rows where the 'opponent' column has Dan Severn as the name.\n2. **Method is Submission (Arm Triangle Choke)**: For the identified row(s) with Dan Severn, check if the 'method' column matches this description.\n3. **Event is UFC Japan : Ultimate Japan**: Again, for those same rows, verify if the event matches this specific event name.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- I'll go through each row one by one to find where the opponent is Dan Severn. Scanning down, I see that in row 2 (assuming the first data row after headers is index 0), the opponent is listed as \"dan severn\". So this is the relevant row.\n\nNow, checking the other conditions for this specific row:\n\n- The method is given as \"submission (arm triangle choke)\", which exactly matches the claim.\n- However, the event in this row is \"wef 9 - world class\", not \"ufc japan : ultimate japan\". This doesn't match the event specified in the claim.\n\nSince one of the conditions (the event) isn't met for the opponent Dan Severn, the claim is not fully supported by the data. Therefore, the claim must be FALSE.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Opponent**: Found as row 2.\n- **Method**: Correctly matches.\n- **Event**: Incorrect; the event in the table doesn't match the one in the claim.\n\nThus, even though two parts are correct, the mismatch in the event makes the entire claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while Dan Severn was an opponent with a submission method via arm triangle choke, the event does not match the specified UFC Japan event. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
