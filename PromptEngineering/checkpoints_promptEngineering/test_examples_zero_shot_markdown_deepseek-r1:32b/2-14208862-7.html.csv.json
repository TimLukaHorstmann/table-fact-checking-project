    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the game on march 8 be play by minnesota (home) and philadelphia (visitor)\".\n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We need a row where the date is March 8. Then, in that same row, the 'home' column should be Minnesota, and the 'visitor' should be Philadelphia.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find the one with March 8. Scanning down the 'date' column:\n\n- The first row is March 1.\n- Second: March 2\n- Third: March 4\n- Fourth: March 6\n- Fifth: March 8 \u2014 this is our target.\n\nNow, in the fifth row (index 4 because rows are zero-indexed), let's check the 'visitor' and 'home' columns. \n\nThe visitor is Philadelphia, which matches the claim. The home team is Minnesota, as stated in the claim. So both conditions are met: date is March 8, visitor is Philadelphia, home is Minnesota.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim: \"edmonton be a visitor on march 9 to philadelphia, with a record of 44 - 7 - 15.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where Edmonton was a visitor. Scanning through the 'visitor' column, I find that on March 9th, Edmonton is listed as the visitor. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to confirm if the home team was Philadelphia on that date. In the same row (row index 5), under the 'home' column, it says Philadelphia. That matches the claim.\n\nNow, checking the record: The claim states a record of 44-7-15. Looking at the 'record' column in row 5, it shows 44 - 7 - 15. So this part is accurate as well.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any row where the 'visitor' is quebec. Scanning through the table rows, I see that quebec appears only once as a visitor in the row with date \"march 27\". \n\nIn this row (row index 15), let's check the relevant columns:\n- The 'decision' column shows 'peeters', not 'myre'. So, the decision is made by peeters here.\n- The 'record' for this row is 46 - 11 - 18, which doesn't match the claim of 44 - 7 - 15.\n\nSince neither condition in the claim is met, I can conclude that the claim is FALSE. \n\nTo support this conclusion, the relevant cells are:\n- The 'decision' column from quebec's visit (row 15).\n- The 'record' column from the same row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
