Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that the youngest winner is 8 years older than the youngest nominee. So, I need to find out the ages of both the youngest winner and the youngest nominee from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two relevant rows here: one for the \"youngest winner\" and another for the \"youngest nominee.\" \n\nFor the youngest winner, the row says:\n- Superlative: youngest winner\n- Director: norman taurog\n- Record set: 32 years old\n- Year: 1930 / 31\n- Notes: skippy\n\nSo, the youngest winner is Norman Taurog at 32 years old.\n\nFor the youngest nominee, the row says:\n- Superlative: youngest nominee\n- Director: john singleton\n- Record set: 24 years old\n- Year: 1991\n- Notes: boyz n the hood\n\nSo, the youngest nominee is John Singleton at 24 years old.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the age difference between these two. The youngest winner is 32, and the youngest nominee is 24. To find out how much older the winner is compared to the nominee, I subtract 24 from 32: 32 - 24 = 8 years.\n\nThe claim says that the youngest winner is 8 years older than the youngest nominee. Based on these numbers, that's exactly correct. \n\nSo, all conditions in the claim are supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are the \"Record set\" column for both the youngest winner and the youngest nominee. Their row indices are 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record set\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The row index here is 1 because tables start counting from 0. So his information is in row 1.\n  \n- For John Ford, he's under \"most awards,\" which mentions he received 4 awards. However, the claim is about nominations, not awards. Looking at John Ford's row (row 0), it says he got 5 nominations, as indicated by the note: \"awards resulted from 5 nominations.\"\n\nNow, the claim states that William Wyler received more than twice the number of nominations compared to John Ford.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nWilliam Wyler has 12 nominations.\nJohn Ford has 5 nominations.\n\nTwice John Ford's nominations would be 5 * 2 = 10.\n\nThe question is whether 12 is more than 10. Yes, it is.

I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the oldest winner and the oldest nominee be both in their seventy\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim mentions two specific categories: \"oldest winner\" and \"oldest nominee.\" It states that both are in their seventies. So, I should check the ages listed for these two categories in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows, each corresponding to a different superlative. The relevant rows here are:\n\n- Row 2: Superlative is \"oldest winner,\" director is Clint Eastwood, record set is 74 years old.\n- Row 3: Superlative is \"oldest nominee,\" director is John Huston, record set is 79 years old.\n\nSo, the oldest winner was 74 when they won, and the oldest nominee was 79 when nominated. Both ages fall within their seventies\u201474 is in the seventies (70-79), as is 79.\n\nNext, I need to ensure that both these directors are indeed in their seventies at the time of winning or being nominated. Checking the years:\n\n- Clint Eastwood's record was set in 2004 when he was 74.\n- John Huston's nomination occurred in 1985 when he was 79.\n\nBoth ages clearly fall within the 70s range (70 to 79 years old). Therefore, the claim that both the oldest winner and the oldest nominee were in their seventies holds true based on the table data.\n\nTo confirm, I'll map out which cells in the table are relevant:\n\n- For the oldest winner: The row index is 2. The columns we're interested in are \"record set\" (which tells us the age) and possibly \"year,\" but since the claim focuses on the age itself being in the seventies, the key column here is \"record set.\"\n- For the oldest nominee: Similarly, the relevant cells would be row index 3, again looking at the \"record set\" column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 2, \"record set\"\n- Row 3, \"record set\"\n\nThese are the cells that directly provide the ages necessary to evaluate the claim. Since both ages are indeed in their seventies, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"record set\"}]}",

The first row has director \"john ford\". His first name is John.\n2. The second row lists \"william wyler\" as the director. First name William, so not John.\n3.

The table has columns: superlative, director, record set, year, notes. So I need to focus on the 'superlative' column to find the rows related to the youngest winner and youngest nominee.\n\nLooking at the 'superlative' entries:\n- The fifth row (index 4) is \"youngest winner\" with Norman Taurog at 32 years old.\n- The sixth row (index 5) is \"youngest nominee\" with John Singleton at 24 years old.\n\nNow, the claim is that the youngest winner is more than 8 years older than the youngest nominee. So I subtract the ages: 32 - 24 = 8 years exactly.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"more than 8 years,\" which would mean it should be greater than 8, not equal to. Since 32 minus 24 is exactly 8, that's not more than 8. Therefore, the difference is exactly 8 years, so the claim isn't true.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because the youngest winner is only 8 years older, not more than 8.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For the youngest winner: row index 4, column 'record set' (32 years old).\n- For the youngest nominee: row index 5, column 'record set' (24 years old).\n\nSo I need to list those two cells in the relevant_cells array.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the youngest winner is more than 8 years older than the youngest nominee.

The claim is comparing the number of nominations that William Wyler and John Ford received, specifically checking if Wyler's nominations are less than twice Ford's.\n\nLooking at the table, there are two relevant rows: one for John Ford and another for William Wyler.\n\nFor John Ford:\n- In the \"record set\" column, it says he has 4 awards. But wait, his row is under the superlative of \"most awards,\" but the actual number of nominations isn't directly stated here. However, in the notes, it says \"awards resulted from 5 nominations.\" So Ford received 5 nominations.\n\nFor William Wyler:\n- His superlative is \"most nominations\" with a record set of 12 nominations. The notes say he got 3 awards from these nominations, but we're focusing on the nominations count here, which is 12.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n- John Ford: 5 nominations\n- William Wyler: 12 nominations\n\nNow, checking if Wyler's nominations (12) are less than twice Ford's nominations. Twice of Ford's would be 5 * 2 = 10. Is 12 less than 10? No, it's more.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right because Wyler has 12, which is more than twice the 5 nominations Ford had (twice being 10). So the claim says Wyler received less than two times the amount of Ford, but in reality, he received more. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nBut wait again, maybe I misread something. Let me double-check:\n\nFord's row: \"most awards\", director John Ford, record set is 4 awards, year 1952, notes say 5 nominations leading to those awards.\n\nWyler's row: \"most nominations\", director William Wyler, record set of 12 nominations, year 1965, notes say he got 3 awards from these 12 nominations.\n\nSo Ford had 5 nominations (from the notes), and Wyler had 12. The claim is whether Wyler's nominations are less than twice Ford's. So 12 < 2*5? That would be 12 < 10, which is false.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that William Wyler received fewer than twice as many nominations as John Ford.

So, I should check their ages from the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The row for \"oldest winner\" shows Clint Eastwood was 74 years old in 2004.\n- The row for \"oldest nominee\" shows John Huston was 79 years old in 1985.\n\nSo, both are way older than 60.
