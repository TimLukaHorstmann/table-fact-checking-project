    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"During the 1993 Minnesota Vikings season there be 2 weeks in which the team do not play.\" Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure, it shows weeks from 1 to 18 with corresponding dates, opponents, results, and attendance. Each row represents a week of the season. The claim is about two weeks where they didn't play any games.\n\nWait, but in the table provided, there's no missing data for weeks 3 or 7. Let me check: Week 1 to Week 2 are present, then Week 4 comes after that. So between Week 2 and Week 4, is there a gap? That would be Weeks 3 missing. Then, looking further down, the next week after Week 6 is Week 8. Wait, Week 7 is also missing.\n\nSo that means Weeks 3 and 7 are not listed in the table. Does that mean they didn't play those weeks? Well, typically in a football season, each team plays every week unless there's a bye week. So if Weeks 3 and 7 aren't present, it implies they had byes or didn't have games scheduled for those weeks.\n\nTherefore, according to the table, there are two weeks (Weeks 3 and 7) where the Vikings did not play any games. Hence, the claim is TRUE because these two weeks are missing from the schedule provided in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": -1, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"there be 2 week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to zero point.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It sounds like they're saying there were two weeks where the Minnesota Vikings allowed their opponents to score zero points. In other words, the Vikings won those games with a shutout\u2014meaning the opposing team didn't score any points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of the season with details about the game, including the opponent and the result. The \"result\" column shows whether the Vikings won (W) or lost (L), followed by the scores. \n\nI should go through each row and check if there are two instances where the Vikings' opponents scored zero points.\n\nLet's start from week 1:\n- Week 1: Opponent is Los Angeles Raiders, result L 24-7. The opponent scored 24 points, so not a shutout.\n- Week 2: Chicago Bears, result W 10-7. Opponent scored 7 points, not zero.\n- Week 4: Green Bay Packers, result W 15-13. Opponents scored 13, not zero.\n- Week 5: San Francisco 49ers, result L 38-19. Opponents scored 38, nope.\n- Week 6: Tampa Bay Buccaneers, result W 15-0. Here's a shutout! The opponent scored 0 points. So that's one week.\n\nContinuing:\n- Week 8: Chicago Bears again, result W 19-12. Opponents got 12, not zero.\n- Week 9: Detroit Lions, loss with opponent scoring 30, nope.\n- Week 10: San Diego Chargers, opponents scored 30 again.\n- Week 11: Denver Broncos, result W 26-23. Opponent scored 23, not a shutout.\n- Week 12: Tampa Bay Buccaneers, lost with opponent scoring 23 points.\n- Week 13: New Orleans Saints, opponents scored 17.\n- Week 14: Detroit Lions, result W 13-0. Another shutout! Opponent scored zero here. That's the second week.\n\nLooking further just to be thorough:\n- Week 15: Dallas Cowboys, they lost with opponents scoring 37.\n- Week 16: Green Bay Packers (Milw), won 21-17. Not a shutout.\n- Week 17: Kansas City Chiefs, result W 30-10. Opponent scored 10.\n- Week 18: Washington Redskins, result W 14-9. Opponents got 9.\n\nSo, from the table, there are two weeks where the Vikings held their opponents to zero points: week 6 and week 14. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to note which rows and columns support this conclusion. The \"result\" column in each row shows whether it was a shutout or not. Specifically:\n\n- Week 6 (row index 5): Result W 15-0\n- Week 14 (row index 13): Result W 13-0\n\nEach of these rows has the relevant cell under the \"result\" column, indicating that the opponent's score was zero.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because there are two weeks where the Vikings held their opponents to zero points. The relevant cells are in the \"result\" column for week 6 and week 14.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says that \"the game on November 21, 1993 has the lowest attendance of any game with only 40848 crowd.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate the row in the table corresponding to November 21, 1993. Looking through the dates, week 12 is November 21, 1993, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it's a loss with attendance listed as 40848.\n\nNext, I have to check all other games' attendances to see if this is indeed the lowest. Let me go through each row:\n\n- Week 1: 44,120\n- Week 2: 57,921\n- Week 4: 61,746\n- Week 5: 63,071\n- Week 6: 54,215\n- Week 8: 64,677\n- Week 9: 53,428\n- Week 10: 55,527\n- Week 11: 67,329\n- Week 12: 40,848 (this is the one in question)\n- Week 13: 53,030\n- Week 14: 63,216\n- Week 15: 63,321\n- Week 16: 54,773\n- Week 17: 59,236\n- Week 18: 42,836\n\nWait a minute, looking at week 18, December 31, 1993, the attendance is 42,836. That's actually lower than 40,848? No, wait\u2014wait, no, 40,848 is less than 42,836. So week 12 has the lowest at 40,848. But then I see that in week 18, it's 42,836. Hmm, so actually, week 12's attendance is indeed lower than week 18. \n\nWait no, wait\u2014no, because 40k is less than 42k. So week 12 has the lowest attendance of 40,848, which is correct. But I should double-check if any other game has an even lower number. Let me go through each attendance:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Week 1: 44,120\n- Week 2: 57k\n- Week 4:61k\n- Week 5:63k\n- Week 6:54k\n- Week8:64k\n- Week9:53k\n- Week10:55k\n- Week11:67k\n- Week12:40,848\n- Week13:53k\n- Week14:63k\n- Week15:63k\n- Week16:54k\n- Week17:59k\n- Week18:42,836\n\nSo the lowest is 40,848 on week 12 (November 21), and then week 18 has a higher attendance of 42,836. So the claim that November 21 has the lowest with 40,848 is correct. \n\nWait no, wait again\u2014no, actually, 40k is less than 42k, so week 12's attendance is lower than week 18. Therefore, the game on November 21, 1993 (week 12) does have the lowest attendance in the table with 40,848.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are row index 11 for the date and the attendance column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game on November 21, 1993 had the lowest attendance of 40,848. Checking all attendances in the table, this is indeed the smallest number.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the game on november 14, 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with 67329 attendee.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this carefully. The claim has two parts: \n1. The specific game on November 14, 1993 had an attendance of 67,329.\n2. This was the lowest attendance among all games.\n\nI'll start by checking each part against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists several weeks with corresponding dates, opponents, results, and attendances. The rows are indexed starting from 0 to 17 since there are 18 entries.\n\nFirst, let me find the row where the date is November 14, 1993. Scanning through the 'date' column:\n\n- Week 1: September 5, 1993\n- Week 2: September 12, 1993\n- Week 4: September 26, 1993\n- Week 5: October 3, 1993\n- Week 6: October 10, 1993\n- Week 8: October 25, 1993\n- Week 9: October 31, 1993\n- Week 10: November 7, 1993\n- Week 11: November 14, 1993 (this is the date in question)\n- Week 12: November 21, 1993\n- Week 13: November 28, 1993\n- Week 14: December 5, 1993\n- Week 15: December 12, 1993\n- Week 16: December 19, 1993\n- Week 17: December 26, 1993\n- Week 18: December 31, 1993\n\nSo, the game on November 14 is in row index 10 (since we start counting from 0). Looking at the 'attendance' column for this row: it's 67,329. So the first part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNow, checking whether this attendance was the lowest among all games. I need to look through all 'attendance' values in each row and see if any are lower than 67,329.\n\nLooking at the attendances:\n\n- Week 1: 44,120\n- Week 2: 57,921\n- Week 4: 61,746\n- Week 5: 63,071\n- Week 6: 54,215\n- Week 8: 64,677\n- Week 9: 53,428\n- Week 10: 55,527\n- Week 11: 67,329 (November 14)\n- Week 12: 40,848\n- Week 13: 53,030\n- Week 14: 63,216\n- Week 15: 63,321\n- Week 16: 54,773\n- Week 17: 59,236\n- Week 18: 42,836\n\nWait a minute. I see that week 12 has an attendance of 40,848, which is lower than 67,329. Also, week 18 (December 31) has 42,836 attendees. Both are significantly lower than 67,329.\n\nTherefore, the claim that November 14's game had the lowest attendance with 67,329 is incorrect because there were games with even lower attendances.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells would include the attendance of the November 14 game and all other attendances to confirm the minimum. But according to instructions, I just need to point out the specific cell in question.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because a game on November 21, 1993 had lower attendance than the November 14 game.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 14, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 67329,\n         \"row_index\": 10,\n         \"lowest_attendance_found\": false,\n         \"lower_attendances\": [40848]\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut according to the required format, only the JSON with answer and relevant cells:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 14, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 67329,\n         \"row_index\": 10\n      },\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 21, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 40848,\n         \"row_index\": 11\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, the instructions specify to provide only the JSON with answer and relevant cells as per the example. So I think it's better to just include the specific cells without additional reasoning.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 14, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 67329,\n         \"row_index\": 10\n      },\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 21, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 40848,\n         \"row_index\": 11\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the example given in instructions didn't include 'reasoning' key. So perhaps just specify the answer and relevant cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only the specific cell where the claim is made:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n      {\n         \"row_index\": 10,\n         \"column\": \"attendance\",\n         \"value\": 67329\n      },\n      {\n         \"row_index\": 11,\n         \"column\": \"attendance\",\n         \"value\": 40848\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the initial example didn't include such a structure. Given that, perhaps just indicate the answer as FALSE without additional keys beyond what's in the example.\n\nWait, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user provided an example JSON with \"answer\" and \"reasoning\". So I think including reasoning is acceptable.\n\nFinal step:\n\nThe correct attendance for November 14 is 67,329, but this isn't the lowest. The lowest attendances were lower than that, so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 14, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 67329,\n         \"row_index\": 10\n      },\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 21, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 40848,\n         \"row_index\": 11\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the exact structure might not be necessary. The minimal JSON required is just the answer and relevant cells.\n\nBut perhaps to stick strictly with the example which only had 'answer' and a list of keys under 'reasoning', each specifying row and column.\n\nWait, the initial example didn't have reasoning but showed a possible structure for the answer. But in this case, since the claim is incorrect, I think it's better to provide the necessary information to show why it's false.\n\nBut given that the user said \"No extra keys, no extra text. Just that JSON.\" So perhaps only specifying the cells related to the November 14 game and any lower attendances.\n\nWait, but in the example, they had answer plus a list of relevant cells. So maybe the correct approach is:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n      { \"row_index\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 67329 },\n      { \"row_index\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 40848 }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the initial example didn't have 'relevant_cells'; instead, it had a list under 'reasoning'. But perhaps in this case, to be precise:\n\nThe correct answer is FALSE. The game on November 14 had 67,329 attendees (row index 10), which isn't the lowest as there are other games with lower attendances, such as the one on November 21 with 40,848 attendees (row index 11).\n\nSo, in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      { \"row\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 67329 },\n      { \"row\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 40848 }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut to match the exact example structure given by the user:\n\nThe user provided an example with \"answer\" and a list of objects under 'reasoning', each specifying row and column.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      { \"row\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 67329 },\n      { \"row\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 40848 }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the initial example didn't include 'reasoning', so perhaps it's better to stick with just answer and relevant cells as per:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n      { \"row_index\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\" },\n      { \"row_index\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\" }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut given the instructions are a bit unclear, but to follow the initial example which had \"answer\" and then a list of key-value pairs under 'reasoning' indicating row and column, perhaps:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      { \"row\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\" },\n      { \"row\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\" }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut without including the actual values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just state that the claim is incorrect because a lower attendance exists, but in JSON format as per instructions.\n\nHowever, considering all this, I think the most appropriate response is:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 14, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 67329,\n         \"row_index\": 10\n      },\n      {\n         \"date\": \"November 21, 1993\",\n         \"attendance\": 40848,\n         \"row_index\": 11\n      }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut in the initial example, they didn't include 'reasoning' with date and attendance. They just listed rows and columns.\n\nThus, perhaps sticking strictly to that structure:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      { \"row\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\" },\n      { \"row\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\" }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the problem is that without specifying which attendance values are lower, it's not clear. So perhaps including both:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      { \"row\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 67329 },\n      { \"row\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 40848 }\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates the two attendances in question.\n\nGiven that, I think this is acceptable.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if the attendance on November 14, 1993, was the lowest. The analysis found that it wasn't; a lower attendance occurred on November 21, 1993. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"reasoning\": [\n      { \"row_index\": 10, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 67329 },\n      { \"row_index\": 11, \"column\": \"attendance\", \"value\": 40848 }\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a specific game from week 1 to week 18 in 1993.\n\nThe claim mentions that the Vikings won 9 games and lost 7. So, I need to check each game's result in the table and count the number of wins (W) and losses (L).\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Week 1 - Result is L (24-7 loss)\nRow 1: Week 2 - Result is W (10-7 win)\nRow 3: Week 4 - Result is W (15-13 win)\nRow 4: Week 5 - Result is L (38-19 loss)\nRow 5: Week 6 - Result is W (15-0 win)\nRow 7: Week 8 - Result is W (19-12 win)\nRow 8: Week 9 - Result is L (30-27 loss)\nRow 9: Week 10 - Result is L (30-17 loss)\nRow 10: Week 11 - Result is W (26-23 win)\nRow 11: Week 12 - Result is L (23-10 loss)\nRow 12: Week 13 - Result is L (17-14 loss)\nRow 13: Week 14 - Result is W (13-0 win)\nRow 14: Week 15 - Result is L (37-20 loss)\nRow 15: Week 16 - Result is W (21-17 win)\nRow 16: Week 17 - Result is W (30-10 win)\nRow 17: Week 18 - Result is W (14-9 win)\n\nNow, let's count the wins and losses:\n\nWins (W): Rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table with data about the Minnesota Vikings' 1993 season and a specific claim to verify: \"during the 1993 minnesota viking season there be no week in which the team do not play.\" I need to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that in every week of the 1993 season, the Vikings played a game. In other words, there are no weeks where they had a bye or didn't play a game.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. The weeks are numbered from 1 to 18, but I notice that week numbers are not consecutive. For example, after week 2 comes week 4, skipping week 3. This suggests there might be missing data or possibly a bye week.\n\nThe claim is about whether there's any week where they didn't play. If the table skips certain weeks, it could mean those were bye weeks. Let me check all the week numbers:\n\nWeeks listed: 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nMissing are weeks 3 and 7.\n\nSince there's no data for weeks 3 and 7, it implies that the Vikings didn't play during those weeks. Therefore, the claim that \"there be no week in which the team do not play\" is false because weeks 3 and 7 are missing from the schedule.\n\nTo support this, I should identify relevant cells. Each row corresponds to a game played, so any absence of data for specific weeks indicates they didn't play those weeks. Therefore, the relevant cells are all rows with week numbers, which show that some weeks are missing.\n\nSo, compiling the answer: the claim is FALSE because weeks 3 and 7 are not present in the table, indicating no games were played during those weeks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the game on november 21, 1993 have the lowest attendance of any game with only 55527 crowd.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions a specific date (November 21, 1993) and claims that this game had the lowest attendance with exactly 55,527 attendees.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for the game on November 21, 1993. Scanning the 'date' column, I find that week 12 corresponds to November 21, 1993. The attendance for this game is listed as 40,848.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is indeed the lowest attendance throughout the season. I'll review all the attendance numbers from weeks 1 through 18:\n\n- Week 1: 44,120\n- Week 2: 57,921\n- Week 4: 61,746\n- Week 5: 63,071\n- Week 6: 54,215\n- Week 8: 64,677\n- Week 9: 53,428\n- Week 10: 55,527\n- Week 11: 67,329\n- Week 12: 40,848\n- Week 13: 53,030\n- Week 14: 63,216\n- Week 15: 63,321\n- Week 16: 54,773\n- Week 17: 59,236\n- Week 18: 42,836\n\nFrom this list, the lowest attendance is actually 40,848 on November 21, 1993 (Week 12). However, the claim says that the game on November 21 had an attendance of 55,527, which doesn't match. Instead, Week 10's game on November 7 has the closest figure to 55,527 at 55,527 attendees.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it misattributes the attendance number and also incorrectly identifies the date as having the lowest attendance when in fact Week 18 (December 31) had even lower attendance with 42,836. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be no week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to more than zero point.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's a bit of old-fashioned language, but I think it's asking if there was any week where the Minnesota Vikings allowed their opponents to score more than zero points. So, in other words, did the Vikings ever win a game by shutout? Or perhaps whether all their games had the opponent scoring at least one point.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of the season with details like date, opponent, result, and attendance. The result column shows either a 'W' for win or 'L' for loss, followed by the score. For example, in Week 1, they lost to the Los Angeles Raiders with a score of 24-7.\n\nI need to check each game's result to see if there's any instance where the opponent scored zero points. That would mean looking at the opponent's score in each game and seeing if it ever was zero.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nWeek 1: Opponent scored 24 points (RAIDERS 24, Vikings 7) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 2: Chicago Bears scored 7 points (Vikings 10-7) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 4: Green Bay Packers scored 13 (Vikings 15-13) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 5: San Francisco 49ers scored 38 (Vikings lost 38-19) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 6: Tampa Bay Buccaneers scored 0? Wait, the result is W 15-0. Oh! So in Week 6, the Vikings won with a score of 15-0. That means their opponent, the Buccaneers, scored zero points.\n\nSo that's one week where the opponent was held to zero. But wait, let me check all weeks just to be thorough.\n\nWeek 8: Chicago Bears scored 12 (Vikings 19-12) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 9: Detroit Lions scored 30 (Vikings lost 30-27) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 10: San Diego Chargers scored 30 (Vikings lost 30-17) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 11: Denver Broncos scored 23 (Vikings won 26-23) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 12: Tampa Bay Buccaneers scored 23 (Vikings lost 23-10) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 13: New Orleans Saints scored 17 (Vikings lost 17-14) \u2192 Opponent >0\nWeek 14: Detroit Lions scored 0? No, the result is W 13-0. So Vikings won 13-0, meaning the opponent scored zero points here too.\n\nWait a minute, I thought only Week 6 was a shutout, but looking again at Week 14, they also shut out the Detroit Lions with a score of 13-0. So that's another week where the opponent scored zero.\n\nTherefore, there are weeks (Week 6 and Week 14) where the Vikings held their opponents to zero points. But wait, the claim says \"no week\" where they held the opponent to more than zero points. Wait, no\u2014that would mean in all weeks, the opponent scored at least one point. But we found two weeks where the opponent scored zero.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the claim again: \"there be no week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to more than zero point.\" Hmm, that's a bit unclear. It seems like it's saying there's no week where the Vikings held the opponent to more than zero points, meaning all opponents scored at least one point. But that's not true because in Week 6 and Week 14, the opponents scored zero.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted. Let me read it again: \"there be no week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to more than zero point.\" Maybe it means there is no week where they held the opponent to a score above zero. But that's not what they're saying; perhaps it's phrased incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that the Vikings never allowed an opponent to score more than zero points in any week. That would mean every game resulted in the opponent scoring zero or less, which isn't possible because scores can't be negative. So that interpretation doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a translation issue or old language. Maybe it's supposed to say \"there is no week where the Vikings held their opponents to more than zero points,\" meaning they didn't have any games where the opponent scored over zero. But that would mean all opponents scored zero, which isn't true because most of them scored multiple points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrectly phrased and should be \"there is no week where the Vikings held their opponents to more than zero points,\" implying they never had a game where they didn't allow any points. But that's not correct either because they did have two shutouts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The claim as stated: \"there be no week in which the minnesota viking hold their opponent to more than zero point.\" So, does that mean that there is no week where the Vikings allowed their opponents to score more than zero? No, because they did have weeks where opponents scored points.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as \"there is no week where the Vikings held their opponents to a score above zero,\" which would mean all games had opponents scoring zero or less. But that can't be true since most opponents scored multiple points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is saying that in every week, the opponent scored more than zero points. That would make sense if the claim was trying to state that the Vikings never shut out any team, meaning they always allowed at least one point. But looking back, we saw that in Week 6 and Week 14, the opponents scored zero.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE because there are weeks where the Vikings held their opponents to zero points.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there are two weeks (Week 6 and Week 14) where the Minnesota Vikings held their opponents to zero points. Therefore, they did have weeks where the opponent scored more than zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the game on november 14 , 1993 have the highest attendance of any game with 54215 attendee\".\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table to find the game that took place on November 14, 1993. Scanning down the 'date' column, I see that week 11 has a date of november 14 , 1993. The opponent for that game was denver broncos, and the result was a win with a score of w 26-23. The attendance for this game is listed as 67329.\n\nNext, I need to check if this attendance figure is indeed the highest in the table. To do that, I'll go through each row's 'attendance' column and compare them all.\n\nLooking at the attendances:\n- Week 1: 44120\n- Week 2: 57921\n- Week 4: 61746\n- Week 5: 63071\n- Week 6: 54215\n- Week 8: 64677\n- Week 9: 53428\n- Week 10: 55527\n- Week 11: 67329 (the game in question)\n- Week 12: 40848\n- Week 13: 53030\n- Week 14: 63216\n- Week 15: 63321\n- Week 16: 54773\n- Week 17: 59236\n- Week 18: 42836\n\nComparing all these, I see that the highest attendance is 67329 on November 14, 1993. The claim mentions that this game had the highest attendance with 54215 attendees. Wait a minute, there's a discrepancy here. The attendance in the table for week 11 (November 14) is 67329, not 54215.\n\nLooking back at the claim, it says \"54215 attendee\". That number actually appears in week 6, which was on October 10, 1993 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But that's a different game altogether with a much lower attendance than the one on November 14.\n\nSo, while the November 14 game did have the highest attendance of 67329, the claim incorrectly states the attendance as 54215 and attributes it to that date. Therefore, the claim is false because it either misstates the number or incorrectly associates a lower attendance figure with the high-attendance game.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"date\"}, {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]}",

Let me recount:\n\nWins:\n\nRow1: W\nRow2: W (week4)\nRow4: W (week6)\nRow5: W (week8)\nRow8: W (week11)\nRow11: W (week14)\nRow13: W (week16)\nRow14: W (week17)\nRow15: W (week18)\n\nThat's 9 wins.\n\nLosses:\n\nRow0: L\nRow3: L\nRow6: L (week9)\nRow7: L (week10)\nRow9: L (week12)\nRow10: L (week13)\nRow12: L (week15)\n\nThat's 7 losses.\n\nSo total games listed: 16. So if the team had 9 wins and 7 losses, that would be a 9-7 record, not 8-6 as claimed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me list each week's result:\n\nWeek1: L\nWeek2: W\nWeek4: W\nWeek5: L\nWeek6: W\nWeek8: W\nWeek9: L\nWeek10: L\nWeek11: W\nWeek12: L\nWeek13: L\nWeek14: W\nWeek15: L\nWeek16: W\nWeek17: W\nWeek18: W\n\nNow, counting:\n\nWins: Week2,4,6,8,11,14,16,17,18 \u2192 9 wins.\n\nLosses: Week1,5,9,10,12,13,15 \u2192 7 losses.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim of 8-6 is incorrect; it should be 9-7 based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states the Minnesota Vikings won 8 games and lost 6 during the 1993 season. Based on the table:\n\n- **Wins (W):** Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18 \u2192 Total of 9 wins.\n- **Losses (L):** Weeks 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 \u2192 Total of 7 losses.\n\nThe actual record is 9-7, not 8-6. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": \"false\",\n    \"wins\": 9,\n    \"losses\": 7\n}\n```",
