    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about two individuals, Lavar Johnson and Anthony Fuller, participating in specific events: WEC 9 and WEC 8 respectively. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It states that \"lavar johnson and anthony fulller be at the wec 9 and wec 8 , rspectively.\" So, Lavar Johnson should be associated with WEC 9, and Anthony Fuller with WEC 8.\n\nNext, I'll look into the table to find any entries related to these two names. Scanning through the \"opponent\" column, I spot two relevant rows:\n\n1. The first row mentions \"lavar johnson\" as the opponent in a win where the record was 2-0 at WEC 9. This seems to match Lavar Johnson's participation in WEC 9.\n   \n2. Another row lists \"anthony fuller\" as the opponent in a win with a record of 1-0 at WEC 8, which aligns with Anthony Fuller being at WEC 8.\n\nNow, I need to verify the exact event names and ensure they match the claim. The events for these two rows are indeed WEC 9 and WEC 8 respectively, as stated in the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries involving Lavar Johnson or Anthony Fuller in different events that might contradict the claim. However, a quick scan shows no other instances of these names, so there's no conflicting information.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table: Lavar Johnson at WEC 9 and Anthony Fuller at WEC 8. This means the claim is fully accurate based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the match against jame irvin and anthony arria both last less than a minute.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find matches involving these two opponents. Let's go row by row.\n\nLooking at each opponent column:\n- Jame Irvin is listed in row 20 (0-based index 19) as the opponent. The result for that match is a loss with time \"3:35\". Wait, no\u2014row 19 is against Tim McKenzie, not Irvin. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at each row:\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 24 (since there are 25 entries). I need to find where the opponent is either \"jame irvin\" or \"anthony arria.\"\n\nScanning through:\n- For Anthony Arria: Found in row 19. The time is listed as \"0:22\", which is 22 seconds.\n- For Jame Irvin: Looking again, I see a match against \"james irvin\" in row 21 (opponent column). Wait no, checking the table:\n\nWait, let me correct that. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking at each opponent name:\n- Row 0: brett cooper\n- Row 1: sultan aliev\n- ...\n- Row 5: jeff terry\n- Row 6: loss against tim mckenzie (opponent is Tim McKenzie)\n- Row 7: opponent is james irvin. Let me check that row.\n\nRow index 7: Opponent is \"james irvin\", result is a loss, time is \"0:45\" in column 'time'. So time is 45 seconds.\n\nRow 19: Opponent is \"anthony arria\". The time for that match is \"0:22\".\n\nSo both matches (against Jame Irvin and Anthony Arria) have times of less than a minute.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"rafael real and phil collins both go down to a tko due to punch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the claim. It states that two specific opponents, Rafael Real and Phil Collins, were defeated by a Technical Knockout (TKO) via punches. So, I need to check if both these names appear in the 'opponent' column with the corresponding 'method' being 'tko  (punches)' or similar.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match outcome with details like result, record, opponent, method, etc. The relevant columns for this claim are 'opponent' and 'method'.\n\nI'll go through each row to find entries where the opponent is either Rafael Real or Phil Collins and check if their respective methods of loss were a TKO due to punches.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few rows don't list these two as opponents.\n- Scanning down, I notice that in Row 12 (0-based index: 12), the opponent is \"rafael real\" and the method is \"tko  (punches)\". This matches the claim for Rafael Real.\n\nContinuing further:\n- In Row 13 (index 13), the opponent is \"phil collins\" with a method of \"tko  (punches)\". This also aligns with the claim regarding Phil Collins.\n\nSince both Rafael Real and Phil Collins are listed as opponents who went down to a TKO via punches, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells:\n- For Rafael Real: Row index 12, columns 'opponent' and 'method'.\n- For Phil Collins: Row index 13, columns 'opponent' and 'method'.\n\nI need to compile these into the required JSON format with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\".\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"Doug Marshall took more time to win the match against Anthony Fuller than Lavar Johnson\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing two fights: one where Doug Marshall fought Anthony Fuller and another where he fought Lavar Johnson. The claim states that the time taken to win against Anthony Fuller was more than the time taken against Lavar Johnson.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like result, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, and location. I need to find the rows where Doug Marshall is fighting both Anthony Fuller and Lavar Johnson.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. The last row has \"opponent\" as Anthony Fuller, and it's a win with a submission (strikes) in 0:32 time.\n2. Another row mentions Lavar Johnson as the opponent, also a win by tko (corner stoppage) in 5:00.\n\nWait, but hold on, I don't see Doug Marshall listed anywhere in the table. The rows list opponents like Brett Cooper, Sultan Aliev, etc., and the names under 'res' are all wins or losses without mentioning the fighter's name beyond that. It seems like this table is from Doug Marshall's perspective, listing his fights against various opponents.\n\nSo, each row shows Doug Marshall fighting someone else, with details of the fight. Therefore, I can assume that the \"opponent\" column refers to who Doug Marshall fought, and \"res\" indicates whether he won or lost.\n\nNow, focusing on Anthony Fuller: looking for any row where the opponent is Anthony Fuller. Scanning through, yes, the last row has Anthony Fuller as the opponent. The time taken was 0:32.\n\nNext, looking for Lavar Johnson as an opponent. I see a row with Lavar Johnson, and the time there was 5:00.\n\nNow, comparing the two times:\n\n- Against Anthony Fuller: 0:32\n- Against Lavar Johnson: 5:00\n\nThe claim is that Doug Marshall took more time to win against Anthony Fuller than against Lavar Johnson. But in reality, 0:32 is less than 5:00. Therefore, the time taken against Anthony Fuller was actually shorter.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because it's the opposite of what happened. The relevant cells are the two rows where Doug Marshall fought Anthony Fuller and Lavar Johnson, specifically looking at the \"time\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the match against anthony arria last longer than the match against james irvin\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look for both opponents in the table: Anthony Arria and James Irvin.\n\nLooking through the rows, I find:\n\n- For Anthony Arria:\n  - The row shows \"win\" with opponent \"anthony arria\".\n  - Time listed is \"0:22\".\n\n- For James Irvin:\n  - The row shows \"loss\" with opponent \"james irvin\".\n  - Time listed is \"0:45\".\n\nWait, but the claim says that the match against Anthony Arria lasted longer than against James Irvin. But according to these times, Anthony's match was 0:22 and James' was 0:45. So 22 seconds vs 45 seconds. That would mean James' match lasted longer, making the claim FALSE.\n\nWait a second\u2014am I looking at the right rows? Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Anthony Arria is in the row where opponent is \"anthony arria\", which is row index 21 (counting from 0). Time is 0:22.\n  \n- James Irvin is in row index 22.

Let me list all opponents and their times correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for both names:\n\nLooking for Anthony Arria:\nFound at row index where opponent is \"anthony arria\". From the data provided:\n\nIn the JSON-like structure given, looking through each object (row):\n\nRow 0: \"opponent\": \"Brett Cooper\", time: \"2:16\"\n...\nWait no, perhaps I'm getting confused because in the problem statement, it's presented as a table with columns, not rows. Let me make sure.\n\nIn the problem, the table is provided as multiple rows, each with several columns. The claim refers to two opponents: Anthony Arria and James Irvin.\n\nI need to find their respective matches' duration (time).\n\nLooking for \"anthony arria\":\n\nFound in a row where opponent is \"anthony arria\". From the data:\n\nIn the table, let's see:\n\n- Row 20: opponent \"carlos garcia\", time \"2:46\" (win)\nRow 21: opponent \"anthony arria\", time \"0:22\"\nSo row index 21 for Anthony Arria.\n\nFor James Irvin:\n\nLooking through the table, found in a loss row. The row where opponent is \"james irvin\". From the data:\n\n- Row 23: opponent \"tim mckenzie\", time \"3:35\" (loss)\nRow 24: opponent \"james irvin\", time \"0:45\" (loss)\n\nWait, no. Let me check each row correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all opponents and their times:\n\nLooking through the table as provided in the problem statement:\n\nEach row has opponent and time. Here's a summary of relevant rows:\n\n- Row 21: opponent \"anthony arria\", time \"0:22\"\n- Row 23: opponent \"james irvin\", time \"0:45\"\n\nWait, but earlier I thought James Irvin was in row index 22 or something else. Let me recount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to go through each row step by step:\n\nRow indices from 0 to let's see how many rows there are.\n\nLooking at the table provided, starting from the top:\n\n1. Row 0: opponent Brett Cooper\n...\nContinuing until I find Anthony Arria and James Irvin.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that in the problem statement, the table has these opponents:\n\nAt row index 20: Carlos Garcia (time 2:46)\nRow 21: anthony arria (0:22)\nRow 22: lavar johnson (5:00)\nRow 23: tim mckenzie (3:35) [loss]\nRow 24: james irvin (0:45) [loss]\n\nWait, no. Looking at the table structure:\n\nThe table starts with row 0 as:\n\n\"opponent\": \"Brett Cooper\", time: \"2:16\"\n\nThen row 1: opponent \"something else\"\n\nContinuing until I find Anthony Arria and James Irvin.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to realize that regardless of their positions, the times are 0:22 for Anthony Arria and 3:35 for James Irvin? Or is it different?\n\nWait no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nLooking through each row in order, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me parse the table correctly:\n\nThe table has these opponents and times (only listing relevant ones):\n\n- Row where opponent is \"anthony arria\": time is 0:22\n- Row where opponent is \"james irvin\": time is 3:35\n\nWait, no. Let's see.\n\nIn the problem statement, looking at each row:\n\nFrom the data given in the table:\n\nRow indices are from 0 upwards.\n\nLooking for the two opponents:\n\n1. For \"anthony arria\":\nFound in a row where opponent is anthony arria. From the table provided, that row has time \"0:22\".\n\n2. For \"james irvin\":\nFound in a row where opponent is james irvin. That row has time \"3:35\".\n\nSo, Anthony Arria's match lasted 0:22 minutes (22 seconds), and James Irvin's match lasted 3:35 minutes (3 minutes 35 seconds).\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was different. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nEach row has a time, which is in the format \"minutes:seconds\".\n\nSo for Anthony Arria's match, the time is 0:22 (very short), and James Irvin's is 3:35.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm confusing the rows. Let me check each opponent with their respective times:\n\nFrom the table provided in the problem statement:\n\n- Row where opponent is \"anthony arria\": yes, time is 0:22.\n- Row where opponent is \"james irvin\": time is 3:35.\n\nSo, Anthony Arria's match took 22 seconds, while James Irvin's took 3 minutes and 35 seconds.\n\nWait, that seems odd. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the problem statement's table, for each row, it's structured as opponent, result (win or loss), time.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow where opponent is \"anthony arria\":\n- Opponent: anthony arria\n- Result: win\n- Time: 0:22\n\nRow where opponent is \"james irvin\":\n- Opponent: james irvin\n- Result: loss\n- Time: 3:35\n\nSo, yes, the times are as I mentioned.\n\nBut this seems odd because a match time of 0:22 would mean it ended very quickly. It's possible, but perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table is structured differently. Let me look again:\n\nIn the problem statement, the table starts with:\n\n- Row 0: opponent \"Brett Cooper\", result \"win\", time \"2:16\"\n...\nContinuing until row 24.\n\nSo, focusing on the two opponents in question:\n\n1. anthony arria:\nLooking through the rows, I find a row where opponent is \"anthony arria\". Let's say that's at row index x. The time there is 0:22.\n\n2. james irvin:\nLooking for a row with opponent \"james irvin\", found with time 3:35.\n\nSo according to this, the times are as stated.\n\nNow, returning to the question: it's asking which match lasted longer\u2014the one against Anthony Arria or James Irvin?\n\nGiven that Anthony Arria's match was 0:22 (22 seconds) and James Irvin's was 3:35 (3 minutes 35 seconds), clearly James Irvin's match lasted much longer.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the times. Let me double-check:\n\nIn the table provided, for \"anthony arria\", time is indeed 0:22.\n\nFor \"james irvin\", the time is 3:35.\n\nSo yes, James Irvin's match was longer.\n</think>\n\nThe match against James Irvin lasted longer than the one against Anthony Arria.",

So, it's a TKO, not a KO.\n\n- For Phil Collins: The row has Opponent 'phil collins', Round 2, Method 'tko (punches)'. Again, it's a TKO in round 2, not a KO in the first round.\n\nSince both were knocked out by methods other than KO and not in the first round as per the claim, the statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n**Answer:** The claim is FALSE because neither Rafael Real nor Phil Collins were knocked out (KO) in the first round; they were TKO'd in their respective matches. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"the match against sultan aliev and lavar johnson be both decide by submission\". \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two specific opponents: Sultan Aliev and Lavar Johnson. The claim states that both of their matches were decided by submission. So, I need to check each of these two rows in the table to see if the method was indeed a submission.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one. \n\n1. **Sultan Aliev**: I scan down the 'opponent' column until I find \"sultan aliev\". That's the second row (row index 2). The 'method' for this match is listed as \"decision  (split)\". Decision doesn't mean submission; it means the judges decided the outcome, not a submission or knockout. So, this match wasn't decided by submission.\n\n2. **Lavar Johnson**: Next, I look for \"lavar johnson\" in the 'opponent' column. That appears towards the bottom of the table (row index 21). The method here is listed as \"tko (corner stoppage)\". Tko stands for technical knockout, which can occur if a fighter is unable to continue due to strikes, but it's not a submission where an opponent taps out or is forced to give up. So, this match also wasn't decided by submission.\n\nSince neither of the matches against Sultan Aliev nor Lavar Johnson were decided by submission methods (they were decided by split decision and technical knockout respectively), the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
