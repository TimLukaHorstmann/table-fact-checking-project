    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"until 2012, black actresses have only won 7 golden globes\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row in the table and look for entries where the result is 'won' and check if the year is up to 2012. Also, I need to confirm that the actor's name indicates a black actress, but since the table doesn't specify ethnicity, I'll assume all listed actors are black as per the context.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: juanita moore - nominated, so not a win.\nRow 1: dorothy dandridge - nominated.\nRow 2: claudia mcneil - nominated.\nRow 3: beah richards - nominated.\nRow 4: abbey lincoln - nominated.\nRow 5: lola falana - new star, nominated.\nRow 6: diana ross - new star, won.

    "claim": "the longest drought between nomination have be 6 year , between 1962 - 68 and 1975 - 1981",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the longest drought between nomination have be 6 year , between 1962 - 68 and 1975 - 1981.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"drought\" means in this context. It likely refers to the time period where there were no nominations for a particular award category. The claim mentions two intervals: from 1962-68 and from 1975-1981, each lasting 6 years.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check if these periods indeed had no nominations. Let's examine each interval.\n\nStarting with 1962-1968:\nThe table shows that in 1962, Claudia McNeil was nominated for Best Actress - Drama for \"A Raisin in the Sun.\" The next nomination after 1962 is Beah Richards in 1968 for Best Supporting Actress. So between 1963 and 1967, there are no nominations listed. That's a period of 5 years without any nominations (from 1963 to 1967 inclusive).\n\nNext, looking at 1975-1981:\nIn 1975, Diahann Carroll was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy for \"Claudine.\" The next nomination is Irene Cara in 1981 for the same category. So between 1976 and 1980, there are no nominations listed. That's a period of 4 years without any nominations (from 1976 to 1980 inclusive).\n\nWait, but the claim mentions these as two separate droughts each lasting 6 years. Let me double-check.\n\nThe first interval is from 1962 to 1968. The time between 1962 and 1968 would be 6 years (including both 1962 and 1968). However, in reality, the nominations in these years are present: 1962 has a nomination, and 1968 also does. So the drought between them is from 1963 to 1967, which is 5 years.\n\nSimilarly, from 1975 to 1981: the drought would be from 1976 to 1980, which is 4 years. But the claim says both periods are 6 years long.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me recount:\n\nFrom 1962 to 1968 inclusive is 7 years (including start and end). The last nomination in 1962, next in 1968: the gap between them is 1963-1967, which is 5 years without nominations. Similarly, from 1975 to 1981 inclusive is also 7 years, with no nominations in between except at the endpoints.\n\nBut the claim states each drought was 6 years. So perhaps it's considering the time between the end of one nomination and the start of another. For example, after 1962, the next nomination is in 1968: that's a gap of 6 years (from 1963 to 1968). Similarly, from 1975 to 1981, it's also a 6-year gap (from 1976 to 1981).\n\nWait, let me think again. If the last nomination is in 1962 and the next is in 1968, that's a span of 6 years between them (1963-1968). Similarly, from 1975 to 1981: 1976-1981 is 6 years. So each gap is indeed 6 years.\n\nBut looking back at the table, in 1962, there's a nomination, and then next in 1968, so that's a 6-year gap without nominations in between (from 1963 to 1967 inclusive: that's 5 years). Similarly, from 1975 to 1981, the gap is 4 years. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because the second period isn't a 6-year drought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to calculate the drought. Perhaps it's counting the number of years without any nominations between two nominated years. For example, from 1962 (nominated) to next nomination in 1968: that's a gap of 5 years (since 1963-1967). Similarly, from 1975 to 1981: the gap is 4 years.\n\nIn that case, neither of these periods are 6-year droughts. So the claim might be incorrect because both gaps are shorter than 6 years.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting the intervals. Let me list all the nomination years:\n\nLooking at the table, let's extract the years when nominations occurred:\n\n1962: Yes\n1968: Yes\n1975: Yes\n1981: Yes\n\nBetween 1962 and 1968: The next nomination after 1962 is in 1968. So from 1963 to 1967, that's 5 years without nominations.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1981: Next nomination after 1975 is in 1981. From 1976 to 1980, that's 4 years without nominations.\n\nThus, the longest drought would be 5 years (from 1963-1967). The claim says both are 6 years, which isn't accurate because one is 5 and the other is 4. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there were two droughts of 6 years each between nominations in 1962-68 and 1975-81. However, upon reviewing the table, the droughts are actually shorter: 5 years from 1963-1967 and 4 years from 1976-1980. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the most common golden globe for a black actress to win be for best support actress.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It's suggesting that among all the Golden Globe awards won by black actresses in the table provided, the majority of these wins are for Best Supporting Actress roles. So, my task is to check how many times a black actress has won a Golden Globe and see if most of those wins are in the Best Supporting Actress category.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to go through each row where the result is \"won\" because only those indicate actual wins, not just nominations. Let's scan through each year:\n\n- 1960: juanita moore was nominated but didn't win.\n- 1960: dorothy dandridge also nominated but no win here either.\n- 1962: claudia mcneil was nominated, not a winner in this row.\n- 1968: beah richards was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- 1969: abbey lincoln was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n- 1971: lola falana was nominated but didn't win here.\n- 1973: diana ross won as a New Star - Actress, so that's one win. The category is \"new star - actress.\"\n- 1973: diana ross was also nominated for Best Actress - Drama but didn't win there.\n- 1973: cicely tyson was nominated for Best Actress - Drama.\n- 1975: diahann carroll was nominated, no win here.\n- 1981: irene cara was nominated, not a winner in this entry.\n- 1984: jennifer beals was nominated but didn't win according to the table.\n- 1986: oprah winfrey won Best Supporting Actress for The Color Purple. That's another win.\n- 1986: whoopi goldberg won Best Actress - Drama, so that's a third win.\n- 1991: whoopi goldberg won Best Supporting Actress again. Now we're at four wins.\n- 1993: whoopi goldberg was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy but didn't win here.\n- 1993: alfre woodard was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, no win listed.\n- 1994: angela bassett won Best Actress - Musical or Comedy. That's a fifth win.\n- 1997: marianne jean - baptiste was nominated but didn't win here.\n- 1998: pam grier was nominated but no win in this entry.\n- 2002: halle berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama, didn't win as per the table.\n- 2003: queen latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but didn't win here.\n- 2007: jennifer hudson won Best Supporting Actress. That's six wins.\n- 2007: beyonc\u00e9 knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy, no win.\n- 2009: viola davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but didn't win here.\n- 2010: mo'niq Uue won Best Supporting Actress. That's seven wins.\n- 2010: gabourey sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama, no win.\n- 2011: halle berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama but didn't win here.\n- 2012: octavia spencer won Best Supporting Actress. Wait, that's an additional row I haven't seen yet in the table provided? Or maybe it's a typo since the last entry is 2012 with octavia spencer winning for \"best support actress.\" Hmm, but looking back at the given table, I don't see this row. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount properly from the provided table:\n\n- Diana Ross: won in 1973 (New Star - Actress)\n- Whoopi Goldberg: 1986 (Best Actress - Drama), 1991 (Best Supporting Actress) \u2192 two wins\n- Jennifer Hudson: 2007 (Best Supporting Actress)\n- Mo'niq Uue (probably a typo for Mo'Nique): 2010 (Best Supporting Actress)\n- Octavia Spencer: if present, but not in the given table.\n\nWait no, looking back at the provided table, I see:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to let's count them:\n\n0: juanita moore\n1: dorothy dandridge\n2: claudia mcneil\n3: beah richards\n4: abbey lincoln\n5: lola falana\n6: diana ross (won)\n7: diana ross (nominated)\n8: cicely tyson (nominated)\n9: diahann carroll (nominated)\n10: irene cara (nominated)\n11: jennifer beals (nominated)\n12: oprah winfrey (won) - Best Support Actress\n13: whoopi goldberg (won) - Best Actress Drama\n14: whoopi goldberg (nominated)\n15: alfre woodard (nominated)\n16: angela bassett (won) - Best Actress Musical or Comedy\n17: marianne jean-baptiste (nominated)\n18: pam grier (nominated)\n19: halle berry (nominated)\n20: queen latifah (nominated)\n21: jennifer hudson (won) - Best Support\n22: beyonc\u00e9 knowles (nominated)\n23: viola davis (nominated)\n24: mo'niq Uue (won) - Best Support\n25: gabourey sidibe (nominated)\n26: halle berry (nominated)\n27: octavia spencer (won) - Best Support\n\nWait, but in the table provided, I only see up to row index 30? Or maybe it's a different count. Wait no, looking at the initial table:\n\nThe table has rows from 1960 to 2012, and each entry is a separate row.\n\nLet me list all the \"won\" entries:\n\n- Diana Ross (row 6): New Star - Actress\n- Oprah Winfrey (row 12): Best Supporting Actress\n- Whoopi Goldberg (row 13): Best Actress Drama\n- Angela Bassett (row 16): Best Actress Musical or Comedy\n- Jennifer Hudson (row 21): Best Supporting Actress\n- Mo'Nique (row 24): Best Supporting Actress\n- Octavia Spencer (row 27): Best Supporting Actress\n\nWait, so in the table provided, there are seven wins:\n\n1. Diana Ross - New Star - Actress\n2. Oprah Winfrey - Best Support\n3. Whoopi Goldberg - Best Actress Drama\n4. Angela Bassett - Best Actress Musical or Comedy\n5. Jennifer Hudson - Best Support\n6. Mo'Nique - Best Support\n7. Octavia Spencer - Best Support\n\nWait, that's a total of seven wins.\n\nNow, among these seven, how many are for Best Supporting Actress?\n\n- Oprah Winfrey: yes (row 12)\n- Jennifer Hudson: yes (row 21)\n- Mo'Nique: yes (row 24)\n- Octavia Spencer: yes (row 27)\n\nThat's four wins in Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThe other three wins are:\n\n- Diana Ross: New Star - Actress\n- Whoopi Goldberg: Best Actress Drama\n- Angela Bassett: Best Actress Musical or Comedy\n\nSo, out of seven total wins, four are for Best Supporting Actress. The claim says that the most common is Best Support Actress. Since 4/7 (~57%) are in support categories, which is more than any other category.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the majority of the Golden Globe wins by black actresses in this table are for Best Supporting Actress.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified to be TRUE as the majority of the wins are in the Best Supporting Actress category. The relevant cells include all rows where a win occurred and specifically the \"Award\" column to identify the category.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": {\n    \"text\": \"The claim is TRUE because, among seven total Golden Globe wins by black actresses listed, four were for Best Supporting Actress, making it the most common award category.\"\n  },\n  \"result\": {\n    \"answer\": \"The claim is TRUE.\",\n    \"reasoning\": {\n      \"total_wins\": 7,\n      \"support_actress_wins\": 4,\n      \"other_award_wins\": 3\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"From 2000 - 2012, there have been 6 years where a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. I need to check each year between 2000 and 2012 and see if in those years, there were instances where no black actresses received any nominations for the Golden Globes. The claim mentions that this happened six times within that period.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists various years from 1960 onwards with information about actresses, their awards, movies, and results (whether they won or were nominated). However, I notice that in the given table, there are only a few entries between 2000 and 2012. Let me list those out:\n\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama for \"Monster's Ball.\"\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for \"Chicago.\"\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won for Best Supporting Actress in \"Dreamgirls,\" and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy for the same movie.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for \"Doubt.\"\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won for Best Supporting Actress for \"Precious,\" and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in the same film.\n- 2011: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama for \"Frankie and Alice.\"\n- 2012: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Actress - Drama for \"The Help,\" and Octavia Spencer won for Best Supporting Actress in the same movie.\n\nNow, let's look at each year from 2000 to 2012:\n\n- 2000: No entries in the table. Since there are no nominations listed, I can't confirm any black actresses were nominated that year.\n- 2001: Similarly, no data for this year either.\n- 2002: As mentioned, Halle Berry was nominated.\n- 2003: Queen Latifah received a nomination.\n- 2004: No entries. So, potentially, no nominations.\n- 2005: No data again.\n- 2006: Still nothing listed here.\n- 2007: Two nominations.\n- 2008: The table doesn't show any nominations for this year.\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated.\n- 2010: Two nominations.\n- 2011: One nomination.\n- 2012: Two nominations.\n\nFrom the years 2000 to 2012, the table shows data starting from 2002. The years without any entries are 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, and 2006, as well as 2008. That's six years in total where there are no nominations listed for black actresses.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether the absence of data necessarily means that no nominations occurred. It could be possible that the table doesn't include all relevant nominations, but based solely on the given information, those six years have no entries indicating any nominations for black actresses. Therefore, according to the table provided, there are indeed six years where a black actress was not nominated for any Golden Globe between 2000 and 2012.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It claims that Whoopi Goldberg was the sole winner of the Best Actress in Drama award, specifically in 1986.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find all entries where the \"award\" column is \"best actress - drama\" and check who won it. Let's go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: 1960, Juanita Moore, Best Supporting Actress \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 1: 1960, Dorothy Dandridge, Best Actress - Musical or Comedy \u2013 not Drama.\n- Row 2: 1962, Claudia Mcneil, Best Actress - Drama.

In the table, I see that in row 25, Viola Davis was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in 2012. But did she win? Looking back, no, her result was \"nominated.\" The winner was Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nWait a second\u2014did any other actor besides Whoopi Goldberg win Best Actress in Drama?

All others either were nominated or were in different categories.\n\nWait, but looking at row 6: Diana Ross had two awards in 1973\u2014New Star and Best Actress - Drama. She won the New Star award but was only nominated for Drama. So no win there.\n\nRow 25: Viola Davis was nominated in 2012 for Best Actress - Drama, but didn't win; the winner that year was Octavia Spencer in a supporting category.\n\nSo based on this, Whoopi Goldberg is indeed the only person who has won the Best Actress in Drama award according to the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Whoopi Goldberg is the sole winner of the Best Actress in Drama award, specifically in 1986. Reviewing the table confirms that she was the only recipient with a \"won\" result in that category.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim \"until 2012, black actors have only won 9 golden globes\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It states that up until the year 2012, black actors have won a total of nine Golden Globes. So, my task is to check how many times black actors have actually won awards in this table and see if it matches nine.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award nomination or win for a specific actor in a given year. The columns include \"year\", \"actor\", \"award\", \"motion picture\", and \"result\". I'm particularly interested in the \"year\" and \"result\" columns because I need to count how many times an actor has won (\"won\") up until 2012.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **1960**: juanita moore was nominated for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 result is \"nominated\". So, no win here.\n2. **1960**: dorothy dandridge was also nominated in a different category \u2013 same as above.\n3. **1962**: claudia mcneil was nominated but didn't win.\n4. **1968**: beah richards was nominated, no win.\n5. **1969**: abbey lincoln was nominated.\n6. **1971**: lola falana was nominated in the New Star category \u2013 still a nomination.\n7. **1973**: diana ross has two entries here. The first is for \"New Star - Actress\" where she won, so that's one win. The second entry is a nomination for Best Actress in Drama, but it didn't result in a win.\n\nSo, by 1973, we have one win from Diana Ross.\n\nMoving on:\n\n8. **1975**: diahann carroll was nominated.\n9. **1981**: irene cara was nominated.\n10. **1984**: jennifer beals was nominated.\n11. **1986**: oprah winfrey was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, but the result is \"nominated\". However, whoopi goldberg in 1986 won Best Actress in Drama for \"The Color Purple\" \u2013 that's a second win.\n\nSo now, up to 1986, we have two wins: Diana Ross (1973) and Whoopi Goldberg (1986).\n\nContinuing:\n\n12. **1991**: whoopi goldberg won Best Supporting Actress for \"Ghost\" \u2013 that's a third win.\n13. **1993**: whoopi goldberg was nominated in the musical/comedy category, but didn't win. Another entry here is alfre woodard, also nominated.\n\nStill three wins so far.\n\n14. **1994**: angela bassett won Best Actress for \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" \u2013 that's a fourth win.\n15. **1997**: marianne jean-baptiste was nominated but didn't win.\n16. **1998**: pam grier was nominated.\n\nStill four wins up until 1998.\n\nNext:\n\n17. **2002**: halle berry was nominated in the drama category.\n18. **2003**: queen latifah was nominated as Best Supporting Actress.\n19. **2007**: jennifer Hudson won for Best Supporting Actress in \"Dreamgirls\" \u2013 that's a fifth win. Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, also in 2007, was nominated but didn't win.\n\nFifth win by Jennifer Hudson (2007).\n\nContinuing:\n\n20. **2012**: Looking at the last two rows, both are from 2012. The first is a nomination for someone else, and the second is octavia spencer winning Best Supporting Actress in \"The Help\" \u2013 that's a sixth win.\n\nWait, but according to the table, the last row (index 34) is also in 2012, where Octavia Spencer won. So up until 2012, there are six wins: Diana Ross (1973), Whoopi Goldberg (1986 and 1991), Angela Bassett (1994), Jennifer Hudson (2007), and Octavia Spencer (2012). That makes a total of six wins.\n\nWait, I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\n- Diana Ross: 1973 \u2013 1 win\n- Whoopi Goldberg: 1986 and 1991 \u2013 that's two more (total 3)\n- Angela Bassett: 1994 \u2013 total 4\n- Jennifer Hudson: 2007 \u2013 total 5\n- Octavia Spencer: 2012 \u2013 total 6\n\nSo, by 2012, there are six wins. But the claim says nine. That's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some entries. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back at the table, in row indices 3 and 4 (1968-1969), both were nominations. Then 1971 was also a nomination. Diana Ross had two rows: one win in 1973 for New Star, and another nomination.\n\nThen in 1986, Whoopi won Best Actress \u2013 that's the second win. In 1991, she won again as Best Supporting Actress \u2013 third win.\n\nAngela Bassett in 1994 won \u2013 fourth.\n\nJennifer Hudson in 2007 \u2013 fifth.\n\nOctavia Spencer in 2012 \u2013 sixth.\n\nWait, but I see another entry in the table for 2012: row index 33 is Halle Berry being nominated, and row 34 is Octavia Spencer winning. So only one win in 2012.\n\nSo that's six wins total up to 2012.\n\nBut the claim says nine. Therefore, the number of wins according to the table is less than what the claim states. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if all actors are black. The problem doesn't specify whether all listed actors are black, but given the context, it's implied that they are considering only black actors. However, without explicit information on each actor's race, we might be assuming, but since the claim refers to \"black actors,\" and the table includes these specific actors, I'll proceed under the assumption that all in consideration are black.\n\nSo, based on the data, up until 2012, there are six wins, not nine. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"result\"}, {\"row_index\":11, \"column_name\":\"result\"}, {\"row_index\":12, \"column_name\":\"result\"}, {\"row_index\":14, \"column_name\":\"result\"}, {\"row_index\":33, \"column_name\":\"result\"}, {\"row_index\":34, \"column_name\":\"result\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"there be more than 2 drought spell span more than 6 year where black actoresses get no nomination.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse what this claim means. It seems to suggest that there are at least two periods (droughts) of over six years each during which Black actresses received no nominations.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to examine the years and see if there are gaps longer than six years without any nominations for Black actresses. \n\nLet me list out the years when nominations occurred:\n\n- 1960: Two nominations (Juanita Moore and Dorothy Dandridge)\n- 1962: One nomination (Claudia Mcneil)\n- 1968: One nomination (Beah Richards)\n- 1969: One nomination (Abbey Lincoln)\n- 1971: One nomination (Lola Falana)\n- 1973: Three nominations (Diana Ross twice and Cicely Tyson)\n- 1975: One nomination (Diahann Carroll)\n- 1981: One nomination (Irene Cara)\n- 1984: One nomination (Jennifer Beals)\n- 1986: Two nominations (Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg)\n- 1991: One nomination (Whoopi Goldberg)\n- 1993: Two nominations (Whoopi Goldberg and Alfre Woodard)\n- 1994: One nomination (Angela Bassett)\n- 1997: One nomination (Marianne Jean-Baptiste)\n- 1998: One nomination (Pam Grier)\n- 2002: One nomination (Halle Berry)\n- 2003: One nomination (Queen Latifah)\n- 2007: Two nominations (Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles)\n- 2009: One nomination (Viola Davis)\n- 2010: Two nominations (Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe)\n- 2011: One nomination (Halle Berry)\n- 2012: Two nominations (Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer)\n\nNow, I'll look for gaps between these years where there were no nominations. \n\nBetween the last nomination in 1969 and the next in 1973 is a gap of about four years (1969 to 1973). That's less than six, so not a drought.\n\nNext, from 1975 to 1981: that's six years. Let me check if there are any nominations between those years. The next nomination after 1975 is in 1981, which is a gap of six years (from 1976 to 1980 inclusive). That's exactly six years without nominations.\n\nLooking further, from 1984 to 1986: that's two years, so not a drought.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check between other years. For example, after 1993, the next nomination is in 1994, which is just one year later. Not a drought.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009: that's two years. Then from 2012 onwards, there are nominations each year until 2012 and beyond, but I don't see any gaps of six years after that.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something earlier. Let me list the years in order:\n\n- The earliest nomination is 1960.\n- Next is 1962 (gap of two years).\n- Then 1968 (six years later).\n- Then 1969 (one year later).\n- Then 1971 (two years later).\n- Then 1973 (two years later).\n- Then 1975 (two years later).\n- Then 1981 (six years later). So that's a gap from 1976 to 1980, which is five years. Wait, from 1975 to 1981 is six years in between? Let me count: 1975, then next is 1981. The years without nominations are 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980\u2014so five years. So that's a gap of five years, which is less than six.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me list the years between each nomination:\n\nFrom 1960 to 1962: two years.\n1962 to 1968: six years (nomination in '68).\nBut within that period, there are other nominations in 1968 and 1969.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the periods between consecutive nominations. Let me create a timeline:\n\n- 1960\n- 1962\n- 1968\n- 1969\n- 1971\n- 1973\n- 1975\n- 1981 (gap from 1976 to 1980: five years)\n- 1984 (gap of three years after 1981)\n- 1986\n- 1991 (five years later)\n- 1993 (two years later)\n- 1994 (one year)\n- 1997 (three years)\n- 1998 (one year)\n- 2002 (four years)\n- 2003 (one year)\n- 2007 (four years)\n- 2009 (two years)\n- 2010 (one year)\n- 2011 (one year)\n- 2012 (one year)\n\nLooking at these gaps, the largest gap is between 1975 and 1981: that's a span of five years without nominations. Then another possible gap is between 1984 and 1986, which is two years.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some other periods. For example, from 2003 to 2007: that's four years (2004-2007). So that's a gap of four years without nominations.\n\nBut the claim requires more than two droughts of over six years each. From what I see, the maximum gap is five years between 1975 and 1981. No gaps longer than six years exist in the data provided. Therefore, there are zero instances where a drought spans more than six years, let alone two such instances.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because there aren't even one such drought period of over six years without nominations for Black actresses.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that between 1975 and 1981, there was a gap of five years without any nominations. No other gaps exceed six years, so the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the award for best actress in comedy have only be win by whoopi goldberg in 1988\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says that Whoopi Goldberg won the Best Actress in Comedy award only once in 1988. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit unclear. The phrase \"have only be win by whoopi goldberg in 1988\" might mean that she's the only person to have ever won it, or specifically that she won it in 1988.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two things: whether Whoopi Goldberg has won a Best Actress - Musical or Comedy award and if that was in 1988. Also, I should verify if there are any other winners besides her for this category.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n- The table lists several awards, including \"best actress  - musical or comedy.\" Let's look at the years and results.\n\nLooking at the rows where award is \"best actress  - musical or comedy\":\n\nRow indices:\n4: 1969, abbey lincoln, best supporting actress \u2013 this isn't the category we're looking for.\n8: 1973, Diana Ross, new star \u2013 not relevant.\n9: 1975, Diahann Carroll, nominated for best actress - musical or comedy. She was nominated but didn't win.\n10: 1981, Irene Cara, nominated \u2013 same as above.\n11: 1984, Jennifer Beals, nominated \u2013 again, no win here.\n12: 1986, Oprah Winfrey, best supporting actress \u2013 not our category.\n13: 1986, Whoopi Goldberg, won Best Actress - Drama for The Color Purple. Not the musical/comedy award.\n14: 1991, Whoopi Goldberg, won Best Supporting Actress for Ghost. Again, different category.\n15: 1993, Whoopi Goldberg, nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy for Sister Act but didn't win (result is 'nominated').\n20: 1997, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, best supporting actress \u2013 no.\n21: 1998, Pam Grier, nominated \u2013 so she was in the running for best musical/comedy actress but didn't win.\n25: 2003, Queen Latifah, best supporting actress \u2013 not relevant.\n27: 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy for Dreamgirls but result is 'nominated'.\n29: 2010, Mo'Nique, won Best Supporting Actress for Precious. Different category.\n31: 2011, Halle Berry, Best Actress - Drama \u2013 nope.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some rows. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the rows, only a few are in the \"best actress  - musical or comedy\" category and have a result of 'won':\n\n- Row 4: 1969, abbey lincoln \u2013 no.\n- Row 8: Diana Ross won as new star but not in that category.\n- Row 15: Whoopi was nominated for Sister Act but didn't win. So she didn't win the award in 1993.\n- Row 21: Pam Grier was nominated in 1998, so no winner there.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each row more carefully:\n\nLooking at all rows where \"award\" is \"best actress  - musical or comedy\":\n\nRow index 9: 1975, Diahann Carroll, result 'nominated' \u2013 didn't win.\nIndex 10: 1981, Irene Cara, 'nominated'.\nIndex 11: 1984, Jennifer Beals, 'nominated'.\nIndex 15: 1993, Whoopi Goldberg, 'nominated'.\nIndex 21: 1998, Pam Grier, 'nominated'.\nIndex 27: 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, 'nominated'.\n\nWait, I don't see any rows where \"best actress - musical or comedy\" has a result of 'won'. So according to the table, no one has ever won that award. Therefore, the claim that Whoopi Goldberg won it in 1988 is false because there's no record of her winning that specific award, and in fact, no one has won it based on this data.\n\nWait another thing: The claim mentions \"in 1988,\" but looking at the table years, I don't see a row for 1988. The closest are 1986 and 1993. So Whoopi didn't win in 1988 because there's no entry for that year in her name.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Whoopi Goldberg won the Best Actress in Comedy award only in 1988. However, checking the table:\n\n- There are no entries where \"award\" is \"best actress - musical or comedy\" and \"result\" is \"won\".\n- Whoopi Goldberg's relevant entry (row 15) shows she was nominated but didn't win for Sister Act in 1993.\n- No one has won this award according to the table.\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems to suggest that among different categories of Golden Globe awards won by Black actresses, the \"Best Actress\" category is the least common. In other words, there are fewer wins in Best Actress compared to other award categories like Best Supporting Actress or New Star - Actress.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to examine each row where a Black actress has either won or been nominated and categorize their awards into types: Best Actress (drama or musical/comedy), Best Supporting Actress, and others like New Star. Then, count how many times they've won in each category to see which is the least common.\n\nLet me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. 1960 - Juanita Moore: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n2. 1960 - Dorothy Dandridge: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated.\n3. 1962 - Claudia McNeil: Best Actress (drama), nominated.\n4. 1968 - Beah Richards: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n5. 1969 - Abbey Lincoln: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n6. 1971 - Lola Falana: New Star - Actress, nominated.\n7. 1973 - Diana Ross: New Star - Actress, won; and Best Actress (drama), nominated.\n8. 1973 - Cicely Tyson: Best Actress (drama), nominated.\n9. 1975 - Diahann Carroll: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated.\n10. 1981 - Irene Cara: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated.\n11. 1984 - Jennifer Beals: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated.\n12. 1986 - Oprah Winfrey: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n13. 1986 - Whoopi Goldberg: Best Actress (drama), won.\n14. 1991 - Whoopi Goldberg: Best Supporting Actress, won.\n15. 1993 - Whoopi Goldberg: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated; and Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n16. 1993 - Alfre Woodard: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n17. 1994 - Angela Bassett: Best Actress (musical/comedy), won.\n18. 1997 - Marianne Jean-Baptiste: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n19. 1998 - Pam Grier: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated.\n20. 2002 - Halle Berry: Best Actress (drama), won; and again in 2011: Best Actress (drama), nominated.\n21. 2003 - Queen Latifah: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n22. 2007 - Jennifer Hudson: Best Supporting Actress, won.\n23. 2007 - Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles: Best Actress (musical/comedy), nominated.\n24. 2009 - Viola Davis: Best Supporting Actress, nominated.\n25. 2010 - Mo'Nique: Best Supporting Actress, won; and Gabourey Sidibe: Best Actress (drama), nominated.\n26. 2012 - Viola Davis: Best Actress (drama), nominated; Octavia Spencer: Best Supporting Actress, won.\n\nNow, let's count the wins in each category:\n\nBest Actress (drama or musical/comedy):\n- Whoopi Goldberg (1986)\n- Angela Bassett (1994)\n- Halle Berry (2002) and another nomination in 2011\n- Diahann Carroll (1975, nominated but didn't win), Irene Cara (1981, nom.), Jennifer Beals (1984, nom.), etc.\n\nWait, looking again: only certain rows have 'won' in Best Actress. Specifically:\n\nRow 7: Diana Ross won New Star - Actress, so that's a different category.\nRow 13: Whoopi Goldberg won Best Actress (drama).\nRow 15: She also had a nomination for Best Supporting but no win there.\nRow 17: Angela Bassett won Best Actress (musical/comedy).\nRow 20: Halle Berry won Best Actress (drama) in 2002, and another nomination in 2011.\n\nSo total wins in Best Actress categories are three: Whoopi (1986), Angela (1994), Halle (2002). Wait no, actually:\n\nWait, let me check each row where 'won' is present under Best Actress:\n\nRow 7: Diana Ross won New Star - Actress. So that's a different category.\n\nLooking for \"Best Actress\" wins:\n\n- Row 13: Whoopi Goldberg, Best Actress (drama), won.\n- Row 17: Angela Bassett, Best Actress (musical/comedy), won.\n- Row 20: Halle Berry, Best Actress (drama), won. In 2011, she was nominated again but didn't win.\n\nSo that's three wins in Best Actress categories.\n\nNow, let's count the Best Supporting Actress wins:\n\nLooking for 'won' under Best Supporting:\n\nRow 6: Abbey Lincoln, nominated.\nRow 4: Beah Richards, nominated.\nRow 5: Abbey Lincoln, won? Wait no. Looking back:\n\nWait, row 1973 Diana Ross and Cicely Tyson are both in Best Actress categories.\n\nIn the table:\n\n- Row 12 (1986): Oprah Winfrey, Best Supporting, nominated; Whoopi Goldberg, Best Actress, won.\n- Row 14: Whoopi won Best Supporting in 1991? Let me check row numbers. The rows are from 0 to 25.\n\nWait, let's correct the approach:\n\nLooking at each 'won' entry:\n\nRow indices where award is 'Best Actress...':\n\nRow 6 (1973): Diana Ross, New Star - Actress, won.\nRow 13 (1986): Whoopi Goldberg, Best Actress (drama), won.\nRow 17 (1994): Angela Bassett, Best Actress (musical/comedy), won.\nRow 20 (2002): Halle Berry, Best Actress (drama), won.\n\nSo four wins in Best Actress categories? Wait:\n\nWait, row 6 is Diana Ross as New Star - Actress. So she won that category once. Then rows 13, 17, 20: three times in Best Actress.\n\nOther wins are in Best Supporting:\n\nRow 22 (2007): Jennifer Hudson, Best Supporting, won.\nRow 25 (2010): Mo'Nique, Best Supporting, won.\nRow 26 (2012): Octavia Spencer, Best Supporting, won.\n\nSo three wins in Best Supporting Actress.\n\nAdditionally, Diana Ross's win was in New Star - Actress. That's another category, so one win there.\n\nNow, the claim is about \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress.\" So if we look at how many times Black actresses have won each category:\n\nBest Actress (drama or musical): 3 wins.\nBest Supporting Actress: 3 wins.\nNew Star - Actress: 1 win.\n\nWait, Diana Ross's New Star was in 1973. That's one win. So the count is:\n\n- Best Actress: 3\n- Best Supporting: 3\n- New Star: 1\n\nSo actually, New Star has fewer wins than Best Actress or Best Supporting.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the least common\" for Best Actress. However, according to this, Best Actress and Best Supporting have the same number of wins (3), while New Star has only 1 win, which is less. So if we're looking for the least common category that Black actresses have won, it's New Star - Actress with only one win, whereas Best Actress and Best Supporting each have three.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. The claim says \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress.\" So maybe it's implying that among all categories, Best Actress is the least commonly won by Black actresses? But according to this, it's not true because Best Supporting has same number as Best Actress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my count is off. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row where 'won' is present and the award category.\n\nRows (assuming index starts at 0):\n\nRow 6: Diana Ross, New Star - Actress, won.\nRow 13: Whoopi Goldberg, Best Actress, won.\nRow 17: Angela Bassett, Best Actress, won.\nRow 20: Halle Berry, Best Actress, won.\nRow 22: Jennifer Hudson, Best Supporting, won.\nRow 25: Mo'Nique, Best Supporting, won.\nRow 26: Octavia Spencer, Best Supporting, won.\n\nSo total wins:\n\n- New Star - Actress: 1\n- Best Actress (drama or musical): 3 (rows 13,17,20)\n- Best Supporting: 3 (rows 22,25,26)\n\nThus, the least common is New Star with only one win. Therefore, the claim that \"Best Actress\" is the least common is incorrect because it's tied with Best Supporting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the categories. Maybe \"Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama\" vs \"Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\" are separate, but they both fall under Best Actress awards.\n\nIn any case, according to this count, New Star has fewer wins than Best Actress and Best Supporting. Therefore, the claim is false because Best Actress isn't the least common; it's tied with another category.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing some other categories or more wins. Let me check again:\n\nAre there any other wins in Best Actress?\n\nRow 13: Whoopi - yes.\nRow 17: Angela - yes.\nRow 20: Halle - yes.\nThat's three.\n\nBest Supporting:\n\nRow 22: Jennifer\nRow 25: Mo'Nique\nRow 26: Octavia\nThree wins.\n\nNew Star:\n\nOnly Diana Ross in row 6.\n\nSo the least common is New Star with one win. Therefore, the original statement that \"the least common\" is Best Actress is incorrect because it's not less than others; it's tied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscounted or missed other wins.\n\nWait, let me check all rows again:\n\nRows where 'won' is present and award starts with 'Best Actress':\n\nRow 13: Best Actress (Drama) - won\nRow 17: Best Actress (Musical/Comedy) - won\nRow 20: Best Actress (Drama) - won\n\nThat's three.\n\nRows where award is 'Best Supporting Actress' and won:\n\nRow 22, 25, 26. Three wins.\n\nRows where award is 'New Star - Actress' and won:\n\nOnly row 6.\n\nSo yes, New Star has one win. Therefore, the claim that Best Actress is the least common is false because it's tied with Best Supporting at three each, while New Star has fewer.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"the least common golden globe for a black actress to win be best actress\" is inaccurate. According to the data analyzed:\n\n- **Best Actress (Drama/Musical/Comedy):** 3 wins\n- **Best Supporting Actress:** 3 wins\n- **New Star - Actress:** 1 win\n\nThus, New Star - Actress has fewer wins than Best Actress categories, making it the least common category. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{False}}$",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"between 2001 and 2011 there be 5 years where a black actress be not nominated for any award.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what we're looking at. The table lists various actors, their awards, motion pictures, and whether they were nominated or won. Each row corresponds to a year from 1960 up to 2012.\n\nThe claim is about the period between 2001 and 2011. So I need to focus on rows where the year falls within that range. Let's look at each relevant row:\n\n- 2002: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"Monster's Ball.\"\n- 2003: Queen Latifah was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Chicago.\"\n- 2007: Jennifer Hudson won Best Supporting Actress, and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles was nominated for Best Actress - Musical or Comedy in \"Dreamgirls.\"\n- 2009: Viola Davis was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in \"Doubt.\"\n- 2010: Mo'Nique won Best Supporting Actress, and Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"Precious.\"\n- 2011: Halle Berry was nominated for Best Actress - Drama in \"Frankie and Alice.\"\n\nWait a minute, the years mentioned are 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. That's six years where there were nominations for black actresses.\n\nThe claim states that there should be five years without any nominations. But according to the table, in every year from 2002 to 2011 (except maybe some in between not listed?), there was at least one nomination each year. For example:\n\n- 2004: Not present in the table.\n- 2005: Also not present.\n- Similarly, 2006 and others.\n\nBut wait, the table might not have entries for all years. So perhaps between 2001 and 2011, some years are missing. Let me check each year:\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, that's 11 years. The table has rows for 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. So the missing years are 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008.\n\nIn those missing years, were there any nominations? The table doesn't show any entries for 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008. So in these four years, perhaps no black actresses were nominated.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"there be 5 year where a black actress be not nominate.\" If there are five such years without nominations, then it's TRUE. However, based on the table, between 2001 and 2011, how many years had no nominations?\n\nLooking at each year:\n\n- 2001: No entries in the table.\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2003: Yes\n- 2004: No\n- 2005: No\n- 2006: No\n- 2007: Yes\n- 2008: No\n- 2009: Yes\n- 2010: Yes\n- 2011: Yes\n\nSo, the years without nominations are 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008. That's five years.\n\nBut wait, does 2001 count? The table doesn't have any entries for 2001, so if no nominations happened that year, it would be one of the five. So the claim says between 2001 and 2011, there are five such years where no black actress was nominated.\n\nLooking at the table, those five years (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008) would be the ones without any nominations. So the claim is TRUE because in those five years, there were no nominations for black actresses.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that in all other years between 2001 and 2011, there was at least one nomination. From the table:\n\n- 2002: Yes\n- 2003: Yes\n- 2007: Yes\n- 2009: Yes\n- 2010: Yes\n- 2011: Yes\n\nSo, yes, in those years, there were nominations. Therefore, the five years without any nominations are indeed present.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nLooking for each year between 2001 and 2011 where no nominations occurred. So we need to check rows with 'year' from 2001 to 2011 and see if any entries exist for those years in the table.\n\nThe table has entries for 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. The missing years (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008) don't have any rows in the table. Therefore, for each of these five years, there are no relevant cells because they're not present.\n\nWait, but how do we represent that in the JSON? The instructions say to list the cells that are relevant to verify the claim. Since those years (2001, 2004-2008) don't have any entries, perhaps there's no cell data for them. Therefore, all the cells related to these years would be zero or non-existent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The claim is about five years without nominations. From 2001 to 2011, which includes 11 years. If in those 11 years, there are six years with nominations and five without, then the claim is TRUE.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Year 2002: nomination\n- Year 2003: nomination\n- Year 2007: two nominations\n- Year 2009: nomination\n- Year 2010: two nominations\n- Year 2011: nomination\n\nSo, six years with nominations. The remaining five years (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008) have no entries, implying no nominations.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that between 2001 and 2011, there are five years where a black actress was not nominated for any award. Checking each year in this range against the table, we find that 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008 have no nominations listed, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"Year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
