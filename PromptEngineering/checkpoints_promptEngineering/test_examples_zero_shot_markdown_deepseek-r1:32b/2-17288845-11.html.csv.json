    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"game 4 be on april 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the game number (game 4) and the date (april 25). My task is to check if in the table, under the \"date\" column for game 4, it corresponds to April 25. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, series. Each row represents a different game.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0 (Game 1): Date is April 18.\n- Row 1 (Game 2): Date is April 20.\n- Row 2 (Game 3): Date is April 23.\n- Row 3 (Game 4): Date is April 25. \n- Row 4 (Game 5): Date is April 28.\n\nSo, Game 4 is on row index 3 because the table starts counting from 0. The date for that game is indeed April 25. \n\nTherefore, the claim accurately states that Game 4 took place on April 25. There's no discrepancy here. \n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The \"game\" column in row index 3, which shows it's Game 4.\n- The \"date\" column in the same row, showing April 25.\n\nSo both pieces of information match what's claimed, making the statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about one of the games. The goal is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. It lists five games with details like date, team, score, high points, rebounds, assists, location attendance, and series status for each game. Each row corresponds to a specific game number (1 to 5).\n\nThe claim given is: \"game 4.0 , series 1 - 4 be on april 25\". I need to parse this claim correctly. It seems like the user might have made a typo or formatting error with the decimal point in \"4.0\". Since all games are listed as integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), it's logical to interpret this as referring to game number 4.\n\nNext, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Game Number**: The claim refers to \"game 4.0\", which we'll take as game 4.\n2. **Series Status**: It mentions \"series 1 - 4\". Looking at the table's series column, each entry shows something like \"x - y\", where x is wins and y is losses for Dallas in that series.\n3. **Date**: The claim states that this game took place on April 25.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table:\n\n- **Game Number 4**: Looking at the first column, game number 4 is indeed listed.\n- **Series Status**: For game 4, the series status is \"1 - 3\", not \"1 - 4\". This suggests that after game 4, Dallas had 1 win and 3 losses in the series. The claim says \"1 - 4\", which would imply four losses for Dallas at that point, but according to the table, it's three.\n- **Date**: The date for game 4 is April 25, which matches the claim.\n\nSo, while two parts of the claim match (game number and date), the series status does not. This discrepancy means the claim isn't fully supported by the table data.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells that were checked. These include:\n\n- The row index for game 4 (which is row 3, since rows are zero-indexed: 0,1,2,3,4).\n- The \"series\" column to verify the series status.\n- The \"date\" column to confirm the date.\n\nPutting it all together, since the series status in the claim doesn't match what's in the table, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are those that were checked for game 4 in the series and date columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"game 4 have a location attendance of at&t center 20491 and the series be 1 - 1\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Game 4's location attendance is \"at&t center 20491\".\n2. The series after game 4 is \"1 - 1\".\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row corresponds to a game. I need to check the details for game 4.\n\nGame 4 is in row index 3 (since counting starts from 0). Let's look at the relevant columns:\n- Location Attendance: The value here is \"american airlines center 20829\". So it's not at&t center, but american airlines center.\n- Series: For game 4, the series is listed as \"1 - 3\".\n\nSo comparing to the claim:\n1. The location attendance for game 4 is incorrect; it should be american airlines center with a higher number than claimed (20829 vs 20491).\n2. The series after game 4 is actually 1-3, not 1-1.\n\nSince both parts of the claim don't match what's in the table, the answer must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that for Game 4, the location attendance was at&T Center with 20491 attendees and the series score was 1-1. However, according to the table:\n\n- **Location Attendance**: For Game 4 (row index 3), it's listed as \"american airlines center 20829\", not at&T Center.\n- **Series**: After Game 4, the series is \"1 - 3\", not \"1 - 1\".\n\nThus, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
