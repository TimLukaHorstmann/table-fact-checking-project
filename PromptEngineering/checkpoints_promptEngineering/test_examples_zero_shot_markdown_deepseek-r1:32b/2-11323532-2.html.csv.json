    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the show in israel be in the hebrew language and be ongoing\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the country/region is Israel. Scanning through the table, I find that at row index 13 (assuming rows start counting from 0), there's a row for Israel. The languages listed are Hebrew. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I check the status of the show in Israel. According to the table, the status is \"discontinued.\" This contradicts the claim that it's ongoing. Therefore, while the language condition is met, the status does not support the claim. \n\nSo, the claim has two parts: correct language but incorrect status. Since both conditions need to be true for the claim to hold, and one part fails, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"languages\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"status\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the people from the country / region o vietnam speak the language vietnamese\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in Vietnam, the people speak Vietnamese. That seems straightforward, but I should verify it against the data provided in the table to be sure.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: country / region, languages, premiere, seasons, and status. The relevant information here would be under the \"country / region\" and \"languages\" columns for Vietnam.\n\nI'll scan through each row of the table to find where the country/region is Vietnam. Scanning down:\n\n- Armenia: Armenian\n- Australia: English\n- Benelux (appears twice)\n- Canada\n- China\n- Denmark\n- Finland\n- France\n- Germany\n- Greece\n- Israel\n- Lithuania\n- Malaysia\n- New Zealand\n- Norway\n- Poland\n- Portugal\n- Scandinavia\n- South Africa\n- Turkey\n- Ukraine\n- United Kingdom\n- United States\n- Vietnam: Vietnamese\n- So, the last few rows include Vietnam.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I might have missed it. Let me go through each row step by step:\n\n1. Armenia - Armenian\n2. Australia - English\n3. Benelux (first entry) - Dutch, English\n4. Benelux (second entry) - same languages\n5. Canada - English, French\n6. China - Chinese\n7. Denmark - Danish\n8. Finland - Finnish\n9. France - French\n10. Germany - German\n11. Greece - Greek\n12. Israel - Hebrew\n13. Lithuania - Lithuanian\n14. Malaysia - English, Malaysian\n15. New Zealand - English\n16. Norway - Norwegian\n17. Poland - Polish\n18. Portugal - Portuguese\n19. Scandinavia - Swedish, Norwegian, Danish\n20. South Africa - English\n21. Turkey - Turkish\n22. Ukraine - Ukrainian\n23. United Kingdom - English\n24. United States - English\n25. Vietnam - Vietnamese\n26. So, it's the 25th row.\n\nWait, let me count properly:\n\nThe table starts with Armenia as row 0, so each subsequent country is +1.\n\nBut in any case, looking for Vietnam: yes, there is a row where \"country / region\" is Vietnam, and under \"languages,\" it says Vietnamese.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data. The people from Vietnam do speak Vietnamese according to the table.\n\nSo the relevant cell is the one in the \"languages\" column for the Vietnam row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table confirms thatVietnam's language is Vietnamese.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"languages\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
