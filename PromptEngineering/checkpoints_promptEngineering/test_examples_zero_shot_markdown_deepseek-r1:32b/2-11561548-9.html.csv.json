    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding the claim carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license, 2 of which run on window.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break this down into parts:\n\n1. Identify all emulators with a proprietary license.\n2. Check how many of these are in the table.\n3. Among them, see if 2 run on Windows.\n\nStarting with step 1: The claim mentions that there are three emulators with proprietary licenses, and corn is one of them. Let's look at the 'license' column in the table to find all entries marked as 'proprietary'.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 3: corn has a license of 'proprietary'.\n- Row 9: sixtyforce has 'proprietary'.\n- Row 10: ultrahle also has 'proprietary'.\n\nSo, that's three emulators with proprietary licenses: corn, sixtyforce, and ultrahle.\n\nNext, step 2: The claim says that two of these three run on Windows. So I need to check the platforms for each of these three.\n\n- corn (row 3): platform is 'windows'.\n- sixtyforce (row 9): platform is 'os x'.\n- ultrahle (row 10): platform includes both 'windows' and 'xbox'.\n\nSo, looking at this:\n\ncorn runs on Windows.\nsixtyforce runs on OS X.\nultrahle runs on both Windows and Xbox.\n\nTherefore, among the three, two run on Windows: corn and ultrahle. That matches the claim which states that 2 of the 3 proprietary emulators run on Windows.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking the relevant rows for their license type and platform. Corn has a proprietary license and runs on Windows, while ultrahle also runs on Windows but under a proprietary license as well.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be 6 emulator release under the gpl v2 license, and only 1 release under the gpl v3 license.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like name, current version, system, platform, and license. My main focus is on the 'license' column because that's what the claim is about.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check the license type:\n\n1. **Row 0**: License is GPL v2 \u2192 Count for GPL v2 increases.\n2. **Row 1**: Also GPL v2 \u2192 Another count for v2.\n3. **Row 2**: BSD 3-clause \u2192 Not relevant, so ignore.\n4. **Row 3**: Proprietary \u2192 Ignore.\n5. **Row 4**: GPL v2 \u2192 Another one.\n6. **Row 5**: GPL v2 \u2192 Counting again.\n7. **Row 6**: GPL v2 \u2192 So that's the fifth one under v2.\n8. **Row 7**: GPL v3 \u2192 This is the only one under v3, so count it.\n9. **Row 8**: Expat license \u2192 Not relevant.\n10. **Row 9**: GPL v2 \u2192 Now we have six under v2.\n11. **Row 10**: Proprietary \u2192 Ignore.\n12. **Row 11**: Proprietary \u2192 Ignore.\n\nSo, counting the GPL v2 licenses: Rows 0,1,4,5,6,9 \u2014 that's six entries. GPL v3 is only Row 7, which is one entry.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I miss any rows? Let me recount:\n\n- GPL v2: \n   - Row 0\n   - Row 1\n   - Row 4\n   - Row 5\n   - Row 6\n   - Row 9 \u2192 That's six.\n- GPL v3:\n   - Only Row7.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the claim is TRUE because there are exactly 6 under v2 and only 1 under v3.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each row index where the license is either GPL v2 or v3 along with the column name 'license'.\n\nSo relevant_ells will include rows 0-9 and 7. Let me list them:\n\nRow indices: 0,1,4,5,6,9 (/GPL v2) and 7 (GPL v3). \n\nWait, row indices start at 0, so the first row is index 0. So I need to include each of these rows where the license matches either GPL v2 or v3.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: license\n- Row1: license\n- Row4: license\n- Row5: license\n- Row6: license\n- Row9: license (/GPLv2)\n- Row7: license (GPLv3)\n\nThat's a total of seven rows. Wait, but in the table, rows 0 to 11 are there. Let me confirm each row:\n\nRow indices:\n\n0: GPL v2 \u2192 yes\n\n1: GPL v2 \u2192 yes\n\n4: GPL v2 \u2192 yes\n\n5: GPL v2 \u2192 yes\n\n6: GPL v2 \u2192 yes\n\n9: GPL v2 \u2192 yes (Project64, 2.1.0.1)\n\n7: GPL v3 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, no\u2014rows are from 0 to 11, so:\n\nRow0: name=1964, license=GPLv2\n\nRow1: 1964js, GPLv2\n\nRow2: cen64, BSD \u2192 not counted\n\nRow3: corn, proprietary \u2192 not counted\n\nRow4: daedalusx64, GPLv2\n\nRow5: mupen64, GPLv2\n\nRow6: mupen64plus, GPLv2\n\nRow7: mupen64plus ae, GPLv3\n\nRow8: n64js, expat \u2192 not counted\n\nRow9: project64, GPLv2\n\nRows10 and 11: proprietary.\n\nSo total GPL v2 is rows 0,1,4,5,6,9 \u2192 six entries.GPLv3 only row7.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are 6 emulators under GPL v2 and 1 under GPL v3. Checking each license:\n\n- GPL v2: Rows 0,1,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 entries.\n- GPL v3: Row7 \u2192 1 entry.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_ells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each row of the table and identify which ones mention mupen64 or its variants. From the table:\n\n- Row 5: mupen64 version 0.5.1 supports platforms windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos.\n- Row 6: mupen64plus version 2.0 supports windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd.\n- Row 7: mupen64plus android edition (ae) version 2.3.5 supports android.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"mupen64,\" but it's important to note if these are considered different emulators or just versions of the same. However, for this analysis, each entry is a separate emulator. So I'll treat mupen64, mupen64plus, and mupen64plus ae as distinct.\n\nNext, I'll count the number of platforms each emulator supports:\n\n1. Row 0: 1964 - windows, xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n2. Row 1: 1964js - javascript \u2192 1 platform.\n3. Row 2: cen64 - windows, os x, gnu/linux \u2192 3 platforms.\n4. Row 3: corn - windows \u2192 1 platform.\n5. Row 4: daedalusx64 - windows, psp \u2192 2 platforms.\n6. Row 5: mupen64 - 5 platforms (windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos).\n7. Row 6: mupen64plus - 4 platforms (windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd).\n8. Row 7: mupen64plus ae - android \u2192 1 platform.\n9. Row 8: n64js - javascript \u2192 1 platform.\n10. Row 9: project64 - windows, xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n11. Row 10: sixtyforce - os x \u2192 1 platform.\n12. Row 11: ultrahle - windows, xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n\nLooking at mupen64 (row 5), it supports 5 platforms. Now I need to check if any other emulator supports more than or equal to 5 platforms.\n\nLooking through the counts:\n\n- The highest is mupen64 with 5.\n- Next is cen64 with 3, and others have fewer.\n\nSo, no other emulator has more platforms than mupen64. However, the claim says mupen64 runs \"1 more platform\" than any other. So I need to check if every other emulator has exactly one less platform than mupen64 (i.e., 4).\n\nBut looking at the counts:\n\n- The next highest is 3 platforms for cen64. Others have even fewer.\n\nSo, no emulator has 5 platforms; only mupen64 does. Therefore, mupen64 doesn't just run one more platform than any other; it runs significantly more.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" So perhaps it's suggesting that mupen64 supports one additional platform compared to every other individual emulator, not necessarily all others combined or something else.\n\nBut in reality, some emulators have fewer platforms. For example, mupen64 has 5, while another might have 3, which is a difference of 2. So the claim isn't accurate because it's not just one more than each other; sometimes it's two or three more.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the maximum number among others and see if mupen64 is exactly one more. The next highest is cen64 with 3. If mupen64 has 5, that's two more than cen64. So the claim would be false because it's not just one more.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe claim states that \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" That could mean mupen64 has one more platform than each of the others individually or in total. But looking at the data, mupen64 supports 5 platforms. The next highest is cen64 with 3, which is two less. So mupen64 doesn't just have one more; it's two more.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't correct because mupen64 has more than just one additional platform compared to others.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator.\" Upon examining the table:\n\n- The row for mupen64 shows it supports 5 platforms: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos.\n\nChecking other emulators:\n\n- cen64 (row 2) supports 3 platforms.\n- Other entries have fewer than 3 platforms each.\n\nThe maximum number of platforms any other emulator has is 3. Since mupen64 has 5, which is more than one platform difference from the next highest, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that exactly three emulators support both Windows and Xbox platforms. So my task is to check each emulator in the table and see how many of them have both \"windows\" and \"xbox\" listed under the \"platform\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are:\n- name\n- current version\n- system (all nintendo 64, so that's consistent)\n- platform\n- license\n\nI need to focus on the \"name\" and \"platform\" columns. For each emulator, I'll check if both Windows and Xbox are listed as platforms.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0: 1964**  \n   Platforms: windows, xbox  \n   Yes, it runs on both. So count = 1\n\n2. **Row 1: 1964js**  \n   Platforms: javascript  \n   No mention of Windows or Xbox. Count remains 1.\n\n3. **Row 2: cen64**  \n   Platforms: windows, os x, gnu/linux  \n   Only Windows here. No Xbox. So no change.

Then comes \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" with version 2.3.5 and platform Android. So this one definitely runs on Android.\n9. n64js is JavaScript-based, so not relevant.\n10. project64 supports Windows and Xbox.\n11. sixtyforce is for OS X.\n12. ultrahle runs on Windows and Xbox.\n\nSo looking through all the rows, only \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" has Android as its platform.

The claim states: \"corn be 1 of 3 emulator that have a proprietary license and 1 of 2 which run on window , and also be compatible with javascript.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Corn has a proprietary license**: Looking at the table, I check the row for \"corn\". Under the \"license\" column, it says \"proprietary\", so this part is correct.\n\n2. **It is one of 3 emulators with a proprietary license**: I'll scan through all rows under the \"license\" column to count how many have \"proprietary\". The entries are:\n   - corn: proprietary\n   - sixtyforce: proprietary\n   - ultrahle: proprietary\n   That's three in total. So, corn is indeed one of three.\n\n3. **It runs on Windows and is one of two that do so**: Checking the \"platform\" column for \"corn\", it only lists \"windows\". Now, I'll count how many emulators have \"windows\" as their platform.\n   - 1964: windows\n   - corn: windows\n   - daedalusx64: windows\n   - mupen64: windows\n   - mupen64plus: windows\n   - project64: windows\n   Wait, that's more than two. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"1 of 2 which run on window\". Let me recount.\n   \n   Looking at the table again:\n   - 1964: windows, xbox\n   - corn: windows\n   - daedalusx64: windows, psp\n   - mupen64: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos\n   - mupen64plus: windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd\n   - project64: windows, xbox\n   So actually, there are 5 emulators that run on Windows. The claim says it's one of two, which is incorrect.\n\n4. **Compatible with JavaScript**: The \"platform\" for corn is only \"windows\". None of the other columns mention JavaScript compatibility. However, looking at other rows:\n   - 1964js and n64js have platforms including JavaScript.\n   Corn doesn't list JavaScript as a platform, so this part of the claim is false.\n\nSince two parts of the claim are incorrect (only one out of three about Windows and no JavaScript compatibility), the overall claim must be FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells checked were:\n- corn's license\n- corn's platform\n- Other rows' platforms for counting\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"mupen64 run 1 more platform than any other emulator, include javascript.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's saying that mupen64 runs on one more platform compared to any other emulator listed, and specifically includes JavaScript as one of those platforms.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple emulators with their respective platforms. I'll go through each emulator one by one to count how many platforms each supports.\n\nStarting with \"mupen64\", which is row index 5. Its platform column lists: windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd. That's four platforms.\n\nNext, checking other emulators:\n\n- \"1964\" (row 0): windows, xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n- \"1964js\" (row 1): javascript \u2192 1 platform.\n- \"cen64\" (row 2): windows, os x, gnu / linux \u2192 3 platforms.\n- \"corn\" (row 3): windows \u2192 1 platform.\n- \"daedalusx64\" (row 4): windows, psp \u2192 2 platforms.\n- \"mupen64plus\" (row 6): windows, os x, gnu / linux, freebsd \u2192 4 platforms.\n- \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" (row 7): android \u2192 1 platform. Note that this is a different entry but same base name as mupen64plus, so it's another emulator.\n- \"n64js\" (row 8): javascript \u2192 1 platform.\n- \"project64\" (row 9): windows, xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n- \"sixtyforce\" (row 10): os x \u2192 1 platform.\n- \"ultrahle\" (row 11): windows, xbox \u2192 2 platforms.\n\nNow, I need to see if mupen64 runs on one more platform than any other emulator. The highest number of platforms besides mupen64 is 4 for \"mupen64plus\". So mupen64 has 4, same as mupen64plus. Therefore, it's not running on one more platform than all others.\n\nAlso, the claim mentions including JavaScript. Looking at the platforms, neither mupen64 nor any other emulator except for \"1964js\" and \"n64js\" have JavaScript listed. So JavaScript is a separate consideration, but it doesn't affect the count since mupen64 itself doesn't run on JavaScript.\n\nSo, the claim that mupen64 runs on one more platform than any other emulator is FALSE because there's another emulator with the same number of platforms.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because \"mupen64\" does not run on one more platform than all others; it shares the highest count. Additionally, JavaScript isn't a platform for mupen64.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the claim and check each part against the data.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 6 emulator release under the gpl v2 license, but only sixtyforce be release under the gpl v3 license.\"\n\nFirst, I'll count how many emulators are licensed under GPL v2. Looking at the 'license' column:\n\n1. Row 0: gpl v2\n2. Row 1: gpl v2\n3. Row 4: gpl v2\n4. Row 5: gpl v2\n5. Row 6: gpl v2\n6. Row 8: expat (not GPL)\n7. Row 9: gpl v2\n\nWait, that's actually seven entries with GPL v2. The rows are:\n\n- 1964 (GPLv2)\n- 1964js (GPLv2)\n- daedalusx64 (GPLv2)\n- mupen64 (GPLv2)\n- mupen64plus (GPLv2)\n- project64 ( GPL v2)\n- n64js is expat, so not counted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking row by row:\n\nRow 0: gpl v2 \u2192 yes\nRow 1: gpl v2 \u2192 yes\nRow 2: BSD 3-clause \u2192 no\nRow 3: proprietary \u2192 no\nRow 4: gpl v2 \u2192 yes\nRow 5: gpl v2 \u2192 yes\nRow 6: gpl v2 \u2192 yes\nRow 7: gpl v3 \u2192 no (GPLv3 is different)\nRow 8: expat \u2192 no\nRow 9: gpl v2 \u2192 yes\nRow 10: proprietary \u2192 no\nRow 11: proprietary \u2192 no\n\nSo, counting rows with GPL v2:\n\nRows 0,1,4,5,6,9. That's six entries.\n\nNext, the claim says only sixtyforce is under GPL v3. Let me check if any emulator is licensed under GPLv3.\n\nLooking through the 'license' column again, I see:\n\n- Row 7: mupen64plus android edition has gpl v3.\n\nSo that's one entry under GPLv3, which is mupen64plus ae, not sixtyforce. Sixtyforce (row 10) is proprietary, so the claim is incorrect here.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim is correct (6 GPL v2), but the second part is wrong because sixtyforce isn't under GPL v3\u2014it's proprietary, and instead, mupen64plus ae is under GPLv3. So the overall claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"license\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"license\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae) be the only emulator that run on android and javascript.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It has two parts:\n1. mupen64plus Android Edition (AE) runs on Android.\n2. It is the only emulator in the table that runs both on Android and JavaScript.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to check which emulators support Android or JavaScript.\n\nStarting with mupen64plus AE: \n- Row index 7 has \"mupen64plus , android edition (ae)\" with platform \"android\" and license \"gpl v3\". So yes, it runs on Android.\n\nNow, checking if any other emulator supports both Android and JavaScript:\n- The table lists several emulators. Let's go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 0: 1964 - platforms are windows and xbox.\nRow 1: 1964js - platform is javascript.\nRow 2: cen64 - platforms include windows, os x, gnu/linux.\nRow 3: corn - only windows.\nRow 4: daedalusx64 - windows and psp.\nRow 5: mupen64 - platforms are windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos. No android or javascript.\nRow 6: mupen64plus - same as row 5 except no qnx beos, still not android or js.\nRow 7: mupen64plus AE (row index 7) - only android.\nRow 8: n64js - platform is javascript.\nRow 9: project64 - windows and xbox.\nRow 10: sixtyforce - os x.\nRow 11: ultrahle - windows and xbox.\n\nSo, the emulators that support JavaScript are row 1 (1964js) and row 8 (n64js). They don't run on Android. The emulator in row 7 runs on Android but not JavaScript. Therefore, there's no emulator in the table that runs both on Android and JavaScript.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because while mupen64plus AE runs on Android, it isn't the only one for JavaScript since others do, and none support both platforms as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The relevant cells show that mupen64plus AE only supports Android, not JavaScript, and there are other emulators supporting JavaScript.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that only three emulators run on both Windows and Xbox: corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each emulator in the table to see which ones support both platforms.\n\nStarting with row 0: name is \"1964\", platform is windows and xbox. So it runs on both. But the claim doesn't include this one, so that's a problem.\n\nRow 1: 1964js runs on javascript only, not relevant here.\n\nRow 2: cen64 supports Windows, OS X, Linux. No Xbox mentioned.\n\nRow 3: corn is listed as running on windows. The platform column says \"windows\", so it doesn't include xbox. Wait, the claim says corn does run on both, but according to the table, it's only on windows. That might make the claim false.\n\nWait, looking back at row 3: yes, it's just windows. So corn isn't running on both, which contradicts the claim.\n\nRow 4: daedalusx64 has platform windows and psp. No xbox listed. The claim says it runs on both Windows and Xbox, but according to the table, it's windows and psp. So that's incorrect in the claim.\n\nRow 5: mupen64 supports windows, os x, gnu/linux, freebsd, qnx beos. No mention of xbox here. So mupen64 doesn't run on both platforms as per the table.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Row 0 is 1964 with windows and xbox. Row 5: mupen64's platform is \"windows , os x  , gnu / linux , freebsd , qnx beos\". No xbox there. So that emulator doesn't run on both.\n\nSo the claim lists corn, daedalusx64, and mupen64 as running on both Windows and Xbox. But according to the table:\n\n- corn only runs on windows.\n- daedalusx64 runs on windows and psp, not xbox.\n- mupen64 doesn't run on xbox.\n\nAdditionally, row 0's emulator \"1964\" does run on both, but it's not mentioned in the claim. So the claim is incorrect because:\n\n1. It includes corn and daedalusx64 which don't support both platforms.\n2. It excludes \"1964\", which does support both.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists three emulators supposedly running on both Windows and Xbox, but according to the table:\n\n- 1964 supports both (not listed in the claim).\n- corn only supports Windows (listed incorrectly as supporting both).\n- daedalusx64 supports Windows and PSP (incorrectly claimed as Windows and Xbox).\n- mupen64 doesn't support Xbox.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"platform\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"platform\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
