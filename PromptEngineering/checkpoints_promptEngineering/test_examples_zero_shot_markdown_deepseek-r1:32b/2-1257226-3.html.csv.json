    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"guillermo franco have a lower goal on march 1 2006 than october 8 2005\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's comparing the number of goals Guillermo Franco scored on two different dates: March 1, 2006, and October 8, 2005. The claim states that the goal count on March 1 was lower than on October 8.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, etc. But I notice that the table doesn't mention any players' names, including Guillermo Franco. It only provides information about goals in general for each match but not specific to individual players.\n\nSo, without any data on which player scored how many goals in those matches, it's impossible to determine whether Guillermo Franco had a lower goal count on March 1 than October 8. The table doesn't provide the necessary details about individual players' performances, only team-level scores and results.\n\nTherefore, since there's no information about individual goals for these dates, the claim can't be verified as either TRUE or FALSE based solely on this table.\n</think>\n\nThe table lacks data on individual player goals, so we cannot determine Guillermo Franco's goal counts on those dates. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"guillermo franco have the same score on march 1 2006 and june 10 , 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, it has several columns: goal, date, venue, score, result, competition. Each row represents a match with specific details about that game. The claim mentions Guillermo Franco having the same score on two specific dates: March 1, 2006, and June 10, 2009.\n\nI notice that the table doesn't have a column for players or individuals like Guillermo Franco. It only shows general information about each match, such as date, venue, score, etc. So, I need to determine if the scores on those two dates are the same.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. The first row is from March 1, 2006. Let me check that. Wait, actually, the second row has the date \"1 march 2006.\" So, row index 1 corresponds to March 1, 2006.\n\n   - For this row, the score is \"1 - 0\" (score column) and result is \"1 - 0.\"\n\n2. The third row has the date \"10 june 2009.\" So, that's June 10, 2009.\n\n   - Here, the score is \"1 - 0,\" and the result is \"2 - 1.\"\n\nNow, looking at the scores: both matches have a score of \"1 - 0\" in their respective rows. However, the results are different. The first match's result was also \"1 - 0,\" but the second match's result was \"2 - 1.\" \n\nWait, does the claim refer to the 'score' or the 'result'? The claim says \"same score,\" so I should focus on the 'score' column.\n\nIn both cases, the score is \"1 - 0\" for each of those dates. So, based on that, the scores are indeed the same. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE.\n\nBut hold on a second. The table doesn't mention Guillermo Franco at all. It just has general match details. Since there's no information about players or their individual performance (like goals scored by specific players), I can't confirm if Guillermo Franco was involved in both matches or even in either of them. \n\nSo, the claim mentions Guillermo Franco specifically, but since the table doesn't provide any data on individual players, we can't verify whether he had the same score in those matches. The scores for the matches themselves are the same, but without info about Franco, we can't link his performance to these scores.\n\nTherefore, even though the scores on both dates are \"1 - 0,\" the claim refers to Guillermo Franco's score, which isn't provided in the table. Hence, I don't have enough information to support the claim as TRUE. \n\nWait, but maybe the claim is about the team's score, not the individual player. The wording says \"guillermo franco have the same score,\" which could be ambiguous. If it's referring to the team's score in both matches, then yes, they are the same. However, if it's about Franco's personal goals, we can't tell because he isn't mentioned.\n\nGiven that the table doesn't include individual player stats, I think the claim is making a statement about the team's scores on those dates. Since both have \"1 - 0\" as the score, it would be TRUE based on the available data. But since the table doesn't mention Franco, maybe the claim isn't fully supported because we don't know if he was involved in either match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is conflating team scores with individual player contributions. Since the table only shows team scores, I can confirm that the scores were \"1 - 0\" on both dates, regardless of individual players. Therefore, the claim's truth hinges on whether it refers to team scores or individual performance.\n\nAssuming it refers to the team score, which is \"1 - 0\" in both cases, then the answer would be TRUE. However, if it's about Franco's personal goals, we can't verify that because he isn't listed in the table.\n\nGiven the ambiguity but considering the information available, I think focusing on the 'score' as per the claim, which is the same for both dates, leads me to conclude TRUE. The relevant cells are from row 1 and row 2 (since row indices start at 0), so rows 1 and 2 under the 'date', 'score', etc., columns.\n\nWait, let's recheck:\n\n- March 1, 2006: row index 1\n- June 10, 2009: row index 2\n\nSo, for each of these rows, the relevant columns would be 'date' and 'score' to check if the dates match the claim and whether their scores are the same.\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor March 1, 2006:\n- Row index 1, column 'date'\n- Row index 1, column 'score'\n\nFor June 10, 2009:\n- Row index 2, column 'date'\n- Row index 2, column 'score'\n\nSo, in total, four cells are relevant. \n\nBut wait, the user's example only included one cell per row when checking conditions. Maybe for each date, I just need to check if their scores match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check the score for each of those specific dates and see if they're equal. Since both have \"1 - 0,\" that would make the claim TRUE in terms of team scores on those dates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"guillermo franco score goal 4 and 5 at the same 2009 concacaf gold cup competition.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look through each row of the table and see if there's any mention of Guillermo Franco scoring goals in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. \n\nLooking at the table rows one by one:\n\n- Row 1: It's about a World Cup qualification match on October 8, 2005. The venue is in Mexico. The score was 1-1 with a result of 5-2. Nothing here mentions Guillermo Franco.\n\n- Row 2: A friendly match on March 1, 2006, at Pizza Hut Park in the US. Score was 1-0 and the result is also 1-0. Again, no mention of Guillermo Franco.\n\n- Row 3: Another World Cup qualification match on June 10, 2009, at Estadio Azteca. The score was 1-0 leading to a 2-1 result. Still no info on Guillermo Franco.\n\n- Row 4: This is from July 23, 2009, at Soldier Field in Chicago, part of the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The score line says 1-0 and the result was 5-3 (PSO). The score here could imply that one goal was scored by each team, but there's no specific mention of who scored.\n\n- Row 5: Another match from July 26, 2009, at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, also part of the same Gold Cup. The score is 0-5, which means Mexico lost this game 0-5. Again, no names are provided for goal scorers.\n\n- Row 6: This is a World Cup qualification match on September 5, 2009, in Costa Rica. The score was 0-2 leading to a result of 3-0. No mention of Guillermo Franco here either.\n\n- Row 7: A friendly match on May 24, 2010, at Wembley Stadium. The score is 2-1 with the result being 3-1. Still no info on Guillermo Franco.\n\nFrom this analysis, none of the rows provide information about who scored goals in any specific matches. Since the table doesn't list individual goal scorers for any of these games, especially not Guillermo Franco's goals in the 2009 Gold Cup, I can't verify if he scored goals 4 and 5. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as the table does not provide information about individual goal scorers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

It looks like each row represents a match with details like goal count, date, venue, score, result, and competition. The columns are: goal (which might indicate how many goals Guillermo Franco scored in that match), date, venue, score (probably the team's overall score), result, and competition.\n\nThe claim is about comparing Guillermo Franco's goals on two specific dates: October 8, 2005, and March 1, 2006. So I need to find the rows corresponding to these dates and check the 'goal' column for each.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- The first row has a date of \"8 october 2005\" and goal value is 1.\n- The second row has a date of \"1 march 2006\" with a goal value of 1 as well.\n\nSo on both dates, Guillermo Franco scored 1 goal each. The claim says he had a lower goal on the first date compared to the second. But since both are equal (1 vs. 1), this isn't true. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should note which cells were relevant. For October 8, 2005, it's row 0 with columns 'goal' and 'date'. For March 1, 2006, it's row 1 again with the same columns.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find the relevant entries for March 1, 2006, and June 10, 2009.\n\nLooking at the 'date' column:\n- Row 2 (index 1) has a date of \"1 march 2006\".\n- Row 3 (index 2) has a date of \"10 june 2009\".\n\nNext, I need to check the scores for these two dates.

Both games ended with a score of 1-0.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"guillermo franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2009 concacaf gold cup.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. The person in question is Guillermo Franco. I need to check how many goals he scored in friendly competitions and how many he scored in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows of data, each representing a different game or competition.\n\nI'll go through each row and see which ones fall under \"friendly\" competition and \"2009 concacaf gold cup.\"\n\nStarting with Row 1: It's from October 8, 2005. The competition is the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. So not a friendly or Gold Cup.\n\nRow 2: March 1, 2006. Competition is \"friendly.\" That's one of the categories we need. The score in this row is 1-0 for Guillermo Franco, as he scored once (the goal column is 1). So, that's one goal in a friendly.\n\nRow 3: June 10, 2009. Competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. Not relevant here.\n\nRow 4: July 23, 2009. Competition is the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The score in this row is 1-0 for Guillermo Franco (goal column is 1). So that's another goal in the Gold Cup.\n\nRow 5: July 26, 2009. Also part of the same competition as Row 4, the 2009 Gold Cup. But the score here shows 0-5; Guillermo Franco didn't score in this game because his goal column is 0.\n\nRow 6: September 5, 2009. Competition is another World Cup qualification (2010). Not relevant.\n\nRow 7: May 24, 2010. Another friendly match. The score here is 2-1 in the goal column for Guillermo Franco. So that's two goals in this friendly game.\n\nWait a second, so in Row 2 and Row 7, which are both friendly competitions, how many goals did he score? Let me check again.\n\nRow 2: Friendly, goal is 1.\nRow 7: Friendly, goal is 2.\n\nSo in total for all friendly matches, he scored 1 + 2 = 3 goals?\n\nWait no, each row represents a different game. So Row 2 is one friendly where he scored once, and Row 7 is another friendly where he scored twice. Therefore, across both friendly games, he has 1+2=3 goals.\n\nNow for the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Rows 4 and 5 are from this competition.\n\nRow 4: He scored once.\nRow 5: He didn't score.\n\nSo total in Gold Cup is 1 goal.\n\nThe claim says he scored the same amount in both competitions, but according to these numbers, friendly has 3 goals (if we sum both games) and Gold Cup has 1. Alternatively, if each row counts individually, then it's not clear how the count should be aggregated.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpret. Maybe the claim refers to per game or overall?\n\nLooking again at the table, each row is a separate match. So in friendly competitions (Rows 2 and 7), he scored 1 goal in one and 2 in another, totaling 3 across both games. In the Gold Cup, he played two matches: scoring once in Row 4 and zero in Row 5, so total 1.\n\nBut maybe the claim is about how many times he participated in each competition type, not per game. For example, did he score the same number of goals in each competition as a whole?\n\nWait no, the claim says \"score goal at friendly competition\" the same amount as at Gold Cup. So perhaps it's the total goals across all matches in each category.\n\nIn that case:\n\nFriendly competitions: Rows 2 and 7.\n- Row 2: 1 goal\n- Row 7: 2 goals\nTotal: 3 goals\n\nGold Cup: Rows 4 and 5.\n- Row 4: 1 goal\n- Row 5: 0 goals\nTotal: 1 goal\n\nSo 3 vs. 1, which are not the same. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait but perhaps I should consider each game separately. The claim could mean that in each friendly and Gold Cup game, he scored the same number of goals.\n\nLooking at Row 2: Friendly, 1 goal.\nRow 4: Gold Cup, 1 goal.\n\nSo in these two games, both were single-goal games for him. Then, maybe the total is not considered but per game.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"the same amount as\" which could mean overall or per occurrence. This is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to each competition type, meaning across all matches in friendly competitions, he scored a certain number, and similarly for Gold Cup.\n\nIf that's the case, then in friendly: 1 + 2 = 3 goals.\nGold Cup: 1 + 0 = 1 goal.\nSo not equal. Therefore, FALSE.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nThe table shows each match with how many goals Guillermo Franco scored (goal column). So for friendly competitions, we have two matches:\n\n- March 2006: 1 goal\n- May 2010: 2 goals\n\nTotal in friendlies: 3 goals.\n\nFor Gold Cup 2009, two matches:\n\n- July 23: 1 goal\n- July 26: 0 goals\n\nTotal in Gold Cup: 1 goal.\n\nSo the claim says he scored the same amount in both competitions. But 3 vs. 1 is not equal. So FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to each game where he participated in friendly and Gold Cup, but that's unclear because he played multiple games in each.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is overall goals in each competition type, so since they are different, it's FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Guillermo Franco scored the same number of goals in friendly competitions as he did in the 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Analyzing the data:\n\n- **Friendly Competitions (Rows 2 and 7):**\n  - March 2006: 1 goal\n  - May 2010: 2 goals\n  - **Total:** 3 goals\n\n- **Gold Cup 2009 (Rows 4 and 5):**\n  - July 23, 2009: 1 goal\n  - July 26, 2009: 0 goals\n  - **Total:** 1 goal\n\nSince 3 \u2260 1, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{B}",

In the context of the table, \"goal\" seems to refer to rows numbered from 1 to 7 under the \"goal\" column.\n\nSo, for goal 1 (row index 0 since it's zero-based), I'll look at the competition type. The competition is listed as \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\". \n\nNext, for goal 6 (which would be row index 5 because counting from 0, rows are 0 to 6), the competition is \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\".\n\nNow, comparing both competitions: one is for the 2006 World Cup and the other for the 2010 World Cup. Even though they are both World Cup qualifications, the years are different, which might indicate different tournaments.\n\nWait, but does \"same type of competition\" mean the exact same event or just the category? Since both are World Cup qualifications, maybe it's considered the same type even if the years differ.\n\nBut looking back at the table, the competitions for goal 1 and 6 are explicitly listed as \"2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\" and \"2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\". These are two distinct qualification processes for different World Cup events. Therefore, they're not exactly the same competition type but different instances of similar competitions.\n\nSo, the claim states that both goals have the same type of competition. Since one is for 2006 and the other for 2010, they aren't identical in terms of the specific competition.

Therefore, the claim is incorrect as the goals were scored in 2009, not 2010.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a claim about some data in a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is provided in markdown format, and the claim is: \"guillermo franco score goal at friendly competition the same amount as at 2010 fifa world cup competition.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It's about Guillermo Franco scoring goals in two different types of competitions: friendly competitions and the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifications. The claim states that he scored the same number of goals in both.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with details like date, venue, score, result, etc. My task is to check how many goals Guillermo Franco scored in friendly competitions versus those in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifications.\n\nI'll go through each row and note down the number of goals he scored in each relevant competition type.\n\nRow 1: Goal 1, Competition is 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualification. Not relevant for our claim since it's about 2010.\nRow 2: Goal 2, Competition is friendly. So here, he scored 1 goal (since the score column shows 1-0). This counts towards his friendly goals.\nRow 3: Goal 3, Competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification. He scored 1 goal here (1-0 in the score column).\nRow 4: Goal 4, Competition is 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Not relevant.\nRow 5: Goal 5, Same competition as row 4. No goals for him here since his team lost 0-5.\nRow 6: Goal 6, Competition is 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification. He scored 3 goals in total (score column shows 3-0). Wait, the score is 3-0, so does that mean he scored all three? Or was this a team result? The 'result' column might be more relevant for his personal goals. Looking at the 'goal' column, it's numbered from 1 to 7, but each row represents a different match. So perhaps in this row (row6), he scored 3 goals because the result is 3-0. Alternatively, maybe each row's goal number is separate. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The 'goal' column seems to be sequential numbering for each row, not indicating how many goals were scored in that match. So perhaps the actual goals he scored per match are in another column? Wait no, looking again, each row is a different match, and the 'score' column shows the match score. But the 'result' might indicate his personal contribution.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at each relevant competition:\n\nFriendly competitions:\n- Row2: Competition is friendly. The goal column is 1, but does that mean he scored one goal in that match? Or is it just a numbering of the row? Hmm, perhaps the 'goal' column isn't directly indicating his goals, but rather the overall match goals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again: Each row represents a different game where Guillermo Franco was involved. The 'score' column shows the match score, and the 'result' might be his personal contribution. Alternatively, perhaps each row's goal number indicates how many goals he scored in that specific match.\n\nWait no, looking at the columns:\n\n- goal: This is likely just a sequential number for each entry.\n- date\n- venue\n- score: Probably the overall match score.\n- result: Maybe the outcome of the match, but not necessarily his personal goals. Or perhaps it's the scoreline after extra time or penalties.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure how to interpret 'score' and 'result'. Let me try to parse each row:\n\nRow1:\n- Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualification\n- Score: 1-1 (this is likely the match score)\n- Result: 5-2 (could be after extra time or aggregate)\n\nBut I'm not sure if this relates directly to his goals. Alternatively, perhaps 'score' refers to the goals he scored in that match, but that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps each row represents a goal he scored, with details about when and where it happened. So the 'goal' column is just an incrementing number for each of his goals. The 'date', 'venue', etc., describe when and where he scored that particular goal.\n\nIf that's the case, then each row represents one of his goals. So:\n\nRow1: He scored his first goal in a 2006 World Cup Qualifier.\nRow2: Second goal in a friendly match.\nRow3: Third goal in a 2010 World Cup Qualifier.\nRow4: Fourth goal in the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\nRow5: Fifth goal, but it's a 0-5 loss; perhaps he didn't score here? Or maybe this is a different type of result.\nWait, no\u2014each row is a separate match. So if the result is 0-5, that means his team lost 0-5, so he didn't score in that match.\n\nBut according to the 'goal' column, each row is a separate goal he scored. So perhaps in rows where he scored, the 'goal' number increments by one, and rows where he didn't score are not included. But this might complicate things because if he didn't score in a match, that row wouldn't be present.\n\nWait, but looking at row5: The competition is CONCACAF Gold Cup, and the result is 0-5. So perhaps he scored zero goals in that match. Similarly, in row6: Competition is 2010 World Cup Qualification, score is 3-0, which might mean his team won, but how many goals did he score? If each row is a goal, then the fact that it's row6 would indicate another goal.\n\nBut this approach is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look at each match and count how many times he scored in friendly vs 2010 World Cup Qualification matches.\n\nSo let me go through each row:\n\nRow1: Competition: 2006 World Cup Qualifier; score: 1-1 (match score), result: 5-2 (aggregate or something). But does this mean he scored a goal in that match? The 'goal' column is 1, which might just be the first goal of his career listed here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row represents a separate game, and the 'goal' column indicates how many goals he scored in that game. So:\n\nRow2: Competition friendly; score 1-0 (his team won), result 5-2? Wait no, this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, I'm clearly misunderstanding something here. Let's try another approach: Perhaps each row is a match where he played, and the 'goal' column indicates how many goals he scored in that match. So:\n\nRow1: He scored 1 goal in a 2006 World Cup Qualifier.\nRow2: He scored 2 goals in a friendly match.\nWait no, because the 'goal' numbers go from 1 to 7 without repetition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is a separate goal he scored. So row1 is his first goal, row2 is his second, etc., with details about when and where it was scored.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nFriendly matches:\n- Row2: Second goal in a friendly match.\n- Are there other rows for friendly matches? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rows, only row2 has 'friendly' as the competition. So he scored 1 goal in a friendly match.\n\nNow, looking at 2010 World Cup Qualification:\n\nRow3: Third goal in a 2010 World Cup Qualifier.\nIs there another row for that? Let's see:\n\nRow6: Competition is 2010 World Cup Qualifier. So he scored his sixth goal in such a match.\n\nSo, how many goals did he score in friendly matches and in 2010 World Cup qualifiers?\n\nFriendly:\n- Row2: 1 goal\n\n2010 WCQ:\n- Row3: 1 goal\n- Row6: another goal? Wait, no\u2014each row is one goal. So if row3 is his third goal overall, scored in a 2010 qualifier, and row6 is his sixth goal overall, also in a 2010 qualifier.\n\nWait, that would mean he scored two goals in 2010 qualifiers (rows3 and6). But are there more?\n\nLet me count:\n\nRows with competition '2010 World Cup Qualifier':\n- Row3: yes\n- Row6: yes\n\nSo that's two rows, meaning two goals.\n\nFriendly matches:\nOnly row2, so one goal.\n\nTherefore, he scored 2 goals in 2010 qualifiers and 1 goal in friendly matches.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each row is a separate match. That might not be the case if some rows represent multiple goals in the same match.\n\nBut the way the data is structured isn't clear. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count how many times he scored in friendly vs WCQ.\n\nIf we assume that each row represents a different match where he scored at least one goal, then:\n\nFriendly:\n- 1 match (row2), so 1 goal\n\nWCQ 2010:\n- 2 matches (rows3 and6), but how many goals? If each row is a separate goal, then in rows3 and6, he scored once each.\n\nSo total: friendly = 1, WCQ = 2.\n\nBut the question was to compare the number of goals in friendly vs WCQ. So if he scored more in WCQ than in friendlies, which would be the case here (2 vs 1), then he has a higher count in WCQ.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether Guillermo Varela has scored more goals in friendly matches or during World Cup qualifiers, we analyze the provided data:\n\n- **Friendly Matches**: There is one entry (row 2) indicating he scored a goal in a friendly match. Therefore, he has scored **1 goal** in friendly matches.\n  \n- **World Cup Qualifiers (specifically for 2010)**: There are two entries (rows 3 and 6) showing goals scored during World Cup qualifiers. This results in **2 goals**.\n\nBased on this breakdown:\n\nGuillermo Varela has scored more goals in World Cup qualifiers than in friendly matches.\n\n**Answer:** Guillermo Varela has scored more goals in World Cup qualifiers.",
