    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the crowd surpass 19000 for 3 match on 22 may 1926\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The dates for all matches listed are 22 May 1926, so that part of the claim is consistent across all entries.\n\nThe claim mentions that the crowd surpassed 19000 for three matches on that day. So I need to check each row's \"crowd\" column and see how many have a value greater than 19000.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Collingwood vs Melbourne: Crowd is 15,000. That's less than 19,000.\n2. Carlton vs South Melbourne: Crowd is 25,000. That's more than 19,000.\n3. Richmond vs Hawthorn: Crowd is 14,000. Less than 19,000.\n4. North Melbourne vs Geelong: Crowd is 14,000. Also less.\n5. St Kilda vs Fitzroy: Crowd is 22,000. That's over 19,000.\n6. Footscray vs Essendon: Crowd is 20,000. Just enough to surpass 19,000.\n\nSo now I count how many matches have a crowd over 19000:\n\n- Carlton vs South Melbourne: 25,000 (row index 1)\n- St Kilda vs Fitzroy: 22,000 (row index 4)\n- Footscray vs Essendon: 20,000 (row index 5)\n\nThat's three matches where the crowd was over 19,000. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nI should note the relevant cells for each of these rows under the \"crowd\" column because that's what determines if they surpass 19000.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows three matches on 22 May 1926 where the crowd exceeded 19,000. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the claim \"for the 6 match the venue be never the same\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that in all six matches listed, each one was held at a different venue\u2014meaning no two matches share the same venue.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are seven columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. The relevant column here is \"venue\" since that's what the claim is about.\n\nNow, I'll examine each row in the table to see if any venues repeat:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Venue is Victoria Park.\n2. **Row 1**: Venue is Princes Park.\n3. **Row 2**: Venue is Punt Road Oval.\n4. **Row 3**: Venue is Arden Street Oval.\n5. **Row 4**: Venue is Junction Oval.\n6. **Row 5**: Venue is Western Oval.\n\nGoing through each one, I notice that all the venues listed are unique.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the crowd be unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match on 22 may 1926\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that the crowd didn't exceed 19,000 in three of the matches held on May 22, 1926. So, my goal is to check how many of these games had a crowd less than or equal to 19,000.\n\nLooking at the table, I see six rows, each representing a different match. Each row has various details, but I'm particularly interested in the \"crowd\" column since that's what the claim is about. The other columns like home team, away team, scores, venue, and date are provided for context but aren't directly relevant to verifying this specific claim.\n\nNext, I'll examine each game's crowd numbers:\n\n1. **Collingwood vs Melbourne**: The crowd was 15,000.\n2. **Carlton vs South Melbourne**: The crowd was 25,000.\n3. **Richmond vs Hawthorn**: The crowd was 14,000.\n4. **North Melbourne vs Geelong**: The crowd was 14,000.\n5. **St Kilda vs Fitzroy**: The crowd was 22,000.\n6. **Footscray vs Essendon**: The crowd was 20,000.\n\nNow, I'll count how many of these had a crowd that didn't surpass 19,000:\n\n- Collingwood: 15,000 (<=19,000)\n- Richmond: 14,000 (<=19,000)\n- North Melbourne: 14,000 (<=19,000)\n\nThat's three matches where the crowd was under or equal to 19,000. \n\nWait a minute\u2014the claim says \"unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match,\" which means exactly three games had crowds below this threshold. However, in our analysis, it looks like there are three such games. But wait, let's double-check:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Carlton: 25,000 (exceeds)\n- St Kilda: 22,000 (exceeds)\n- Footscray: 20,000 (exceeds)\n\nSo three matches exceeded 19,000. That leaves the other three as not exceeding. Therefore, the claim is correct because exactly three games had crowds that didn't surpass 19,000.\n\nBut wait again\u2014the claim says \"unable to surpass 19000 for 3 of the match.\" So it's about three matches where the crowd did NOT exceed 19,000. From the table:\n\n- Collingwood: 15k (<=19k)\n- Richmond:14k\n- North Melbourne:14k\n\nYes, that's three. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each row index and the column name \"crowd\" since those are the ones we checked.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in three of the matches on 22 May 1926, the crowd did not exceed 19,000.

Now, I need to check if this is accurate according to the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find the one where Richmond is either the home or away team and where the venue is Punt Road Oval because the claim specifies the venue as well.\n\nLet me go through the rows:\n\n1.

Hawthorn's score is 14.16 (100), meaning 14 goals and 16 behinds, totaling 100 points.\n\nComparing the total points: Richmond has 112, Hawthorn has 100. So Richmond won this match with a higher score than Hawthorn.\n\nThe claim states that Richmond was unable to defeat Hawthorn, which would mean Hawthorn should have won or at least not lost. But according to the scores, Richmond did win because their total points are higher. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I misread anything. The home team is Richmond with 16.16 (84 + ? Wait no, wait the table shows home team score as 16.16 (112) and away team 14.16 (100). So yes, 112 > 100. Therefore, Richmond won.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because Richmond did defeat Hawthorn at Punt Road Oval on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from row index 2 where both teams and their scores are listed. \n\n{  \n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",  \n   \"relevant_cells\": [  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},  \n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}  \n   ]  \n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down each part of the claim and check against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"fitzroy lose to st kilda by 11 point at junction oval on 22 march 1926.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the match involving Fitzroy and St Kilda. Scanning the table, I see that in row index 4 (since counting starts from 0), the home team is St Kilda with a score of 9.8 (62) and the away team is Fitzroy with 7.9 (51). The venue for this match is junction oval on date 22 may 1926.\n\nNext, I need to verify each component:\n\n1. **Teams**: Yes, it's between St Kilda (home) and Fitzroy (away).\n2. **Score Difference**: St Kilda scored 62 points, and Fitzroy scored 51. The difference is 11 points.\n3. **Venue**: It's at junction oval as stated in the claim.\n4. **Date**: The date in the table is May 22, 1926, but the claim mentions March 22, 1926. This is a discrepancy.\n\nAdditionally, the claim says Fitzroy lost to St Kilda by 11 points. Looking at the scores, St Kilda (home) has a higher score than Fitzroy, so yes, Fitzroy did lose by exactly 11 points.\n\nHowever, the date in the table is May 22, not March 22. Since dates don't match, this affects the claim's validity. Therefore, despite other parts being correct, the incorrect date makes the overall statement FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check are from row index 4:\n- Home team: st kilda\n- Away team: fitzroy\n- Away team score: 7.9 (51)\n- Home team score: 9.8 (62)\n- Venue: junction oval\n- Date: 22 may 1926\n\nSo, the answer is FALSE because of the wrong date.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
