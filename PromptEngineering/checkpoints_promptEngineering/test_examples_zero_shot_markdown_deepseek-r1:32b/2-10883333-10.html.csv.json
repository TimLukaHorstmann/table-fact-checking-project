So, for princes park, the row index is 3. For junction oval, it's row 4.\n\nNext, I need to check the crowd numbers for these venues.

The claim is about North Melbourne having the highest score among all away teams in a table from June 7, 1975. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns for home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a game played on that day.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"north melbourne have the highest score out all the way team.\" I think there's a typo here\u2014probably meant to say \"away team.\" So, we're looking at the scores of each away team and seeing if North Melbourne has the highest.\n\nLooking at the table, the away teams and their respective scores are:\n- Melbourne: 14.14 (98)\n- North Melbourne: 17.19 (121)\n- Essendon: 12.9 (81)\n- Collingwood: 13.11 (89)\n- Carlton: 16.10 (106)\n- South Melbourne: 12.15 (87)\n\nI need to compare these scores.

Comparing this with the others:\n- Melbourne has 98\n- Essendon: 81\n- Collingwood: 89\n- Carlton: 106\n- South Melbourne: 87\n\nSo, North Melbourne's 121 is indeed higher than all other away teams' scores. \n\nNow, I need to map this information back to the table. Each row corresponds to a game, and each away team's score is in the \"away team score\" column.\n\nThe relevant cells for each away team are:\n- Row 0: Melbourne (home vs Geelong)\n- Row 1: North Melbourne\n- Row 2: Essendon\n- Row 3: Collingwood\n- Row 4: Carlton\n- Row 5: South Melbourne\n\nSo, I need to list the relevant cells for each of these teams.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"kardinia park have less crowd than moorabbin oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure to identify which columns are relevant. The table includes columns like 'home team', 'away team', 'venue', and 'crowd'. Since the claim compares the crowds at two specific venues\u2014kardinia park and moorabbin oval\u2014I need to find their respective crowd numbers.\n\nLooking through each row, I'll check for rows where the venue is either kardinia park or moorabbin oval. \n\nThe first row has 'kardinia park' as the venue, with a crowd of 13,328. The second row mentions 'moorabbin oval', recording a crowd of 17,811. These two rows are the only ones relevant to the claim.\n\nNow, comparing the crowd numbers: 13,328 (kardinia park) versus 17,811 (moorabbin oval).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"north melbourne have the second highest score out all the way team\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that North Melbourne has the second-highest away team score in the table. So I should look at each row and identify the away teams along with their scores.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has an \"away team\" column and an \"away team score\". Let me list out all the away teams and their respective scores:\n\n1. Melbourne - 14.14 (98)\n2. North Melbourne - 17.19 (121)\n3. Essendon - 12.9 (81)\n4. Collingwood - 13.11 (89)\n5. Carlton - 16.10 (106)\n6. South Melbourne - 12.15 (87)\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake there because the away teams are as follows:\n\nLooking back at each row:\n- Row 0: Away team is Melbourne with 14.14 (98)\n- Row 1: Away team is North Melbourne with 17.19 (121)\n- Row 2: Away team is Essendon with 12.9 (81)\n- Row 3: Away team is Collingwood with 13.11 (89)\n- Row 4: Away team is Carlton with 16.10 (106)\n- Row 5: Away team is South Melbourne with 12.15 (87)\n\nSo, compiling the away team scores:\n\n- Melbourne: 98\n- North Melbourne: 121\n- Essendon: 81\n- Collingwood: 89\n- Carlton: 106\n- South Melbourne: 87\n\nNow, to find out who has the highest and second-highest scores. Let's sort these scores in descending order:\n\n1. North Melbourne: 121 (highest)\n2. Carlton: 106 (second-highest)\n3. Melbourne: 98\n4. Collingwood: 89\n5. South Melbourne: 87\n6. Essendon: 81\n\nSo, the highest score is North Melbourne with 121, and the second-highest is Carlton with 106.\n\nThe claim says that North Melbourne has the second-highest score among all away teams. But according to my sorting, they actually have the highest. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's not the second-highest but the first.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the claim. The claim could be interpreted as whether North Melbourne is the second in the entire table regardless of home or away, but that doesn't make sense because the claim specifically mentions \"away team\". So, focusing on just the away teams.\n\nThus, since North Melbourne has the highest score among all away teams, the statement that they have the second-highest is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to look at each row's \"away team\" and \"away team score\". So, for each row from 0 to 5, check both columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because North Melbourne actually has the highest away team score, not the second.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"fitzroy have a higher score than any of the other team\" is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The relevant columns here are \"home team\", \"home team score\", \"away team\", and \"away team score\". Each row represents a match between two teams with their respective scores.\n\nThe claim is about Fitzroy having a higher score than any other team. So I need to check all the scores in the table, both home and away, for each team, and see if Fitzroy's score is indeed the highest.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. Geelong vs Melbourne: Geelong scored 14.20 (104), Melbourne 14.14 (98)\n2. St Kilda vs North Melbourne: St Kilda 15.9 (99), North Melbourne 17.19 (121)\n3. Richmond vs Essendon: Richmond 19.14 (128), Essendon 12.9 (81)\n4. Hawthorn vs Collingwood: Hawthorn 19.24 (138), Collingwood 13.11 (89)\n5. Fitzroy vs Carlton: Fitzroy 15.7 (97), Carlton 16.10 (106)\n6. Footscray vs South Melbourne: Footscray 13.11 (89), South Melbourne 12.15 (87)\n\nNow, I need to list out all the scores for each team:\n\n- Geelong: 104\n- Melbourne: 98\n- St Kilda: 99\n- North Melbourne: 121\n- Richmond: 128\n- Essendon: 81\n- Hawthorn: 138\n- Collingwood: 89\n- Fitzroy: 97\n- Carlton: 106\n- Footscray: 89\n- South Melbourne: 87\n\nLooking for the highest score, I see that Hawthorn scored 138, which is higher than Fitzroy's 97. So Fitzroy isn't the top scorer; Hawthorn has a higher score.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are other teams (like Hawthorn) with higher scores than Fitzroy.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Fitzroy has the highest score among all teams in the table. By examining each team's score, it becomes evident that Hawthorn scored 138, which is higher than Fitzroy's 97.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
