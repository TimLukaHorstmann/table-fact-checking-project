    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by carefully checking each part of the claim.\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the opponent is \"buffalo sabres\". Scanning through the 'opponent' column, I see that game number 47 has \"buffalo sabres\" as the opponent. The row index here is 10 because counting starts from 0; let me verify: game 37 is index 0, then each subsequent game increments by one. So game 47 is indeed at index 10.\n\nNext, I'll check the 'attendance' for that particular game. Looking at the attendance column in row 10, the value is 15611. The claim states the attendance was 10750, which doesn't match. \n\nI should also ensure there are no other games against Buffalo Sabres to avoid missing any possibilities. Checking all rows, I only find one game against them at row index 10. So the correct attendance is 15611, not 10750.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
