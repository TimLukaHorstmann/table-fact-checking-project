    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to verify the claim: \"in Tokyo, Japan, Hikaru Sato's match ended before round 2.\" Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where the location is Tokyo, Japan. Scanning the table, there are multiple rows with \"tokyo, japan\" in the Location column. For example, row 37 has Hikaru Sato's match in Tokyo.\n\nNext, I check if this was a loss or a win. In row 37, the Result is \"win,\" so it wasn't a loss. But wait, the claim says the match ended before round 2, which implies a stoppage, like a KO or TKO, not necessarily a loss. So maybe looking for matches that didn't go the full rounds.\n\nLooking at row 37 again, under Round, it's listed as \"1\". That means the match only went to round 1, so it ended before round 2. The column 'Round' here is important because it shows how many rounds were completed.\n\nThe time in that cell is \"3:53\", which is within a single round (assuming each round is 5 minutes). So yes, Hikaru Sato's match in Tokyo ended before the second round.\n\nSo I need to include the row index where this match is and the columns that support this. The relevant cells are the Location and Round for that specific match.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 37, \"column_name\": \"Round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says the record was 19-9-4 with a time of 1:44. \n\nFirst, I need to check each part of the claim against the data in the table. Let's break it down into components: event name, record, and time.\n\nStarting with the event name \"Pancrase - Impressive Tour 9\". I'll look through the \"Event\" column to see if this exact phrase appears. Scanning through the rows, I notice events like \"Pancrase - Spiral 4\", \"Pancrase - Brave 10\", and others. There's no mention of \"Impressive Tour 9\" in any of these. So, the event itself doesn't exist in the table.\n\nNext, checking the record: 19-9-4. The table has a column for \"Record\". I'll go through each row to see if this specific record appears. Looking at the records listed:\n\n- 19-9-4 isn't present anywhere. The closest is 19-8-4 in one of the later rows, but that's not matching exactly.\n\nLastly, the time mentioned is 1:44. I'll check the \"Time\" column to see if any fight lasted 1 minute and 44 seconds. Looking through the times:\n\n- Most entries are around 3-5 minutes, with some as short as 1:09 or 1:41. There's no time of exactly 1:44 listed.\n\nSince none of these components match\u2014event name, record, or time\u2014the claim isn't supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"At the gcm - dog 4 event, daisuke hanazawa be the opponent.\" So I need to check this against the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row in the table and see where 'gcm - dog 4' appears as an event name. Scanning through the rows, I notice that there's a row with \"Event\" column value \"gcm  - dog 4\". Let me check which row that is.\n\nLooking at the rows, I find the row where the Event is \"gcm  - dog 4\". In this row, the Opponent is listed as Daisuke Hanazawa. The Result for this match is a win, and it's under the GCM event series.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. I'll double-check each relevant cell. The Event column in that row has \"gcm  - dog 4\", which matches part of the claim. The Opponent column shows Daisuke Hanazawa, so that fits as well. \n\nI should also consider if there are any other rows mentioning 'dog 4' or similar events to avoid confusion. But looking through all the events listed, it seems only this row refers to \"gcm - dog 4\". So I can confidently say that Daisuke Hanazawa was indeed the opponent at that event.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Event\"}, {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this task where I need to check a claim against a table of match records. The claim is: \"19  - 9  - 4 be the record of the match that have a time of 1:44 in saitama , japan\". \n\nFirst, let me break down what's being asked here. The claim mentions three things: the record (19-9-4), the time (1:44), and the location (saitama, japan). I need to verify if there's a match in the table that has all these details.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with several columns. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"record\", \"time\", and \"location\". Let me go through each row one by one to see if any of them have a time of 1:44 and location in saitama, japan.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. First row: Time is 5:00, location is australia. Doesn't match.\n2. Second row down: Time varies, locations include japan but I'm looking for 1:44 specifically.\n3. Scanning through each entry, checking the \"time\" column for 1:44.\n\nWait a second, going back to the first few rows:\n\n- The claim mentions saitama, japan as the location. Let me check if any row has that location and the specified time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow with index 0 (assuming starting from 0) shows \"saitama , japan\" in the location column. What's the time there? It says 5:00. Not 1:44. Next, I see another entry for saitama, but again, the time is different.\n\nGoing further down:\n\nRow with index 2 has a time of 3:53 and location tokyo, japan.\nRow 3: Time 5:00, location chiba, japan.\nRow 4: 1:40 in tokyo. Close but not 1:44.\n\nHmm, I don't see any row where the time is exactly 1:44 and location saitama, japan. Also, regarding the record of 19-9-4, looking through each row's \"record\" column, none seem to match that exact figure either.\n\nWait, actually, in the second part of the table, I see a row with a time of 1:09, location saitama, but that's different from 1:44. So no matches for both the time and location.\n\nTherefore, since there's no entry in the table where the time is 1:44 and the location is saitama, japan, the claim can't be supported by the data provided. Additionally, even if such a match existed, I need to check if the record is indeed 19-9-4. But since there's no matching entry with that time and location, it's already FALSE.\n\nSo the conclusion is, the claim isn't supported by any of the cells in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a time of 1:44 in Saitama, Japan with a record of 19-9-4. Reviewing each row:\n\n- No entry has both \"saitama , japan\" and \"time: 1:44\".\n- The closest is row index 0 with location saitama but time 5:00.\n- No rows match all three conditions.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"Tokyo, Japan be the location of the match that end after round 2 against Hikaru Sato.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the claim correctly. It mentions three key points:\n1. The location is Tokyo, Japan.\n2. The match ended after round 2.\n3. The opponent was Hikaru Sato.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different match with various details like date, event, location, opponent, result, method of victory/loss, and rounds. \n\nI'll start by searching for matches where the location is Tokyo, Japan. Scanning through the 'Location' column:\n- Row 25: Location is Tokyo, Japan.\n- Other rows either have 'japan' without specifying Tokyo or other locations.\n\nNext, I need to check if this match against Hikaru Sato ended after round 2. Checking row 25 details:\n- Opponent: hikaru sato\n- Rounds: 1 (only one round)\n- Result: win via tko (punches)\n\nHmm, the rounds column shows 1, meaning the match ended in the first round, not the second. This contradicts the claim which states it ended after round 2.\n\nAdditionally, looking for any other matches against Hikaru Sato in Tokyo:\n- There's only one entry with Hikaru Sato as the opponent, and that's row 25.\n\nTherefore, while Tokyo, Japan is indeed the location of a match against Hikaru Sato, it ended after round 1, not round 2. This makes the claim false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies that the match in Tokyo, Japan against Hikaru Sato ended after round 2.
