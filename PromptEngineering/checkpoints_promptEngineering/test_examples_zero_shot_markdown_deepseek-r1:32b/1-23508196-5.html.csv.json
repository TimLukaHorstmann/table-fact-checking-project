I need to determine whether the claim \"the tactical reconnaissance squadron have 60 more personnel than the night fighter squadron\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are type of unit, type of aircraft, number of aircraft, number of crews, men per crew, total personnel, officers, and enlisted. So, the key numbers here will be in the 'total personnel' column for each squadron mentioned.\n\nThe claim is comparing two squadrons: tactical reconnaissance and night fighter. I'll need to find their respective total personnel from the table.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- For the Night Fighter Squadron, which is row 8 (index starting at 0), the total personnel is 288.\n- For the Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, that's row 9, with a total of 233 personnel.\n\nWait, wait. The claim says tactical reconnaissance has 60 more than night fighter. But according to these numbers, night fighter has 288 and tactical recce has 233. So 233 is actually less than 288 by 55. That means the claim would be false because 233 isn't 60 more than 288; it's actually fewer.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm looking at the right rows. The table lists:\n\nRow 8: Night Fighter Squadron - total personnel 288.\nRow 9: Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron - total personnel 233.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the difference is negative, not positive by 60. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list the rows and columns that support this conclusion.

The columns include 'type of unit', 'type of aircraft', 'number of aircraft', 'number of crews', 'men per crew', and others. Since the claim mentions \"number of crew,\" that's probably referring to either the number of crews or men per crew.\n\nThe claim says both groups have 45 as their number of crew. Let me find the rows for single-engine and twin-engine fighter groups.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Single-engine fighter group: row index is 4.\n  - Number of crews: 108 to 126\n  - Men per crew: 1\n\n- Twin-engine fighter group: row index is 5.\n  - Number of crews: 108 to 126\n  - Men per crew: 1\n\nWait, the claim says \"they both share the same number of crew which be 45.\" But according to the table, both have 108 to 126 as their number of crews. There's no mention of 45 here.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could it refer to men per crew? For single-engine, it's 1, and twin-engine is also 1. That would mean each crew has 1 person, not 45.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to something else. Let me check again:\n\n- Single-engine: 108-126 crews\n- Twin-engine: 108-126 crews\n\nNeither of these is 45. So the number of crews isn't 45 for either group.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong column. Maybe it's 'men per crew'? For single-engine, men per crew are 1; twin-engine also 1. Still not 45.\n\nOr maybe total personnel? Single-engine: 994, Twin-engine: 1081. Not 45 either.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about something else, but based on what's in the table, it doesn't seem to align. The number of crews for both groups are the same range (108-126), not 45. So the claim that they share the same number of crew as 45 is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both single-engine and twin-engine fighter groups have a crew number of 45, but according to the table, both have 108-126 crews. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"number of crews\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"number of crews\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
