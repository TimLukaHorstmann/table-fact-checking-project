    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what the claim says.\n\nThe claim states: \"there be 1 woman's double team consist of kerry ann sheppard and carolina harvey when jamie van hooijdonk compete in the men's single.\"\n\nWait, first off, I notice that \"carolina harvey\" is written here. Looking at the table, under the \"womens doubles\" column for 2009, it says \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" So maybe that's a typo, and the claim meant to say \"Caroline\" instead of \"carolina\"? Or perhaps it's just a variation in spelling. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. In the year when Jamie van Hooijdonk competed in men's singles, was there a women's doubles team consisting of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey?\n\nSo, first, I need to find out in which season Jamie van Hooijdonk was in men's singles. Looking at the table:\n\n- The \"mens singles\" column lists various players for each year.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n2000: richard vaughan\n2001: richard vaughan\n2002: richard vaughan\n2003: irwansyah\n2004: irwansyah\n2005: paul le tocq\n2006: martyn lewis\n2007: raj popat\n2008: martyn lewis\n2009: jamie van hooijdonk\n2010: irwansyah\n\nSo, Jamie van Hooijdonk competed in men's singles in 2009.\n\nNow, I need to check the women's doubles team for that same year (2009) to see if it was Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nLooking at the \"womens doubles\" column for 2009: It says \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" Wait, actually, looking at the table again:\n\nWait, no. Let me double-check. The table is in markdown format, so let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe table has the following columns: season, mens singles, womens singles, mens doubles, womens doubles, mixed doubles.\n\nFor 2009:\n\n- men's singles: jamie van hooijdonk\n- women's singles: sarah thomas\n- men's doubles: martyn lewis matthew hughes\n- women's doubles: kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey\n- mixed doubles: martyn lewis vikki jones\n\nWait, in the table, under 2009 for women's doubles, it says \"kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey.\" So yes, that matches exactly with the claim. The team is Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nIn 2009, when Jamie van Hooijdonk was in men's singles, the women's doubles team was indeed Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I'm looking at the table again. The row for 2009 is:\n\n|     2009  | jamie van hooijdonk  | sarah thomas      | martyn lewis matthew hughes  | kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey  | martyn lewis vikki jones      |\n\nYes, that's correct. So the claim is accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are:\n\n- The row where season is 2009 (row index 9) in the \"womens doubles\" column.\n- Also, the same row for \"mens singles\" to confirm Jamie van Hooijdonk was competing there.\n\nSo, the relevant_cells would include both the \"womens doubles\" and \"mens singles\" columns from that row.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided. \n\nFirst, I'll restate the claim to make sure I understand it correctly: \"The women's double team, Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey, compete in the same year as when Jamie van Hooijdonk competes in men's singles.\" So, we need to check two things:\n\n1. In which year did Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey compete together in women's doubles?\n2. In which year did Jamie van Hooijdonk compete in men's singles?\n\nThen, we'll see if these two events occurred in the same year.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to examine the \"womens doubles\" column for the team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey. Scanning through each row:\n\n- 2000: Jo Muggeridge Felicity Gallup\n- 2001: Same as above\n- 2002: Same as above\n- 2003: Same as above\n- 2004: Same as above\n- 2005: Robyn Ashworth Harriett Johnson\n- 2006: Jo Muggeridge Rachele Phillips\n- 2007: Jo Muggeridge Rachele Phillips\n- 2008: Vikki Jones Nicole Walkley\n- 2009: Kerry Ann Sheppard Caroline Harvey (Here we go)\n- 2010: Caroline Harvey Carissa Turner\n\nSo, the team of Kerry Ann Sheppard and Caroline Harvey is listed in the women's doubles for the year 2009.\n\nNext, I'll check when Jamie van Hooijdonk competed in men's singles. Looking at the \"mens singles\" column:\n\n- 2000: Richard Vaughan\n- 2001: Same as above\n- 2002: Same as above\n- 2003: Irwansyah\n- 2004: Same as above\n- 2005: Paul le Tocq\n- 2006: Martyn Lewis\n- 2007: Raj Popat\n- 2008: Martyn Lewis\n- 2009: Jamie van Hooijdonk (Here)\n- 2010: Irwansyah\n\nSo, Jamie van Hooijdonk competed in men's singles in the year 2009.\n\nSince both events occurred in 2009, the claim is TRUE. \n\nTo summarize, the relevant cells are:\n- For women's doubles in 2009: row index 9 (assuming rows start at 0), column \"womens doubles\".\n- For men's singles in 2009: same row index 9, column \"mens singles\".\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE with those two cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be zero woman's double team that compete when jamie van hooijdonk compete.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that in the years Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed in the men's singles category, there were no teams competing in the women's doubles category.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check for the presence of Jamie Van Hooijdonk in the men's singles column. Let me scan down the \"mens singles\" column:\n\n- 2000: richard vaughan\n- 2001: richard vaughan\n- 2002: richard vaughan\n- 2003: irwansyah\n- 2004: irwansyah\n- 2005: paul le tocq\n- 2006: martyn lewis\n- 2007: raj popat\n- 2008: martyn lewis\n- 2009: jamie van hooijdonk\n- 2010: irwansyah\n\nSo, Jamie Van Hooijdonk is listed only once in the men's singles, in 2009. Now, I need to check if there were any women's doubles teams that year.\n\nLooking at the \"womens doubles\" column for 2009, it says: kerry ann sheppard caroline harvey. That means two people competed as a team in women's doubles in 2009 when Jamie Van Hooijdonk was competing in men's singles.\n\nTherefore, the claim is saying that there were zero teams, but we can see that there was at least one team (two players) in women's doubles that year. So the claim is FALSE because there was a woman's double team competing when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The row where Jamie Van Hooijdonk is listed in men's singles is row 9 (since rows start at index 0).\n- In that same row, under \"womens doubles\", there are entries. So we need to note both the \"mens singles\" and \"womens doubles\" columns for that row.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 9, column \"mens singles\"\n- Row 9, column \"womens doubles\"\n\nThis shows that when Jamie Van Hooijdonk competed (2009), there was a women's doubles team competing. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"mens singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"womens doubles\"}\n   ]\n}",
