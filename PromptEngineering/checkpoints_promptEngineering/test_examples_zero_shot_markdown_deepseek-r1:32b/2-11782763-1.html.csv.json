The goal is to count how many heirs have a relationship described as \"son\".\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Robert Curthose - Relationship is \"son\".\n2. Row 2: Robert Curthose again (this time under William II) - Relationship is \"elder brother\", so not son.\n3. Row 3: Henry Beauclerc - Relationship is \"younger brother\", so not son.\n4. Row 5: William Adelin - Relationship is \"only son\".\n5. Other rows either have unclear succession or relationships that aren't \"son\".\n\nSo, I count two instances where the relationship to monarch is \"son\": Robert Curthose under William I and William Adelin under Henry I.\n\nThe claim says only two heirs have this relationship, which matches my findings.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088. Then it says this happened a year after Robert Curthose. So I need to check two things: when Henry became heir and when Robert did, then see if there's a one-year difference between them.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find entries related to both Henry Beauclerc and Robert Curthose.\n\nStarting with Robert Curthose:\n- The first row has him as \"heir presumptive\" under William I. He became heir in 1066 because his father became king.\n- Then there's a row about succession being unclear between 1077 and 1087, but that seems to be during William I's reign, so maybe not directly relevant.\n- Next, Robert is listed again as \"heir presumptive\" under William II. He became heir in 1087 by agreement.\n\nNow for Henry Beauclerc:\n- In the next row after Robert under William II, Henry is listed as \"heir presumptive.\" His became heir date is 1088, due to Robert's rebellion.\n\nSo, according to the table, Robert Curthose became heir in 1087 (under William II), and Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088. That means there's a one-year difference between them. Therefore, the claim that Henry became heir a year after Robert seems accurate based on the data provided.\n\nI'll make sure I'm not missing anything else. The table doesn't have any other entries about their heirs or changes in status beyond these points, so it looks consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088, a year after Robert Curthose. Checking the relevant cells:\n\n- Robert Curthose became heir under William II in 1087 (row index 2).\n- Henry Beauclerc became heir in 1088 (row index 3).\n\nThe timeline shows a one-year difference between them.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"William Adelin be the only one who became heir due to birth.\" I need to verify if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table that can help me determine how each person became an heir. The key columns here are \"became heir\" and \"reason.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Robert Curthose (William I's son):** He became heir in 1066 because his father became king. The reason is a direct familial relationship, not just birth, so this doesn't support the claim.\n\n2. **Succession unclear (William I period):** This row indicates uncertainty from 1077 to 1087. Since there's no clear heir here, it doesn't apply to the claim about William Adelin being the only one due to birth.\n\n3. **Robert Curthose again (William II's time):** He became heir in 1087 by agreement, not just because of birth. So this also doesn't fit the claim.\n\n4. **Henry Beauclerc:** He became heir in 1088 due to Robert's rebellion. His ascension was political, not solely because of his birth.\n\n5. **Succession unclear (Henry I period):** Again, uncertainty from 1100-1103 doesn't relate directly to William Adelin's case.\n\n6. **William Adelin:** He became heir in 1103 simply because he was the only son. The \"reason\" column says he was born, which aligns with the claim of becoming heir due to birth.\n\n7. **Empress Matilda:** She became heiress presumptive when her brother died. This wasn't solely based on birth but also on the circumstances of her brother's death.\n\nNow, checking each relevant cell:\n\n- For William Adelin: The row index is 5 (assuming rows are zero-indexed starting from Robert Curthose as row 0). Looking at \"became heir\" (1103) and \"reason\" (born).\n\nLooking through all the entries, only William Adelin's ascension to heir was specifically due to being born. All others had reasons beyond just their birth, such as agreements, rebellion, or sibling deaths.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because William Adelin is the sole individual in the table who became heir solely based on his birth.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Henry Beauclerc ceased to be heir on August 2, 1100.\n2. William Adelin became heir 20 years after that date.\n\nLet's check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table for Henry Beauclerc:\n- In row 3 of the table (index starts from 0), under \"ceased to be heir,\" it says August 2, 1100. So the first part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, checking William Adelin's entry:\n- He became heir in 1103 as per the table. The date mentioned in the table for when he started being heir is 1103.\n\nNow, calculating the time between Henry ceasing and William becoming heir: 1103 - 1100 = 3 years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"henry beauclerc be the only 1 who became heir due to birth\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Henry Beauclerc was the only person who became an heir solely because of their birth. In other words, his status as heir was determined by being born into the position, rather than any other reason like inheritance through marriage, appointment, or rebellion.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different heir with various details about their status and how they became heirs. I'll go through each relevant entry to see if Henry Beauclerc is indeed the only one who became an heir due to birth.\n\n1. **Robert Curthose (Row 0):** He became heir because his father became king in 1066. His reason for ceasing to be heir was in 1077, but that's not directly related here. The key point is he became heir due to being the son of the monarch.\n\n2. **Succession unclear (Row 1):** This row doesn't apply to Henry Beauclerc, so I can skip it.\n\n3. **Robert Curthose again (Row 2):** He's listed under William II and became heir by agreement in 1087. So his status here was due to an agreement, not birth.\n\n4. **Henry Beauclerc (Row 3):** According to the table, he became heir because of Robert's rebellion in 1088. The \"reason\" column says \"robert 's rebellion.\" This implies that Henry's position as heir was due to Robert rebelling, which likely led to his removal, allowing Henry to take over.\n\n5. **Succession unclear (Row 4):** Again, not relevant to the claim about Henry.\n\n6. **William Adelin (Row 5):** He became heir because he was the only son, so this is another instance where someone became heir due to birth. His reason is simply \"born.\"\n\n7. **Empress Matilda (Row 6):** She became heiress presumptive after her brother died. Her status wasn't due to being born but rather because she was the only child left after her brother's death.\n\nNow, focusing on Henry Beauclerc: The claim says he became heir \"due to birth.\" But according to the table, his reason for becoming heir was Robert's rebellion. That suggests it wasn't solely due to his birth but because of political events\u2014Robert's rebellion likely led to his removal as heir, allowing Henry to take that position.\n\nAdditionally, William Adelin (Row 5) became heir because he was born as the only son. This means there's at least one other person who became heir due to birth, which contradicts the claim that Henry was the only one.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on two counts: first, Henry didn't become heir solely due to birth, and second, William Adelin did become heir because of his birth.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Henry Beauclerc was the sole individual who became an heir due to birth. However, examining the table reveals that Henry's status as heir resulted from Robert's rebellion rather than birth. Additionally, William Adelin also became heir due to being the only son. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"reason\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reason\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"only 3 heir have daughter as their relationship to monarch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that there are only three heirs in the table whose relationship to the monarch is listed as a daughter. So my task is to go through each row of the table and check how many times the \"relationship to monarch\" column indicates a daughter.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: heir, status, relationship to monarch, became heir, reason, ceased to be heir, monarch.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0:\n   - Heir: robert curthose\n   - Relationship: son\n   - Not a daughter.\n\n2. Row 1:\n   - This row seems to indicate uncertainty about the succession from 1077-1087. The relationship is listed as \"succession unclear\". So no specific gender mentioned here, can't count this as a daughter.\n\n3. Row 2:\n   - Heir: robert curthose again\n   - Relationship: elder brother\n   - Not a daughter.\n\n4. Row 3:\n   - Heir: henry beauclerc\n   - Relationship: younger brother\n   - Not a daughter.\n\n5. Row 4:\n   - Another succession unclear period from 1100-1103. Similar to row 1, the relationship is unclear and doesn't specify a daughter.\n\n6. Row 5:\n   - Heir: william adelin\n   - Relationship: only son\n   - Not a daughter.\n\n7. Row 6:\n   - Heir: empress matilda\n   - Relationship: only child\n   - Here, the relationship is \"only child\". It doesn't explicitly say daughter, but since she's called \"empress\" and referred to as an heiress presumptive, it implies she was a daughter. However, the exact term used is \"only child\", not \"daughter\".\n\nWait, so in row 6, the relationship is listed as \"only child\". The claim specifies \"daughter\", so does \"only child\" count? If the monarch had only one child and that child was female, then yes, she would be a daughter. But looking at the table, the relationship column doesn't say \"daughter\"; it says \"only child\". So strictly speaking, unless there's more context, I can't assume gender based on \"only child\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"heiress\" in her status implies she was female, hence a daughter. So maybe row 6 counts as having a daughter relationship.\n\nWait, let me check each row again:\n\n- Rows 0: son\n- Row1: unclear\n- Row2: brother\n- Row3: brother\n- Row4: unclear\n- Row5: son\n- Row6: only child (but she's an heiress)\n\nSo in the table, is there any entry where the relationship to monarch is explicitly \"daughter\"? Let me check each row:\n\nLooking again at each \"relationship to monarch\" column:\n\nRow0: son\nRow1: unclear\nRow2: elder brother\nRow3: younger brother\nRow4: unclear\nRow5: only son\nRow6: only child\n\nNone of the entries say \"daughter\". The only possible candidate is row6, but it's listed as \"only child\", not daughter. So even though empress matilda was a daughter, the table doesn't explicitly state that in the relationship column.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the information given, there are zero heirs where the relationship to the monarch is explicitly stated as a daughter. Hence, the claim that only three heirs have daughters as their relationship to the monarch is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are three heirs with a daughter relationship. Checking each row in the table under \"relationship to monarch\", none list \"daughter\". One row mentions \"only child\" but doesn't specify gender. Thus, no entries explicitly indicate a daughter.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** All rows where relationship is checked.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"relationship to monarch\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

From the table, under the row for William Adelin, the 'ceased to be heir' column shows \"25 November 1120.\" The claim says he ceased on 5 August 1119, which doesn't match. So that part seems off.\n\nNext, Empress Matilda's row shows she became heir on \"25 November 1120 proclaimed 1127\" and ceased in 1135.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim says.\n\nFirst, the claim states that Robert Curthose became heir in 1094. Then it adds that this happened a year after Empress Matilda. So I need to check two things: when Robert Curthose became heir and whether Empress Matilda's heir status was one year prior.\n\nLooking at the table, let me scan for entries related to Robert Curthose and Empress Matilda.\n\nStarting with Robert Curthose:\n\n- The first row mentions him as a heir presumptive under William I. His 'became heir' date is listed as 1066 because his father became king.\n- Then in another row, he's again a heir presumptive but this time under William II (William II was the son of William I). Here, he became heir in 1087 by agreement.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, looking at the table:\n\nRow index 0: Robert Curthose as heir presumptive, son to William I, became heir in 1066 when his father became king.\nThen row 2: Robert again as heir under William II, became heir in 1087.\n\nSo his becoming heir was twice. Once in 1066 and then again in 1087.\n\nNow for Empress Matilda:\n\nLooking at the last row, Empress Matilda is listed as heiress presumptive. She became heir on November 25, 1120, but was proclaimed in 1127. So her 'became heir' date seems to be 1120 or 1127.\n\nWait, the table says \"25 november 1120\" for William Adelin as heir apparent, then Empress Matilda became heiress presumptive after that, starting in November 1120 when she was proclaimed in 1127. So perhaps her 'became heir' is considered to be 1120 or 1127.\n\nBut the claim says Robert became heir in 1094, a year after Empress Matilda. But according to the table, Empress Matilda's becoming heir was much later, around 1120 or 1127, while Robert's dates are 1066 and 1087.\n\nSo Robert Curthose became heir in 1066 and then again in 1087. There's no mention of him becoming heir in 1094. The claim says he became heir in 1094, which isn't present in the table.\n\nAdditionally, Empress Matilda's dates are much later than 1094. Therefore, the claim that Robert became heir in 1094 a year after her is incorrect because both his becoming heir and hers happened at different times.\n\nMoreover, checking all rows:\n\n- For Robert Curthose: Became heir in 1066 and 1087.\n- Empress Matilda: Became heir in 1120 or 1127.\n\nSo the claim's dates don't align with the table. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Robert Curthose became heir in 1094, a year after Empress Matilda. However, according to the table, Robert became heir in 1066 and again in 1087, while Empress Matilda's dates are much later (around 1120). Thus, the claim is not supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"robert curthose be the heir 2 time, in 1082 and 1094\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying. It suggests that Robert Curthose was an heir twice, specifically in the years 1082 and 1094.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists various heirs along with their status, relationship to the monarch, when they became heir, reasons for becoming heir, when they ceased being heir, and the monarch they were associated with. The rows are indexed from 0 upwards.\n\nFirst, I'll search for all entries where Robert Curthose is mentioned as the heir. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Robert Curthose is listed as heir presumptive, became heir in 1066.\n- Row 2: Again, Robert Curthose as heir presumptive, became heir in 1087.\n\nI notice that there are two entries for Robert Curthose. In row 0, he became heir in 1066, and in row 2, he became heir again in 1087. Now, the claim mentions years 1082 and 1094 as the times when he was an heir.\n\nHmm, neither 1082 nor 1094 appear in the 'became heir' column for Robert Curthose. The relevant cells are row 0 with 'became heir' as 1066 and row 2 with 'became heir' as 1087. There's no mention of him being an heir in 1082 or 1094.\n\nSo, according to the table, Robert Curthose was an heir in 1066 and again in 1087, not in 1082 and 1094 as the claim states. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it references years that aren't supported by the data provided.\n\nI think I should also check if there are any other rows or columns that might have relevant information about Robert Curthose's heir status around those years, but from what I see, no such entries exist. The table clearly shows his two instances as heir in 1066 and 1087 under William I and William II respectively.\n\nThus, the claim doesn't align with the data in the table. It mentions incorrect years for Robert Curthose being an heir.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"became heir\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
