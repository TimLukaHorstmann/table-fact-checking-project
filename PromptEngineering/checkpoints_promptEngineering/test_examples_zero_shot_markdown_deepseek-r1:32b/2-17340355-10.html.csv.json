    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some basketball games and their details. The claim is \"3 of the game at the us airways center have the same attendance.\" My job is to figure out if this is true or false by checking each relevant cell in the table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's about games played at the US Airways Center and their attendance numbers. Specifically, it says that three of these games had the same attendance figure.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple columns: game number, date, team, location attendance, and record. The relevant parts here are the 'location attendance' column for each game played at US Airways Center.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Game 75: April 1 vs Houston, US Airways Center, attendance 18422.\n2. Game 76: April 3 vs Sacramento, US Airways Center, same attendance as before? Let's check \u2013 yes, it's also 18422.\n3. Game 77: April 5 vs Dallas, but the location is American Airlines Center. So this isn't at US Airways, so we can skip it.\n4. Game 78: April 8 vs New Orleans, played in New Orleans Arena. Not relevant.\n5. Game 79: April 10 vs Memphis, FedexForum. Not relevant.\n6. Game 80: April 11 vs Minnesota, Target Center. Not at US Airways.\n7. Game 81: April 13 vs Memphis again, but this time back at US Airways with attendance 18422.\n8. Game 82: April 15 vs Golden State, also at US Airways Center. Wait, the attendance here is just listed as \"us airways center\" without a number. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe it was missing or not recorded? So I can't count this one because there's no number provided.\n\nSo now, let me list out all the games at US Airways and their attendances:\n\n- Game 75: 18422\n- Game 76: 18422\n- Game 81: 18422\n- Game 82: No attendance number\n\nWait, that's three games with the same attendance of 18422. Games 75, 76, and 81 all have 18422 attendees at US Airways Center.\n\nBut wait a minute, what about game 82? The claim mentions \"3 of the games.\" So does that mean exactly three or at least three? Since game 82 doesn't have an attendance number, it can't be counted. Therefore, there are three games (75, 76, 81) with the same attendance.\n\nSo according to this, the claim is true because there are indeed three games at US Airways Center with the same attendance figure of 18422.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as three games at US Airways Center each had an attendance of 18422. The relevant cells are from rows 0, 1, and 6 in the 'location attendance' column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the highest attendance be at the american airline center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions \"highest attendance.\" That means I'm looking for the game with the maximum number of attendees. The table has a column named \"location attendance,\" which seems to be the relevant one here. Each row under this column provides both the location and the attendance figure. For example, the first row says \"us airways center 18422,\" which I assume means that the game was held at the US Airways Center with an attendance of 18,422 people.\n\nNext, the claim specifies \"at the american airline center.\" So I need to check if any of these games were played at the American Airlines Center and what their attendance numbers were. Looking through the table:\n\n- Game 75: US Airways Center (attendance 18,422)\n- Game 76: US Airways Center (18,422)\n- Game 77: American Airlines Center with an attendance of 20,301\n- The rest are at other locations like New Orleans Arena, FedexForum, Target Center, and another mention of US Airways Center.\n\nSo the only game played at the American Airlines Center is Game 77 on April 5th against Dallas. Its attendance was 20,301. Now, I need to compare this figure with all other attendances in the table to determine if it's indeed the highest.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- Game 75: 18,422\n- Game 76: 18,422\n- Game 77: 20,301 (highest so far)\n- Game 78: 17,781\n- Game 79: 15,908\n- Game 80: 18,478\n- Game 81: 18,422\n- Game 82: The attendance figure isn't provided for this game; it just says \"us airways center\" without a number. So we can ignore this since there's no data.\n\nComparing all the numbers, Game 77 has the highest attendance at 20,301. Since this game was at the American Airlines Center, that means the claim is correct\u2014the highest attendance was indeed at the American Airlines Center.\n\nTo summarize my steps:\n1. Identified \"location attendance\" as the relevant column for attendance figures.\n2. Scanned each row to find games played at the American Airlines Center.\n3. Found Game 77 had an attendance of 20,301 there.\n4. Compared this number with all other attendances in the table.\n5. Concluded that 20,301 was the highest, supporting the claim.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are from Game 77 under \"location attendance.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the American Airlines Center hosted a game with the highest attendance of 20,301 compared to all other games listed in the table. The relevant cell is at row index 2 in the \"location attendance\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"the game at the target center took place after the game at the fedexforum\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each column in the table to identify where the locations are mentioned. The relevant columns here seem to be 'location attendance' since it specifies where each game was held.\n\nLooking at the rows, I need to find the games that took place at Target Center and FedExForum. \n\nStarting with row 5 (row index 4, assuming starting from 0), I see that the location is \"target center 18478\". The date for this game is April 11.\n\nNext, looking for FedExForum, it's in row 6 (row index 5) where the location is \"fedexforum 15908\" with a date of April 10.\n\nComparing the dates, April 11 comes after April 10. Therefore, the game at Target Center occurred after the one at FedExForum.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because the Target Center game (April 11) happened later than the FedExForum game (April 10).\n\nThe relevant cells for this determination are:\n- The location and date of the Target Center game: row index 4 under 'location attendance' and 'date'.\n- The location and date of the FedExForum game: row index 5 under 'location attendance' and 'date'.\n\nThis confirms that both games took place, with the Target Center game occurring later.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the game at Target Center on April 11 occurred after the game at FedExForum on April 10.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each of these teams in the table and check their attendance numbers.\n\nStarting with Golden State: Looking at the last row (row 82), the location and attendance are listed as \"us airways center\" but without a specific number\u2014it just says us airways center. Wait, no\u2014the \"location attendance\" column for that row is only \"us airways center,\" so I think the attendance isn't provided here. Maybe it's implied to be the same as previous games at the same location? But actually, in the earlier rows like game 75 and others, the attendance was 18422 when it was at us airways center. So perhaps for Golden State, the attendance is also 18422.\n\nNext, Memphis: There are two entries for Memphis. The first is on April 10 (row 79) with an attendance of 15908 at fedexforum. The second is on April 13 (row 81), which took place at us airways center and had an attendance of 18422.\n\nNow, New Orleans: Their game was on April 8 (row 78) with an attendance of 17781 at new orleans arena.\n\nSo, compiling the attendances:\n\n- Golden State: Assuming it's 18422 since that's where they played before.\n- Memphis: They have two games\u201415908 and 18422. So depending on which game we're considering, their attendance varies.\n- New Orleans: Their attendance was 17781.\n\nWait, but the claim says all three teams have the same attendance. Looking at their attendances:\n\nGolden State (assuming 18422), Memphis (either 15908 or 18422), and New Orleans (17781). These are not all the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Perhaps it's referring to the attendance figures for each team across their games? Let me check again:\n\n- Golden State: Only one game in the table, so attendance is 18422.\n- Memphis: Two games\u201415908 and 18422. So they have different attendances themselves.\n- New Orleans: One game with 17781.\n\nTherefore, their attendances are not all the same across these entries.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the game against new orleans didn't have the highest attendance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that the game against New Orleans did not have the highest attendance among all games listed. To verify this, I need to look at the 'location attendance' column for each game and see which one has the highest number.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 8 games (rows 0 to 7). Each row lists a different game with details including the opponent team and the attendance number. My goal is to find out the attendance numbers for all games and compare them, especially focusing on the New Orleans game.\n\nLet me list out each game's attendance:\n\n- Game 75: Houston vs April 1 - Attendance: 18,422\n- Game 76: Sacramento vs April 3 - Attendance: 18,422\n- Game 77: Dallas vs April 5 - Attendance: 20,301\n- Game 78: New Orleans vs April 8 - Attendance: 17,781\n- Game 79: Memphis vs April 10 - Attendance: 15,908\n- Game 80: Minnesota vs April 11 - Attendance: 18,478\n- Game 81: Memphis vs April 13 - Attendance: 18,422\n- Game 82: Golden State vs April 15 - Attendance: The value is just \"us airways center\" without a number. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe it wasn't recorded or was omitted.\n\nWait, for Game 82, the attendance isn't provided as a numerical value but just the location. That could complicate things because I don't know the exact number. But perhaps we can infer or maybe it's a typo. However, without an actual number, it might not be considered in determining the highest attendance since we can't compare it numerically.\n\nNow, focusing on the other games:\n\n- The highest attendance numbers are 20,301 (Game 77 against Dallas), followed by 18,478 (Game 80 against Minnesota), and then multiple games at 18,422. The New Orleans game had an attendance of 17,781.\n\nSo, the highest attendance is clearly Game 77 with 20,301 attendees. Therefore, the game against New Orleans (Game 78) did not have the highest attendance since 17,781 is less than 20,301.\n\nWait a second, but what about Game 82? It's possible that if Game 82 had a higher attendance than 20,301, then maybe New Orleans wasn't the highest. However, since we don't have a numerical value for Game 82, it's safer to consider only the games where we do have numbers.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, Game 77 has the highest attendance, so the claim that the game against New Orleans didn't have the highest is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against New Orleans did not have the highest attendance. By examining the 'location attendance' column for each game, we find that the New Orleans game had an attendance of 17,781, while the Dallas game (Game 77) had the highest attendance at 20,301. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Comparing all entries, Target Center has 18478 which is less than 20301.

Each row represents a different game with its details.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific locations: fedexforum and target center. I need to find which games were played at these venues and then check their dates to see if the fedexforum game was after the target center game.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For \"fedexforum\", I scan the \"location attendance\" column.

Comparing these, April 10 is before April 11.

Let's go through each game:\n\n- Game 75: Houston - Attendance 18,422\n- Game 76: Sacramento - Attendance 18,422\n- Game 77: Dallas - Attendance 20,301\n- Game 78: New Orleans - Attendance 17,781\n- Game 79: Memphis - Attendance 15,908\n- Game 80: Minnesota - Attendance 18,478\n- Game 81: Memphis - Attendance 18,422\n- Game 82: Golden State - Attendance (no number provided)\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is 20,301 for game 77 against Dallas. The New Orleans game had only 17,781 attendees, which isn't the highest.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the game against New Orleans had the highest attendance is false. The relevant cells to support this conclusion are the \"team\" and \"location attendance\" columns across all rows to compare attendances.\n</think>\n\nThe game against New Orleans (row 3) has an attendance of 17,781. However, other games like Dallas (20,301) have higher attendances.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
