    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"the title of deacon of ss cosma e damiano go to the spanish order of the cardinal - deacon\".\n\nFirst, I'll look for the relevant information in each column.\n\nStarting with the 'title' column, I'm searching for \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano\". Looking through the rows, row index 8 has this exact title. So that's a match.\n\nNext, the claim mentions the nationality as Spanish. Checking the 'nationality' column for the same row (row 8), it indeed says \"spanish\".\n\nThe order is specified as \"cardinal - deacon\". In the 'order' column of row 8, it states \"cardinal - deacon\", which matches.\n\nPutting this together: The title in question corresponds to a Spanish national who holds the order of cardinal-deacon. Therefore, the claim aligns with the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"nationality\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"order\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"cardinal - deacon have the title of deacon of s lorenzo in lucina\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that cardinals who are deacons have a specific title: \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" So I need to check if any cardinal with the order \"cardinal - deacon\" has this exact title.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column for \"order,\" which includes entries like \"cardinal - bishop,\" \"cardinal - priest,\" and \"cardinal - deacon.\" The other relevant columns are \"title\" and \"elevator.\"\n\nI'll go through each row to find any cardinals with the order \"cardinal - deacon.\" \n\nRow 0: Rinaldo Conti de Segni is a cardinal - bishop, so not applicable.\nRow 1: Romano Bonaventura is also a cardinal - bishop.\nRow 2: Goffredo da Castiglione is another cardinal - bishop.\nRow 3: Tommaso da Capua is a cardinal - priest.\nRow 4: Stefano de Normandis dei Conti is a cardinal - priest.\nRow 5: Giovanni Colonna is a cardinal - priest.\nRow 6: Sinibaldo Fieschi is a cardinal - priest. His title is \"title of s lorenzo in lucina,\" but his order is priest, not deacon, so this doesn't fit the claim.\nRow 7: Rainiero Capocci is a cardinal - deacon. His title is \"deacon of s maria in cosmedin.\"\nRow 8: Gil Torres is a cardinal - deacon. His title is \"deacon of ss cosma e damiano.\"\nRow 9: Riccardo Annibaldi is a cardinal - deacon. Title is \"deacon of s angelo in pescheria.\"\nRow 10: Robert Somercotes is a cardinal - deacon. Title is \"deacon of s eustachio.\"\n\nNone of the cardinals with the order \"cardinal - deacon\" have the title \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" The only person with that title is Sinibaldo Fieschi, who is a cardinal - priest.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because no cardinal-deacon has that specific title.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that cardinals of the order \"cardinal - deacon\" have the title \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\" Reviewing each row:\n\n- The relevant rows are those where the \"order\" column is \"cardinal - deacon.\"\n- Checking these rows, none have the title \"deacon of s lorenzo in lucina.\"\n\nThus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\":  \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"order\"},\n     {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
