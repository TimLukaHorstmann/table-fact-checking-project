This seems relevant.\n- Other entries for Bellevue include stations like bellevue transit center, east main, south bellevue, etc., but none mention a hospital except this one.\n\nSo, there's at least one station in Bellevue named \"hospital.\" Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cell is row index 25 with column name \"station\" since it directly mentions the hospital station in Bellevue.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"station\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about one of the entries in the table. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It looks like each row represents a station with several attributes: station name, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening year, whether it has a park and ride, and if it's funded by ST2. \n\nThe claim in question is: \"the redondo  / star lake station be fund by st2\". So, I need to check two things: does the station named Redondo/Star Lake exist in the table? And if so, is it funded by ST2?\n\nLooking through the table rows one by one. Let's see:\n\n1. The first row is about Boeing Access Road station.\n2. Next is Jackson Park.\n3. Then Shoreline.\n4. Mountlake Terrace.\n5. Lynnwood.\n6. Alderwood.\n7. 164th / Ash Way.\n8. Everett Station.\n9. Highline Community College.\n10. Redondo/Star Lake \u2013 there it is!\n\nSo, row index 9 (since indexing starts at 0) has the station name \"redondo  / star lake\". Now, I need to check the 'funded by st2' column for this row.\n\nLooking at that specific cell in row 9 under 'funded by st2', it says \"yes\". That means the Redondo/Star Lake station is indeed funded by ST2. Therefore, the claim is correct.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything else, I'll double-check if there are other rows with similar names or details that might affect the conclusion. But in this case, row 9 is the only one mentioning Redondo/Star Lake, and it clearly states \"yes\" for ST2 funding.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that the redondo / star lake station is funded by ST2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"station\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"funded by st2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: station, extension, city/neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, funded by st2. So each row represents a station with various details.\n\nThe claim is about \"overlake village\" having one park and ride project proposed. To check this, I need to find any rows where the station is overlake village and see if the 'park and ride' column for that row is marked as yes or no.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll scan each row's 'station' column until I find \"overlake village\". Let me go down the list:\n\n- The first few stations are Boeing access road, Jackson park, Shoreline, etc. None of these match.\n- Continuing down, I see entries like Highline Community College, Redondo/Star Lake, Federal Way Transit Center... still no.\n- Then there's a station named \"overlake village\" in the row with index 23 (assuming rows start at 0).

Let me double-check:\n\nThe table has rows up to \"se redmond\" which is the last one. So, the overlake village station is at row index 21.\n\nNow, checking the 'park and ride' column for that row. The claim says there's a park and ride proposed for overlake village. Let me see what the cell says.\n\nLooking at row 21: the columns are:\n\nstation: overlake village\n\nextension: east link\n\ncity/neighborhood: overlake\n\nprojected opening: 2021\n\npark and ride: yes\n\nfunded by st2: yes\n\nSo, the 'park and ride' is marked as \"yes\" for overlake village.\n\nTherefore, there is indeed a park and ride project proposed for overlake village. Since it's only one station mentioned in the claim, and this row shows that it has a park and ride, the claim is TRUE.\n\nAdditionally, I should check if there are any other rows with overlake village or related entries. But looking through, the next row (22) is \"overlake transit center\" which might be another project but isn't named as overlake village. So only one entry for overlake village exists in the table, and it has a park and ride.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"overlake village have 1 park and ride project propose.\" From the table, there's exactly one row for \"overlake village\" with 'park and ride' as yes.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"station\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"1 neighborhood doesn't have a station proposed at a hospital\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there is one neighborhood where no station has been proposed at a hospital. So, I need to check each row in the table to see if any station is named \"hospital\" and then look at its corresponding city or neighborhood.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n1. The first few stations don't mention hospitals.\n2. Scanning down, I find a station named \"hospital\" located in \"bellevue\". So, Bellevue has a proposed station at a hospital.\n3. However, the claim is about a neighborhood that doesn't have such a station. Since Bellevue does have one, we need to see if any other neighborhoods don't have this.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"1 neighborhood,\" implying there's exactly one. Let me check all rows for stations named \"hospital.\" Only the row with index 23 has a station named \"hospital\" in Bellevue. All other neighborhoods (like Tukwila, Shoreline, Lynnwood, etc.) don't have a station at a hospital.\n\nSo, the claim is saying that exactly one neighborhood doesn't have a hospital station. But since most neighborhoods don't have any hospital stations except Bellevue, it's not accurate to say only one neighborhood lacks this. Therefore, the claim might be FALSE because multiple neighborhoods don't have a hospital station proposed.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The claim says \"1 neighborhood doesn't have,\" but actually, Bellevue does have a hospital station, so other neighborhoods without any station at a hospital would mean there's more than one such neighborhood. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Bellevue has a hospital station (row 23). Other neighborhoods do not have stations named \"hospital,\" indicating multiple neighborhoods don't have such stations.

It states that there's one park and ride that hasn't been proposed for Overlake Village. So, I'm looking for a station in Overlake Village where the \"park and ride\" column says \"no.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find any entries related to Overlake Village.\n\nI see two rows with \"overlake village\" under the city/neighborhood column:\n\n1. The first one is \"overlake village\" in the east link extension. It has a projected opening of 2021 and park and ride marked as yes.\n2. The second row is \"overlake transit center,\" also in the east link, same opening year, and also park and ride is yes.\n\nWait, that's two entries for Overlake Village, both with park and ride as yes. So neither of them hasn't been proposed; both have park and rides.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The claim says \"1 park and ride haven't be[n] propose[d]\"\u2014so is it saying there's one that hasn't been proposed? Or that none have?\n\nWait, the wording might be a bit off. It says \"1 park and ride haven't been proposed for overlake village.\" That could mean that out of possibly multiple, one hasn't been proposed. But in the table, both stations in Overlake Village have park and rides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's saying that zero park and rides haven't been proposed\u2014meaning they've all been proposed. Since both are yes, there aren't any that haven't been proposed. So if the claim is asserting that 1 hasn't been proposed, but actually none haven't, then the claim would be FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is mistyped and meant to say \"no park and rides have been proposed,\" which would also be false because both are yes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all rows for Overlake Village. Are there any rows where city/neighborhood includes Overlake Village and park and ride is no? From what I can see, both entries have park and ride as yes.\n\nTherefore, the claim that 1 park and ride hasn't been proposed is FALSE because in reality, all proposed stations for Overlake Village include a park and ride.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that one park and ride hasn't been proposed for Overlake Village. However, examining the table, both stations associated with Overlake Village have \"yes\" under the \"park and ride\" column. This means there are no park and rides that haven't been proposed; hence, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look for rows where the city/neighborhood is \"overlake village.\"\n2. **Check Park and Ride Status:** For each of these rows, check if \"park and ride\" is \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n3. **Evaluate Claim:** The claim suggests there's at least one park and ride not proposed. Since both entries have \"yes,\" the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"overlake have a propose station of bellevue transit center , an extension of east link , and a propose parking and ride.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim into its components:\n1. Overlake has a proposed station named Bellevue Transit Center.\n2. This station is part of the East Link extension.\n3. There's a proposed parking and ride at this station.\n\nNow, I'll look through the table to verify each point.\n\nLooking for \"Bellevue Transit Center\" in the 'station' column:\n- Scanning down, I find two entries: one at row 16 (row index 15 if starting from 0) which is \"bellevue transit center\". The extension is East Link, so that's correct. \n\nNext, check for parking and ride ('park and ride'):\n- For the row with station \"bellevue transit center\", the 'park and ride' column says \"no\". That means there isn't a proposed parking and ride at this station, which contradicts part 3 of the claim.\n\nAdditionally, checking if \"overlake\" is associated with this station:\n- The table has stations in Overlake (rows 21 to 24), but \"bellevue transit center\" is under Bellevue, not Overlake. So the first part of the claim that Overlake has this station might be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. The claim says \"overlake have a propose station of bellevue transit center\". But according to the table, \"bellevue transit center\" is in downtown Bellevue, not Overlake. That's another discrepancy.\n\nSo, points 1 and 3 are not fully supported:\n- Station exists (point 1) but it's in Bellevue, not Overlake.\n- Extension is East Link (point 2), which matches.\n- Parking and ride is 'no' (point 3 fails).\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported because both the location and parking/ride aspects are incorrect. The relevant cells include the row for \"bellevue transit center\" in station, extension, park and ride, and any Overlake entries to check if they have a proposed parking.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't list an Overlake station named Bellevue Transit Center; that's under Bellevue. So the claim incorrectly associates it with Overlake and also says there is parking/ride, which isn't true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Overlake has a proposed station named Bellevue Transit Center as part of the East Link extension with parking and ride facilities. However, according to the table:\n\n1. **Bellevue Transit Center** is listed under the city/neighborhood \"downtown bellevue,\" not Overlake.\n2. The extension for this station is indeed **East Link**, which aligns with the claim's second part.\n3. The 'park and ride' column for Bellevue Transit Center is marked as **no**, contradicting the third part of the claim.\n\nAdditionally, checking for any Overlake stations in the table:\n- There are stations like \"overlake village\" and \"overlake transit center,\" but neither has a parking and ride option listed. \n\nThus, the claim's first and third parts are not supported by the data, making the overall statement FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"station\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"extension\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"park and ride\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the se redmond station be fund by st2\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim mentions \"se redmond station,\" which I assume is a specific station listed in the table. The second part talks about being \"fund by st2.\" From looking at the table headers, there's a column named \"funded by st2,\" so that must be relevant.\n\nNext, I'll scan through the table to find the row corresponding to the \"se redmond\" station. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Boeing access road - not it.\n2. Jackson park - nope.\n3. Shoreline - no.\n4. Mountlake terrace - no.\n5. Lynnwood - no.\n6. Alderwood - no.\n7. 164th / ash way - no.\n8. Everett station - no.\n9. Highline community college - no.\n10. Redondo / star lake - no.\n11. Federal way transit center - no.\n12. South federal way - no.\n13. Port of tacoma / fife - no.\n14. Rainier - no.\n15. Mercer island - no.\n16. South bellevue - no.\n17. East main - no.\n18. Bellevue transit center - no.\n19. Hospital - no.\n20. 120th - no.\n21. 130th - no.\n22. Overlake village - no.\n23. Overlake transit center - no.\n24. Se redmond - yes, that's the one.\n\nSo the row for \"se redmond\" is at index 24 (assuming counting starts from 0). Now, looking at the columns in this row: station, extension, city / neighborhood, projected opening, park and ride, funded by st2.\n\nThe claim is about whether it's funded by ST2. The relevant column here is \"funded by st2.\" Let me check that cell for the se redmond station. According to the table, under \"funded by st2,\" it says \"no.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim states that it is funded by ST2, but the table shows otherwise. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also note the relevant cells that were checked. The row index for se redmond is 24 (if starting from 0) or perhaps 23 if counting starts at 1. Wait, looking back, in the table provided, each line after the header is a new station. Let me recount:\n\nThe rows start from the third line of the markdown table as the first data row. So \"boeing access road\" is row index 0. Then each subsequent station increments the index by 1. The last row is \"se redmond,\" which would be at index 24 (since there are 25 rows after the header). \n\nWait, but in markdown tables, sometimes the first data row is considered row 0 or row 1? In programming, indices usually start at 0. So if we count from 0, \"boeing access road\" is 0, then each next station increments by 1. So \"se redmond\" would be the last entry, which is row index 24.\n\nBut looking at the user's example, they used row_index: 0 for the first data row, so I should follow that convention. Thus, se redmond is at row_index: 24.\n\nSo the relevant cell is in column \"funded by st2\" at row 24.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the \"se redmond\" station's \"funded by st2\" field shows \"no.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"funded by st2\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
