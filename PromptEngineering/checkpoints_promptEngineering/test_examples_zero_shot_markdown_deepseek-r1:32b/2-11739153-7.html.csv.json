    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the score was the same on February 27 and February 29.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what's in the table. It looks like each row represents a game with details such as date, visitor team, score, home team, decision (maybe the goalie or coach?), attendance, and record. The relevant columns here are \"date\" and \"score.\"\n\nThe claim is about two specific dates: February 27 and February 29. I need to check what the scores were on those days.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For February 27, I scan through each row's date until I find that date. Let me go row by row.\n\nRow indices are from 0 to 13. \n\nRow 0: february 2 - not relevant.\nRow 1: february 5 - nope.\nRow 2: feb 7 - nope.\nRow 3: feb 9 - nope.\nRow 4: feb 10 - no.\nRow 5: feb 12 - no.\nRow 6: feb 14 - no.\nRow 7: feb 17 - no.\nRow 8: feb 19 - no.\nRow 9: feb 20 - no.\nRow 10: feb 24 - nope.\nRow 11: feb 26 - not yet. Wait, row 11 is feb 26, so next row is 12.\n\nRow 12: date is February 27. The score here is listed as \"3 - 2.\" So on Feb 27, the score was 3-2.\n\nNow, looking for February 29. I continue scanning after February 27.\n\nThe next rows are:\nRow 13: feb 29, which is our target date. The score here is \"3 - 2.\"\n\nSo both dates have a score of 3-2. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because the scores were the same on those two days.\n\nTo make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check:\n\n- February 27: Score is 3-2.\n- February 29: Score is also 3-2.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the relevant cells are the \"score\" column for both February 27 and February 29.\n\nSo the relevant_cells would be row_index 12 (Feb 27) with column_name \"score,\" and row_index 13 (Feb 29) also with column_name \"score.\"\n\nWait, let me confirm the row indices again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The table starts at index 0 for February 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- Feb 2 is row 0\n- Feb 5: 1\n- Feb7:2\n- Feb9:3\n- Feb10:4\n- Feb12:5\n- Feb14:6\n- Feb17:7\n- Feb19:8\n- Feb20:9\n- Feb24:10\n- Feb26:11\n- Feb27:12\n- Feb29:13\n\nYes, correct. So row 12 is Feb 27 and row 13 is Feb 29.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE, with those two cells marked as relevant.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

The claim says: \"during the 2007-08 minnesota wild season, the score on february 10 and february 24 be 2 - 1\".\n\nFirst, let me check if the table corresponds to that specific season. I notice all the entries are in February, but the years aren't explicitly stated. However, given the context of the claim mentioning the \"2007-08\" season, I'll assume this is the correct table.\n\nNow, looking at the table, each row has a date and a score. I need to find the rows for February 10 and February 24 and check their scores.\n\nStarting with February 10:\nLooking through the dates, I see \"february 10\" on the fifth row (row index 4, since counting starts at 0). The score column shows \"2 - 1\". So that's correct for February 10.\n\nNext, February 24:\nI scan down to find \"february 24\", which is in row index 10. Checking the score, it says \"2 - 1\" as well. That matches the claim too.\n\nWait a second, I should double-check if there are any other rows with those dates just in case. But looking through all the entries, only one February 10 and one February 24 are present, both showing a score of 2-1.\n\nSo, both specified dates have the score as claimed. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on February 10 and February 24 during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the scores were 2-1. Checking the table:\n\n- For February 10: The score is listed as \"2 - 1\" (row index 4).\n- For February 24: The score is also listed as \"2 - 1\" (row index 10).\n\nBoth dates match the claimed scores.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me check its details:\n   - Visitor: minnesota\n   - Home: edmonton\n   - Decision: harding\n\n- Next, for February 20: Checking the table again.\n- The ninth row (row index 8 if counting from 0?)

Let me check the data:\n\nThe table has 14 rows. Wait no, looking at it:\n\nFrom february 2 to february 29, each date is a row.\n\nCounting from top:\n\nRow indices 0-13.\n\nLooking for February 12 and February 20.\n\nFebruary 12: Looking through the 'date' column.\n\n- Row index 5: feb 12\nDecision: harding\n\nFebruary 20: Checking each date until I find it. Let me see:\n\nRow6: feb14, row7: feb17, row8: feb19, row9: feb20.\n\nSo row index 9 is feb20.\n\nIn that row, the decision is harding as well.\n\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\nLooking back at row5 (feb12): visitor minnesota, home edmonton, score 2-4. Decision is harding.\n\nRow9: february 20, visitor minnesota, home chicago, score 0-3. Decision is harding.\n\nSo both decisions are 'harding' for these two dates.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because both matches on February 12 and February 20 had the same decision (harding).\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n\nFor feb12: row5, column 'decision'\n\nFor feb20: row9, column 'decision'\n\nSo in JSON, relevant_cells will be two objects with their respective row indices and column name as \"decision\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season, minnesota play home 2 times less than they play away.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. The team in question is the Minnesota Wild. They have a certain number of home games and away games during the specified season. The claim suggests that their home games are two fewer than their away games.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. There's a column called \"visitor\" which indicates the opposing team visiting Minnesota, and the \"home\" column shows where the game was played. If \"minnesota\" is listed under \"visitor,\" it means they were playing away; conversely, if \"minnesota\" is in the \"home\" column, it means they were hosting a game.\n\nSo, I'll go through each row to count how many times Minnesota was at home and how many times they played away. Let's start counting:\n\n1. **February 2**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Columbus. So this is an away game for Minnesota.\n2. **February 5**: Visitor is Detroit, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n3. **February 7**: Visitor is Dallas, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n4. **February 9**: Visitor is NY Islanders, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n5. **February 10**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is St. Louis. Away game.\n6. **February 12**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Edmonton. Away game.\n7. **February 14**: Visitor is Calgary, Home is Vancouver. Wait, no, the home is Minnesota? No, looking back: Visitor is Minnesota, so it's an away game in Vancouver. So February 14:Visitor is Calgary, but wait, let me double-check that row.\n\nWait, the table shows for February 14:\n\n- date: february 14\n- visitor: calgary\n- score: 2 - 1\n- home: minnesota\n\nSo actually, this is a home game for Minnesota. So February 14 is a home game.\n\nContinuing:\n\n8. **February 17**: Visitor is Nashville, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n9. **February 19**: Visitor is Vancouver, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n10. **February 20**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Chicago. Away game.\n11. **February 24**: Visitor is Calgary, Home is Minnesota. Home game.\n12. **February 26**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Washington. Wait, no: Looking at the table, February 26's home is Washington? Let me check:\n\nWait, the row for February 26 shows:\n\n- visitor: minnesota\n- score: 1 -4\n- home: washington\n\nSo this is an away game.\n\n13. **February 27**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Tampa Bay. Away game.\n14. **February 29**: Visitor is Minnesota, Home is Florida. Away game.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier with February 14. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Feb 2 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow 1: Feb5 - home minnesota (home)\nRow 2: Feb7 - home minnesota (home)\nRow3: Feb9 - home minnesota (home)\nRow4: Feb10 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow5: Feb12 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow6: Feb14 - visitor calgary, home minnesota (home)\nRow7: Feb17 - visitor nashville, home minnesota (home)\nRow8: Feb19 - visitor vancouver, home minnesota (home)\nRow9: Feb20 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow10: Feb24 - visitor calgary, home minnesota (home)\nRow11: Feb26 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow12: Feb27 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow13: Feb29 - visitor minnesota (away)\n\nSo now, counting home games:\n\nRows where \"home\" is Minnesota: rows 1,2,3,6,7,8,10. That's 7 home games.\n\nAway games are the rest: rows 0,4,5,9,11,12,13. Also 7 away games.\n\nWait, that's 7 home and 7 away? But the claim says they played home two times less than away, meaning home = away - 2. So if away is A, home is A-2.\n\nIn our count, both are equal at 7. Therefore, the claim would be false because they have the same number of home and away games, not differing by two.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's recount:\n\nHome games (rows where \"home\" is Minnesota):\n\nRow1: Feb5 - home\nRow2: Feb7 - home\nRow3: Feb9 - home\nRow6: Feb14 - home\nRow7: Feb17 - home\nRow8: Feb19 - home\nRow10: Feb24 - home\n\nThat's 7.\n\nAway games (rows where \"visitor\" is Minnesota):\n\nRow0: Feb2\nRow4: Feb10\nRow5: Feb12\nRow9: Feb20\nRow11: Feb26\nRow12: Feb27\nRow13: Feb29\n\nThat's also 7.\n\nSo total games are 14. Wait, but the table only has 14 rows? Let me check:\n\nFrom row 0 to row13, that's 14 rows. So 7 home and 7 away.\n\nBut the claim says home is two less than away. If they played 7 home and 9 away, then home = away -2. But in this case, it's equal.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false. The number of home games equals the number of away games, not differing by two.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each row again carefully.\n\nRow0: Feb2 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow1: Feb5 - home minnesota (home)\nRow2: Feb7 - home minnesota (home)\nRow3: Feb9 - home minnesota (home)\nRow4: Feb10 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow5: Feb12 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow6: Feb14 - visitor calgary, home minnesota (home)\nRow7: Feb17 - visitor nashville, home minnesota (home)\nRow8: Feb19 - visitor vancouver, home minnesota (home)\nRow9: Feb20 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow10: Feb24 - visitor calgary, home minnesota (home)\nRow11: Feb26 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow12: Feb27 - visitor minnesota (away)\nRow13: Feb29 - visitor minnesota (away)\n\nYes, that's 7 home and 7 away. So the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \"play home two times less.\" Maybe it means they played at home half as many times as away. But if away is A, then home would be A/2. If A=9, home would be 4.5, which isn't possible. Alternatively, the phrasing could mean they played two fewer home games than away, so H = A -2.\n\nIn our case, H =7 and A=7, so H is not less by two. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows 14 games for Minnesota: 7 home and 7 away. The claim states they played 2 fewer home games than away, which isn't accurate.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"is_claim_true\": false,\n    \"home_games_count\": 7,\n    \"away_games_count\": 7,\n    \"difference\": 0\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim first: \"during the 2007-08 minnesota wild season, minnesota lose by more than 2 on february 27 and february 29.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check which rows correspond to February 27 and February 29. Looking at the 'date' column:\n\n- February 27 is in row index 13 (since counting starts from 0). The score for that game is 3-2, with Minnesota as the home team. They scored 3, and the opponent, Tampa Bay, scored 2. So, the difference is 1 goal.\n\n- February 29 is in row index 14.

The claim states: \"During the 2007 - 08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision be backstrom 11 times more than it be harding.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems to compare how many times Backstrom and Harding made decisions (probably as goalies making saves or decisions in games) during that season. The claim suggests that Backstrom had 11 more decisions than Harding.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll need to check each row for the 'decision' column, which likely indicates who made the decision in that game. Each row corresponds to a game played by the Minnesota Wild in February of what appears to be the 2007-08 season based on the dates provided (february 2 to february 29).\n\nLet's go through each row and count how many times Backstrom and Harding are listed under 'decision':\n\n1. Row 0: decision is backstrom \u2192 +1 for Backstrom\n2. Row 1: backstrom \u2192 +1 \u2192 Total: 2\n3. Row 2: backstrom \u2192 Total: 3\n4. Row 3: backstrom \u2192 Total: 4\n5.

Row 13: backstrom \u2192 Backstrom: 11\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- Backstrom appears in rows 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,10,11,12,13 \u2192 that's 11 times.\n- Harding appears in rows 4,5,9 \u2192 that's 3 times.\n\nSo Backstrom has 11 decisions, and Harding has 3. The claim says Backstrom was the decision-maker 11 times more than Harding. \n\nCalculating 11 (Backstrom) minus 3 (Harding) equals 8. So Backstrom had 8 more decisions than Harding, not 11. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating a difference of 11 instead of 8.\n\nAlternatively, if \"11 times more\" is interpreted as 11 multiplied by Harding's count (which would be 3), that would mean Backstrom should have 33 decisions, which isn't the case. So either way, the claim doesn't hold true based on the table data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to check if both of these games have the same score.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find the rows corresponding to February 12 and February 20.\n\nStarting with February 12:\n- Scanning through each row by date, I see a row for \"february 12\". The visitor is Edmonton, home team is Minnesota. The score column says \"2 - 4\". So, Minnesota scored 2 goals, and Edmonton scored 4.\n\nNext, checking February 20:\n- Looking further down the table, there's a row for \"february 20\". Here, the visitor is Chicago, and the home team is Minnesota. The score is listed as \"0 - 3\".\n\nNow, comparing both scores:\n- February 12: Minnesota (home) vs Edmonton (visitor) \u2013 Score 2-4\n- February 20: Chicago (visitor) vs Minnesota (home) \u2013 Score 0-3\n\nWait a minute. The claim says both matches have the same score. However, looking at these two games:\n- On February 12, the score was 2 - 4 in favor of Edmonton.\n- On February 20, the score was 0 - 3 in favor of Chicago.\n\nThese scores are different: 2-4 vs 0-3. Therefore, the claim that both matches have the same score is incorrect.\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed anything, let me double-check each relevant cell:\n- For February 12: row index 5 (assuming counting starts at 0), column 'score' shows \"2 - 4\".\n- For February 20: row index 9, column 'score' shows \"0 - 3\".\n\nNo other rows have these dates, so I can confirm that the scores are indeed different.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"during the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the difference in the score on February 10 and February 24 be more than 2.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the dates mentioned in the claim: February 10 and February 24. I need to find the corresponding rows in the table for these dates.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For February 10: The row has visitor as minnesota, home as st louis, score 2 - 1.\n- For February 24: Visitor is calgary, home is minnesota, score 2 - 1.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFebruary 10 entry:\nVisitor: minnesota\nHome: st louis\nScore: 2 - 1 (visitor's score first)\nSo, the visitor (minnesota) scored 2, home (st louis) scored 1. So the difference is 2-1=1.\n\nFebruary 24 entry:\nVisitor: calgary\nHome: minnesota\nScore: 2 - 1 (visitor's score first)\nSo, visitor (calgary) scored 2, home (minnesota) scored 1. Difference is 2-1=1.\n\nWait, that seems odd because both scores are 2-1 with a difference of 1 each time. But I need to calculate the difference in their scores on those two days. So, what's the claim? It says whether the difference in the score (I think it means the points difference) on Feb 10 and Feb 24 is more than 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. The claim might be about the difference between the two games' scores. Let me clarify: \"the difference in the score on february 10 and february 24 be more than 2.\" So, maybe it's comparing the two game scores.\n\nSo for Feb 10: minnesota scored 2 points (visitor), st louis scored 1 point. The difference for that game is 2-1=+1 for minnesota.\n\nFor Feb 24: visitor calgary scored 2, home minnesota scored 1. So the difference is 2-1=+1 for calgary. Wait, but I think we need to see if the scores themselves differ by more than 2 points when comparing both games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking about the score in each game and whether either of them had a difference greater than 2.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"the difference in the score on february 10 and february 24 be more than 2.\" So, I think it's comparing the scores of those two games, not within each game.\n\nSo, what was the score for Feb 10: minnesota (visitor) vs st louis (home): 2-1. So, minnesota won by 1 point.\n\nFeb 24: calgary (visitor) vs minnesota (home): 2-1. Calgary won by 1 point.\n\nSo, in both games, the score difference was 1 point each. Now, is the claim talking about whether each game's score difference is more than 2? Or if one of them has a difference more than 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the overall attendance or something else. Wait no, the columns are date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record.\n\nThe claim mentions \"difference in the score,\" so that likely refers to the points difference in each game. So, in Feb 10, the difference was +1 (minnesota won by 1), and on Feb 24, the difference was +1 for calgary. So both differences are 1.\n\nBut wait, another interpretation: perhaps it's asking if the score of one game minus the other is more than 2. Like, if you subtract the scores or something. But that seems less likely because each game has two scores (visitor and home).\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking at the overall points for minnesota across both games compared to their opponents. Let me check:\n\nFeb 10: minnesota scored 2\nFeb 24: minnesota scored 1\nTotal for minnesota: 3\n\nOpponents:\nFeb 10: st louis scored 1\nFeb 24: calgary scored 2\nTotal: 3\n\nSo the difference is zero. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the goals or points difference in each game, whether either of them had a difference more than 2. So, in Feb 10, minnesota won by 1 goal, and in Feb 24, calgary won by 1 goal. Both differences are less than or equal to 2.\n\nSo if the claim is that the difference in each score was more than 2, then it's false because both were only 1 point difference. If the claim is that the combined difference is more than 2, perhaps adding the two differences (each +1) would be 2, which is not more than 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The scores are 2-1 on Feb 10 and 2-1 on Feb 24. So each game had a difference of 1, so the total difference across both games is 2, but that's still not more than 2.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about whether in either of those two dates, the score difference was more than 2. In that case, since both were only 1 point difference, the answer would be no, so the claim is false.\n\nSo based on this, I think the difference in each game's score (Feb 10 and Feb 24) was only 1, which is not more than 2. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the difference in the scores on February 10 and February 24 was more than 2 points. Looking at the table:\n\n- On February 10, the score was 2-1 (difference of 1).\n- On February 24, the score was 2-1 (difference of 1).\n\nThe difference in each game's score is 1 point, which is not more than 2. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"during the 2007 - 08 minnesota wild season, minnesota play at home more time than they play away\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Minnesota played more games at home than away during the specified season.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game, with details like date, visitor, score, home team, etc. The \"home\" column indicates where the game was played. So, when \"minnesota\" appears in the \"home\" column, it means they were playing at home; otherwise, if they are listed under \"visitor\", they were away.\n\nLet me go through each row and count how many times Minnesota was at home versus away.\n\n1. February 2: Visitor is Minnesota, so they played away.\n2. February 5: Home is Minnesota, so they played at home.\n3. February 7: Home is Minnesota, another home game.\n4. February 9: Home is Minnesota, third home game.\n5. February 10: Visitor is Minnesota, away again.\n6. February 12: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\n7. February 14: Home is Minnesota, fourth home game.\n8. February 17: Home is Minnesota, fifth home game.\n9. February 19: Home is Minnesota, sixth home game.\n10. February 20: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\n11. February 24: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\n12. February 26: Visitor is Minnesota, away.\n13. February 27: Home is Minnesota, seventh home game.\n14. February 29: Home is Minnesota, eighth home game.\n\nWait a second, that doesn't seem right because when I count again:\n\n- Home games for Minnesota: Let's see the rows where \"home\" is Minnesota:\n   Rows 1 (Feb5), 2 (Feb7), 3 (Feb9), 6 (Feb14), 7 (Feb17), 8 (Feb19), 12 (Feb27), 13 (Feb29). That's 8 home games.\n\n- Away games: Rows where \"visitor\" is Minnesota. Let me check:\n   Row0 (Feb2), row4 (Feb10), row5 (Feb12), row9 (Feb20), row10 (Feb24), row11 (Feb26). That's 6 away games.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total number of games should add up to all rows. Let me recount.\n\nTotal rows: 14 games.\n\nCounting home games:\n\n- Feb5: home\n- Feb7: home\n- Feb9: home\n- Feb14: home\n- Feb17: home\n- Feb19: home\n- Feb27: home\n- Feb29: home\n\nThat's 8 home games.\n\nAway games (visitor is Minnesota):\n\n- Feb2: away\n- Feb10: away\n- Feb12: away\n- Feb20: away\n- Feb24: away\n- Feb26: away\n\nThat's 6 away games. So total games played would be 8 + 6 = 14, which matches the number of rows.\n\nSo, according to this, Minnesota played more home games (8) than away games (6). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let's list each game:\n\nRow 0: Visitor MN \u2192 Away\nRow1: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow2: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow3: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow4: Visitor MN \u2192 Away\nRow5: Visitor MN \u2192 Away\nRow6: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow7: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow8: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow9: Visitor MN \u2192 Away\nRow10: Visitor MN \u2192 Away\nRow11: Visitor MN \u2192 Away\nRow12: Home MN \u2192 Home\nRow13: Home MN \u2192 Home\n\nSo, home games are in rows 1,2,3,6,7,8,12,13 \u2192 8 games.\nAway games are rows0,4,5,9,10,11 \u2192 6 games.\n\nYes, that's correct.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"During the 2007-08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision be harding more time than it be backstrom.\" Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like the claim is about whether Harding made more decisions (i.e., was the goaltender who got the win or loss) than Backstrom during that season according to the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, decision, attendance, and record. The 'decision' column probably indicates which goalie made the save percentage or was responsible for the outcome of the game, either a win or loss.\n\nSo my task is to count how many times Harding and Backstrom are listed under the 'decision' column. Then compare those counts to see if Harding appears more often than Backstrom.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. February 2: Decision is Backstrom.\n2. February 5: Backstrom again.\n3. February 7: Backstrom.\n4. February 9: Backstrom.\n5. February 10: Harding here.\n6. February 12: Harding.\n7. February 14: Backstrom.\n8. February 17: Backstrom.\n9. February 19: Backstrom.\n10. February 20: Harding.\n11. February 24: Backstrom.\n12. February 26: Backstrom.\n13. February 27: Backstrom.\n14. February 29: Backstrom.\n\nNow, let's tally the decisions:\n\n- Backstrom: Let's count how many times he appears. From rows 0 to 13, looking at each decision:\n   Rows 0 (Back), 1 (Back), 2 (Back), 3 (Back), then row 4 is Harding, row5 is Harding, row6 is Back, row7 (Back), row8 (Back), row9 (Harding), row10 (Back), row11 (Back), row12 (Back), row13 (Back). So counting all the Backstroms: rows 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,10,11,12,13. That's 11 times.\n\n- Harding appears in rows 4,5,9: that's three times.\n\nSo according to this table, Backstrom made the decision 11 times and Harding only 3 times. Therefore, Harding did not make more decisions than Backstrom; rather, it was the opposite.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because Harding was the decision-maker fewer times than Backstrom.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n   ]\n}",
