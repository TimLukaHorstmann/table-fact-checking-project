    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about Vit\u00f3ria airport being the most crowded at 222.5% capacity is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure. The columns are rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. There are 15 rows, each representing a different airport with its respective data.\n\nThe claim states that Vit\u00f3ria airport is the most crowded, operating at 222.5% capacity. To verify this, I'll focus on two things: whether the capacity percentage for Vit\u00f3ria is indeed 222.5%, and whether that's the highest among all listed airports.\n\nLooking at the table, I find Vit\u00f3ria in row index 14 (since counting starts from 0). The 'capacity in use' column shows 222.5% for Vit\u00f3ria. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nNow, to check if it's the most crowded, I need to compare this percentage with all other airports listed. Scanning through each row:\n\n- S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 1): 113.4%\n- Another S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 2): 78.4%\n- Bras\u00edlia: 134.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro entries: 40.2% and 152.7%\n- Salvador: 69.1%\n- Porto Alegre: 52.7%\n- Belo Horizonte: 213.0%\n- Recife: 63.5%\n- Curitiba: 81.2%\n- Fortaleza: 77.3%\n- Florian\u00f3polis: 125.7%\n- Manaus: 75.4%\n- Bel\u00e9m: 49.3%\n\nComparing all these, the highest capacity in use is indeed 222.5% for Vit\u00f3ria, which is higher than Belo Horizonte's 213.0%. So, based on this data, the claim holds true.\n\nI should also ensure that I'm not missing any other airport with a higher percentage, but from my scan, none exceed 222.5%. Therefore, the relevant cell to support this is row index 14 under 'capacity in use'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies Vit\u00f3ria as having the highest capacity usage at 222.5%.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"none of the airports on the list have seen a decrease in use\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states that all airports listed in the table have not experienced any decrease in their usage. So, I need to check if any airport has a negative annual change percentage because that would indicate a decrease.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an airport with its rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. The column \"annual change\" shows the percentage increase or decrease in passenger numbers from one year to the next.\n\nI'll go through each row's \"annual change\" value:\n\n1. S\u00e3o Paulo (row 0): 12.8% - Increase\n2. S\u00e3o Paulo (row 1): 11.7% - Increase\n3. Bras\u00edlia: 45.1% - Increase\n4. Rio de Janeiro: 30.4% - Increase\n5. Rio de Janeiro: 9.2% - Increase\n6.

The task is to determine whether the given claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport , and both of them have 1 run under capacity and 1 running over.\" So, the main points are:\n1. S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the only locations with two airports each.\n2. For each of these cities, one airport is operating under its capacity (capacity in use < 100%), and the other is operating over capacity (capacity in use > 100%).\n\nNow, let's examine the table provided. The table lists various locations along with their total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use.\n\nLooking at the 'location' column:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo appears twice, which means it has two airports.\n- Rio de Janeiro also appears twice, indicating two airports there as well.\n\nOther locations like Bras\u00edlia, Salvador, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Florian\u00f3polis, Manaus, Bel\u00e9m, and Vit\u00f3ria each have only one entry. So, the first part of the claim is correct: S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are the only locations with two airports.\n\nNext, I need to check if each city has one airport under capacity and another over capacity.\n\nFor S\u00e3o Paulo:\n- The first entry (row 0) shows a capacity in use of 113.4%, which is above 100%.\n- The second entry (row 1) shows 78.4%, which is below 100%. \n\nSo, S\u00e3o Paulo has one airport over capacity and another under.\n\nFor Rio de Janeiro:\n- The third entry (row 3) shows a capacity in use of 40.2%, which is under.\n- The fifth entry (row 5) shows 152.7%, which is above.\n\nThus, Rio de Janeiro also has one airport over and one under.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are supported by the data, the answer should be TRUE. \n\nNow, to gather the relevant cells:\n- For S\u00e3o Paulo: rows 0 and 1 in the 'capacity in use' column.\n- For Rio de Janeiro: rows 3 and 5 in the 'capacity in use' column.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at row indices 0,1 (S\u00e3o Paulo) and 3,5 (Rio).

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the most over capacity airport, vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that have see the least annual growth.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\n1. **Most Over Capacity Airport:** This likely refers to the airport with the highest percentage in the 'capacity in use' column. Looking at the table, I need to find which location has the maximum value in that column.\n\n2. **Least Annual Growth:** This would be the airport with the smallest percentage increase in annual change. So, I'll check the 'annual change' column to see which airport has the lowest percentage.\n\nLet me go through the table row by row to gather the necessary data.\n\nLooking at the 'capacity in use' column:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 113.4% and 78.4%\n- Bras\u00edlia: 134.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro: 40.2% and 152.7%\n- Salvador: 69.1%\n- Porto Alegre: 52.7%\n- Belo Horizonte: 213.0%\n- Recife: 63.5%\n- Curitiba: 81.2%\n- Fortaleza: 77.3%\n- Florian\u00f3polis: 125.7%\n- Manaus: 75.4%\n- Bel\u00e9m: 49.3%\n- Vit\u00f3ria: 222.5%\n\nThe highest 'capacity in use' is 222.5% at Vit\u00f3ria (row index 14). So, Vit\u00f3ria is indeed the most over capacity airport.\n\nNext, looking at the 'annual change' column to find the least growth:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo: 12.8%, 11.7%\n- Bras\u00edlia: 45.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro: 30.4%, 9.2%\n- Salvador: 20.0%\n- Porto Alegre: 11.6%\n- Belo Horizonte: 7.5%\n- Recife: 16.1%\n- Curitiba: 13.0%\n- Fortaleza: 24.0%\n- Florian\u00f3polis: 7.8%\n- Manaus: 10.3%\n- Bel\u00e9m: 13.5%\n- Vit\u00f3ria: 6.1%\n\nThe smallest annual change is 6.1% at Vit\u00f3ria (row index 14).

The claim says that \"s\u00e3o paulo and rio de janeiro be the only location to see more than 10000000 passenger pass through their airport.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the claim is stating. It claims that these two cities are the only ones where their airports have handled over 10 million passengers annually.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row for the \"total passengers\" column because that's what determines if a location meets the threshold of more than 10 million passengers.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 1: S\u00e3o Paulo has 13,611,227 passengers. That's over 10 million.\nRow 2: Another entry for S\u00e3o Paulo with 12,940,193 passengers. Also over 10 million.\nRow 3: Bras\u00edlia has 9,926,786 passengers. Just under 10 million, so it doesn't qualify.\nRow 4: Rio de Janeiro has 6,024,930 passengers. That's way below 10 million.\nWait, but the claim mentions Rio de Janeiro as one of the locations with over 10 million. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 5 is another Rio entry with 4,887,306 passengers. Still under 10 million.\nRows after that (6 to 15) have passenger numbers all below 10 million as well.\n\nWait a second, so according to the table, only S\u00e3o Paulo has two entries above 10 million, while Rio de Janeiro's highest is 6 million and 4 million. That means the claim is incorrect because Rio doesn't meet the 10 million threshold, and there are no other locations that do either.\n\nSo the claim states that S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio are the only ones with over 10 million passengers, but in reality, only S\u00e3o Paulo does. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because only S\u00e3o Paulo's airports exceed 10 million passengers, not Rio de Janeiro.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the recife airport be the most crowded airport, run at 81.2% capacity.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is saying. It has two main points:\n1. Recife's airport is the most crowded.\n2. It operates at 81.2% capacity.\n\nI'll start by looking for Recife in the table. Scanning through the \"location\" column, I find that Recife is listed as row index 8 (since counting starts from 0). Let me check the other details there: total passengers are 3,173,672 with a 16.1% annual change and capacity in use of 63.5%. \n\nWait, the claim mentions 81.2%, but according to row 8, Recife's capacity is 63.5%. That's different. Maybe I should check if there are other entries for Recife? Looking through again, it seems like Recife only appears once at row index 9 (if starting from 0, no\u2014row 8 is Recife). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the rows. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices start at 0:\n- 0: S\u00e3o Paulo\n- 1: S\u00e3o Paulo\n- 2: Bras\u00edlia\n- 3: Rio de Janeiro\n- 4: Rio de Janeiro\n- 5: Salvador\n- 6: Porto Alegre\n- 7: Belo Horizonte\n- 8: Recife\n- 9: Curitiba\n- 10: Fortaleza\n- 11: Florian\u00f3polis\n- 12: Manaus\n- 13: Bel\u00e9m\n- 14: Vit\u00f3ria\n\nSo Recife is at row index 8. The capacity there is 63.5%, which doesn't match the claim of 81.2%. That means either the airport name in the claim isn't Recife, or perhaps I'm looking at the wrong data.\n\nWait a second, maybe the user made a mistake in the claim? Let me check other rows for 81.2% capacity. Scanning through the \"capacity in use\" column:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo (row 0): 113.4%\n- Another S\u00e3o Paulo (row 1): 78.4%\n- Bras\u00edlia: 134.1%\n- Rio de Janeiro: 40.2% and 152.7%\n- Salvador:69.1%\n- Porto Alegre:52.7%\n- Belo Horizonte:213.0%\n- Recife:63.5%\n- Curitiba:81.2%\nAh, there it is! At row index 9, the location is Curitiba with a capacity of 81.2%. So the claim incorrectly attributes this percentage to Recife instead of Curitiba.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the claim about Recife being the most crowded is also incorrect because the highest capacity in use is actually Belo Horizonte at 213.0%, which would make it the most crowded, not Recife or even Curitiba.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are wrong: Recife isn't running at 81.2% and isn't the most crowded. The correct airport with 81.2% is Curitiba, and the most crowded is Belo Horizonte.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Recife operates at 81.2% capacity; in reality, it's Curitiba. Additionally, the most crowded airport is Belo Horizonte.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"all of the airport on the list have seen a decrease in use\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what each column represents:\n\n- **Rank**: The position of the location based on total passengers.\n- **Location**: Names of cities with their airports.\n- **Total Passengers**: The number of passengers that year.\n- **Annual Change**: Percentage change in passenger numbers from the previous year.\n- **Capacity in Use**: How much of the airport's capacity is being used, percentage-wise.\n\nThe claim states that all airports on the list have seen a decrease in use. I think \"use\" here refers to the number of passengers, so we're looking at whether each location's total passengers have decreased compared to the previous year. \n\nTo verify this, I'll look at the \"Annual Change\" column because it directly shows percentage changes. A negative value would indicate a decrease, while a positive value indicates an increase.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. **S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 1)**: Annual change is 12.8% \u2014 positive, so an increase.\n2. **S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 2)**: 11.7% \u2014 also positive, another increase.\n3. **Bras\u00edlia**: 45.1% \u2014 a significant increase.\n4. **Rio de Janeiro (rank 4)**: 30.4% \u2014 increase again.\n5. **Rio de Janeiro (rank 5)**: 9.2% \u2014 still an increase, albeit smaller.\n6. **Salvador**: 20.0% \u2014 positive change.\n7. **Porto Alegre**: 11.6% \u2014 increase.\n8. **Belo Horizonte**: 7.5% \u2014 increase.\n9. **Recife**: 16.1% \u2014 up.\n10. **Curitiba**: 13.0% \u2014 positive.\n11. **Fortaleza**: 24.0% \u2014 increase.\n12. **Florian\u00f3polis**: 7.8% \u2014 another increase.\n13. **Manaus**: 10.3% \u2014 up.\n14. **Bel\u00e9m**: 13.5% \u2014 positive change.\n15. **Vit\u00f3ria**: 6.1% \u2014 still an increase.\n\nI notice that all \"Annual Change\" percentages are positive, meaning each airport's passenger numbers increased from the previous year. \n\nWait a minute, but what if \"decrease in use\" refers to something else, like capacity? Let me check the \"Capacity in Use\" column just to be sure.\n\nLooking at \"Capacity in Use\":\n\n- **S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 1)**: 113.4% \u2014 above 100%, which might mean over capacity.\n- **S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 2)**: 78.4% \u2014 under capacity.\n- **Bras\u00edlia**: 134.1% \u2014 over capacity.\n- **Rio de Janeiro (rank 4)**: 40.2% \u2014 very low usage.\n- **Rio de Janeiro (rank 5)**: 152.7% \u2014 over.\n- And so on.\n\nBut the claim mentions \"decrease in use.\" Capacity could be a factor, but typically, when talking about airports and passenger numbers, it's more common to refer to passenger counts rather than capacity usage. Moreover, all annual changes are positive, indicating no decreases in passengers. \n\nTherefore, since every location shows an increase in total passengers (positive annual change), the claim that all have seen a decrease is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells to check this are each row's \"Annual Change\" column because it directly indicates whether there was an increase or decrease.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"manaus and rio de janeiro be the only location to have 2 airport, and both of them be run over capacity.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. **Identify locations with two airports:** I need to check if Manaus and Rio de Janeiro are the only locations that appear twice in the table (since each occurrence likely represents a different airport).\n\nLooking at the 'location' column:\n- S\u00e3o Paulo appears twice.\n- Rio de Janeiro appears twice.\n- The other locations appear once.\n\nSo, according to this, both S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro have two airports. But the claim says only Manaus and Rio do. That's incorrect because S\u00e3o Paulo also has two entries, implying two airports there as well.\n\n2. **Check if both are over capacity:** Next, I need to see if both of these locations (Manaus and Rio) are running over capacity.\n\nFor each occurrence:\n- Manaus is at row 13 with \"capacity in use\" of 75.4%. Since it's under 100%, it's not over capacity.\n- Rio de Janeiro has two entries: one at row 4 with 40.2% and another at row 5 with 152.7%. The second entry is over 100%, so that airport is over capacity, but the first isn't.\n\nWait, the claim says both are running over capacity. So for Manaus, even if it had two airports (which it doesn't in this table), one of them would have to be under. But in our case, Manaus only has one entry, which is under capacity.\n\nSo the claim's first part is wrong because S\u00e3o Paulo also has two airports. The second part about both being over capacity isn't true either since neither Manaus nor Rio de Janeiro's other airport are over (or Manaus isn't even listed twice).\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly identifies Manaus and Rio de Janeiro as the only locations with two airports and both over capacity. S\u00e3o Paulo also has two airports, and not all of their capacities are exceeded.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"salvador and rio de janeiro be the only location to see more than 20000000 passenger pass through their airport.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this. It says that Salvador and Rio de Janeiro are the only locations where over 20 million passengers passed through their airports.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different airport, with its rank, location, total passengers, annual change, and capacity in use. The 'total passengers' column is what's relevant here since it indicates the number of passengers passing through each location.\n\nLet me go through each row to check the total passengers:\n\n1. S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 1): 13,611,227 \u2013 this is under 20 million.\n2. Another S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 2): 12,940,193 \u2013 also under 20 million.\n3. Bras\u00edlia: 9,926,786 \u2013 under.\n4. Rio de Janeiro (rank 4): 6,024,930 \u2013 still under.\n5. Another Rio de Janeiro (rank 5): 4,887,306 \u2013 way below 20 million.\n\nWait a minute, both entries for Rio de Janeiro have much lower numbers than 20 million. The claim says they are the only ones with over 20 million, but according to the table, their totals are well below that.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nSalvador is rank 6: 4,145,371 passengers \u2013 again, under 20 million.\n\nThe rest of the locations also have much lower numbers. The highest is S\u00e3o Paulo with around 13 million, which isn't even close to 20 million.\n\nSo, the claim that Salvador and Rio de Janeiro are the only ones seeing more than 20 million passengers is false because neither of them reach that number. In fact, none of the locations in the table have over 20 million passengers.\n\nTherefore, I'll mark this as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is incorrect because neither Salvador nor Rio de Janeiro have total passengers exceeding 20,000,000 according to the table.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the most under capacity airport, vit\u00f3ria, be also the airport that have see the most annual growth.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means.\n\n1. **Most Under Capacity Airport (Vit\u00f3ria):** This refers to an airport whose actual passenger usage is much lower than its designed capacity. In other words, the 'capacity in use' should be low because it's underutilized. Looking at the table, I see a column named \"capacity in use.\" A value less than 100% would indicate that the airport isn't operating at full capacity. However, in this case, I notice that Vit\u00f3ria has a \"capacity in use\" of 222.5%, which is above 100%. This suggests that the airport is actually over its designed capacity rather than under. So, this part might already indicate the claim could be false.\n\n2. **Most Annual Growth:** The claim also states that Vit\u00f3ria has seen the most annual growth. I check the \"annual change\" column to find which location has the highest percentage increase. Scanning through the numbers:\n   - S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 1): 12.8%\n   - S\u00e3o Paulo (rank 2): 11.7%\n   - Bras\u00edlia: 45.1% (highest so far)\n   - Rio de Janeiro (rank 4): 30.4%\n   - Rio de Janeiro (rank 5): 9.2%\n   - Salvador: 20.0%\n   - Porto Alegre: 11.6%\n   - Belo Horizonte: 7.5%\n   - Recife: 16.1%\n   - Curitiba: 13.0%\n   - Fortaleza: 24.0%\n   - Florian\u00f3polis: 7.8%\n   - Manaus: 10.3%\n   - Bel\u00e9m: 13.5%\n   - Vit\u00f3ria: 6.1% (which is quite low)\n\nThe highest annual change is Bras\u00edlia with 45.1%, not Vit\u00f3ria which only has a 6.1% growth rate.\n\nPutting it together, the claim has two parts:\n- Vit\u00f3ria being the most under capacity is incorrect because it's operating above its capacity.\n- Vit\u00f3ria having the most annual growth is also incorrect because it's actually the lowest among the listed airports in terms of growth percentage.\n\nTherefore, both conditions in the claim are false. The airport with the highest annual growth is Bras\u00edlia, and the one with the least (or negative) growth would be different from Vit\u00f3ria. Also, being over capacity doesn't make an airport \"under capacity.\"\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"capacity in use\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"annual change\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
