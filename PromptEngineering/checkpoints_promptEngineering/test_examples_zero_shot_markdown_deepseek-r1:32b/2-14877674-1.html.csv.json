    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim says: \"the fullback ken snelling be pick 58 in round 7\". \n\nFirst, let me parse this correctly. It seems like there might be a typo or grammatical issue. I think it's saying that Ken Snelling was picked as a fullback in the 7th round at pick number 58.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has details about players including their position and pick number. Let me go through each step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Information**: The claim mentions \"Ken Snelling\" as a fullback picked 58 in round 7. I need to check if Ken Snelling exists in the table, what his position is, his pick number, and the round.\n\n2. **Search for Ken Snelling**: Scanning through the players' names, I find \"ken snelling\" in row index 6 (since rows start from 0). Let me confirm that: \n\n   - Round: 7\n   - Pick: 58\n   - Player: ken snelling\n   - Position: fullback\n\n3. **Verify the Claim**: The claim states he was picked at 58 in round 7, which matches exactly with row index 6 of the table.\n\n4. **Check for Any Mismatches or Typos**: The position is listed as 'fullback', which aligns with the claim. There's no discrepancy in the pick number or round.\n\nSince all details match, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"round\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"pick\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"player\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 6,\n       \"column_name\": \"position\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim about George Zellick is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"George Zellick have a position of end and a school / club of oregon state.\" So there are two pieces of information to verify\u2014his position and his school/club team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different player with details like round, pick number, player name, position, and school or club team. I need to find the row where the player's name is George Zellick.\n\nI'll scan through the \"player\" column to locate George Zellick. Scrolling down, I see that at row index 24 (assuming counting starts from 0), there's a player named George Zellick. \n\nNext, I'll check the \"position\" and \"school / club team\" for this row. The position is listed as \"end,\" which matches the claim. Then, looking at the school/club team column, it says \"oregon state.\" This also aligns with what's stated in the claim.\n\nSince both pieces of information\u2014the position being end and the school/club team being Oregon State\u2014are correctly represented in the table for George Zellick, the claim is accurate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"school  / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the \"player\" column, I see his name at row 24. The columns are: round, pick, player, position, school/club team.\n\nLooking at the claim: it says George Zellick's position is center and his school/club is Oregon State. Let me check these details in the table.\n\nThe \"position\" for George Zellick is listed as \"end.\" So that doesn't match the claim which states he's a center. Next, checking his school: it's Oregon State, which does match the claim.\n\nHowever, since one part (his position) doesn't align with the claim, I need to evaluate whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE. The claim combines both pieces of information, so if either is incorrect, the entire claim is false.\n\nTherefore, because George Zellick's position is listed as end and not center, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that George Zellick has a position of center and attended Oregon State. From the table:\n\n- Position: end (row 24)\n- School/Club Team: oregon state (row 24)\n\nSince the position doesn't match, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"school  / club team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
