    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the title of the episode that aired on March 31, 2008 is 'New York: Secret Societies'\". \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns like production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. I need to find the row where the original airdate matches March 31, 2008.\n\nLooking through each row's airdate:\n\n- Row 9 (since counting starts at 0) has an airdate of March 31, 2008. Let me check that again: yes, row index 9 because the first row is 0. \n\nIn this row, I should look at two columns: original airdate and episode title. The original airdate in row 9 is indeed March 31, 2008, and the episode title is \"New York: Secret Societies\".\n\nSo both conditions are satisfied: the correct date corresponds to that specific episode title. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that on March 31, 2008, the episode titled \"New York: Secret Societies\" aired.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"episode number 202 air on february 4, 2008\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: production no, episode no, original airdate, episode title, and host. Each row represents an episode with specific details under these headers.\n\nThe claim mentions \"episode number 202\". So, my first task is to find which row in the table has the episode number 202. I'll scan through the 'episode no' column looking for 202.\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 15: production 15, episode 201\n- Row 16: production 16, episode 202 \u2192 This matches.\n\nOnce I've found the correct row (row index 15 since counting starts from 0), I need to check two things: whether the episode number is indeed 202 and what's the original airdate for that episode.\n\nIn row 15:\n- 'episode no' is 202, which matches the claim.\n- The 'original airdate' is listed as \"february 4 , 2008\". \n\nThe claim states the airdate is February 4, 2008. Comparing this to what's in the table, it exactly matches. Even though there's a space after the comma in the table (\"february 4 , 2008\"), that doesn't change the date itself; it's still February 4th.\n\nSo both pieces of information from the claim are accurately reflected in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n- The 'episode no' cell in row 15 verifies the episode number.\n- The 'original airdate' cell in the same row confirms the date.\n\nThese two cells support the entire claim. No other rows or columns are needed because they don't contain conflicting information or additional data that affects the claim's validity.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table as both the episode number and the airdate match exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the title of the episode that aired on January 28, 2008 was 'Vietnam' hosted by Don Wildman.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns for production number, episode number, original airdate, episode title, and host. There are 14 rows listed here.\n\nThe claim mentions three specific pieces of information: the airdate (January 28, 2008), the episode title ('Vietnam'), and the host (Don Wildman). I need to check each of these against the table.\n\nStarting with the airdate. Scanning through the \"original airdate\" column, I see that January 28, 2008 is listed in the first row (row index 0). The corresponding episode title for that date is 'underground apocalypse', not 'Vietnam'. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nNext, looking at the host. Every entry in the \"host\" column is Don Wildman, so regardless of the episode, the host is consistent. That part checks out.\n\nBut since the episode titled 'Vietnam' doesn't air on January 28, 2008\u2014instead, it's on February 4, 2008\u2014the claim isn't accurate. The correct title for January 28 is 'underground apocalypse'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are from row index 0: original airdate and episode title. Even though the host matches, the other parts don't support the claim. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"episode number 213 air on january 28, 2008.\" So, the episode in question is number 213, and the claim states that this episode aired on January 28th, 2008.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a production with details like production number, episode number, airdate, title, and host. I need to find the row where the episode number is 213 to check its corresponding airdate.\n\nGoing through the rows:\n\n- The first few rows have episode numbers 201 to 207, which are all lower than 213.\n- Continuing down, at row index 14 (assuming counting starts from 0), I find production number 27 and episode number 213. \n\nNow, checking the airdate for this row: it's May 5, 2008, not January 28, 2008 as claimed.\n\nSo, the claim states that episode 213 aired on January 28, 2008, but according to the table, it actually aired on May 5, 2008. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- The row where production number is 27 (row index 14) and episode number is 213.\n- The same row's airdate column, which shows May 5, 2008 instead of January 28, 2008.\n\nThis discrepancy confirms that the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"episode no\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"original airdate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
