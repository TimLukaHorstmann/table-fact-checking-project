    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"newcastle united score 2 more goals in their replayed match than manchester unite do in their match.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It compares Newcastle United's performance in a replayed match to Manchester United's performance in their match. Specifically, it says that Newcastle scored two more goals in their replay compared to what Manchester United scored in theirs.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple matches listed, some with replays. Let me identify which rows correspond to Newcastle United and Manchester United.\n\nStarting with Newcastle United: Scanning through the 'home team' and 'away team' columns, I notice a match on row 7 where the home team is Coventry City and the away team is Newcastle United. The score is 1-1, and there's a replay listed after this match. The replay for Newcastle United is on January 28, 1976, with Newcastle as the home team against Coventry City, scoring 5-0.\n\nNow, let me find Manchester United's match. Looking through the rows, I see row 8 where the home team is Manchester United versus Peterborough United, with a score of 3-1 on January 24, 1976. There's no replay indicated for this match, so we only consider their initial game.\n\nNext, I'll extract the relevant scores. For Newcastle United's replay, they scored 5 goals (as the home team in the replay). Manchester United, in their match, scored 3 goals as the home team. The claim says that Newcastle scored two more goals than Manchester United in their respective matches. So, let's check: 5 (Newcastle) vs. 3 (Manchester United). The difference is indeed 2 goals.\n\nWait a minute, but I should ensure that both are being compared correctly. The claim mentions \"their replayed match\" for Newcastle and \"their match\" for Manchester. Since Manchester's match didn't have a replay, we only consider their initial score of 3. Newcastle's replay score is the one we need to compare. So, 5 (Newcastle) minus 3 (Manchester) equals 2, which aligns with the claim.\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there are any other matches involving Manchester United that might affect this comparison. Looking through the table again, row 16 mentions Stoke City vs. Manchester City on January 28, 1976, but that's a different team\u2014Manchester City instead of Manchester United. So that doesn't impact our current analysis.\n\nTherefore, based on the scores from their respective matches (replay for Newcastle and initial match for Manchester), Newcastle scored two more goals than Manchester United. This makes the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It states that three matches were replayed in January 1976. So, I should look for any entries marked as replays and check their dates.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- There are multiple rows where the \"tie no\" is labeled as \"replay\". Let's identify those:\n  - Row index 6: Replay between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town on 27 January 1976.\n  - Row index 8: Replay between Newcastle United and Coventry City on 28 January 1976.\n  - Row index 13: Replay between Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic on 27 January 1976.\n\nSo, there are three replays listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"only 1 match be play in february\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: tie no, home team, score, away team, and date. The rows represent different matches with their respective details.\n\nThe claim says only one match was played in February. So I need to check all the dates in the 'date' column for any entries in February 1976.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is 24 January 1976.\n- Row 1: Same date as above.\n- Row 2: Again, 24 January 1976.\n- Row 3: Here's a different date\u20142 February 1976. That's the first match in February I see.\n- Row 4 to 8: All have dates on 24 or 27 January 1976, except for row 8 which is another January date.\n- Row 9 and beyond up to row 15 all list 24 January 1976 as the date.\n- Finally, row 16 has a date of 28 January 1976.\n\nSo, only one match in the table (row 3) was played on February 2, 1976. All others are either in January or have different dates within that month but not in February. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there's exactly one match played in February according to the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the number of goals scored by Chelsea be double that score by Crystal Palace.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through the table to find entries involving Chelsea and Crystal Palace. Let's go row by row.\n\nRow 14 shows \"leeds united\" as the home team with a score of 0-1 against \"crystal palace.\" Wait, so Crystal Palace is the away team here and scored 1 goal. \n\nNow, checking for Chelsea. I see Row 15: \"york city\" vs \"chelsea,\" with a score of 0-2. So Chelsea is the away team and they scored 2 goals.\n\nThe claim says Chelsea's goals should be double that of Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace scored 1 goal, so double would be 2. Since Chelsea scored exactly 2 goals, this matches the condition.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n- For Crystal Palace: row_index 14, column \"score.\"\n- For Chelsea: row_index 15, column \"score.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"only 1 of the 3 drawn match be goalless.\" I need to verify if this statement is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each part of the claim means. A \"drawn match\" refers to a game where both teams have the same score at the end of regular time. A \"goalless draw\" would be when neither team scores any goals in that match; so the score is 0-0.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to identify which matches were drawn and check if they ended with a goalless result.\n\nLet's start by examining each row:\n\n1. **Row 1**: Southampton vs Blackpool (3-1) \u2013 Not a draw.\n2. **Row 2**: Leicester City vs Bury (1-0) \u2013 Not a draw.\n3. **Row 3**: West Bromwich Albion vs Lincoln City (3-2) \u2013 Not a draw.\n4. **Row 4**: Sunderland vs Hull City (1-0) \u2013 Not a draw.\n5. **Row 5**: Derby County vs Liverpool (1-0) \u2013 Not a draw.\n6. **Row 6**: Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers (0-0) \u2013 This is a draw, and it's goalless because both scores are zero.\n7. **Replay Row**: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Ipswich Town (1-0) \u2013 It's a replay, but the score here isn't a draw. However, the initial match was a 0-0 draw, which we've already noted as row 6.\n8. **Row 7**: Coventry City vs Newcastle United (1-1) \u2013 This is a draw, but not goalless since both teams scored one goal each.\n9. **Replay Row**: Newcastle United vs Coventry City (5-0) \u2013 Not a draw.\n10. **Row 8**: Manchester United vs Peterborough United (3-1) \u2013 Not a draw.\n11. **Row 9**: Norwich City vs Luton Town (2-0) \u2013 Not a draw.\n12. **Row 10**: Bradford City vs Tooting & Mitcham United (3-1) \u2013 Not a draw.\n13. **Row 11**: Southend United vs Cardiff City (2-1) \u2013 Not a draw.\n14. **Row 12**: Huddersfield Town vs Bolton Wanderers (0-1) \u2013 Not a draw.\n15. **Row 13**: Charlton Athletic vs Portsmouth (1-1) \u2013 This is a draw, but not goalless as both teams scored once.\n16. **Replay Row**: Portsmouth vs Charlton Athletic (0-3) \u2013 Not a draw; the initial match was a 1-1 draw.\n17. **Row 14**: Leeds United vs Crystal Palace (0-1) \u2013 Not a draw.\n18. **Row 15**: York City vs Chelsea (0-2) \u2013 Not a draw.\n19. **Row 16**: Stoke City vs Manchester City (1-0) \u2013 Not a draw.\n\nFrom the table, there are three drawn matches:\n- Row 6: 0-0 (goalless)\n- Row 7: 1-1\n- Row 13: 1-1\n\nSo, out of these three draws, only one was goalless. Therefore, the claim that \"only 1 of the 3 drawn match be goalless\" is true.\n\nThe relevant cells to support this are:\n- Row 6, score column (0-0)\n- Row 7, score column (1-1)\n- Row 13, score column (1-1)\n\nThese rows show all the drawn matches and indicate which were goalless.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

The claim is: \"newcastle united score 3 more goal in their replayed match than manchester unite do in their match.\"\n\nFirst, I should parse what the claim is saying. It's stating that Newcastle United scored three more goals in their replay compared to Manchester United's score in their own match.\n\nLooking at the table, let me identify the relevant matches for both teams.\n\nStarting with Newcastle United: I scan the \"home team\" and \"away team\" columns for any mention of Newcastle United. In row 7, under home team, there's a match where Coventry City is playing against Newcastle United on January 24, 1976, with a score of 1-1. Since it's a draw, there's a replay mentioned later. The replay for this match is in row 8: Newcastle United as the home team scored 5 goals and Coventry City scored 0. So, in their replayed match, Newcastle United scored 5 goals.\n\nNext, I need to find Manchester United's match. Looking through the table, row 16 mentions Stoke City vs. Manchester City on January 28, 1976. Wait, that's not Manchester United; that's Manchester City. Did I miss Manchester United? Let me check again. Row 8 is about Manchester United: it says \"manchester united\" as the home team with a score of 3-1 against Peterborough United on January 24, 1976. So in their match, Manchester United scored 3 goals.\n\nNow, comparing the two scores: Newcastle United scored 5 goals in their replay, and Manchester United scored 3 goals in their match. The claim says Newcastle scored three more goals than Manchester United. Let's see: 5 (Newcastle) minus 3 (Manchester United) equals 2. That's only a difference of 2 goals, not 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the difference is two goals, not three.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"2 match be replay in january 1976\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it's intended to say that two matches were replayed in January 1976. So, my task is to check if there are exactly two replays in that month according to the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a match with details like tie number, home team, score, away team, and date. There's also a \"replay\" entry for matches that went into extra games. I need to identify all such replay entries occurring in January 1976.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to see which ones are marked as replays. \n\n- Row 6 is labeled as a replay between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town on 27 January 1976.\n- Another replay entry is found at row 8 (though the table shows row index starting from 0, so I need to be careful here). Wait, actually looking back, the replays are rows with \"replay\" in the tie no column. So rows 6 and 8 are replays.\n\nWait, let me clarify the indices. The initial rows go up to row 16 (the last one being index 15). Then, there are additional replays listed after some matches:\n\n- Row 6: Replay between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town on 27 January.\n- Row 8: Another replay between Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic on 27 January as well.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table provided in markdown, let me recount. The replays are listed as separate rows with \"replay\" under the tie no column.\n\nSo:\n\nRow indices (assuming starting from 0):\n\n- Row 6: Tie no 'replay' between Wolverhampton and Ipswich on 27 Jan.\n- Row 13: Tie no 'replay' between Portsmouth and Charlton on 27 Jan.\n\nWait, but looking at the markdown table provided:\n\nLooking again, row indices are as follows (assuming rows start from 0):\n\nRow 6 is a replay of match 6. Then, in row 8, there's another replay for match 13.\n\nSo that makes two replays: one on 27 Jan and another also on 27 Jan. Wait, no, both are on the same date? Let me check:\n\n- The first replay is between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town on 27 January.\n- The second replay is between Portsmouth and Charlton Athletic on 27 January as well.\n\nWait, but looking back at the table provided, row indices might be different. Let me recount from the markdown:\n\nLooking at the original table, I see that after each main match, some have a replay listed with their own rows. So let's list all replays and their dates:\n\n1. The first replay is for tie no 6: \"replay\" between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town on 27 January.\n2. Then, the next replay is after tie no 8? Wait, looking at the table:\n\nNo, actually, in the provided markdown, rows are as follows (assuming starting from row index 0):\n\n- Row 6: tie no 'replay', date 27 Jan.\n- Row 13: tie no 'replay', date 27 Jan.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table again, each \"replay\" is in its own row, so rows with \"replay\" under tie no are:\n\nRow 6: replay between Wolverhampton and Ipswich on 27 Jan.\nRow 13: replay between Portsmouth and Charlton on 27 Jan.\n\nSo that's two replays in January 1976. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there were exactly two matches that required a replay in January 1976.\n\nNow, I need to note the relevant cells for each replay:\n\nFor the first replay (Wolverhampton vs Ipswich), row index 6:\n- tie no: 'replay' (column name 'tie no')\n- date: 27 Jan (column name 'date')\n\nWait, but in the table, the columns are \"tie no\", \"home team\", \"score\", \"away team\", and \"date\". So each replay row has these columns.\n\nBut for the purpose of verifying the claim, we need to check that it's a replay (tie no is 'replay') and that the date is in January 1976.\n\nSo for each relevant cell:\n\nFirst replay:\n- Row index: let's see. The first replay is at row index 6? Wait, looking back, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me list all the rows with their indices as per markdown table:\n\nRow 0: tie no 1\nRow 1: tie no 2\n...\nRow 5: tie no 6\nRow 6: replay (tie no 'replay') - this is the first replay\nThen,\nRow 7: tie no 7\nRow 8: tie no 8\nRow 9: tie no 9\nRow 10: tie no 10\nRow 11: tie no 11\nRow 12: tie no 12\nRow 13: replay (tie no 'replay') - this is the second replay\n\nWait, so row indices for replays are 6 and 13.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n\nFor first replay:\n- Row index 6, tie no column ('replay')\n- Date column in same row: 27 Jan 1976.\n\nBut perhaps to verify it's a replay, we just need to check if tie no is 'replay' and date is in January. So the relevant cells are:\n\nRow 6:\n- Tie no: 'replay'\n- Date: 27 Jan\n\nRow 13:\n- Tie no: 'replay'\n- Date: 27 Jan.\n\nWait, but looking at row 13's date, it's also on 27 Jan. So both replays are in January.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE as there are two replays in January 1976.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two matches were replayed in January 1976, which is correct based on the table showing two replay entries with dates in January of that year. \n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{2}",

So Crystal Palace scored 1 goal in this match because they are the away team and the score is 0 (Leeds) - 1 (Crystal Palace).\n18. Row 17: York City vs Chelsea. Here, Chelsea is the away team. The score is 0-2. So Chelsea scored 2 goals as the away team.\n19. Row 18: Stoke City vs Manchester City. Not relevant.\n\nSo from the table, Crystal Palace played in row 16 and scored 1 goal. Chelsea played in row 17 and scored 2 goals.\n\nWait, hold on a second. The claim is about whether Chelsea's score is less than Crystal Palace's. But according to this, Chelsea scored more (2) than Crystal Palace (1). So the claim would be FALSE because 2 is not less than 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting which team is home or away. Let me double-check. In row 16, Crystal Palace is the away team with score 0-1, so they scored 1 goal. In row 17, Chelsea is the away team with score 0-2, meaning they scored 2 goals as the away team. So yes, Chelsea's score (2) is more than Crystal Palace's (1). Therefore, the claim that Chelsea's goals are less than Crystal Palace's is false.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chelsea's goal count is less than Crystal Palace's. According to the table:\n\n- Crystal Palace scored 1 goal in their match against Leeds United (row 16).\n- Chelsea scored 2 goals in their match against York City (row 17).\n\nSince 2 is not less than 1, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Relevant cells:**\n- Row 16 (Crystal Palace's score)\n- Row 17 (Chelsea's score)\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that all three drawn matches were goalless. A drawn match means both teams have the same score, and if it's goalless, that would mean both scores are zero (0-0). So I'm looking for any matches in the table where the score was a draw, i.e., both teams scored the same number of goals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a 'score' column. I'll go through each row and check if the match was drawn and whether it was goalless.\n\nLet's list out all the rows:\n\n1. Tie no 1: Southampton vs Blackpool - Score 3-1 (not a draw)\n2. Tie no 2: Leicester City vs Bury - Score 1-0 (not a draw)\n3. Tie no 3: West Bromwich Albion vs Lincoln City - Score 3-2 (not a draw)\n4. Tie no 4: Sunderland vs Hull City - Score 1-0 (not a draw)\n5. Tie no 5: Derby County vs Liverpool - Score 1-0 (not a draw)\n6. Tie no 6: Ipswich Town vs Wolverhampton Wanderers - Score 0-0 (draw, and goalless)\n7. Replay: Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Ipswich Town - Score 1-0 (not a draw)\n8. Tie no 7: Coventry City vs Newcastle United - Score 1-1 (draw, but not goalless because both scored once each)\n9. Replay: Newcastle United vs Coventry City - Score 5-0 (not a draw)\n10. Tie no 8: Manchester United vs Peterborough United - Score 3-1 (not a draw)\n11. Tie no 9: Norwich City vs Luton Town - Score 2-0 (not a draw)\n12. Tie no 10: Bradford City vs Tooting & Mitcham United - Score 3-1 (not a draw)\n13. Tie no 11: Southend United vs Cardiff City - Score 2-1 (not a draw)\n14. Tie no 12: Huddersfield Town vs Bolton Wanderers - Score 0-1 (not a draw)\n15. Tie no 13: Charlton Athletic vs Portsmouth - Score 1-1 (draw, but not goalless)\n16. Replay: Portsmouth vs Charlton Athletic - Score 0-3 (not a draw)\n17. Tie no 14: Leeds United vs Crystal Palace - Score 0-1 (not a draw)\n18. Tie no 15: York City vs Chelsea - Score 0-2 (not a draw)\n19. Tie no 16: Stoke City vs Manchester City - Score 1-0 (not a draw)\n\nNow, let's identify all the drawn matches:\n\n- Row 6: Score 0-0 (goalless draw)\n- Row 7: Not a replay, but in row 8 it's a tie with score 1-1\nWait, row 7 is a replay of row 6. So the original match was 0-0, which is a goalless draw, and then the replay had a different result.\n\nRow 8: Tie no 7 has a score of 1-1 (draw, but not goalless)\nRow 13: Charlton Athletic vs Portsmouth - 1-1 (draw, not goalless)\n\nSo there are three drawn matches:\n\n1. Row 6: 0-0\n2. Row 8: 1-1\n3. Row 13: 1-1\n\nOut of these three, only the first one is a goalless draw. The other two have goals in them.\n\nThe claim says \"all 3 of the drawn match be goalless.\" But since two out of the three draws had goals, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
