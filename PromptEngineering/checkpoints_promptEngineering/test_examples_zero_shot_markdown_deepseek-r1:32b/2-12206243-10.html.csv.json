Scanning through the rows:\n\n- The first row has date \"september 1\", opponent \"mets\". That matches.\n  \nNow, checking the details from this row:\n- The score column shows \"3 - 0\". Since it's listed as a win (the team scored more), and the claim states it was a win, that part is correct.\n\nNext, verifying attendance: the attendance number in the same row is 19196. The claim mentions 19196 crowd attendance, which matches exactly.\n\nI should also check if any other rows have September 1 against Mets to ensure there's no conflicting information. Scanning further, I see that the next few rows are all for September 2 and onwards, so no duplicates for September 1.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim\u2014game result (3-0 win) and attendance\u2014are correctly supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"on september 22 23 , 3380 crowd witness a win against the yankee of 8 - 1\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this. It seems like there might be some confusion in the date and attendance numbers. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Date Parsing**: The claim mentions \"september 22 23\". This is a bit unclear. September has only 30 days, so I'm assuming they meant either September 22 or September 23. Looking at the table, there are entries for both dates:\n   - September 22: Opponent is Yankees\n   - September 23: Opponent is Orioles\n\n2. **Opponent**: The claim states that it's a win against the Yankees. Let's check the opponent on each date:\n   - September 22: Opponent is Yankees (row index 21)\n   - September 23: Opponent is Orioles (row index 22)\n\nSince the claim mentions winning against the Yankees, we'll focus on September 22.\n\n3. **Score Check**: The score in the claim is \"8-1\". Let's check the score for September 22:\n   - Looking at row index 21: Score is 8-1 (Team won since it's listed as their score first)\n\n4. **Attendance Check**: The claim mentions an attendance of \"3380\". However, in the table, the attendance on September 22 is 23,380 (row index 21). That's a significant difference\u20143380 vs. 23,380.\n\n5. **Row Index and Column Names**:\n   - For date: Row 21, column \"Date\"\n   - For opponent: Row 21, column \"Opponent\" (Yankees)\n   - For score: Row 21, column \"Score\" (8-1)\n   - For attendance: Row 21, column \"Attendance\" (23,380)\n\nThe claim mentions 3380 crowd witnesses. The table shows 23,380 attendees on September 22 when they played against the Yankees and won with a score of 8-1.\n\nTherefore, even though the date (September 22), opponent (Yankees), and score (8-1) match, the attendance figure does not. The claim's attendance number is off by two zeros.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- row_index 21 for Date\n- row_index 21 for Opponent\n- row_index 21 for Score\n- row_index 21 for Attendance\n\nBut since the attendance doesn't match, the claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the record after the september 28 win against the red sox be 76 - 86.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim refers to. The date mentioned is September 28, and the opponent is the Red Sox. So, I should look for the row in the table where the date is September 28 and the opponent is the Red Sox.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. The first few rows are from September 1 to September 3 against the Mets.\n2. Then, September 4-6 against the Rangers.\n3. Followed by September 7 against the Rangers again.\n4. Next, September 8 and 9 against the Angels.\n5. September 10-11 against the Athletics.\n6. September 12-15 against the Mariners.\n7. Then, September 17-18 against the Red Sox. Wait, but that's before September 28.\n8. September 19-22 are against the Yankees.\n9. September 23-24 against the Orioles.\n10. September 25 is also against the Orioles.\n11. September 26 and 27 are back against the Red Sox, with the last one on September 28.\n\nSo, row_index 27 (since counting starts at 0) has date \"september 28\" and opponent \"red sox.\" Let me confirm that:\n\nRow 27: Date is september 28, Opponent is red sox. The record after this game is listed as \"76 - 86.\"\n\nTherefore, the claim matches exactly with what's in the table. So, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to identify which parts of the table were used to verify this. Specifically, I looked at two columns: 'Date' and 'record'. The row where date is september 28 has the record as 76-86, so both these columns are relevant.\n\nSo, the \"relevant_cells\" will include two objects:\n1. For the Date column in that specific row.\n2. For the record column in the same row.\n\nThat's how I arrived at the conclusion that the claim is TRUE and identified which parts of the table were necessary to confirm it.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies a date (September 28) and an opponent (Red Sox), both found in the last row of the table. The resulting record matches exactly, confirming the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"Date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 27, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the highest scoring game of the season be against the angel on september 8 final score be 12 - 10.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n1. It mentions the highest scoring game of the season.\n2. This game was against the Angels on September 8.\n3. The final score was 12-10.\n\nI'll start by looking at the table to find the relevant information. Let me go through each row and check for games against the Angels, specifically on September 8.\n\nLooking through the \"date\" column, I see a date \"september 8\". In that same row, the opponent is listed as \"angels\". The score for that game was 12-10. So far, this matches part of the claim.\n\nNow, to determine if it's the highest scoring game, I need to check all the scores in the table and see if any other games have a higher total than 12-10. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- September 1: 3-0 \u2192 total 3\n- September 2: 8-5 \u2192 total 13\n- September 3: 4-2 \u2192 total 6\n- September 4: 6-2 \u2192 total 8\n- September 5: 5-1 \u2192 total 6\n- September 6: 2-1 \u2192 total 3\n- September 7: Not listed, but I'll assume it's not present since the next date is September 8.\n- September 8: 12-10 \u2192 total 22 (since 12+10=22)\n- Continuing to check other dates:\n- September 9 onwards, scores include 3-2, 5-4, etc., but I don't see any game with a higher total than 22.\n\nWait, wait. Let me double-check all the rows beyond September 8:\n\nSeptember 20: 5-4 (total 9)\nSeptember 21: 5-4 (total 9)\nSeptember 22: 8-1 (total 9)\nSeptember 23: 3-2 (total 5)\nSeptember 24: 9-3 (total 12)\nSeptember 25: 4-3 (total 7)\nSeptember 26: 3-0 (total 3)\nSeptember 27: 12-5 (total 17)\nSeptember 28: 3-2 (total 5)\n\nSo, the highest total I found is 22 in the September 8 game against the Angels. The next closest was September 27 with a total of 17.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the highest scoring game was against the Angels on September 8 with a score of 12-10 seems to be correct based on the data provided.\n\nI should also verify if there are any other games that might have a higher score. But looking through all rows, none exceed the total of 22 points from the September 8 game.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the highest scoring game in the table is indeed against the Angels on September 8 with a final score of 12-10.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}",

The opponent on September 25 is the Orioles.\n2. The final score was 4-3.\n3. The attendance was 28,324 fans.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through the 'date' column for \"september 25\". From what I see in the provided data, the rows go up to September 28, but there's no entry for September 25.

I need to determine if the claim \"the blue jay fell to 76 - 86 follow their loss to the red sox on september 28\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It mentions two things: the Blue Jays' record after a game and that they lost to the Red Sox on September 28th.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played by the Blue Jays. The columns include 'date', 'opponent', 'score', 'loss', 'attendance', and 'record'. \n\nI'll start by finding the row where the opponent is the Red Sox on September 28th. Scanning through the dates, I see that September 28 is listed with \"red sox\" as the opponent. The score is 3-2 in favor of the Blue Jays? Wait, no\u2014the 'score' column shows 3 - 2, but the loss column says gordon (6 - 10), which probably indicates the Blue Jays lost that game. So it's a loss for the Blue Jays against the Red Sox on September 28.\n\nNext, I check the 'record' after this game. The record is shown as 76 - 86 in that row. The claim states that they fell to 76-86 following this loss, which matches exactly with what's in the table.\n\nI should also ensure there are no other games against the Red Sox on September 28th or any inconsistencies.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It states that the Blue Jays scored 12 runs once in September. So I'm looking for a game where their score was exactly 12 runs.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, etc. The 'score' column shows both teams' scores separated by a hyphen. For example, \"3 - 0\" means Blue Jays scored 3 against the Mets.\n\nI'll go through each row and check the 'score' column to see if there's any instance where the Blue Jays scored 12 runs. \n\nStarting from September 1: The score is 3-0, so Blue Jays scored 3.\nSeptember 2: 8-5, they scored 8.\nSeptember 3: 4-2, scored 4.\nSeptember 4: 6-2, 6 runs.\nSeptember 5: 5-1, 5 runs.\nSeptember 6: 2-1, only 2 runs.\nSeptember 7: 4-0, 4 runs.\nSeptember 8: 12-10. Oh wait, here the Blue Jays scored 12 runs against the Angels on September 8th.\n\nSo that's one instance where they scored 12. I should check if there are any others to ensure it's only once. \n\nLooking further:\nSeptember 9 is not in the table, but checking all provided rows:\n\nSeptember 20: They have a score of 5-4 (10th inning), which is still 5 runs.\nSeptember 21: 5-4 again in 10 innings.\nNo other games show Blue Jays scoring more than single digits except September 8 with 12.\n\nThus, the claim holds true because they scored exactly 12 runs once during the month.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the combined run on september 1 be the lowest of any game that month\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"combined run,\" which typically refers to the total runs scored by both teams in a single game. So, for each game on September 1st, I need to find out the total runs and compare it with all other games in that month to see if it's indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking at the table, the dates range from September 1 to September 28. Each row represents a different game. The \"score\" column shows the runs scored by each team, with the home team first and the away team second. For example, on September 1 against the Mets, the score is 3-0.\n\nTo find the combined runs for each game, I'll add both numbers in the score column. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. **September 1**: Score is 3-0. Combined runs = 3 + 0 = 3.\n2. **September 2**: 8-5 \u2192 8+5=13.\n3. **September 3**:4-2\u21926.\n4. **September 4**:6-2\u21928.\n5. **September 5**:5-1\u21926.\n6. **September 6**:2-1\u21923.\n7. **September 7**:4-0\u21924.\n8. **September 8**:12-10\u219222.\n9. **September 9**:2-0\u21922.\nWait, no, September 9's score is 2-0? Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking back at row index 8 (since rows start from 0), the score is indeed 2-0, so combined runs are 2+0=2. That's lower than September 1's total of 3. So this game has a lower combined run than September 1.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other games with even lower totals. Let's go through the rest:\n\n9. **September 9**: Score is 2-0 \u2192 2+0=2.\n10. **September 10** (row index 9): It seems there's a typo in my earlier thought; actually, row indices are from 0 to 27 since there are 28 days. So let me correct that.\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused with the numbering. Let me list all scores properly:\n\n- September 1: 3-0 \u2192 total 3\n- September 2: 8-5 \u2192 13\n- September 3:4-2\u21926\n- September 4:6-2\u21928\n- September 5:5-1\u21926\n- September 6:2-1\u21923\n- September 7:4-0\u21924\n- September 8:12-10\u219222\n- September 9: Score is actually in row index 8, which I believe is the next day after September 8. Let me check.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table, it's from September 1 to September 28. So each row corresponds to a specific date. Let me list all scores correctly:\n\n1. Sep 1:3-0 \u2192 total 3\n2. Sep 2:8-5\u219213\n3. Sep3:4-2\u21926\n4. Sep4:6-2\u21928\n5. Sep5:5-1\u21926\n6. Sep6:2-1\u21923\n7. Sep7:4-0\u21924\n8. Sep8:12-10\u219222\n9. Sep9: The next row after Sep8 would be Sep9, but looking at the table provided, I only see up to Sep28, but in the initial data, I don't have a row for Sep9. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait no, the table starts on September 1 and goes through September 28. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices are from 0 (Sep1) to 27 (Sep28). So each row is a day in September. Now, let's list all scores again properly:\n\n- Row 0: Sep1 \u21923-0=3\n- Row1: Sep2\u21928-5=13\n- Row2:Sep3\u21924-2=6\n- Row3:Sep4\u21926-2=8\n- Row4:Sep5\u21925-1=6\n- Row5:Sep6\u21922-1=3\n- Row6:Sep7\u21924-0=4\n- Row7:Sep8\u219212-10=22\n- Row8:Sep9\u2192Looking at the table, I think Sep9's score is actually in row index 8. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking back, the table provided only goes up to Sep28 with 28 rows (indices 0-27). So each row corresponds to a day from Sep1 to Sep28.\n\nSo for Row8: Sep9. The score is not shown in my initial data snippet, but perhaps I need to look at all scores again.\n\nWait no, looking back, the table provided by the user only includes dates up to September 28, with each row representing a day. Let me recount:\n\nRow0: Sep1 \u21923-0=3\n\nRow1:Sep2\u21928-5=13\n\nRow2:Sep3\u21924-2=6\n\nRow3:Sep4\u21926-2=8\n\nRow4:Sep5\u21925-1=6\n\nRow5:Sep6\u21922-1=3\n\nRow6:Sep7\u21924-0=4\n\nRow7:Sep8\u219212-10=22\n\nRow8:Sep9\u2192The score is 2-0 as per the table (checking row index 8): \"september 9\" \u2192 score is 2-0, so total runs 2.\n\nWait no, looking back at the table provided:\n\nIn the table, the rows are listed from Sep1 to Sep28. Let me check row by row:\n\nRow0: Sep1 \u21923-0=3\n\nRow1:Sep2\u21928-5=13\n\nRow2:Sep3\u21924-2=6\n\nRow3:Sep4\u21926-2=8\n\nRow4:Sep5\u21925-1=6\n\nRow5:Sep6\u21922-1=3\n\nRow6:Sep7\u21924-0=4\n\nRow7:Sep8\u219212-10=22\n\nRow8:Sep9\u2192Looking at the table, it's actually Sep9's score is 2-0 (checking the data):\n\nWait in the user's provided data:\n\nThe first row after Sep8 is Sep9 with a score of \"september 9\" and \"score\" as \"september 9\". Wait no, perhaps I misread. Let me re-examine.\n\nNo, looking back at the table structure provided by the user, each row has \"Date\", \"Score\", etc., but in the initial data snippet, after Sep8 (row7), the next rows are:\n\nRow8: Date=\"september 9\", Score=\"2-0\"\n\nSo total runs for Sep9 would be 2.\n\nSimilarly, checking other rows:\n\nRow9:Sep10 \u2192 score=3-1=4\n\nRow10:Sep11\u21925-0=5\n\nAnd so on. But the key point is that Sep9 has a total of 2 runs, which is lower than Sep1's 3.\n\nTherefore, the game with the lowest combined runs in September is Sep9 with a total of 2.\n</think>\n\nThe game with the lowest combined runs was on **September 9**, where the total runs were **2** (2-0). \n\n**Answer:** The lowest combined runs occurred on September 9 with a score of 2-0, resulting in a total of \\boxed{2} runs.",
