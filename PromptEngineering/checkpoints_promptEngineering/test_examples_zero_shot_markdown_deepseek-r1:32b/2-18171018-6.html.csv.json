    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"player gil morgan represent the united state tie for 7th place with -2 to par.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each part of the claim and check it against the table. \n\n1. **Player Name**: The claim mentions \"gil morgan.\" I need to find if there's a row where the player is Gil Morgan. Scanning the 'player' column, yes, I see Gil Morgan listed in one of the rows.\n\n2. **Country Representation**: The claim states that Gil Morgan represents the United States. Looking at the 'country' column for Gil Morgan's row, it indeed says \"united states.\" So this part checks out.\n\n3. **Tied for 7th Place**: The table has a 'place' column. For Gil Morgan, the place is listed as t7, which I assume stands for tied for 7th place. That matches what the claim says about being tied for 7th.\n\n4. **Score and To Par**: The score isn't directly mentioned in the claim, but the to par is given as -2. Checking Gil Morgan's row under 'to par,' it shows \"- 2.\" So this also aligns with the claim.\n\nNow, compiling all these points:\n- Player exists: Yes.\n- Country correct: United States.\n- Place correct: Tied for 7th (t7).\n- To par matches: -2.\n\nSince all parts of the claim are supported by the table data, I can conclude that the claim is TRUE. \n\nThe relevant cells would include the row where Gil Morgan is listed and check each necessary column to verify the details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"place\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
