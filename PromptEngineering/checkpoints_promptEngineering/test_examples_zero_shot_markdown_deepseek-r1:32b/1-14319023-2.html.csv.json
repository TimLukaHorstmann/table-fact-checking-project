    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a specific claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim in question is: \"When the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of this claim refers to in the context of the provided table. The table has several columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nThe claim is making two specific assertions:\n1. In a particular year, the girl's singles champion was Lindaweni Fanetri.\n2. In that same year, the mixed doubles champions were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nTo verify this claim, I need to check if both these conditions are satisfied in any given row of the table.\n\nLet me first look for the year when Lindaweni Fanetri was the girls singles champion. Scanning through the \"girls singles\" column:\n\n- 2001: Maria Kristin Yulianti\n- 2002: Fransisca Ratnasari\n- 2003: Wiwis Meilyanna\n- 2004: Pia Zebadiah\n- 2005: Bellaetrix Manuputty\n- 2006: Sylvinna Kurniawan\n- 2007: Lindaweni Fanetri\n- 2008: Ana Rovita\n- 2009: Ana Rovita\n- 2010: Ganis Nur Rahmadani\n\nSo, Lindaweni Fanetri was the girls singles champion in 2007. Now, I need to check what the mixed doubles champions were that year.\n\nLooking at the \"mixed doubles\" column for 2007:\n\n- The entry is Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n\nThis matches exactly with the claim made. Therefore, both conditions are satisfied in the same row (year 2007). \n\nTo summarize:\n- Relevant cell for girls singles: Row 6 (since indexing starts at 0), column \"girls singles\".\n- Relevant cell for mixed doubles: Same row 6, column \"mixed doubles\".\n\nSince both parts of the claim correspond correctly within the same year, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"when the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia , the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this correctly. It seems like it's saying that in the same year when the girls doubles winners were Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia, the boys doubles winners were Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.\n\nSo, I'll look through each row of the table and check if there's a year where both conditions are met: girl doubles is Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia AND boy doubles is Jones Ralfy Jansen Dandi Prabudita.\n\nLet me go through each year:\n\n- 2001: Girl doubles is Lilyana Natsir Natalia Poluakan. Not matching.\n- 2002: Fransisca Ratnasari for girls, not the ones mentioned.\n- 2003: Wiwis Meilyanna, no match.\n- 2004: Pia Zebadiah, still not matching.\n- 2005: Bellaetrix Manuputty. No.\n- 2006: Sylvinna Kurniawan. Not our girls.\n- 2007: Lindaweni Fanetri. Still no match.\n- 2008: Ana Rovita. Nope.\n- 2009: Ana Rovita again. Wait, looking at the girl doubles in 2009, it's Ayu Pratiwi Anggi Widia. That matches part of the claim.\n\nNow, let's check what the boys doubles were that year. In 2009, the boy doubles are Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita. Yes, that's exactly as per the claim.\n\nSo both conditions are met in the same row (year 2009). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nI'll note down the relevant cells: for 2009, both girls doubles and boys doubles columns.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"girls doubles\"}, {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys doubles\"}]}",

The claim states: \"In 2006, the mixed double be danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto and the boy single be nugroho andi saputro.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what I'm looking for in the table. The table has columns for each year from 2001 to 2010 with categories like boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nI need to focus on the year 2006. So, I'll look at the row where the year is 2006.\n\nIn that row, under \"mixed doubles,\" the names listed are Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto. That matches exactly with the claim which mentions Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto in mixed doubles for 2006. So this part of the claim is correct.\n\nNext, the claim also states that the boys singles winner in 2006 was Nugroho Andi Saputro. Looking at the \"boys singles\" column for 2006, I see that Nugroho Andi Saputro is indeed listed there. That matches as well.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by the table data. The mixed doubles team and the boys singles winner in 2006 are correctly identified.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information in the table for the year 2006 regarding both the mixed doubles winners and the boys singles champion.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine if the claim made is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"In 2007, the girl double be anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati and the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto.\"\n\nSo, there are two parts to this claim. The first part refers to the \"girls doubles\" event in 2007, stating that Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati won. The second part is about the \"mixed doubles,\" claiming that Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto were the winners.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. It's a markdown table with columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles. Each row represents a different year from 2001 to 2010.\n\nI need to find the row corresponding to the year 2007. Scanning through the years, I see that row index 6 (since counting starts at 0) is for the year 2007.\n\nNow, focusing on this row, let's check each relevant column:\n\n1. **Girls Doubles**: The claim mentions \"anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati.\" Looking at the table, under the girls doubles column for 2007, I see exactly that name: \"Anneke Feinya Agustin Wenny Setiawati.\" So this part of the claim is correct.\n\n2. **Mixed Doubles**: The claim states it was won by \"wifqi windarto debby susanto.\" Checking the mixed doubles column for 2007, I find the names listed are \"Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto,\" which matches exactly with what's in the claim.\n\nBoth parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified against the 2007 row in the table.

The claim states: \"when the girl single be lindaweni fanetri , the mixed double be wifqi windarto debby susanto after the year 2007.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to in the table.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Columns:**\n   - The claim mentions two specific columns:\n     - \"girls singles\": This refers to the female single champion each year.\n     - \"mixed doubles\": This refers to the mixed doubles pair (one male and one female) that won each year.\n\n2. **Find the Year When Lindaweni Fanetri Won:**\n   - Looking through the \"girls singles\" column, I need to find the year when Lindaweni Fanetri was the champion.\n   - Scanning down, in 2007, Lindaweni Fanetri is listed under \"girls singles.\"\n\n3. **Check the Mixed Doubles Champion After 2007:**\n   - The claim mentions that after the year 2007 (i.e., years following 2007), the mixed doubles champions were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.\n   - However, in the table, the only occurrence of \"wifqi windarto debby susanto\" is in 2007 under \"mixed doubles.\"\n\n4. **Analyze the Timing:**\n   - The claim says \"after the year 2007,\" which would mean years like 2008 and beyond.\n   - Checking subsequent years (2008 onwards), the mixed doubles champions are different:\n     - 2008: Irfan Fadhilah Weni Anggraeni\n     - 2009: Didit Juang Indrianto Yayu Rahayu\n     - 2010: Jones Ralfy Jansen Nurbeta Kwanrico\n\n5. **Conclusion on the Claim:**\n   - Since the mixed doubles champions after 2007 are not Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto, the claim is incorrect.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells:**\n   - To verify this, I need to check the cells where Lindaweni Fanetri was the girl's singles champion (2007) and then look at the mixed doubles champions in the years after 2007.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim is FALSE because Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto were only the mixed doubles champions in 2007, not in any subsequent year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"girls singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"in 2010, the girl double be ayu pratiwi anggi widia and the boy double be jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\" \n\nI need to check two things here:\n1. The girls doubles in 2010 are ayu pratiwi and anggi widia.\n2. The boys doubles in 2010 are jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the year 2010.

The claim mentions ayu pratiwi anggi widia, but according to the table, it's a different pair. So this part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow checking the boys doubles for 2010: The names are jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita. That matches exactly with what the claim states. So the boy doubles part is correct.\n\nSince the girls doubles in the claim don't match the table, even though the boys doubles do, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the data.

Let me read through the problem again.\n\nThe claim states: \"in 2009 , the mixed double consists of didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu and hermansyah be the boy single.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this. It's saying that in the year 2009, the mixed doubles team was Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu, and Hermansyah was the boys singles player.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year from 2001 to 2010. The columns are: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nSo I need to check two things:\n1. In 2009, was Hermansyah the boys singles champion?\n2. Was the mixed doubles team Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu?\n\nLet's find the row for 2009. Scrolling down, I see:\n\n|   2009  | riyanto subagja          | ana rovita              | jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita           | ayu pratiwi anggi widia                   | didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu    |\n\nWait, the mixed doubles column for 2009 is \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu.\" That matches part of the claim. So the mixed doubles team is correct.\n\nNow checking boys singles: in 2009, it's riyanto subagja, not Hermansyah. Looking back at other years, Hermansyah was the boys singles champion in 2008. In 2009, it's a different person.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly states that Hermansyah was the boys singles in 2009 when he wasn't; it was Riyanto Subagja instead.\n\nTherefore, since part of the claim is incorrect (Hermansyah not being the boy single in 2009), the overall claim is FALSE.\n\nFor relevant cells:\n- The mixed doubles cell for 2009: row index 8 (since rows start at 0) and column \"mixed doubles\".\n- The boys singles cell for 2009: same row, column \"boys singles\".\n\nSo the relevant_cells list will include these two.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"mixed doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"boys singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So in 2009, the girls doubles were not anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati. That's a mismatch.\n\n2. **Mixed doubles (mixed doubles column):** The names here are \"didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu\". Wait, no, that doesn't match either. Hmm, wait, looking again: 2009 mixed doubles is didit juang indrianto and yayu rahayu?
