    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the building that remain the tallest in montreal today be the 1000 de la gaucheti\u00e8re\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim: it's saying that as of now, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re is the tallest building in Montreal. So I need to check if this building holds the record for being the current tallest.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a building with details about when they were the tallest and their height. The relevant columns here are \"years as tallest\" and \"height m / ft\".\n\nI'll go through each building:\n\n1. Notre Dame Basilica: Years as tallest from 1829-1928 (99 years). Height is 69m/226ft.\n2. Royal Bank Building: 1928-1931 (3 years), height 121m/397ft.\n3. Sun Life Building: 1931-1962 (31 years), height 122m/400ft.\n4. Tour CIBC: Only in 1962, less than a year, 187m/614ft.\n5. Place Ville Marie: 1962-1964 (2 years), 188m/617ft.\n6. Tour de la Bourse: 1964-1992 (28 years), 194m/637ft.\n7. 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: From 1992 to present, 21 years so far. Height is 205m/673ft.\n\nNow, the key here is to see which building is currently the tallest. The claim states that 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re remains the tallest today. Looking at the table, it shows that this building has been the tallest since 1992 and is still holding that title as of now (present). Its height is listed as 205m/673ft, which seems higher than all previous entries.\n\nWait a second\u2014Tour de la Bourse was taller at 194m before this building. So yes, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re being the current tallest makes sense because it's the last in the list and still holds the record without any newer buildings listed after it.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the \"years as tallest\" and \"height m / ft\" for 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"height m  / ft\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"from 1829-1928, the notre dame basilica be the tallest building and still hold the record for the most year be the tallest.\"\n\nLooking at the table, I see that Notre-Dame Basilica is listed first. The relevant columns here are 'years as tallest' and 'of years as tallest'.\n\nFor the period mentioned (1829-1928), the table shows that Notre-Dame Basilica was indeed the tallest during those years. Additionally, under the 'of years as tallest' column, it's noted as 99 years. Comparing this with other entries, I check if any building has more than 99 years as the tallest.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"regardless of both building have 47 floor , the tour de la bourse take the title of the tallest building from the place ville marie in 1964 by a mere 6 / 20 m  / ft difference\"\n\nLet me parse each part:\n\n1. Both buildings (tour de la bourse and place Ville Marie) have 47 floors.\n2. Tour de la Bourse took the title of tallest from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\n3. The height difference was 6 meters or 20 feet.\n\nI'll check each point against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: Do both buildings have 47 floors?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Tour de la Bourse is on row 5 (index 5), column \"floors\" shows 47.\n- Place Ville Marie is on row 4, also has 47 floors. So that's correct.\n\nNext, did Tour de la Bourse take the title in 1964? Let me check their years as tallest:\n\n- Place Ville Marie was tallest from 1962 to 1964 (row 4). Then, Tour de la Bourse took over starting in 1964. So yes, in 1964, Tour de la Bourse became the new tallest.\n\nNow, checking the height difference:\n\n- Place Ville Marie's height is 188 m / 617 ft (row 4).\n- Tour de la Bourse is 194 m / 637 ft (row 5).\n\nCalculating the difference:\n\n194 - 188 = 6 meters. In feet, 637 - 617 = 20 feet.\n\nSo the claim says the difference was exactly 6m/20ft, which matches. Therefore, all parts of the claim are correct based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because both buildings have 47 floors, Tour de la Bourse replaced Place Ville Marie as the tallest in 1964, and the height difference was exactly 6 meters or 20 feet.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height m / ft\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year , follow by place ville marie\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's asserting that Tour CIBC was the tallest building for the shortest duration, and then Place Ville Marie followed it as the next tallest building with a slightly longer period.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n- **Tour CIBC** became the tallest in 1962 and held that title for less than a year. The \"years as tallest\" column shows \"<1 year\".\n- **Place Ville Marie** took over from 1962 to 1964, which is 2 years.\n\nI should compare these durations to see if Tour CIBC indeed had the shortest period as the tallest building. Checking all rows:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years\n- Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n- Sun Life Building: 31 years\n- Tour CIBC: <1 year (which is less than a year)\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n- Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years (current)\n\nComparing these durations, Tour CIBC's duration is the shortest at less than a year. Next, Place Ville Marie held the title for 2 years, which is more than Tour CIBC but still shorter compared to others like Royal Bank (3 years) or Sun Life (31 years). \n\nSo, according to the table, Tour CIBC was indeed the tallest for the least amount of time, and Place Ville Marie followed it with a slightly longer period. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For **Tour CIBC**: Check \"years as tallest\" which is in row index 3.\n- For **Place Ville Marie**: Also check \"years as tallest\" which is in row index 4.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are at rows 3 and 4 under the column \"years as tallest\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Tour CIBC held the title for less than a year, followed by Place Ville Marie for two years. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about the Sun Life Building and Notre Dame Basilica is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"The sun life building remained the tallest building in Montreal for close to a third of the time of the Notre Dame Basilica.\" So, we're comparing how long each building was the tallest relative to each other.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant data points. The columns that matter here are \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest\" because these will give us the duration each building held the title.\n\nFor the Sun Life Building:\n- Under \"years as tallest,\" it's listed from 1931 to 1962.\n- In the \"of years as tallest\" column, it says 31 years.\n\nFor Notre Dame Basilica:\n- Its period is from 1829 to 1928.\n- The duration here is 99 years.\n\nNow, let's verify if the Sun Life Building was the tallest for close to a third of the time that Notre Dame Basilica was. A third of 99 years would be approximately 33 years (since 99 divided by 3 is 33). The Sun Life Building held the title for exactly 31 years, which is very close to 33 years.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because 31 years is indeed close to a third of 99 years. \n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll double-check the numbers:\n- Notre Dame: 99 years.\n- Sun Life: 31 years.\nCalculating one-third of 99 gives us 33. The difference between 31 and 33 is only two years, which supports the claim that it's \"close to a third.\"\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are those containing their respective durations as tallest buildings.\n</think>\n\nThe Sun Life Building was the tallest for 31 years, while Notre Dame Basilica held the title for 99 years. A third of 99 is approximately 33, making 31 close enough to support the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by carefully examining the table and understanding each column.\n\nThe table lists several buildings with their details such as name, street address, years they were the tallest, duration of that period, height in meters and feet, and number of floors. The claim is about whether Notre Dame Basilica is still the tallest today.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the \"name\" column to find Notre Dame Basilica. There it is, in the first row. Now, let's check the relevant details for this building. \n\nIn the \"years as tallest\" column, it says 1829 - 1928, which means it held that title for 99 years. The next column shows this duration, confirming it was replaced in 1928 by another building. \n\nLooking at the \"height m / ft\" column, Notre Dame Basilica is listed as 69 meters or 226 feet tall. Comparing this to other buildings in the table, I see that subsequent buildings have significantly greater heights. For example, Royal Bank Building is 121m (397ft), Sun Life Building at 122m (400ft), and so on, up to 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re which is 205m (673ft) tall.\n\nThe claim states that Notre Dame Basilica remains the tallest today. But from the table, I notice that its period as the tallest ended in 1928. Since then, other buildings have been taller and currently, 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re has been the tallest since 1992 and is still holding that title as per \"years as tallest\" which says 1992 - present.\n\nTherefore, Notre Dame Basilica was once the tallest but isn't anymore.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Although the Place Ville Marie has more floors than Tour de la Bourse, Tour de la Bourse took the title of the tallest building from Place Ville Marie in 1964.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check the number of floors for both buildings. Looking at the table:\n\n- Place Ville Marie is on row index 4 and has 47 floors.\n- Tour de la Bourse is on row index 5 and also has 47 floors.\n\nSo, they have the same number of floors. The claim mentions that Place Ville Marie has more floors, which isn't accurate since both have equal floors. That might be a problem for the claim's truthfulness.\n\nNext, I need to check when Tour de la Bourse became the tallest. According to the table:\n\n- Place Ville Marie was the tallest from 1962 to 1964.\n- Tour de la Bourse took over in 1964 and held the title until 1992.\n\nSo, in 1964, Tour de la Bourse did become the tallest. However, since both buildings have the same number of floors, the claim's first part about having more floors isn't correct. Therefore, even though Tour de la Bourse did take the title in 1964, the reason given (more floors) is incorrect.\n\nPutting it together: The claim has two parts. The second part (Tour de la Bourse taking over in 1964) is true, but the first part (Place Ville Marie having more floors) is false. Since the entire claim relies on both being accurate, and one part is wrong, the overall claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n\n- For Place Ville Marie: Floors and Years as Tallest.\n- For Tour de la Bourse: Floors and Years as Tallest.\n\nSo, I'll list these in the relevant_cells section with their respective row indices and column names.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, the claim is: \"tour cibc hold the record for the most year be the tallest in montreal.\" I need to determine if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand what data we're dealing with. The table lists several buildings along with details about their height, floors, years they were the tallest, and so on.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tour cibc\" holding the record for the most years as the tallest in Montreal. So, I need to check two things: how many years tour cibc was the tallest and compare it to other buildings listed.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Tour CIBC is in row 3 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). It has \"years as tallest\" from 1962 to less than a year, so only one year. The column for 'of years as tallest' says \"<1 year.\" That's clear\u2014it was the tallest for less than a year.\n\nNow, let me check other buildings in the table to see if any held the record longer:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years (from 1829 to 1928)\n- Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n- Sun Life Building: 31 years\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n- Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n- 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years (from 1992 to present)\n\nFrom this, I can see that tour cibc was only the tallest for less than a year, which is definitely not the most. The longest period was held by Notre Dame Basilica with 99 years.\n\nSo, the claim says that tour cibc holds the record, but clearly, another building has been the tallest for much longer. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nTo determine relevant cells: \n\nI need to look at each building's \"years as tallest\" and \"of years as tallest.\" So, for tour cibc, it's row 3 with columns 'years as tallest' and 'of years as tallest.' But since all other buildings have longer periods, I should include their relevant cells too.\n\nWait, but the instructions say to list only the cells that are relevant to verify the claim. The claim is about tour cibc, so perhaps just looking at its duration is enough. However, to compare and determine if it's the record holder, I need to check all other entries' durations as well. So, each building's \"of years as tallest\" column is relevant.\n\nBut wait, let me re-examine the instructions. It says: \"each with 'row_index' (int) and 'column_name' (string)\"\u2014so perhaps for each building, we need to note how many years they were tallest. So, I should list all the rows with the 'of years as tallest' column.\n\nSo, relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 0: 'years as tallest'\n- Row 1: 'years as tallest'\n- Row 2: 'years as tallest'\n- Row 3: 'years as tallest'\n- Row 4: 'years as tallest'\n- Row 5: 'years as tallest'\n- Row 6: 'years as tallest'\n\nBut wait, looking back at the table structure, the columns are:\n\n0: name\n\n1: street address\n\n2: years as tallest (e.g., 1829 - 1928)\n\n3: of years as tallest (e.g., 99 years)\n\n4: height m / ft\n\n5: floors\n\nSo, to determine the duration each building was tallest, column index 3 is 'of years as tallest.' Therefore, for all rows, looking at column 3 will give the number of years.\n\nThus, relevant cells would be:\n\nEach row's 'of years as tallest' cell. So, rows 0-6 with column name \"of years as tallest.\"\n\nTherefore, in JSON format, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells include each row's 'of years as tallest' entry.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems to state that Place Ville Marie was the tallest building but only held that title for the shortest period among all entries in the table. So I need to verify two things: whether Place Ville Marie was indeed a tallest building and whether its duration as the tallest was the least.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different building along with details like the years it was the tallest, how many years that was, height, etc. The column \"years as tallest\" shows the period each building held the title, and \"of years as tallest\" specifies the duration in years.\n\nLet me scan through each building's tenure:\n\n1. Notre Dame Basilica: 99 years\n2. Royal Bank Building: 3 years\n3. Sun Life Building: 31 years\n4. Tour CIBC: less than 1 year\n5. Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n6. Tour de la Bourse: 28 years\n7. 1000 de la Gaucheti\u00e8re: 21 years (current)\n\nNow, the claim is that Place Ville Marie held the title for the least amount of time. So I need to find which building has the shortest duration.\n\nLooking at the durations:\n\n- Tour CIBC: <1 year\n- Royal Bank: 3 years\n- Place Ville Marie: 2 years\n\nWait a minute, Tour CIBC only held the title for less than a year, which is shorter than Place Ville Marie's 2 years. So Place Ville Marie isn't actually the shortest; Tour CIBC was even shorter.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Place Ville Marie was the tallest building for the least amount of time is FALSE because Tour CIBC had an even shorter duration.\n\nTo support this, I'll note the relevant cells:\n\n- For Place Ville Marie: row index 4, column \"of years as tallest\" with 2 years.\n- For Tour CIBC: row index 3, same column with <1 year.\n\nSo the claim is incorrect because there's a building that held the title for even less time than Place Ville Marie. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the sun life building remain the tallest building in montreal for the same amount of time as the notre dame basilica\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns in the table that can help me verify this claim. The key information needed is the duration each building held the title as the tallest. \n\nLooking at the table structure, the column \"of years as tallest\" seems to contain the exact durations. Additionally, the \"years as tallest\" column shows the time periods they were the tallest.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the rows for both buildings:**\n   - Notre Dame Basilica is in row 0.\n   - Sun Life Building is in row 2.\n\n2. **Extract the duration each was the tallest:**\n   - For Notre Dame Basilica, under \"of years as tallest,\" it's listed as 99 years.\n   - For Sun Life Building, under the same column, it's listed as 31 years.\n\n3. **Compare the durations:**\n   - 99 years (Notre Dame) vs. 31 years (Sun Life). They are not equal.\n\n4. **Check for any discrepancies or possible misinterpretations:**\n   - I'll double-check if \"of years as tallest\" is indeed the correct column. It seems so, as it directly states the duration.\n   - The time periods in \"years as tallest\" also confirm that Notre Dame was from 1829-1928 (99 years) and Sun Life from 1931-1962 (31 years).\n\nSince the durations are different, the claim is FALSE. I'll note the relevant cells for both buildings to support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both buildings were the tallest for the same duration. However, according to the table:\n\n- Notre Dame Basilica was the tallest for 99 years (1829 - 1928).\n- Sun Life Building was the tallest for 31 years (1931 - 1962).\n\nSince 99 years is not equal to 31 years, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"of years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
