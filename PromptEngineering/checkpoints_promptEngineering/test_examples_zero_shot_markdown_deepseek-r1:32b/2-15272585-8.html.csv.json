    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what this problem is about. So, I have a table with some tennis match data, and there's a claim that \"Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE by checking the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. It has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a match that Galina Voskoboeva participated in, with details about each match.\n\nThe claim mentions playing 3 games on hard courts. So, I should look for entries where the surface is 'hard' or 'hard (i)' as per the table. Then, count how many such matches there are.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: Surface is 'hard (i)'. That's a hard court match.\n2. Second row: Surface is 'hard (i)'. Another hard court match.\n3. Third row: Surface is 'clay'. Not relevant for the claim.\n4. Fourth row: Surface is 'hard'. This counts as well.\n5. Fifth row: Surface is 'clay'. Not relevant.\n\nSo, rows 0, 1, and 3 have surfaces that are hard courts. That makes three matches in total on hard surfaces.\n\nNow, checking if each of these matches involved Galina Voskoboeva playing. The table lists her as the player since all the opponents are different. Each row represents a match she was part of, either winning or losing.\n\nSo, there are three games where she played on a hard court. That supports the claim.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Are any other rows relevant? The fifth row is clay, so no. Rows 0,1,3: that's three matches on hard courts. So yes, the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"galina voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Galina Voskoboeva played 20% of her games on clay courts. To verify this, I'll need to look at each relevant entry in the table and count how many times she played on clay versus other surfaces.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five entries. Each row represents a game she either won or was a runner-up in. The \"surface\" column indicates the type of court used for each game.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Outcome is runner-up, date January 28, 2003, tournament Tipton, surface hard (i), opponent Matea Mezak. So, this was a hard court.\n2. **Row 1**: Outcome is winner, June 29, 2003, Mont-de-Marsan, surface hard (i). Another hard court match.\n3. **Row 2**: Runner-up on October 3, 2003, Latina tournament, surface clay against Roberta Vinci. This is a clay court.\n4. **Row 3**: Runner-up on November 8, 2005, Pittsburgh, surface hard. Another hard court.\n5. **Row 4**: Winner on June 6, 2006, Cuneo, Italy, surface clay against Alice Canepa. This is another clay court.\n\nNow, let's count the number of games played on clay. Rows 2 and 4 are clay surfaces, so that's two matches. The total number of games in the table is five.\n\nTo find the percentage: (Number of clay games / Total games) * 100 = (2/5)*100 = 40%.\n\nThe claim says she played 20% on clay courts, but according to the table, it's actually 40%. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant in making this determination. The \"surface\" column across all rows was important because I needed to count how many times clay was mentioned versus other surfaces. Additionally, the \"outcome\" and other details are not directly relevant for determining the surface type percentage, so they don't factor into the verification.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE as Galina Voskoboeva played 40% of her games on clay courts according to the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Looking through each row under the \"opponent\" column: the opponents listed are Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. I don't see Galina Voskoboeva's name anywhere in this table. \n\nSince she isn't an opponent in any of these matches, there's no data about her performance on clay or hard courts here.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"Galina Voskoboeva never played the same opponent more than once\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Galina Voskoboeva did not face any of her opponents more than once in the matches listed in the table. So, I need to check if any opponent appears more than once across all the rows in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. The relevant column here is \"opponent\" because that's where the names of her opponents are listed.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row and list out the opponents:\n\n1. First row: Opponent is Matea Mezak.\n2. Second row: Opponent is Oleksandra Kravets.\n3. Third row: Opponent is Roberta Vinci.\n4. Fourth row: Opponent is Lilia Osterloh.\n5. Fifth row: Opponent is Alice Canepa.\n\nSo the opponents listed are Matea Mezak, Oleksandra Kravets, Roberta Vinci, Lilia Osterloh, and Alice Canepa. Each of these names appears only once in the opponent column across all rows.\n\nSince none of the opponents repeat, it means that Galina Voskoboeva played each of them only once in the matches shown here.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"on average, Galina Voskoboeva lose with only 4 points\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that on average, Galina loses her matches and scores only 4 points per set. But wait, in tennis, scoring isn't just about points; it's about games won within sets. So when they say \"lose with only 4 points,\" I think they might be referring to the number of games she lost in a set.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five matches listed. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. **First Row**: Outcome is runner-up on January 28, 2003. She played against Matea Mezak on a hard court. The score was 6-4, 4-6, 4-6. So in this match, she lost the first set 4-6 and then two more sets. Each set is a separate count of games.\n\n2. **Second Row**: She's the winner on June 29, 2003. She played against Oleksandra Kravets. The score was 6-4, 6-2. Since she won both sets, this doesn't affect her losing average.\n\n3. **Third Row**: Runner-up again on October 3, 2003. Opponent is Roberta Vinci on clay. Score: 3-6, 4-6. She lost both sets, scoring 3 and 4 games each set.\n\n4. **Fourth Row**: Runner-up on November 8, 2005. Opponent is Lilia Osterloh. Score: 6-7, 4-6. So in the first set, she lost 6-7, and the second set 4-6.\n\n5. **Fifth Row**: Winner on June 6, 2006. She played Alice Canepa on clay. Score was 6-1, 6-2. These are wins, so they don't affect her losing stats.\n\nNow, focusing only on the matches where she lost (runner-up), let's extract the sets she lost:\n\n- First match: two sets lost with scores 4 and 4.\n- Third match: two sets lost with scores 3 and 4.\n- Fourth match: one set lost with score 6 (since 6-7 is a loss in that set, meaning she scored 6 games) and another set lost with 4.\n\nWait, actually, the way tennis scoring works, each set is won when a player reaches at least 6 games with a two-game lead. So for each set, I need to note how many games she had (the lower number if she lost that set).\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\n1. **First Match**:\n   - Set 1: She scored 4, opponent 6 \u2192 lost this set.\n   - Set 2: She scored 6, opponent 4 \u2192 won.\n   - Set 3: She scored 4, opponent 6 \u2192 lost.\n\n2. **Third Match**:\n   - Both sets she lost: 3-6 and 4-6 \u2192 so her scores were 3 and 4.\n\n3. **Fourth Match**:\n   - Set 1: 7-6 (opponent wins), so Galina scored 6.\n   - Set 2: 4-6, so she scored 4.\n\nSo compiling all the sets where she lost:\n\nFrom first match:\n- 4 and 4 points? Wait, no. Points are different from games. Each game is a set of points, but in the table, the scores show the number of games won per set. So each score like 6-4 refers to games, not points.\n\nThe claim is about losing with only 4 points on average. But the table shows the number of games she lost in each set. To get an average of points, I would need more detailed data than what's provided here.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is misphrased and actually refers to games instead of points. Let me assume that for a moment. If so, looking at all her losses:\n\nFrom first match:\n- Set 1: lost with 4 games\n- Set 3: lost with 4 games\n\nThird match:\n- Set 1: lost with 3 games\n- Set 2: lost with 4 games\n\nFourth match:\n- Set 1: lost with 6 games (since it was 7-6)\n- Set 2: lost with 4 games\n\nSo total sets lost where she lost:\n\nTotal number of sets lost is 5.\n\nCalculating the average games per lost set:\n\nShe had scores of 4,4,3,4,6 in her lost sets. Summing those up: 4+4+3+4+6 = 21. Divided by 5 sets: 21/5 = 4.2.\n\nIf the claim is about average games per set when she loses being around 4, then it's close to that. However, the original table shows more than just 4 points; in some cases, she had higher or lower games.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"lose with only 4 point,\" which might be a translation error and should probably refer to games instead of points. If we take it as games, then her average is about 4.2 per set when she loses.\n\nBut if the claim strictly refers to points, we don't have enough data because each game can vary in points. So without knowing how many points were played in each game, we can't determine the exact number of points she scored on average when losing.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the table, which only shows games and not points, we cannot accurately verify the claim about the average points per loss. The data isn't sufficient to support or refute it conclusively.\n</think>\n\nThe table provides Galina Voskoboeva's match outcomes, including scores which indicate games won per set, not individual points. The claim references an average of 4 points lost, but without point-level data, we cannot verify this. Thus, the claim is unsupported by the given information.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"galina voskoboeva play 20% of her game on a clay top tennis court and 1% on hard.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table. There are five rows with outcomes, dates, tournaments, surfaces, opponents, and scores. Each row represents a match played by Galina Voskoboeva.\n\nI need to determine how many of her games were on clay versus hard surfaces. The claim says 20% on clay and 1% on hard, which seems a bit unusual because usually, percentages add up more meaningfully, but let's check the data.\n\nLooking at the 'surface' column:\n\n- Row 0: hard (i)\n- Row 1: hard (i)\n- Row 2: clay\n- Row 3: hard\n- Row 4: clay\n\nSo there are two rows where the surface is clay and three where it's hard. That means out of five matches, 2 were on clay and 3 on hard.\n\nCalculating percentages:\n- Clay: (2/5)*100 = 40%\n- Hard: (3/5)*100 = 60%\n\nThe claim states 20% on clay and 1% on hard. That doesn't match the data at all. So, the claim is false.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for this conclusion:\n\nFor each row that has surface 'clay' or 'hard', we need to note them because they contribute to the percentage calculation. \n\nSo, rows with index 0 (hard), 1 (hard), 2 (clay), 3 (hard), and 4 (clay) are all relevant. Specifically, each of these has the 'surface' column.\n\nTherefore, each row's 'surface' cell is relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Galina Voskoboeva played 40% of her games on clay and 60% on hard surfaces according to the table data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says she has an equal winrate between clay and hard courts but never wins.\n\nFirst, let's look at the table structure. It has columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score. Each row represents a match result for Galina Voskoboeva.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Outcome is runner-up on a hard court (hard (i)). She lost to Matea Mezak with scores 6-4, 4-6, 4-6.\n2.

On clay, she has 1 win and 1 loss.\n\nThe claim says her winrate is equal between both surfaces. Let's check that.\n\nWinrate is calculated as wins divided by total matches. For hard courts: 1/(1+2) = 1/3 \u2248 33.3%. For clay: 1/(1+1) = 0.5, or 50%.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time except in 6 june 2006.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly this claim is stating. It seems like it's saying that Galina Voskoboeva only played against each of her opponents once, except for one instance on June 6, 2006. So, in other words, all her opponents appear only once in the table, and she might have played one opponent twice on June 6.\n\nBut looking at the table provided, I don't see any mention of Galina Voskoboeva as a player. The table lists outcomes where someone is either a winner or runner-up, but it doesn't specify who the players are beyond their opponents. For example, in the first row, Matea Mezak is listed as the opponent with the outcome being \"runner-up\" on January 28, 2003. Similarly, other rows list different opponents like Oleksandra Kravets and Roberta Vinci.\n\nSince Galina Voskoboeva isn't present in any of these rows, it's unclear who she is in relation to the table. The claim might be about her as a player, but without her being listed, I can't verify if she played against any opponents multiple times or not.\n\nAdditionally, the dates in the table don't include June 6, 2006. Wait, no\u2014the last row does have \"6 june 2006\" as the date. That's a bit confusing because the claim mentions that exception is on that date. But again, since Galina isn't listed, I can't tell if she was involved in that match or not.\n\nSo putting it all together: The table doesn't include any mention of Galina Voskoboeva. Therefore, there's no way to verify whether she played opponents more than once or if the exception on June 6, 2006, applies to her. Since the claim is about her actions and the table lacks information about her, the claim can't be supported by the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because we don't have enough evidence from the table to confirm Galina Voskoboeva's match history as described in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't mention \"galina voskoboeva\" at all. Without any information about her matches or opponents, it's impossible to verify if she played any opponent more than once except on June 6, 2006.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
