The claim states: \"twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007, where the score be 22 - 12.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look for the row in the table that corresponds to April 6, 2007. Scanning through the dates, the first row has \"6 april 2007.\" That's a match.\n\nNow, checking the venue column for this row: it says \"twickenham stoop,\" which matches the claim. So far, so good.\n\nNext, I'll check the score. The result column shows \"30 - 28\" for that date and venue. However, the claim mentions \"22 - 12.\" This is a discrepancy because the actual score in the table isn't matching the claimed score.\n\nSo, while the venue is correct on April 6, 2007, the score doesn't match. Therefore, the entire claim isn't fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim specifies both the venue and the score for a specific date. While the venue matches, the score does not. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
