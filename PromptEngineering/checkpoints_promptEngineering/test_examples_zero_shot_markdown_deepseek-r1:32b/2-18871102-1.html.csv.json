The claim states: \"olympic have an ihsaa class  / football  / soccer of 4a  /5a /2a and join after 1926\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n1. Olympic has a classification of 4A/5A/2A for IHSAA.\n2. They joined after the year 1926.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various details. The columns include \"school\", \"location\", \"mascot\", \"county\", \"enrollment\", \"ihsaa class / football / soccer\", \"year joined\", and \"previous conference\".\n\nI'll search for any row where the \"previous conference\" is \"olympic\". Scanning through, I see that Huntington North has \"olympic\" listed under previous conference. So this must be the school referred to in the claim.\n\nNow, checking Huntington North's details:\n- The ihsaa class / football / soccer is 4A/5A/2A, which matches the claim.\n- The year joined is 2003, which is indeed after 1926.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim seems to state that for the school named \"logansport community,\" the mascot should be \"berries.\" I'll need to check the table to see if this matches.\n\nLooking at the table, it's in markdown format with several columns: school, location, mascot, county, enrollment, ihsaa class / football / soccer, year joined, and previous conference. Each row represents a different school.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find where the school is \"logansport community.\" Let's see:\n\n1. The first row is Anderson with mascot Indians.\n2. Second is Huntington North with Vikings.\n3. Third is Kokomo with Wildkats.\n4. Fourth is Logansport Community with Berries as the mascot.\n5. Then Marion has Giants, Muncie Central has Bearcats, New Castle Chrysler has Trojans, and Richmond has Red Devils.\n\nSo, in the fourth row, the school is indeed \"logansport community,\" and its mascot is listed as \"berries.\" This directly supports the claim.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other instances of Logansport Community or any possible typos. Looking through all rows, it's only mentioned once. There are no other entries for Logansport, so I don't have to worry about multiple schools with similar names.\n\nTherefore, since the table clearly shows that Logansport Community has the mascot berries, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table where Logansport Community's mascot is listed as berries.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"school\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"mascot\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The main pieces of information are:\n\n1. School name: Huntington North\n2. Mascot: Viking\n3.

Let's note this as row index 1 (assuming rows are zero-indexed).\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. **School Name**: The school name in the table is indeed \"huntington north\" which matches the claim.\n\n2. **Mascot**: Looking at the \"mascot\" column for this row, it's listed as \"vikings.\" The claim mentions \"viking\" (singular). I need to consider if there might be a typo or inconsistency here. However, \"vikings\" is plural, but sometimes mascots are referred to in singular form informally. So while the exact wording doesn't match, the essence does\u2014Huntington North's mascot is Vikings, so the claim's use of \"viking\" could be considered correct depending on context.\n\n3. **Year Joined**: The table shows \"year joined\" as 2003 for Huntington North, which matches exactly with the claim.\n\nNow, considering whether to mark this as TRUE or FALSE. While the mascot has a slight discrepancy in number (plural vs singular), it's still referring to the same entity. Given that other parts of the claim are accurate and the mascot part is essentially correct despite minor wording differences, I would lean towards TRUE.\n\nHowever, if strict adherence to exact wording is required, \"vikings\" vs \"viking\" might be a reason to consider FALSE.

It seems there are two main conditions here:\n1. The school must have a 'year joined' value less than 1926.\n2.

Since it's not less than 1926, this doesn't meet the first condition.\n\nNext, Huntington North.\n- County is 35 huntington.\n- Year joined: 2003, which is more than 1926. So, it doesn't satisfy the year condition.\n- Previous conference is Olympic, not independents.\n\nKokomo:\n- Year joined: 1926.

So, there are two main conditions here:\n\n1. The school's previous conference is \"independents.\"\n2. The ihsaa class/football/soccer is exactly \"3a / 4a / 2a.\"\n3. Additionally, the year joined must be larger than 1926.\n\nWait, no\u2014the way it's phrased might have two conditions: previous conference is independent AND (ihsaa class... of 3a/4a/2a and year join >1926). Or maybe the claim is that among schools with ihsaa class 3a/4a/2a, their previous conference was independent and they joined after 1926. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nLet's check each school to see if they meet all three conditions:\n\n- Previous Conference: \"independents\"\n- ihsaa class / football / soccer: exactly \"3a / 4a / 2a\"\n- Year Joined > 1926\n\nLet me go row by row.\n\n1. Anderson:\n   - Previous conference: independents\n   - ihsaa class: 4a/5a/2a \u2192 Not matching 3a/4a/2a.\n   So doesn't meet the second condition.\n\n2.

Muncie Central:\n   - Previous: independents\n   - ihsaa class: 3a/4a/2a \u2192 This matches the second condition!\n   Now check year joined: 1926.

Richmond:\n   - Previous: independents\n   - ihsaa class: 4a/5a/2a \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nSo, only Muncie Central has the correct ihsaa class and previous conference as independent, but its year joined is exactly 1926, not larger. Therefore, there's no school in the table that meets all three conditions.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me double-check. Huntington North had a different conference, so it doesn't count.
