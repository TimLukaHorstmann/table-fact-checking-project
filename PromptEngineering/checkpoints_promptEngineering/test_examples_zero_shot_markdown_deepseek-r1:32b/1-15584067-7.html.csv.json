    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"erica montolfo  - bura write an episode which gain 1.81 million viewer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down what this claim is asserting. It's saying that Erica Montolfo-Bura wrote an episode, and that particular episode had exactly 1.81 million viewers in the US. \n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: \"no in series\", \"no in season\", \"title\", \"directed by\", \"written by\", \"original air date\", and \"us viewers (million)\". The relevant columns here are \"written by\" and \"us viewers (million)\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check if Erica Montolfo-Bura is listed under the \"written by\" column. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 0: Written by Mara Brock Akil. Not her.\n- Row 1: Written by Erica Montolfo-Bura. Okay, so that's one episode she wrote. Let me check how many viewers it had. The US viewers for this row are 1.81 million. \n\nSo, the claim is about an episode written by Erica Montolfo-Bura with exactly 1.81 million viewers. From row index 1, we can see that's correct.\n\nI don't need to check further because I've already found a match in the first relevant row. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Erica Montolfo-Bura wrote an episode (\"We Gotta Stop Meeting Like This\") which had exactly 1.81 million viewers.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (million)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the title of episode 102 in the series be we gotta stop meeting like this.\" Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is asking. It's saying that the episode numbered 102 in the series has the title \"we gotta stop meeting like this.\" To verify this, I'll need to look at the table and find the row where the \"no in series\" column is 102.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details about its number in the series, season, title, etc. The relevant columns here are \"no in series\" and \"title.\" \n\nI'll go through each row to find where \"no in series\" is exactly 102. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 0: no in series is 100-101\n- Row 1: no in series is 102\n\nSo, the second row (index 1) has \"no in series\" as 102. Now, checking the title for this row. The title column shows \"we gotta stop meeting like this.\" \n\nThis matches exactly with what the claim states. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because episode number 102 does have that specific title.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion:\n\n- The cell in row 1 (index starts at 0) under \"no in series\" is where we found the episode number 102.\n- The corresponding cell in the same row under \"title\" confirms the title.\n\nSo, these two cells are crucial for verifying the claim. No other rows or columns are needed since they don't contribute to this specific check.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"kenny smith write number 11 in the season\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The phrase \"number 11 in the season\" likely refers to the episode that is the 11th in its season. Looking at the table, there's a column called \"no in season.\" I'll search for the row where \"no in season\" is 11.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\nRow indices go from 0 to 16 (since there are 17 rows). Let me check each row's \"no in season\" value. \n\n- Row 9 has \"no in season\" as 11. So that's the episode in question.\n\nNext, I need to find out who wrote this episode. The claim states that Kenny Smith is the writer for number 11. So, I should check the \"written by\" column for row 9.\n\nIn row 9, under the \"written by\" column, it says \"kenny smith.\" That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, to be thorough, let's verify other details related to this episode just in case there are any discrepancies. The title is \"the busted episode,\" directed by Bille Woodruff, and aired on July 2, 2013. The US viewers were around 3.58 million. All these details seem consistent with what I know about the series, but since the claim only concerns the writer and the season number, focusing on those is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the claim is true because Kenny Smith indeed wrote episode number 11 in the season.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"no in season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me start by carefully analyzing the claim and then cross-checking it against the data in the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. The key elements are:\n\n- Director: eric laneuville\n- Episode number in series: 106\n\nI need to find if there is a row where the \"directed by\" column has \"eric laneuville\" and the \"no in series\" column includes 106.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with various details. The columns are:\n\n- no in series\n- no in season\n- title\n- directed by\n- written by\n- original air date\n- us viewers (million)\n\nI'll go through each row to check if any have \"eric laneuville\" as the director and whether that row corresponds to episode number 106.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Directed by salim akil, no in series 100-101. Not relevant.\nRow 1: Also directed by salim akil, no in series 102. Not Eric.\nRow 2: Same director, nope.\nRow 3: Salim again, no.\nRow 4: Mary lou belli directs episode 105.\nRow 5: Episode 106 is directed by mary lou belli as well.\nWait, that's the first mention of episode 106. Let me check row indices properly.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe rows are listed from 0 to 17 (since there are 18 entries). So, each row index corresponds to its position in the list starting from 0.\n\nLet me find which row has \"no in series\" as 106. Scanning through:\n\nRow 5: no in series is 106, directed by mary lou belli.\nSo, the director for episode 106 is Mary Lou Belli, not Eric Laneuville.\n\nNow, checking if Eric Laneuville directed any episodes:\n\nLooking at the \"directed by\" column across all rows. I see entries like salim akil, mary lou belli, billie woodruff, etc., but eric laneuville is only in row 17: directed by eric laneuville for episode 118.\n\nTherefore, Eric Laneuville directed episode 118, not 106. Episode 106 was directed by Mary Lou Belli.\n\nThus, the claim that \"eric laneuville direct episode 106 in the series\" is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Eric Laneuville directed episode 106. Checking the table, episode 106 (row index 5) was directed by Mary Lou Belli, not Eric Laneuville. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"directed by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"no in series\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"episode 102 air multiple time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by carefully examining the table and understanding what information it contains.\n\nFirst, looking at the table structure: each row represents an episode with details like the number in series, number in season, title, director, writer, original air date, and US viewers in millions. The columns are 'no in series', 'no in season', 'title', 'directed by', 'written by', 'original air date', and 'us viewers (million)'.\n\nThe claim is about episode 102 airing multiple times. So I need to check if there's more than one entry for episode 102 in the table, or perhaps whether it has multiple air dates listed.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Episode numbers 100-101 (no in series), season 1-2, titled \"the blueprint\", aired March 26, 2013.\n- Row 1: Episode 102, season 3, titled \"we gotta stop meeting like this\", aired April 2, 2013.\n- The rest of the rows go from episode 103 up to 118.\n\nI see that episode 102 is only listed once in row 1. It has a single original air date on April 2, 2013. There's no other entry for episode 102 in the table. Therefore, based on this data, it doesn't appear that episode 102 aired multiple times.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of an error or missing data. The claim might imply that the episode was rerun or aired more than once on different dates. However, looking at the 'original air date' column for each row, I don't see another entry with the same original air date as episode 102. Each subsequent episode has a unique air date moving forward in time.\n\nSince there's only one occurrence of episode 102 and it aired on April 2, 2013, without any duplicates or additional entries for the same episode number, the claim that \"episode 102 air multiple time\" doesn't hold true according to the data provided. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"original air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"kenny smith write everything before season 11\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Kenny Smith wrote every episode before season 11. So, I should check all episodes with \"no in season\" less than 11 and see if their \"written by\" column lists Kenny Smith as the sole writer or at least a co-writer.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like the number in series, number in season, title, director, writer(s), air date, and viewership. The relevant columns here are \"no in season\" and \"written by\".\n\nI'll start by listing out all episodes where \"no in season\" is less than 11. From the table:\n\n- Season 1: Episodes 1-2 (Rows 0 and 1)\n- Season 3-10: Rows 2 to 9\n\nWait, actually, looking at the \"no in season\" column:\nRow 0 has 1-2, which is seasons 1 and 2.\nRows 1 to 9 have seasons 3 through 10.\n\nSo all episodes up to season 10 are before season 11. Now, I need to check each of these rows to see if Kenny Smith was the writer.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Written by Mara Brock Akil and Salim Akil. No mention of Kenny Smith.\nRow 1: Written by Erica Montolfo-Bura. Not Kenny.\nRow 2: Written by Marcos Luevanos. Not Kenny.\nRow 3: Written by Kenya Barris. Not Kenny.\nRow 4: Written by Hale Rothstein. Not Kenny.\nRow 5: Same as row 4.\nRow 6: Jenifer Rice-Genzuk Henry. No.\nRow 7: Erica Montolfo-Bura again. Not Kenny.\nRow 8: Keki Smith? Wait, no\u2014it's Keki Smith? Wait, in the table it's \"kenny smith\" for row 9. Let me check.\n\nWait, row 9 is season 10, written by Kenny Smith. So that one is written by him. But what about the others?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: Mara and Salim Akil.\nRow 1: Erica.\nRow 2: Marcos.\nRow 3: Kenya.\nRows 4-5: Hale.\nRow 6: Jenifer.\nRow 7: Erica again.\nRow 8: Keki? Wait, no\u2014it's actually \"kenny smith\" in row 9 (season 10). So before that, up to season 10, only row 9 has Kenny as writer. The rest are written by others.\n\nSo the claim says Kenny wrote everything before season 11. But from the table, he only wrote one episode (season 10) and others were written by different people. Therefore, the claim is false because not all episodes before season 11 were written by him.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\n\nFor each row where \"no in season\" <11, check if \"written by\" includes Kenny Smith.\n\nRelevant rows are 0 to 9 (since row 10 is season 11). But actually, looking at row indices:\n\nRow 0: season 1-2\nRows 1-9: seasons 3-10\n\nSo the relevant cells would be all \"written by\" columns in these rows.\n\nWait, but to check if any of them are not written by Kenny Smith. So each of these rows' \"written by\" should have Kenny for the claim to be true. Since some don't, we can pick a few examples where it's not him.\n\nBut according to instructions, I need to list all relevant cells that were checked. That means for every episode before season 11 (rows 0-9), their \"written by\" column is relevant.\n\nSo the \"relevant_ cells\" should include row indices 0 through 9, each with \"written_by\".\n\nThus, the answer is FALSE, and the relevant cells are rows 0-9 in the \"written by\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"written by\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"written by\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
