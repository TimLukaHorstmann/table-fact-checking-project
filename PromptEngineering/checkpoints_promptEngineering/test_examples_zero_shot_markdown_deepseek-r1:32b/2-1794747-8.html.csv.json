    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"imelda staunton win the laurence olivier award for best actress in a musical category in 2013.\" Okay, so the key points here are Imelda Staunton winning the Laurence Olivier Award in the Best Actress in a Musical category in 2013.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided. The table has several columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. There are seven rows of data here, each representing different awards or nominations.\n\nI'll start by checking the year mentioned in the claim, which is 2013. I need to look for all entries where the year is 2013. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row is 2012, so that's not relevant.\n- Rows 2 through 7 are all from 2013.\n\nNext, the award ceremony in question is the Laurence Olivier Award. Let me confirm which rows have this as the award ceremony. Looking at the \"award ceremony\" column:\n\n- Row 1: Evening Standard Award (year 2012) \u2013 not relevant.\n- Rows 2 to 7: Laurence Olivier Award.\n\nSo, focusing on rows 2 through 7 now.\n\nThe category in question is Best Actress in a Musical. I need to find the row where the category matches this. Checking each row:\n\n- Row 2: Best musical revival\n- Row 3: Best actor in a musical\n- Row 4: Best actress in a musical\n\nAh, here we go. So row 4 has the category \"best actress in a musical.\" Let me check the other details.\n\nThe nominee for this category is Imelda Staunton. The result column says \"won.\" That aligns perfectly with the claim. \n\nSo to recap: In 2013, at the Laurence Olivier Award ceremony, Imelda Staunton was nominated in the Best Actress in a Musical category and won.\n\nI should make sure there are no other entries that contradict this. Let's look through all rows again for any possible conflicts:\n\n- All other categories in 2013 either have different nominees or results like \"nominated,\" but nothing conflicting with Imelda's win.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects that Imelda Staunton won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 2013 as shown in row 4 of the table. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"imelda staunton be the nominee in 2012\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The rows are indexed from 0 to 6 as per the markdown table.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: Imelda Staunton and the year 2012. So I need to check if there's a row where the year is 2012 and the nominee is Imelda Staunton.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2012, category \"best musical\", nominee \"best musical\" \u2013 not Imelda.\n- Rows 1 to 6 are all from 2013. So for year 2012, only row 0 is relevant.\n\nIn row 0, the nominee is listed as \"best musical,\" which I assume refers to a production or perhaps an award category rather than a person. The result is \"won.\" Since Imelda Staunton's name doesn't appear in any of the 2012 entries, and she only shows up in 2013 for her acting awards.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry where Imelda Staunton was nominated in 2012. The claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Imelda Staunton was a nominee in 2012. Checking the table, the only 2012 entry has \"best musical\" as the nominee, not a person. Imelda's entries are all from 2013.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
