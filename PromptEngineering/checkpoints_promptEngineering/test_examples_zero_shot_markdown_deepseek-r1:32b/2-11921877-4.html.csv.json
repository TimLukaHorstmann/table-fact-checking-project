Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim mentions there being two members of the Irish Parliamentary Party. So, my first step is to look through the table and identify any entries where the political party column says \"irish parliamentary party.\" \n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"political party\" column. I'll go through each row one by one.\n\nRow 0: Political party is Conservative.\nRow 1: Also Conservative.\nRow 2: Liberal Unionist Party.\nRow 3: Liberal Unionist Party.\nRow 4: Unionist.\nRow 5: Liberal.\nRow 6: Conservative.\nRow 7: Conservative.\nRow 8: Conservative.\nRow 9: Independent Unionist.\nRow 10: Irish Parliamentary Party \u2013 okay, that's one member. Row index 10.\nRow 11: Next row is Captain William Hoey Kearney Redmond, political party is Irish Parliamentary Party. That's the second one. Row index 11.\n\nWait, but I should check all rows to make sure there are only two. Let me continue.\n\nRows 12 through 24:\n\nRow 12: Liberal.\nRow 13: Liberal.\nRow 14: Liberal.\nRow 15: Ulster Unionist Party.\nRow 16: Liberal.\nRow 17: Conservative.\nRow 18: Liberal.\nRow 19: Conservative.\nRow 20: Liberal Party.\nRow 21: Conservative.\nRow 22: Conservative.\nRow 23: Conservative.\nRow 24: Conservative.\n\nSo, I found two instances where the political party is \"irish parliamentary party\" at rows 10 and 11. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there are exactly two members of that party listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two members of the Irish Parliamentary Party. Checking each row's political party column reveals two such members.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"there be 5 member who be the rank of lieutenant\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: rank in military, name, born, killed, political party, and mp's seat. The claim is about the number of members with the rank of \"lieutenant.\"\n\nI need to go through each row and check if their rank is exactly \"lieutenant.\" Let me count them one by one.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n1. Row 0: Lieutenant Colonel - not lieutenant.\n2. Row 1: Lieutenant Colonel - same as above.\n3. Row 2: Lieutenant Colonel - same.\n4. Row 3: Lieutenant Colonel - same.\n5. Row 4: Lieutenant Colonel - same.\n6. Row 5: Major - nope.\n7. Row 6: Major - same.\n8. Row 7: Major - same.\n9. Row 8: Major - same.\n10. Row 9: Major - same.\n11. Row 10: Captain - not lieutenant.\n12. Row 11: Captain - same.\n13. Row 12: Captain - same.\n14. Row 13: Captain - same.\n15. Row 14: Captain - same.\n16. Row 15: Captain - same.\n17. Row 16: Captain - same.\n18. Row 17: Captain - same.\n19. Row 18: Captain - same.\n20. Row 19: Captain - same.\n21. Row 20: Lieutenant - yes, this is one.\n22. Row 21: Lieutenant - another.\n23. Row 22: Lieutenant - third.\n24. Row 23: Lieutenant - fourth.\n25. Row 24: Lieutenant - fifth.\n\nWait a second, that's five lieutenants in rows 20 to 24. So the claim says there are five members with the rank of lieutenant, and according to my count, that's exactly correct.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any or include anyone incorrectly. Let me double-check each row from 20 onwards:\n- Row 20: Lieutenant - correct.\n- Row 21: Lieutenant - correct.\n- Row 22: Lieutenant - correct.\n- Row 23: Lieutenant - correct.\n- Row 24: 2nd lieutenant - Oh, wait. The claim specifies \"lieutenant,\" not \"2nd lieutenant.\" So row 24 is actually a 2nd lieutenant, which might be considered different.\n\nHmm, that changes things. Now I have four lieutenants (rows 20-23) and one 2nd lieutenant (row 24). The claim says five members with the rank of \"lieutenant,\" but row 24 is a different rank. So does that count as a lieutenant?\n\nThe table distinguishes between \"Lieutenant\" and \"2nd Lieutenant.\" Therefore, only the rows where the rank is exactly \"Lieutenant\" should be counted. That would make four lieutenants (rows 20-23), not five.\n\nWait, but let me recount:\nRows with \"Lieutenant\":\n- Row 20: yes\n- Row 21: yes\n- Row 22: yes\n- Row 23: yes\n\nThat's four. The fifth row is a 2nd Lieutenant, which isn't the same as just \"Lieutenant.\" So the claim states there are five, but according to this, it's only four.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE because there aren't five lieutenants in the table. There are four, and one more who is a 2nd Lieutenant, which doesn't count as per the exact rank mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is that \"all of the members of parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom die between 1914 and 1918.\" I need to check if this is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns like rank in military, name, born, killed, political party, and MP's seat. The relevant information here would be the 'killed' column because that indicates when each MP died.\n\nI need to go through each row and check the 'killed' year for every MP listed. Let's start from the top:\n\n1. Charles Duncombe: Killed in 1916 - within the range.\n2. Guy Baring: Killed in 1916 - okay.\n3. Lord Crichton-Stuart: Killed in 1915 - still within the timeframe.\n4. Percy Clive: Died in 1918, which is on the upper end of the claim.\n5. Duncan Campbell: Killed in 1916.\n6. Charles Lyell: Died in 1918.\n7. Lord Thynne: Also died in 1918.\n8. Valentine Fleming: Killed in 1917.\n9. Philip Glazebrook: 1918.\n10. Francis Bennett-Goldney: 1918 as well.\n\nContinuing down, the next few entries:\n\n11. William Redmond: Died in 1917.\n12. John Esmonde: 1915.\n13. Thomas Agar-Robartes: Killed in 1915.\n14. Harold Cawley: 1915.\n15. Oswald Cawley: 1918.\n16. Arthur O'Neill: Wait, he died in 1914? Oh, that's within the range since 1914 is included as the start year.\n\nThen:\n\n17. Neil Primrose: Died in 1917.\n18. Michael Hicks-Beach: Killed in 1916.\n19. Francis McLaren: 1917.\n20. Charles Mills: 1915.\n21. William Walrond: 1915.\n22. Thomas Kettle: Died in 1916.\n23. William Gladstone: Killed in 1915.\n24. Gerald Arbuthnot: 1916.\n\nLooking through all these, it seems every MP listed was killed between 1914 and 1918. There are no entries where the 'killed' year is outside this range.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"most of the member of the parliament of the united kingdom be captain\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The claim states that most MPs were captains. So, I should check how many of the listed members had the rank of captain and see if it's more than half.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows with different ranks. The relevant columns here are \"rank in military\" and \"mp 's seat\". Each row represents an MP with their respective details.\n\nI'll go through each row to count how many were captains. \n\nRow 1: rank is lieutenant colonel \u2013 not captain.\nRow 2: same as above.\nRow 3: same.\nRows continue, I see that starting from the beginning:\n\n- The first four rows have ranks of lieutenant colonel or major; none are captains yet.\n\nThen, looking further down:\nRow 6: major\nRow 7: major\n... and so on until I reach the captain ranks. Let's list them:\n\nStarting around row 12, \"captain\" appears for William Hoey Kearney Redmond.\nThen Dr John Joseph Esmonde is also a captain (row 13).\nLord Thomas Agar-Robartes is a captain in row 14.\nHarold Cawley \u2013 row 15: captain.\nOswald Cawley, Arthur O'Neill, Neil Primrose, Michael Hicks-Beach are all captains. So that's rows 16 to 20.\n\nWait, actually, let me count each row:\n\nLooking through the table from top to bottom:\nRow indices (assuming starting at 0):\nRow 0: lieutenant colonel\nRow 1: same\nRow 2: same\nRow 3: same\nRow 4: same\nRow 5: major\nRow 6: major\nRow 7: major\nRow 8: major\nRow 9: major\nRow 10: captain \u2013 yes, row 10.\nRow 11: captain \u2013 row 11.\nRow 12: captain \u2013 row 12.\nRow 13: captain \u2013 row 13.\nRow 14: captain \u2013 row 14.\nRow 15: captain \u2013 row 15.\nRow 16: captain \u2013 row 16.\nRow 17: captain \u2013 row 17?\nWait, let me recount.\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe table has 28 rows (from rank in military to the last entry). Let's count each row where rank is 'captain':\n\n- Row 10: Captain\n- Row 11: Captain\n- Row 12: Captain\n- Row 13: Captain\n- Row 14: Captain\n- Row 15: Captain\n- Row 16: Captain\n- Row 17: Captain (Wait, row 17 is a 2nd lieutenant. Let me check again.)\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in counting. The entries for captain start at row 10:\n\nRow 10: Captain\nRow 11: Captain\nRow 12: Captain\nRow 13: Captain\nRow 14: Captain\nRow 15: Captain\nRow 16: Captain\nRow 17: Captain? No, row 17 is 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nWait, the table's rows are as follows:\n\nRows 0-9: Ranks are lieutenant colonel (rows 0-3), major (rows 4-9).\n\nThen, starting at row 10: Captain (William Hoey Kearney Redmond)\nRow 11: Dr John Joseph Esmonde \u2013 Captain\nRow 12: Lord Thomas Agar-Robartes \u2013 Captain\nRow 13: Harold Cawley \u2013 Captain\nRow 14: Oswald Cawley \u2013 Captain\nRow 15: Arthur O'Neill \u2013 Captain\nRow 16: Neil Primrose \u2013 Captain\nRow 17: Michael Hicks-Beach \u2013 Captain\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nThe table shows that rows after the first few are as follows:\n\nRow 0: lieutenant colonel\n...\nRow 9: major\nRow 10: captain (William Hoey Kearney Redmond)\nRow 11: captain (Dr John Joseph Esmonde)\nRow 12: captain (Lord Thomas Agar-Robartes)\nRow 13: captain (Harold Cawley)\nRow 14: captain (Oswald Cawley)\nRow 15: captain (Arthur O'Neill)\nRow 16: captain (Neil Primrose)\nRow 17: captain (Michael Hicks-Beach)\nRow 18: 2nd Lieutenant ( Gerald Arbuthnot)\n\nSo, rows 10 to 17 are captains \u2013 that's 8 rows. Row 18 is a 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nNow, the total number of MPs in the table is 28 (since it starts at row 0 and ends at row 27).\n\nOut of these 28, how many were captains? Let's count:\n\nRows with rank 'captain' are rows 10 to 17: that's 8 rows. So 8 MPs were captains.\n\nThe rest have other ranks like lieutenant colonel, major, or 2nd lieutenant.\n\nSo total number of captains is 8. The claim is that \"most\" of the MPs were captains. Since most means more than half, we need to check if 8 is more than half of 28.\n\nHalf of 28 is 14, so 8 is less than 14. Therefore, not most are captains; only a fraction are.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists 28 MPs with various military ranks. Among them, 8 are captains. Since 8 is less than half of 28 (which is 14), the majority were not captains. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_ cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"conservative member be all lieutenant\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll interpret the claim. It seems to suggest that every military member who belongs to the conservative party has the rank of 'lieutenant'. So, for all entries where the political party is 'conservative', their rank should be 'lieutenant'.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple columns: rank in military, name, born, killed, political party, and mp's seat. The relevant columns here are \"rank in military\" and \"political party\".\n\nI'll go through each row to check where the political party is 'conservative' and see what their ranks are.\n\nRow 0:\n- Rank: lieutenant colonel\n- Party: conservative\nThis doesn't match because it's not a 'lieutenant'.\n\nRow 1:\n- Rank: lieutenant colonel\n- Party: conservative\nAgain, not a 'lieutenant'.\n\nRow 5:\n- Rank: major\n- Party: conservative\nNot a 'lieutenant'.\n\nRow 7:\n- Rank: major\n- Party: conservative\nStill not matching.\n\nRow 8:\n- Rank: major\n- Party: conservative\nNo match.\n\nRow 9:\n- Rank: captain (but wait, the rank is major)\nWait, looking back, row 9 has rank 'major', party 'conservative'. So that's another non-lieutenant.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 18:\n- Rank: captain\n- Party: conservative\nNope.\n\nRow 20:\n- Rank: captain\n- Party: conservative\nStill not a lieutenant.\n\nRow 21:\n- Rank: 2nd lieutenant\nWait, 'lieutenant' is mentioned here. So row 21 has rank '2nd lieutenant' and party 'conservative'. That's one case where the claim holds true, but I need to check if all conservative members are lieutenants.\n\nBut earlier rows like row 0 had higher ranks, so not all conservatives are lieutenants. Therefore, the claim is false because there are conservative members with ranks higher than 'lieutenant'.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all conservative members have the rank of lieutenant. However, examining the table shows that some conservative members hold higher ranks like 'lieutenant colonel' and 'major', which contradicts the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"political party\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"political party\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It says there are two majors representing the Irish Parliamentary Party. So I need to check each row in the table for two things: their rank and their political party.\n\nLooking at the \"rank in military\" column, the possible ranks mentioned include lieutenant colonel, major, captain, and 2nd lieutenant. The claim specifically mentions \"major,\" so I'll focus on rows where this is the case.\n\nNow, scanning through each row:\n\nRow 6: Major - Lord Alexander Thynne - Conservative\nRow 7: Major - Valentine Fleming - Conservative\nRow 8: Major - Philip Glazebrook - Conservative\nRow 9: Major - Francis Bennett-Goldney - Independent Unionist\n\nWait, none of these majors are from the Irish Parliamentary Party. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at all the rows, I see that the political parties for the majors are either Conservative or Liberal. Specifically:\n\n- Row 6: Lord Alexander Thynne is a Major with party Conservative\n- Row 7: Valentine Fleming - same here\n- Rows 8 and 9 also have Majors in the Conservative or Independent Unionist parties.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some? Let me go through each row again.\n\nRow 0 to 5 are lieutenant colonels. \n\nRow 6: Major - Lord Alexander Thynne - Conservative\n\nRow 7: Valentine Fleming - Major - Conservative\n\nRow 8: Philip Glazebrook - Major - Conservative\n\nRow 9: Francis Bennett-Goldney - Major - Independent Unionist\n\nRows 10 onwards are Captains or Lieutenants.\n\nSo, in the Majors' section (rows 6-9), none have the Irish Parliamentary Party as their political party. \n\nWait a second\u2014maybe I need to look at all entries where rank is Major regardless of other details. Let me list all the Majors:\n\nRow indices: 6,7,8,9\n\nTheir parties are Conservative, Conservative, Conservative, Independent Unionist.\n\nSo none of them belong to the Irish Parliamentary Party. \n\nNow, checking if any other ranks (like Captains) have this party but were perhaps misread as Majors. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all rows with rank Captain:\n\nRow 10: William Hoey Kearney Redmond - Captain - Irish Parliamentary Party\n\nRow 11: Dr John Joseph Esmonde - Captain - Irish Parliamentary Party\n\nSo there are two Captains from the IPP, but the claim is about Majors. \n\nTherefore, the claim that there are two majors representing the Irish Parliamentary Party is FALSE because in the table, there are no Majors with that party; instead, there are two Captains.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that there are two Majors representing the Irish Parliamentary Party. Upon reviewing the table, it's evident that while there are two individuals from the Irish Parliamentary Party, they hold the rank of Captain, not Major.

That immediately suggests the claim might be false because this person died earlier.\n\nRow 1 shows Guy Baring also killed in 1916. So another instance of death before 1920.\n\nLooking further down, other rows like Ninian Crichton-Stuart (1915), Duncan Campbell (1916), and others show deaths from as early as 1914 up to 1918. None of these are after 1920.\n\nSince the claim states that all MPs died after 1920, but I found multiple entries where they died before, including 1915, 1916, etc., this means the claim is not supported by the data in the table.

The goal is to determine if the claim \"most of the member of parliament of the united kingdom be unionist\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that most MPs in the UK are Unionists. So, I'll look at each MP's political party and count how many identify as Unionist.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for this claim is \"political party\". Each row lists a member of parliament along with their political affiliation. My task is to go through each entry, note down if they're from the Unionist party or not, and then see if Unionists make up the majority.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n1. Charles Duncombe: Conservative\n2. Guy Baring: Conservative\n3. Ninian Crichton-Stuart: Liberal Unionist Party (so that's a Unionist)\n4. Percy Clive: Liberal Unionist Party (another Unionist)\n5. Duncan Campbell: Unionist\n6. Charles Lyell: Liberal\n7. Alexander Thynne: Conservative\n8. Valentine Fleming: Conservative\n9. Philip Glazebrook: Conservative\n10.

There are 24 rows. So, out of 24 MPs, only 5 are Unionists. The rest belong to other parties like Conservative, Liberal, Irish Parliamentary Party, etc. \n\nThe claim is that \"most\" are Unionists.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"most of the member of the parliament of the united kingdom be lieutenant\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that most members of Parliament (MPs) are lieutenants. So, I need to determine if more than half of the MPs listed in the table have the rank of lieutenant.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an MP with details like their military rank, name, birth year, killed year, political party, and MP's seat. The column \"rank in military\" is the one that matters here because it tells us their military rank.\n\nI'll start by counting how many MPs have the rank of lieutenant. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Lieutenant Colonel - Not a lieutenant.\n2. Row 1: Lieutenant Colonel - Same as above.\n3. Row 2: Lieutenant Colonel - Again, not a lieutenant.\n4. Row 3: Lieutenant Colonel - Nope.\n5. Row 4: Lieutenant Colonel - Still no.\n6. Row 5: Major - Not a lieutenant.\n7. Row 6: Major - No.\n8. Row 7: Major - No.\n9. Row 8: Major - No.\n10. Row 9: Major - No.\n11. Row 10: Captain - Not a lieutenant.\n12. Row 11: Captain - No.\n13. Row 12: Captain - No.\n14. Row 13: Captain - No.\n15. Row 14: Captain - No.\n16. Row 15: Captain - No.\n17. Row 16: Captain - No.\n18. Row 17: Captain - No.\n19. Row 18: Lieutenant - Yes, count this.\n20. Row 19: Lieutenant - Another one.\n21. Row 20: Lieutenant - Third lieutenant.\n22. Row 21: Lieutenant - Fourth.\n23. Row 22: 2nd Lieutenant - This is a bit different but still a form of lieutenant.\n\nWait, let me recount. Rows 18 to 23 have the ranks:\n\n- Row 18: Lieutenant\n- Row 19: Lieutenant\n- Row 20: Lieutenant\n- Row 21: Lieutenant\n- Row 22: Lieutenant\n- Row 23: 2nd Lieutenant\n\nSo that's a total of 6 lieutenants.\n\nNow, how many MPs are there in total? Let me count the rows. The table starts at row 0 and goes up to row 23, which is 24 rows total. So there are 24 MPs listed.\n\nOut of these 24, only 6 have the rank of lieutenant (including the 2nd Lieutenant). To determine if \"most\" are lieutenants, we need more than half. Half of 24 is 12, so to be most, it needs at least 13. But here, only 6 are lieutenants.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because fewer than half (in fact, less than a quarter) of the MPs are lieutenants.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each row where the rank is lieutenant and specify the column as \"rank in military\". That includes rows 18 through 23.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"rank in military\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
