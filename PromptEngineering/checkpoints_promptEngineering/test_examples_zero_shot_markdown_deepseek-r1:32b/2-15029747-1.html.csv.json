    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"brandi love be nominate for 2 award at the avn award ceremony in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the components of this claim to check against the table.\n\n1. **Name**: Brandi Love. I'm assuming that's the person being referred to. The table has entries with \"work\" as n/a or specific works, but it doesn't list names directly except in the award descriptions and work columns. So, I need to infer if these awards are for Brandi Love.\n\n2. **Year**: 2013. The claim specifies this year, so I'll focus on rows where the year is 2013.\n\n3. **Awards Nominated For**: The claim mentions two awards at the AVN ceremony in 2013. So I need to look for rows where \"ceremony\" is AVN award and see how many nominations there are.\n\nLooking at the table, the first thing I notice is that it doesn't explicitly mention Brandi Love anywhere. However, since the claim is about her, I'll assume these entries pertain to her. Alternatively, maybe she's the one being nominated for these awards, but the table doesn't specify names in the \"work\" column; instead, it says n/a or specific works.\n\nLet me look at the rows:\n\n- Row 0: Year 2013, AVN award, Nominated, Milf/Cougar Performer of the Year, work is n/a.\n- Row 1: Year 2013, AVN award, Nominated, Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison), work is \"Big Titty Milfs.\"\n- Row 2: Year 2013, Nightmoves award, Won, Best Cougar/MILF Performer, work n/a.\n- Row 3: Year 2013, Nightmoves award, Nominated, Best Ass, work n/a.\n- Row 4: Year 2013, XBIZ award, Nominated, Web Star of the Year, work n/a.\n\nSo focusing on AVN awards (ceremony is 'avn award'), there are two entries for 2013:\n\nRow 0 and row 1. Both have \"result\" as 'nominated'. So that's two nominations at the AVN ceremony in 2013. \n\nThe claim says she was nominated for two awards at the AVN awards, which matches these two rows. Therefore, it seems the claim is true.\n\nBut wait, the table doesn't explicitly mention Brandi Love by name anywhere. It just lists the award categories and works. So maybe I'm making an assumption here that these entries are about her. If the claim is talking about someone else, then this could be misleading. But since the claim mentions Brandi Love specifically, perhaps she's associated with these entries, even if it's not directly stated in the table.\n\nAnother point: The AVN award ceremony had two nominations for this person (assuming it's her), so that would align with the claim of being nominated for 2 awards. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"brandi love be only nominated for best as 1 time in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim carefully. The claim states that Brandi Love was nominated only once for a \"best as\" award in 2013. So I'm looking for entries in the table from 2013 where she was nominated specifically for \"best as\".\n\nLooking at the table structure: It has columns year, ceremony, result, award, and work.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check if any match the criteria.\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: avn award\n- Result: nominated\n- Award: milf / cougar performer of the year\nHere, she was nominated for \"milf / cougar performer\", not \"best as\". So this doesn't fit the claim.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: avn award\n- Result: nominated\n- Award: most outrageous sex scene (with Kelly Madison)\nThis is about a sex scene, so again, not relevant to \"best as\".\n\nRow 2:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: nightmoves award\n- Result: won\n- Award: best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice)\nShe won this award, but the claim is about nominations. Also, it's a win, so not relevant to being nominated.\n\nRow 3:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: nightmoves award\n- Result: nominated\n- Award: best ass\nThis is exactly what the claim refers to\u2014being nominated for \"best as\" (I assume that's a typo and they meant \"ass\"). So this row supports part of the claim.\n\nRow 4:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: xbiz award\n- Result: nominated\n- Award: web star of the year\nThis is about being a web star, not related to \"best as\".\n\nNow, compiling the findings: The only relevant row where Brandi Love was nominated for \"best ass\" in 2013 is row index 3. There's no other row where she was nominated under that category.\n\nSo, the claim states that she was only nominated once for best as, and according to the table, that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"big titty milfs be the only name work brandi love receive an award nomination for in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. It lists several awards Brandi Love was nominated for or won in 2013. The columns are year, ceremony, result, award, and work.\n\nThe claim states that \"big titty milfs\" was the only work she received a nomination for in 2013. To verify this, I need to check each row where Brandi Love was nominated or won an award.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Nominated for \"milf / cougar performer of the year\". The work is listed as \"n/a\", meaning there's no specific work associated with this nomination.\n2. **Row 1**: Nominated for \"most outrageous sex scene (with kelly madison)\" with the work titled \"big titty milfs\".\n3. **Row 2**: Won \"best cougar / milf performer\" with work as \"n/a\".\n4. **Row 3**: Nominated for \"best ass\" with work \"n/a\".\n5. **Row 4**: Nominated for \"web star of the year\" with work \"n/a\".\n\nFrom this, I can see that in row 1, there's a nomination where the specific work is listed as \"big titty milfs\". However, rows 0, 2, 3, and 4 don't mention any specific works\u2014they all have \"n/a\". \n\nThe claim says that \"big titty milfs\" was the only work she received a nomination for. But looking at the other rows, even though they don't specify a particular work, Brandi Love still had nominations in those categories (like performer of the year and best ass). This means that apart from \"big titty mulheres\", there were other nominations, just without specific works listed.\n\nSo, since there are multiple nominations beyond the one linked to \"big titty mulheres\", the claim is not entirely accurate. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_0\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So I need to check all rows for the year 2013 and see if there's a 'won' result for that specific award.\n\nLooking at the table, it has five rows, each corresponding to different awards Brandi Love was involved in during 2013.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says that Brandi Love won two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013. So my task is to check if there are two entries in the table for the AVN Awards in 2013 where she actually won an award.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: year, ceremony, result, award, and work. I'm particularly interested in rows where the year is 2013, the ceremony is AVN Award, and the result is 'won'. \n\nLet me scan through each row:\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, Ceremony AVN Award, Result nominated. So this isn't a win.\n\nRow 1: Also 2013, AVN Award, but again, the result is nominated. Still no win here.\n\nRows 2 and 3 are Nightmoves Awards, so they don't count for AVN.\n\nRow 4 is an XBIZ Award, which is different from AVN.\n\nSo in all rows, under AVN Awards in 2013, Brandi Love was only nominated but didn't win any awards. There's no row where the result is 'won' for AVN Awards in that year.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she won two awards at the AVN Awards in 2013 isn't supported by the data.

The columns are 'year', 'ceremony', 'result', 'award', and 'work'. Each row represents an award event for Brandi Love in 2013.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 0: Avn Award, nominated for \"milf / cougar performer of the year\".\nRow 1: Avn Award, nominated for \"most outrageous sex scene\" with Kelly Madison.\nRow 2: Nightmoves Award, won for \"best cougar / milf performer (editor\u2019s choice)\".\nRow 3: Nightmoves Award, nominated for \"best ass\".\nRow 4: Xbiz Award, nominated for \"web star of the year\".\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim. It states that Brandi Love was nominated twice for \"best as\" at two different award ceremonies in 2013.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In row 3, she was nominated by Nightmoves Award for \"best ass\".\n- Are there any other nominations for \"best ass\"?

Therefore, the claim is incorrect because she was nominated once, not twice.\n\nI'll note that the relevant cells are from rows where the award ceremony and result are relevant. So rows 0 (Avn Award), 1 (Avn Award), 2 (Nightmoves Award), 3 (Nightmoves Award), and 4 (Xbiz Award) need to be considered to check for any \"best ass\" nominations.\n\nWait, actually, only row 3 has the \"best ass\" nomination.

I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: \"big titty milfs be the third name work that brandi love receive an award for in 2013.\" Wait a second, the claim mentions \"brandi love,\" but looking at the table, I don't see any mention of her. The table lists awards and nominations without specifying individuals like Brandi Love. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nNext, let's break down what the claim is saying. It states that \"big titty milfs\" was the third work for which someone (presumably Brandi Love) received an award in 2013. Looking at the table, I see entries from 2013 with various awards and nominations.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for mentions of \"big titty milf.\" \n\n- Row 0: AVN Award nomination for MILF/Cougar Performer of the year, work is N/A.\n- Row 1: AVN Award nomination for Most Outrageous Sex Scene with Kelly Madison, work is \"Big Titty Milfs.\"\n- Rows 2 and 3 are Nightmoves Awards, but they don't list any specific works except N/A or Best Ass.\n- Row 4 is an XBiz Award nomination without a specified work.\n\nSo, the only occurrence of \"big titty milfs\" is in row 1. This was a nomination for Most Outrageous Sex Scene, not an award that was won. The claim says it's the third work for which Brandi Love received an award, but since she isn't mentioned and this was just a nomination, the claim doesn't hold up.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are row 1, column \"work\" because that's where \"big titty milfs\" is listed.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"brandi love be nominate for and win 5 award in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It states that Brandi Love was both nominated for and won five awards in 2013. So I'm looking for any entries in the table where the ceremony year is 2013, result is either \"nominated\" or \"won\", and then count how many times she was involved.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Year 2013, Ceremony AVN Award, Result Nominated. So this counts towards nominations.\nRow 1: Also 2013, same ceremony, another nomination. That's two nominations so far.\nRow 2: Nightmoves Award in 2013, and she won the award. So that's a win.\nRow 3: Another nomination at Nightmoves for Best Ass. That brings total nominations to three.\nRow 4: Xbiz Award nomination in 2013. So that's four nominations.\n\nWait, but each row is an individual award entry, so I need to count all the nominations and wins across all rows for 2013.\n\nCounting:\n\nTotal nominations:\n- AVN: 2\n- Nightmoves: 1 (nominated)\n- Xbiz: 1\nTotal nominations = 4\n\nWins:\n- Nightmoves: 1 (won)\n\nSo total awards she was involved in as either nominated or won is 5. However, the claim says she \"be nominate for and win 5 award\". That implies five awards in total, counting both nominations and wins. But looking at the table, there are five rows all from 2013. Each row represents a different award.\n\nBut let's check each cell:\n\nRow 0: Nominated\nRow 1: Nominated\nRow 2: Won\nRow 3: Nominated\nRow 4: Nominated\n\nSo in total, she was involved in five awards: four nominations and one win. The claim says she was nominated for and won five awards. Wait, that could be a bit ambiguous. Does it mean she was nominated for five awards and won some of them? Or does it mean she was both nominated and won five each?\n\nBut looking at the table, in 2013, Brandi Love has one win (Row 2) and four nominations (Rows 0,1,3,4). So total awards she participated in are five: four as nominated and one as a winner. Therefore, the claim that she was \"nominate for and win 5 award\" could be interpreted as being involved in five awards, either nominated or won. That would make it TRUE because she has five entries (four nominations and one win) across different awards.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n1. AVN Award: Milf/Cougar performer of the year - Nominated\n2. AVN Award: Most outrageous sex scene - Nominated\n3. Nightmoves Award: Best cougar/mlf (won)\n4. Nightmoves Award: Best ass - Nominated\n5. Xbiz Award: Web star of the year - Nominated\n\nSo that's five awards in total, each listed as separate entries. Therefore, she was involved in five award instances. So the claim is TRUE because she was both nominated and won in 2013 across these five awards.\n\nWait, but does \"win 5 awards\" mean she won five? No, because she only won one. The claim says she was nominated for and won five awards. That could be a bit confusing. But perhaps it's intended as she was involved in five awards (four nominations, one win). So the total number of awards she was part of is five.\n\nYes, so the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Brandi Love was nominated for and won five awards in 2013. The table shows five award instances from 2013: four nominations and one win, totaling five awards. Therefore, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"award\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"Brandi Love be the winner of the web star of the year award at the xbiz award ceremony in 2013.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse each part:\n\n- Person involved: Brandi Love\n- Award won: Web Star of the Year\n- Ceremony: Xbiz Awards\n- Year: 2013\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to see if there's any relevant information.\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: MILF/Cougar Performer of the Year\n- Work: n/a\n\nThis row is about an AVN award nomination, not a win. Also, it's for a different category, so not relevant.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: AVN Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Most Outrageous Sex Scene (with Kelly Madison)\n- Work: Big Titty Milfs\n\nAgain, AVN award and just a nomination. Different category, so not relevant.\n\nRow 2:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n- Result: Won\n- Award: Best Cougar MILF Performer (Editor\u2019s Choice)\n- Work: n/a\n\nHere, someone won the Best Cougar MILF award at Nightmoves. But the claim is about Xbiz and Web Star of the Year, so not matching.\n\nRow 3:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: Nightmoves Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Best Ass\n- Work: n/a\n\nAnother nomination at Nightmoves, different award. Doesn't help with the claim.\n\nRow 4:\n- Year: 2013\n- Ceremony: Xbiz Award\n- Result: Nominated\n- Award: Web Star of the Year\n- Work: n/a\n\nAh, here's the relevant row. The ceremony is Xbiz Awards in 2013, and it's for the award \"Web Star of the Year.\" However, the result is \"nominated,\" not \"won.\"\n\nSo according to the table, Brandi Love was nominated but didn't win that award at the Xbiz ceremony in 2013. The claim says she \"be the winner,\" which isn't supported by the data.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because while there's a nomination, there's no indication of a win.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
