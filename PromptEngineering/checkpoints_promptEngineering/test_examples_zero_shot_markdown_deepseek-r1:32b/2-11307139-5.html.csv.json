    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and win every time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It says Wozniak competed in Canada five times and won each of those competitions. So, I need to check two things: how many times Wozniak competed in Canada (should be 5) and whether all those instances resulted in wins.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that not every row has a \"player\" column. Wait, actually, upon closer inspection, there is no \"player\" column mentioned. The opponent's name is listed under the \"opponent\" column, but it doesn't specify who Wozniak is. Hmm, this could be an issue because without knowing which rows correspond to Wozniak's matches, I can't accurately assess her performance.\n\nThe table lists various tournaments with outcomes as either winner or runner-up. The opponents are different each time, but none of the rows mention a player named Wozniak. So, it seems like the claim might be about someone else, or perhaps there's an error in the data provided.\n\nSince there's no indication of who the player is in the table entries, I can't verify how many times she competed in Canada or whether she won all those matches. The information required to assess the claim isn't present in the given table. Therefore, based on the available data, the claim cannot be confirmed as TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any implicit information. For instance, if \"Wozniak\" is a common last name among players, maybe it's referring to someone else, but without explicit names linking to Wozniak in the opponent column, it's impossible to tell. \n\nAdditionally, even if I were to assume that all Canadian tournaments listed are where Wozniak competed, there are only two entries with \"canada\" as the location: June 30, 2002 (Lachine) and July 17, 2005 (Hamilton). Both of these show the outcome as \"winner.\" However, this is just two instances, not five. Therefore, even if Wozniak were the player in these matches, she only competed twice in Canada according to the table.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim states five competitions in Canada with all wins, but the table doesn't mention Wozniak at all and only shows two Canadian tournaments where the outcome was a win. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list any player named \"Wozniak,\" so it's impossible to verify her competitions or outcomes.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 1 time but win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that Wozniak has competed in the Bahamas only once and won that competition. So, I should check two things: how many times she competed in the Bahamas and whether she was a winner in that instance.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an outcome (either 'winner' or 'runner-up'), along with other details like date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score. The relevant columns for this claim are \"outcome\", \"tournament\", and \"opponent\".\n\nI'll go through each row to see if there's a match for the Bahamas. Scanning down:\n\n- The first few rows are in Canada or Mexico.\n- Then, I notice a row on March 17, 2012: the tournament is in Nassau, Bahamas, and the outcome is 'winner'. So that's one win in the Bahamas.\n\nAre there any other entries where the tournament location includes the Bahamas? I'll check all rows again to be thorough. The next relevant entry after that is August 7, 2011, which is in Vancouver, Canada, so not the Bahamas. All other tournaments are in places like Lachine, Hamilton, Pelham, Victoria, Mexico City, Toronto, Ashland, Pittsburgh, Redding, and Nassau.\n\nSo, only one row mentions Nassau, Bahamas, and in that instance, the outcome was a win. Therefore, Wozniak did compete in the Bahamas once and won.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE because there's exactly one entry where she competed in the Bahamas, and it resulted in her being the winner.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"tournament\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"wozniak compete in 5 tournament in 2005 and win 3 of them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is stating. It mentions that someone named wozniak participated in five tournaments in the year 2005 and won three of those. So, my goal is to check how many tournaments in 2005 are listed for this person and how many they've won.\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row represents a different outcome (either 'winner' or 'runner-up') along with other details like date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score. My focus should be on the rows where the date falls within 2005 and see if wozniak is the player involved.\n\nWait, actually, I notice that in the table provided, there's no column for the name of the player (wozniak). All entries seem to list opponents but not necessarily who played against them. That's a bit confusing. So perhaps each row represents a match where the opponent was someone else, and the outcome is whether wozniak won or lost.\n\nBut without explicit mention of wozniak in any column, it's unclear which rows correspond to her matches. Alternatively, maybe the table is about wozniak's performance, listing her opponents each time. So I'll proceed under that assumption: each row represents a match where wozniak was either the winner or runner-up.\n\nSo, first step: identify all entries in 2005. Let me look at the 'date' column and filter for dates in 2005.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. June 30, 2002 \u2013 that's 2002, not 2005.\n2. July 17, 2005 \u2013 yes, this is within 2005.\n3. October 2, 2005 \u2013 also 2005.\n4. October 16, 2005 \u2013 another in 2005.\n5. October 23, 2005 \u2013 still 2005.\n6. November 13, 2005 \u2013 yes.\n7. July 23, 2006 \u2013 that's 2006, so skip.\n8. October 1, 2006 \u2013 also 2006.\n9. November 12, 2006 \u2013 same year.\n10. March 23, 2008 \u2013 later than 2005.\n11. August 7, 2011 \u2013 way after.\n12. March 17, 2012 \u2013 also after.\n\nSo in total, the entries from rows 1 to 6 are within or before 2005? Wait no, row indexes start at 0:\n\nRow 0: 2002\nRow 1: 2005\nRow 2: 2005\nRow 3: 2005\nRow 4: 2005\nRow 5: 2005\nRows 6 onwards are 2006 or later.\n\nWait, actually row indexes:\n\n- Row 1: July 17, 2005 (index 1)\n- Row 2: October 2, 2005 (index 2)\n- Row 3: October 16, 2005 (index 3)\n- Row 4: October 23, 2005 (index 4)\n- Row 5: November 13, 2005 (index 5)\n\nSo from row index 1 to 5 inclusive, that's five entries in 2005.\n\nNow, among these five tournaments, how many did wozniak win? Let me check the 'outcome' column for each of these rows.\n\nRow 1: outcome is winner\nRow 2: runner-up\nRow 3: winner\nRow 4: runner-up\nRow 5: winner\n\nSo in row 1: won, row 2: lost, row 3: won, row 4: lost, row 5: won.\n\nThat's a total of three wins (rows 1, 3, 5) and two losses (rows 2,4).\n\nWait, but the claim says \"compete in 5 tournaments in 2005\" \u2013 that matches because we have five entries. And she \"won 3 of them\" which also matches since three are 'winner' outcomes.\n\nBut wait a second, I'm assuming these rows all correspond to wozniak's matches. But the table doesn't explicitly mention her name anywhere except perhaps in the outcome? Or is it that each row represents a match where someone else was the opponent?\n\nWait no, looking at the table, each entry is an event with an opponent and whether it was won or lost. So if the claim is about wozniak, then these must be her matches.\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain because sometimes tables can represent different players' perspectives. But since in all rows except perhaps one, the outcome is either 'winner' or 'runner-up,' and there's no other player mentioned besides opponents, it's likely that each row represents a match involving wozniak.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is about her performance, so she was the participant in all these tournaments.\n\nGiven that, yes, in 2005, she participated in five tournaments (rows 1-5) and won three of them. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but looking back at rows 1 to 5:\n\nRow 1: outcome winner\nRow 2: runner-up\nRow 3: winner\nRow 4: runner-up\nRow 5: winner\n\nYes, that's five tournaments in 2005 and three wins. So the claim is accurate.\n\nBut let me double-check for any possible miscounts or errors.\n\nIn row index 1 (July 17, 2005): outcome is 'winner'\nIndex 2: October 2, 2005 \u2013 'runner-up'\nIndex 3: October 16, 2005 \u2013 'winner'\nIndex 4: October 23, 2005 \u2013 'runner-up'\nIndex 5: November 13, 2005 \u2013 'winner'\n\nYes, that's three wins and two losses.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that wozniak competed in five tournaments in 2005 and won three of them. By examining the table entries from July 17, 2005, to November 13, 2005 (rows 1 to 5), we find that she participated in exactly five tournaments. Among these, she was the winner in three instances. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is TRUE.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak compete in 5 tournament in 2006 and win 3 of them\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check all the entries in the table for the year 2006. The table has a 'date' column which includes both day, month, and year information. So, I'll look through each row's date to see if it falls within 2006.\n\nLooking at the dates:\n\n1. June 30, 2002 - This is in 2002.\n2. July 17, 2005 - 2005.\n3. October 2, 2005 - 2005.\n4. October 16, 2005 - 2005.\n5. October 23, 2005 - 2005.\n6. November 13, 2005 - 2005.\n7. July 23, 2006 - This is in 2006.\n8. October 1, 2006 - 2006.\n9. November 12, 2006 - 2006.\n10. March 23, 2008 - 2008.\n11. August 7, 2011 - 2011.\n12. March 17, 2012 - 2012.\n\nSo, the only rows relevant for 2006 are rows 6 (index starting at 0?), wait no\u2014wait, counting from the top: first row is index 0. So let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: 2002\n- Row 1: 2005\n- Row 2: 2005\n- Row 3: 2005\n- Row 4: 2005\n- Row 5: 2005\n- Row 6: July 23, 2006 - yes.\n- Row 7: October 1, 2006 - yes.\n- Row 8: November 12, 2006 - yes.\n- Rows beyond row 8 are 2008 and later.\n\nSo there are three entries in 2006: rows 6, 7, 8.\n\nNow, the claim is that Wozniak competed in 5 tournaments in 2006 and won 3 of them. But according to the table, there are only 3 tournament entries for 2006. So, competing in 5 seems incorrect based on this data.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if all these rows correspond to Wozniak's participation. Wait, looking at the opponent column: opponents like Beier Ko, Maria Jose Argeri, etc. The player whose outcomes are listed is likely the subject of the claim, which would be Wozniak. So each row represents a match where Wozniak was either winner or runner-up.\n\nSo in 2006, there are three entries:\n\nRow 6: Winner\nRow 7: Winner\nRow 8: Winner\n\nWait, all three are 'winner'. So that would mean she won all three tournaments in 2006. But the claim says she competed in 5 and won 3. According to the table, she only has 3 entries for 2006, not 5.\n\nSo the relevant cells are the dates and outcomes for those rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"wozniak have compete in canada 5 time and loss every time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states two things:\n1. Wozniak competed in Canada five times.\n2. In all those competitions, Wozniak lost every time (i.e., was a runner-up).\n\nLooking at the table, I should check each row to see if the opponent is \"wozniak\" and whether the outcome was a loss. Also, count how many times this happened in Canada.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Beier Ko. Not Wozniak.\nRow 1: Opponent Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri. Not Wozniak.\nRow 2: Runner-up against Soledad Esper\u00f3n. Opponent isn't Wozniak, and the outcome is a loss for the runner-up, but not relevant here since we're looking for when Wozniak was an opponent.\nWait, no\u2014actually, I think I got that wrong. The claim says \"Wozniak have compete in canada 5 time\"\u2014so maybe it's about who the player is, not necessarily the opponent? Hmm, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait a minute\u2014the table shows outcomes from the perspective of a particular player, as each row lists an outcome (winner or runner-up) and their opponent. So if the claim is about Wozniak's performance in Canada, I need to find rows where the tournament location is Canada and the player's outcome was either winner or runner-up.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Lachine, Canada \u2013 Outcome Winner\nRow 1: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 Outcome Winner\nRow 6: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 Outcome Winner\nRow 7: Ashland, United States \u2013 not relevant\nRow 8: Pittsburgh, USA \u2013 not relevant\nRow 9: Redding, USA \u2013 not relevant\nRow 10: Vancouver, Canada \u2013 Outcome Winner\nRow 11: Nassau, Bahamas \u2013 not relevant\n\nWait, the opponent in these rows is who the player played against. So if I'm looking for when Wozniak competed (as a player) in Canada, but the table doesn't list players named Wozniak as opponents or participants.\n\nLooking through the \"opponent\" column: names like Beier Ko, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri, etc., but none are Wozniak. So perhaps there's no instance of Wozniak being an opponent in any row. Therefore, the claim that she competed five times and lost every time isn't supported because she doesn't appear as an opponent or player in these entries.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if the \"player\" is Wozniak? But the table's structure shows each row from the perspective of a player who either won or was runner-up. So for example, the first row shows that the player (who is presumably the one being tracked) won against Beier Ko in Canada on June 30, 2002.\n\nIf we're considering the claim about Wozniak, then perhaps she's the opponent. But looking at all opponents:\n\n- Row 0: Beier Ko\n- Row 1: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri\n- Row 2: Soledad Esper\u00f3n\n- Row 3: Olga Blahotov\u00e1\n- Row 4: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Argeri (again)\n- Row 5: Olena Antypina\n- Row 6: Val\u00e9rie T\u00e9treault\n- Row 7: \u00c1gnes Sz\u00e1vay\n- Row 8: Victoria Azarenka\n- Row 9: Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1\n- Row 10: Jamie Hampton\n- Row 11: Aliz\u00e9 Cornet\n\nNo Wozniak listed. So the claim that she competed five times in Canada and lost every time is unsupported because there are zero instances of her in the opponent column, let alone five.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again all rows:\n\nRow 0: Lachine, Canada \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 1: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 2: Pelham, US \u2013 outcome Runner-up\nRow 3: Victoria, Mexico \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 4: Mexico City, Mexico \u2013 outcome Runner-up\nRow 5: Toronto, Canada \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 6: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 7: Ashland, US \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 8: Pittsburgh, US \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 9: Redding, US \u2013 outcome Runner-up\nRow 10: Vancouver, Canada \u2013 outcome Winner\nRow 11: Nassau, Bahamas \u2013 outcome Winner\n\nSo in total, the player (whoever this table is about) has competed in Canada multiple times. Let's count how many times:\n\n- Row 0: Lachine, Canada \u2013 Winner\n- Row 1: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 Winner\n- Row 5: Toronto, Canada \u2013 Winner\n- Row 6: Hamilton, Canada \u2013 Winner\n- Row 10: Vancouver, Canada \u2013 Winner\n\nThat's five times in Canada. All outcomes are Winners except for none\u2014wait, all are winners.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says Wozniak competed five times and lost every time. But according to this table, when competing in Canada (five times), the player was always a winner. So unless Wozniak is the opponent here, but she's not listed as an opponent. Therefore, there are no instances where Wozniak was a runner-up or lost in Canada.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding who the table is about. If it's about Wozniak herself, then each row would be her performance. But if that's the case, the opponents would include others. Since none of the opponents are named Wozniak, maybe this isn't her table.\n\nBut regardless, the claim is that she competed five times in Canada and lost every time. The table doesn't show any entries where she was a runner-up or lost. Therefore, the claim is false based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that Wozniak competed five times in Canada and lost every time is **false** based on the provided data. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Competitions in Canada**: The table shows competitions in Canada occurring five times (Lachine, Hamilton twice, Toronto, and Vancouver). However, these entries are from the perspective of a player who was always the winner in those instances.\n\n2. **Opponents Named Wozniak**: There are no opponents named Wozniak listed in any of the rows, meaning there is no record of her participating as an opponent or losing in Canada.\n\nTherefore, the data does not support the claim that Wozniak lost five times in Canada. \n\n**Answer:** False",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the claim is \"wozniak have only compete in the bahamas 2 time but lose\". I need to check if this is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should look for entries where the location is the Bahamas because that's what the claim is about. Scanning through the \"tournament\" column, I see most entries are in Canada, United States, Mexico, etc. Wait, looking at row 10 (index starting from 0), there's a tournament in Nassau, Bahamas on March 17, 2012. The outcome here is listed as \"winner\", so Wozniak won that match.\n\nNow, the claim says she competed twice in the Bahamas and lost both times. But according to the table, there's only one entry for the Bahamas. So the first part of the claim\u2014that she competed two times\u2014is incorrect because it's just once. Also, since the outcome is \"winner\", she didn't lose that match.\n\nSo putting this together: the claim states two competitions in the Bahamas with losses, but the table shows only one competition where she won. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Wozniak competed twice in the Bahamas and lost both times, but the table shows only one win there.

The claim is \"wozniak have lose 9 time between the year 2002 and 2012.\" I need to determine if this is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Wozniak lost 9 times between 2002 and 2012. To verify this, I'll look through the table for entries where the outcome is \"runner-up,\" which indicates a loss.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows with \"runner-up\" as the outcome. Let's list them out:\n\n1. October 2, 2005: Runner-up in Pelham, United States.\n2. October 23, 2005: Runner-up in Mexico City, Mexico.\n3. March 23, 2008: Runner-up in Redding, United States.\n\nWait, that's only three losses, not nine. I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other rows where the outcome is \"runner-up.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- June 30, 2002: Winner\n- July 17, 2005: Winner\n- October 2, 2005: Runner-up (1)\n- October 16, 2005: Winner\n- October 23, 2005: Runner-up (2)\n- November 13, 2005: Winner\n- July 23, 2006: Winner\n- October 1, 2006: Winner\n- November 12, 2006: Winner\n- March 23, 2008: Runner-up (3)\n- August 7, 2011: Winner\n- March 17, 2012: Winner\n\nOnly three instances where the outcome is \"runner-up.\" Therefore, Wozniak lost only 3 times between 2002 and 2012, not 9. The claim is false because it states 9 losses when there are actually only 3.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE, with the relevant cells being the three rows where the outcome is \"runner-up.\"\n</think>\n\nThe table shows three instances where Wozniak was a runner-up (lost) between 2002 and 2012.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"wozniak have be winner 3 time but never in canada\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It seems there's a typo; probably meant to say \"Wozniak has been a winner three times but never in Canada.\" So I need to check two things: \n\n1. How many times did Wozniak win (i.e., where the outcome is 'winner')?\n2. Did any of those wins occur in Canada?\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple entries with the outcome as 'winner'. Let's count them:\n\n- Row 0: Winner\n- Row 1: Winner\n- Row 3: Winner\n- Row 5: Winner\n- Row 6: Winner\n- Row 7: Winner\n- Row 8: Winner\n- Row 9: Runner-up (so not a win)\n- Row 10: Winner\n- Row 11: Winner\n\nWait, that's more than three wins. Let me recount:\n\nRows with 'winner' outcome:\nRow 0: winner\nRow 1: winner\nRow 3: winner\nRow 5: winner\nRow 6: winner\nRow 7: winner\nRow 8: winner (score has a ret, but still marked as winner)\nRow 10: runner-up, so not counted.\nWait no, row 10 is runner-up. Rows with 'winner' are rows 0-5 except row 2 and 4, then 6-11.\n\nSo total winners: Let's count:\n\nRows:\n0: Winner\n1: Winner\n3: Winner (after checking)\nRow 4: Runner-up, so no\nRow 5: Winner\nRow 6: Winner\nRow 7: Winner\nRow 8: Winner\nRow 9: Winner (vancouver, canada)\nRow 10: Runner-up, not counted\nRow 11: Winner\n\nWait, row 9 is a winner in Canada. So that's one win in Canada.\n\nSo the first part of the claim says Wozniak was a winner three times. But looking at the table, there are more than three wins. Let me count again:\n\nRows with outcome 'winner':\n\nRow 0: yes\nRow 1: yes\nRow 3: yes (october 16, 2005)\nRow 5: yes (november 13, 2005)\nRow 6: yes (july 23, 2006)\nRow 7: yes (october 1, 2006)\nRow 8: yes (november 12, 2006)\nRow 9: winner in Canada\nRow 11: winner\n\nWait that's 9 times? No, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\nRows with 'winner' outcome:\n- Row 0: June 30, 2002 - Lachine, Canada\n- Row 1: July 17, 2005 - Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 3: October 16, 2005 - Victoria, Mexico\n- Row 5: November 13, 2005 - Toronto, Canada\n- Row 6: July 23, 2006 - Hamilton, Canada\n- Row 7: October 1, 2006 - Ashland, US\n- Row 8: November 12, 2006 - Pittsburgh, US\n- Row 9: August 7, 2011 - Vancouver, Canada\n- Row 11: March 17, 2012 - Nassau, Bahamas\n\nSo that's 9 wins total. But the claim says \"3 times.\" So perhaps I'm misunderstanding who Wozniak is. Maybe in the table, only three entries are for a player named Wozniak. Wait, looking at opponents:\n\nThe opponents include names like beier ko, mar\u00eda jos\u00e9 argeri, soledad esper\u00f3n, etc., but none are Wozniak. So perhaps the claim refers to the person whose outcomes are listed here. Let me check: all rows have 'outcome' as winner or runner-up, and I'm assuming this is about one player's performance.\n\nWait, the table seems to list matches of a specific player, let's say Player X. The opponent column lists who they played against. So perhaps Wozniak is the name of this player? Or maybe it's a different person.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to someone else named Wozniak. But in the table, opponents are listed as various names, not including Wozniak. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the outcomes and opponents, perhaps all these matches are for a player whose name is in another column? Or perhaps this table is about different players. Wait no, each row seems to be a match, but it's unclear who the player is unless specified elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps Wozniak is the opponent in some of these matches. Let me check:\n\nOpponents:\nRow 0: beier ko\nRow 1: mar\u00eda jos\u00e9 argeri\nRow 2: soledad esperon\nRow 3: anna torro-Flor\nRow 4: nadia petrova\nRow 5: justine henin\nRow 6: amelie mauresmo\nRow 7: jill crISTIEs\nRow 8: maria sharapova\nRow 9: sakkari\nRow10: andrea petkovic\nRow11: monica niclase\n\nSo no Wozniak here. So perhaps the player in question is someone else, or maybe it's a different table.\n\nWait, I think I misread the problem. The user didn't specify whose wins to count. Perhaps this is about Maria Sharapova? Because her name appears as an opponent in row 8. But no, the outcomes are for whoever is playing against these opponents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the player's name isn't listed here; maybe it's implied elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count how many times the outcome is 'winner' and where those wins occurred.\n\nCount of 'winner' outcomes: rows 0,1,3,5,6,7,8,9,11 \u2013 that's nine times. So if the claim says three times, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Wozniak has three wins in this table. Let me see:\n\nLooking at all 'winner' entries, and their locations:\n\n- Lachine, Canada (row 0)\n- Hamilton, Canada (row1)\n- Victoria, Mexico (row3)\n- Toronto, Canada (row5)\n- Hamilton, Canada (row6)\n- Ashland, US (row7)\n- Pittsburgh, US (row8)\n- Vancouver, Canada (row9)\n- Nassau, Bahamas (row11)\n\nSo, of these nine wins, how many are in Canada? Let's count:\n\nRow0: Lachine, Canada \u2013 1\nRow1: Hamilton, Canada \u20132\nRow5: Toronto, Canada \u20133\nRow6: Hamilton, Canada \u20134\nRow9: Vancouver, Canada \u20135\n\nWait that's five wins in Canada. So the claim says \"never in Canada,\" but according to this table, there are multiple wins in Canada.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Wozniak has been a winner multiple times (at least five) and some of those were in Canada.\n\nAlternatively, if Wozniak refers to someone else, perhaps the opponent's name. But as opponents don't include Wozniak, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting 'winner' entries. Let me list all rows with outcome 'winner':\n\nRow 0: Winner\nRow 1: Winner\nRow3: Winner\nRow5: Winner\nRow6: Winner\nRow7: Winner\nRow8: Winner\nRow9: Winner\nRow11: Winner\n\nSo that's nine wins total, five in Canada. So the claim that Wozniak was a winner three times and never in Canada is false because they've won more than three times, including several in Canada.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the table. Maybe each row represents a different player's match? Or maybe this is about the opponent being Canadian? But no, opponents are various nationalities.\n\nWait, perhaps Wozniak is the name of one of the opponents. Let me check: the opponents are beier ko (Korea?), mar\u00eda jos\u00e9 argeri (Argentina), soledad esperon, etc., but no Wozniak. So perhaps this table isn't about Wozniak at all.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe the player in question is someone else, and the table is showing their opponents. But since the outcomes are 'winner' or 'runner-up', it's more likely that each row represents a match where this specific player either won or lost.\n\nTherefore, the number of wins for this player is nine times, with five wins in Canada. So the claim that Wozniak was a winner three times and never in Canada would be false based on this data.\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding who Wozniak is. Maybe it's a different table or context. Alternatively, maybe the user made an error in the problem statement.\n\nGiven the information, I can conclude that according to the table, Wozniak (assuming they are the player whose outcomes are listed) has been a winner multiple times, including in Canada.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false based on the provided data. The player in question, assumed to be Maria Sharapova or another prominent figure given the opponents listed, has won multiple matches, including several in Canada. Specifically, there are nine wins recorded, five of which occurred in Canadian cities such as Lachine, Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is incorrect because Wozniak (if referring to this player) has won more than three times and some of those wins were in Canada.",
