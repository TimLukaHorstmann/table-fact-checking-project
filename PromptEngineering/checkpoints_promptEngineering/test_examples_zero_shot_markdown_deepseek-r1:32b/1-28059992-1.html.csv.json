    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"mark farraway be pick 7 pick after chad folk\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for both Mark Farraway and Chad Folk in the table. Scanning through the player names, I see that Chad Folk is listed at row index 0 (the first row). He was picked number 1 by the Toronto Argonauts as an OL from Utah. \n\nNow, searching for Mark Farraway, I find him at row index 7. His pick number is 8, and he plays DL for Edmonton, coming from St. Francis Xavier.\n\nThe claim says that Mark Farraway was pick 7, but according to the table, his pick number is actually 8. That means the claim about his pick number is incorrect. \n\nAdditionally, the claim mentions that Mark Farraway was picked after Chad Folk. Since Chad Folk was picked first (pick 1) and Mark Farraway was picked eighth, this part of the claim is true because 8 comes after 1.\n\nHowever, since one part of the claim (Mark being pick 7) is false, even though the other part (picked after Chad) is true, the overall statement isn't fully accurate. The main issue here is the incorrect pick number for Mark Farraway.\n\nSo, the relevant cells I checked are:\n- For Chad Folk: row index 0 in all columns to confirm his details.\n- For Mark Farraway: row index 7, specifically looking at 'pick' and other columns to verify his information.\n\nTherefore, since the claim has an incorrect pick number for Mark Farraway, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"both Doug Brown and Jason Clemett be pick that come from Simon Fraser\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It states two things:\n1. Doug Brown was picked.\n2. Jason Clemett was picked.\nAdditionally, both picks are said to have come from Simon Fraser.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure, each row represents a pick with details like CFL team, player, position, and college. The relevant columns here are \"player\" and \"college\" since we need to check which players attended Simon Fraser.\n\nLet's go through each player mentioned in the claim:\n\n1. Doug Brown: Checking the table, Doug Brown is listed at row index 4 (0-based counting). His college is indeed Simon Fraser. So, this part of the claim holds true.\n\n2. Jason Clemett: He appears at row index 6. According to the table, his college is also Simon Fraser. This part also checks out.\n\nSince both players are from Simon Fraser and were picked as per their respective rows in the table, the claim seems valid. There's no discrepancy here. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Doug Brown and Jason Clemett are picks from Simon Fraser.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then check each relevant part against the table.\n\nThe claim says: \"draft pick from calgary stampeders, montreal alouettes and edmonton play the position dl.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what this means. The claim is stating that three specific teams\u2014CFL Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton Eskimos (since I know in CFL Edmonton is represented by the Eskimos)\u2014have draft picks who all play the position \"dl\".\n\nI'll need to check each of these teams in the table to see if their players are listed as playing \"dl\". Let's look at the table row by row.\n\nLooking through the \"cfl team\" column:\n\n1. Toronto Argonauts: Pick 1, Chad Folk, OL from Utah.\n2. Saskatchewan Roughriders: Pick 2, Ben Fairbrother, OL from Calgary.\n3. Edmonton Eskimos: Pick 3, Ian Franklin, CB from Weber State.\n4. Hamilton Tiger-Cats: Pick 4, Tim Prinsen, OG from North Dakota.\n5. Calgary Stampeders: Pick 5, Doug Brown, DL from Simon Fraser.\n6. Montreal Alouettes: Pick 6, Steve Charbonneau, DL from New Hampshire.\n7. Calgary (I assume this is another team or perhaps a duplication; but let's check): Pick 7, Jason Clemett, LB from Simon Fraser.\n8. Edmonton: Pick 8, Mark Farraway, DL from St. Francis Xavier.\n\nWait, I notice that in row 3, the CFL team is \"edmonton eskimos\", and their player is Ian Franklin who plays CB. So for Edmonton Eskimos, position isn't DL. But then in row 8, there's another entry for \"edmonton\" without specifying Eskimos. The player here is Mark Farraway, DL.\n\nSo now, let me list each team mentioned in the claim and see their corresponding positions:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders: Doug Brown plays DL (position is 'dl' as per table).\n- Montreal Alouettes: Steve Charbonneau plays DL.\n- Edmonton (Eskimos): The main entry for Edmonton Eskimos has Ian Franklin, CB. But there's another row where Edmonton (row 8) has Mark Farraway playing DL.\n\nHmm, so the claim says \"edmonton\", which might refer to the Edmonton Eskimos. In their main row, they have a CB, not DL. However, in another row labeled just \"edmonton\" (row 8), there's a DL player. So is this considered as part of Edmonton's picks? Or is it a separate team?\n\nIn the table, each pick corresponds to a team. The teams listed are:\n\n1. Toronto Argonauts\n2. Saskatchewan Roughriders\n3. Edmonton Eskimos\n4. Hamilton Tiger-Cats\n5. Calgary Stampeders\n6. Montreal Alouettes\n7. Calgary (could be a mistake or another team)\n8. Edmonton\n\nSo, for \"edmonton\", row 8 is a separate entry. So if the claim refers to Edmonton as in the main Eskimos team, their pick is CB, not DL. But there's another Edmonton entry with DL.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way the table is structured is that each pick is assigned to a specific team, and for Edmonton, they have two entries? That might be unusual because typically each team has one pick per round in a draft. Alternatively, it could be an error in the table.\n\nAssuming the claim refers to the main teams: Calgary Stampeders (row 5), Montreal Alouettes (row6), and Edmonton Eskimos (row3). Let's check their positions:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders: Doug Brown, DL.\n- Montreal Alouettes: Steve Charbonneau, DL.\n- Edmonton Eskimos: Ian Franklin, CB.\n\nSo for the claim to be TRUE, all three teams should have a player with position DL. But in row3, Edmonton Eskimos' pick is CB, not DL. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because one of the teams (Edmonton) does not have a DL but rather a CB.\n\nWait, but there's another entry for Edmonton in row8, where Mark Farraway plays DL. So if \"edmonton\" in the claim refers to this other pick, then perhaps both Calgary Stampeders and Montreal Alouettes have DLs, as well as this other Edmonton pick. But the main team is the Eskimos, so I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is referring to three teams: Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton (the one in row8). In that case:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders: Doug Brown, DL.\n- Montreal Alouettes: Steve Charbonneau, DL.\n- Edmonton (row8): Mark Farraway, DL.\n\nIn this scenario, all three have DL players. So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nBut wait, the table lists \"edmonton\" in row3 as Edmonton Eskimos with a CB, and another \"edmonton\" in row8 with DL. That might mean there are two teams named Edmonton? Or perhaps it's an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pick for Edmonton is split into two? But that doesn't make much sense in a draft context.\n\nLet me clarify: The claim mentions \"calgary stampeders\", \"montreal alouettes\", and \"edmonton\" as teams. In the table:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders are row5: DL.\n- Montreal Alouettes are row6: DL.\n- Edmonton is row3: CB (Eskimos) or row8: DL.\n\nSo if the claim refers to \"edmonton\" in row3, then their position is CB, not DL. Therefore, the claim would be FALSE because one of the teams does not have a DL.\n\nBut if the claim refers to the other Edmonton pick in row8, which is DL, then all three (Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton) have DL players. But I think it's more accurate that each team has one pick per round, so having two Edmonton entries might be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is considering only the main teams: Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton Eskimos (row3). In this case, since Edmonton's position is CB, not DL, the claim would be FALSE.\n\nWait, but in row8, \"edmonton\" has a DL. So maybe it's another team or perhaps an error. Alternatively, the claim might include both picks for Edmonton, but that seems unlikely because each team typically gets one pick per round.\n\nSo, considering only the main teams:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders: Yes (DL).\n- Montreal Alouettes: Yes (DL).\n- Edmonton Eskimos: No (CB).\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider both Edmonton picks as part of the same team, then perhaps it's TRUE because one pick is DL. But I think that's stretching it because each pick is a separate selection.\n\nSo, to be precise:\n\nThe claim mentions three teams and their respective draft picks. Each should have a player at position DL.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders: row5 - DL.\n- Montreal Alouettes: row6 - DL.\n- Edmonton: if referring to row3 (Eskimos), then CB; if referring to row8, DL.\n\nAssuming the claim is about the main teams, and given that Edmonton Eskimos have a CB, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, and Edmonton each selected a player at the defensive line (DL) position in the draft. \n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Calgary Stampeders (row5): Doug Brown - DL.\n- Montreal Alouettes (row6): Steve Charbonneau - DL.\n- Edmonton Eskimos (row3): Ian Franklin - CB.\n\nSince Edmonton's pick is a CB, not a DL, the claim is FALSE.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"there be 1 more dl position than there be player who play the position of ol\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The claim is comparing two counts from the table: the number of players with the position \"dl\" (defensive lineman) and the number of players with the position \"ol\" (offensive lineman). It's saying there is 1 more dl position than ol positions. So, if I count how many dl and ol positions there are in the table, I should check if dl count equals ol count plus one.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\n|   pick  | cfl team                  | player             | position    | college            |\n|-------:|:-------------------------|:------------------|:-----------|:------------------|\n|      1  | toronto argonauts         | chad folk          | ol          | utah               |\n|      2  | saskatchewan roughriders  | ben fairbrother    | ol          | calgary            |\n|      3  | edmonton eskimos          | ian franklin       | cb          | weber state        |\n|      4  | hamilton tiger  - cats    | tim prinsen        | og          | north dakota       |\n|      5  | calgary stampeders        | doug brown         | dl          | simon fraser       |\n|      6  | montreal alouettes        | steve charbonneau  | dl          | new hampshire      |\n|      7  | calgary                   | jason clemett      | lb          | simon fraser       |\n|      8  | edmonton                  | mark farraway      | dl          | st francis xavier  |\n\nI'll go through each row and count the number of players in \"dl\" and \"ol\" positions.\n\nStarting with ol:\n- Row 1: position is ol \u2192 count +=1\n- Row 2: position is ol \u2192 count +=1\n\nTotal ol positions: 2.\n\nNow for dl:\n- Row 5: dl \u2192 count +=1\n- Row 6: dl \u2192 count +=1\n- Row 8: dl \u2192 count +=1\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, row indices start at 0? Because in the table, pick 1 is row index 0? Let me check.\n\nIn markdown tables, typically, the first data row is considered as index 0 if we're using zero-based indexing. So:\n\nRow 0: ol\nRow 1: ol\nRows 2 and 3 are not dl or ol.\nRow 4: dl (row index 4)\nRow 5: dl (row index 5)\nRow 6 is lb, so not relevant.\nRow 7: dl (row index 7)\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount correctly.\n\nLooking at the table again:\n\nRows with position \"ol\":\n- Row 0: ol\n- Row 1: ol\n\nSo, total of 2 players in ol positions.\n\nRows with position \"dl\":\n- Row 4: dl\n- Row 5: dl\n- Row 7: dl\n\nThat's a total of 3 players in dl positions.\n\nNow, according to the claim, there should be 1 more dl than ol. So, if ol is 2, dl should be 3 (since 2+1=3). Which matches our counts.\n\nBut wait, looking back at row indices: pick 5 is Row 4? Because pick numbers start at 1 but rows in the table are zero-indexed. Let me confirm:\n\nPick 1 \u2192 Row 0\nPick 2 \u2192 Row 1\nPick 3 \u2192 Row 2\nPick 4 \u2192 Row 3\nPick 5 \u2192 Row 4\nPick 6 \u2192 Row 5\nPick 7 \u2192 Row 6\nPick 8 \u2192 Row 7\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo dl positions are in rows 4,5,7. That's three players: Doug Brown (Row4), Steve Charbonneau (Row5), Mark Farraway (Row7). So 3 dl.\n\nOl positions are in rows 0 and 1: Chad Folk and Ben Fairbrother. So 2 ol.\n\nThus, dl count is indeed one more than ol count (3 vs 2). Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount or misread positions. Let me list each row:\n\nRow0: position ol \u2192 count ol +=1\nRow1: position ol \u2192 count ol +=1\nRow4: dl \u2192 count dl +=1\nRow5: dl \u2192 count dl +=1\nRow7: dl \u2192 count dl +=1\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all the rows where position is either dl or ol. So:\n\nFor \"ol\":\n- Row0, column \"position\"\n- Row1, column \"position\"\n\nFor \"dl\":\n- Row4, column \"position\"\n- Row5, column \"position\"\n- Row7, column \"position\"\n\nThus, these are the relevant cells to determine the counts.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there is 1 more dl position than ol. From the table:\n\n- Ol positions: 2 (rows 0 and 1)\n- Dl positions: 3 (rows 4,5,7)\n\nSince 3 = 2 + 1, the claim holds true.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE  \n**Relevant Cells:** Rows with position \"ol\" and \"dl\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the draft pick by calgary be pick pick before the player, mark farraway\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. The wording seems a bit off, so I'll try to understand it correctly. It says that Calgary made a draft pick before Mark Farraway's pick. So, essentially, did Calgary select someone in an earlier round (lower pick number) than when Mark Farraway was picked?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The rows are ordered by pick number from 1 to 8.\n- Each row has details about the team that made the pick, the player, position, and college.\n\nLet me find the relevant information. I'll look for Calgary's picks and see where Mark Farraway is picked.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 2: Saskatoon Roughriders picked Ben Fairbrother at pick 2.\nRow 5: Calgary Stampeders picked Doug Brown at pick 5.\nRow 7: Calgary (presumably Stampeders) picked Jason Clemett at pick 7.\nRow 8: Edmonton (Eskimos) picked Mark Farraway at pick 8.\n\nWait, the last two picks are by Calgary and Edmonton. Pick 7 is Calgary's pick for Jason Clemett, and pick 8 is Edmonton's pick for Mark Farraway.\n\nSo Calgary made a pick at number 7, which is earlier than pick number 8 where Mark Farraway was picked. Therefore, Calgary did pick someone (Jason Clemett) before Mark Farraway's pick.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the draft pick by calgary be pick pick before the player mark farraway.\" So, it's about whether Calgary's pick occurred before Mark Farraway's pick. Since Calgary picked at 7 and Edmonton (not Calgary) picked Farraway at 8, yes, Calgary did make a pick before Farraway was picked.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because Calgary made their pick (pick 7) before Mark Farraway was selected by Edmonton in pick 8.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nFor Calgary's picks:\n- Row 5: Pick 5, Calgary Stampeders, Doug Brown\n- Row 7: Pick 7, Calgary, Jason Clemett\n\nBut since the claim is about Calgary picking before Farraway, I need to check the pick numbers. The key cells are where Calgary made their picks and where Mark Farraway was picked.\n\nSo, relevant cells include:\n\n- For Calgary's first pick at row 5: columns 'pick' (value 5) and 'player' (Doug Brown)\n- For Calgary's second pick at row 7: columns 'pick' (7), 'cfl team' (calgary), 'player' (Jason Clemett)\n- For Mark Farraway's pick at row 8: columns 'pick' (8), 'cfl team' (edmonton), 'player' (Mark Farraway)\n\nThese cells help confirm that Calgary had a pick before Farraway was selected.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"cfl team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim seems a bit grammatically off, but I think it's asking if Mark Farraway was picked (selected) before Chad Folk. So, in other words, does Mark Farraway have an earlier pick number than Chad Folk?\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective details including the \"pick\" number. The columns are: pick, cfl team, player, position, and college.\n\nFirst, I'll find the rows where the players are Mark Farraway and Chad Folk.\n\n- For Chad Folk: Scanning through the table, I see that he's in row 0 (since indexing starts at 0). His details are:\n  - Pick: 1\n  - Team: toronto argonauts\n  - Position: ol\n  - College: utah\n\n- For Mark Farraway: Looking further down, he's in row 7. His details:\n  - Pick: 8\n  - Team: edmonton\n  - Position: dl\n  - College: st francis xavier\n\nSo, Chad Folk is picked at number 1 and Mark Farraway at number 8. Since 8 comes after 1 in the pick order, Mark Farraway was picked after Chad Folk.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"mark farraway be pick before chad folk\" would be FALSE because his pick (8) is later than Chad Folk's pick (1).\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For Chad Folk: The pick number is in row 0 under the 'pick' column.\n- For Mark Farraway: His pick number is in row 7 under the 'pick' column.\n\nSo, these two cells are crucial to determine their pick order.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Mark Farraway was picked after Chad Folk.

That's the first player from SFU.\n6. Row 5: College is New Hampshire. Not Simon Fraser.\n7. Row 6: College is Simon Fraser again. So that's the second player from SFU.\n8. Row 7: College is St. Francis Xavier. Not Simon Fraser.\n\nWait, so in row 4, Doug Brown from Calgary Stampeder comes from Simon Fraser. Then in row 6, Jason Clemett from Calgary also comes from Simon Fraser. That means there are two players picked who are from Simon Fraser.\n\nThe claim says \"only 1 player,\" but according to the table, it's actually two. Therefore, the claim is false because more than one player was picked from Simon Fraser.\n\nI should note down the relevant cells for each of these picks. For row 4 (index 4), column \"college\" shows Simon Fraser, and for row 6 (index 6), same thing. So those are the two cells that support that there are two players from Simon Fraser, making the claim false.\n\nSo putting it all together: The answer is FALSE because there are two players picked from Simon Fraser, not just one.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists two players from Simon Fraser University (Doug Brown and Jason Clemett), which contradicts the claim of only one player being picked from there. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"college\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"college\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"draft pick from calgary stampeders , montreal alouettes and edmonton play the position ol\". So, the claim states that each of these teams (CFL team) has a draft pick who plays the OL (offensive line) position.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with columns: pick number, CFL team, player, position, and college. Each row represents a different draft pick.\n\nI'll go through each team mentioned in the claim and check their respective positions:\n\n1. **Calgary Stampeders**: From the table, Calgary Stampeders have two entries:\n   - Pick 2: Ben Fairbrother, OL\n   - Pick 7: Jason Clemett, LB\n   So, for Calgary, one of their picks is an OL (Ben Fairbrother), which supports part of the claim.\n\n2. **Montreal Alouettes**: Their entry is pick 6: Steve Charbonneau, DL.\n   DL stands for Defensive Lineman, not OL. This means Montreal's pick isn't playing OL, which goes against the claim.\n\n3. **Edmonton Eskimos**: They have two entries:\n   - Pick 3: Ian Franklin, CB\n   - Pick 8: Mark Farraway, DL\n   Neither of these positions is OL. So, Edmonton's picks don't align with the claim either.\n\nPutting it all together, only Calgary has a pick in the OL position as per the table. Montreal and Edmonton do not have any OL players listed. Therefore, the claim that all three teams (Calgary, Montreal, Edmonton) have draft picks playing OL is FALSE because Montreal and Edmonton's relevant picks are DL or other positions.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because while Calgary has an OL pick, both Montreal and Edmonton do not.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Teams in the Claim**: Calgary Stampeders, Montreal Alouettes, Edmonton (Eskimos).\n2. **Check Positions for Each Team**:\n   - **Calgary**: Ben Fairbrother is OL.\n   - **Montreal**: Steve Charbonneau is DL.\n   - **Edmonton**: Both picks are CB and DL, not OL.\n3. **Conclusion**: Since only Calgary has an OL pick among the three teams, the claim that all three have OL draft picks is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "more player pick played the ol position than the dl position",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"more player pick played the ol position than the dl position.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each column represents. The relevant columns here are \"position\" which tells us the role each player has, and possibly \"pick,\" though the pick number itself might not be as important unless we're considering the order or something else. But in this case, it's about counting positions.\n\nI'll go through each row to count how many players are OL (offensive line) versus DL (defensive line).\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Position is \"ol\" \u2192 OL count =1\nRow 1: Position is \"ol\" \u2192 OL count=2\nRow 3: Position is \"og\" which I think stands for offensive guard, so still OL? Or is that a separate position? Wait, maybe OG is considered part of the offensive line. So OL count would be 3.\nWait, but sometimes positions like OG and OT are specific roles within OL, so perhaps they should all be counted as OL.\n\nRow 4: Position is \"dl\" \u2192 DL count=1\nRow 5: Position is \"dl\" \u2192 DL count=2\nRow 7: Position is \"dl\" \u2192 DL count=3\n\nSo counting:\n\nOL positions (rows 0,1,3): 3 players\nDL positions (rows 4,5,7): 3 players\n\nWait, that's equal. So the claim says more OL than DL, but they are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe OG is considered a separate position and not part of OL? If so, then OL would be rows 0 and1: count=2, DL=3 \u2192 then OL < DL, making the claim FALSE.\n\nBut I think in CFL, positions like OT (offensive tackle), OG (offensive guard) are all part of the offensive line. So OG is OL. Therefore, OL has 3 players, DL also has 3. The counts are equal, so the claim that more players picked were OL than DL would be FALSE.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nRows:\n\n0: ol\n1: ol\n2: cb (cornerback)\n3: og (offensive guard) \u2192 considered OL?\n4: dl\n5: dl\n6: lb (linebacker)\n7: dl\n\nSo if OG is part of OL, then rows 0,1,3 are OL (count=3). DL is rows 4,5,7 (count=3). So equal.\n\nIf the claim says more OL than DL, and they're equal, the answer is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, if OG isn't considered OL, then OL count is 2 vs DL 3 \u2192 still OL < DL, so the claim is FALSE either way.\n</think>\n\nThe claim compares the number of players picked for OL versus DL positions. Counting each:\n\n- OL: Rows 0 (ol), 1 (ol), 3 (og) = 3 players\n- DL: Rows 4 (dl), 5 (dl), 7 (dl) = 3 players\n\nSince they are equal, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: pick, cfl team, player, position, college. The rows are numbered from 1 to 8.\n\nThe claim states that Jason Clemett was picked after Mark Farraway. To verify this, I need to find their respective picks in the table and compare their positions.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Jason Clemett is listed in row 7 with a pick number of 7.\n- Mark Farraway is in row 8 with a pick number of 8.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check that. The rows are numbered from 0 to 7 because it's zero-indexed. So row 6 has pick 7 for Jason Clemett and row 7 has pick 8 for Mark Farraway.\n\nSo according to the table, Jason Clemett was picked at position 7, and Mark Farraway at position 8. That means Jason was picked before Mark because a lower pick number indicates an earlier selection in the draft order.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Jason Clemett was picked after Mark Farraway is incorrect.
