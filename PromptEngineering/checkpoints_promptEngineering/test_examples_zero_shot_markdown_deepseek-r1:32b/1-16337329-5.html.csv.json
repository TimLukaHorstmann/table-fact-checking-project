    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the past habitual and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the probable future.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d gari is the past habitual.\"\n2. \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas is the probable future.\"\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for different tenses and forms: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nEach row corresponds to a person and number. Let's see where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" are located.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d gari is the past habitual.\"\n\nIn the table, the 'past habitual' column has several entries. Looking through each row:\n\n- First person singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901\n- First person plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901\n- Second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d (this is where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" appears)\n- The column for 'past habitual' in the second person singular row shows \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\", which means 'you used to do.' Wait, but the claim says it's 'you did,' not 'used to do.' That might be a problem.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d gari 'you did' be the past habitual.\" But according to the table, in the second person singular low-grade row under 'past habitual', it's written as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f \u0938\u094d garthis 'you used to do'\". Hmm, but wait no\u2014the claim refers to \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\", which is actually in the simple past column. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Second person singular low-grade: \n  - probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d\n  - simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d (so this cell says 'you did')\n  - past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f \u0938\u094d 'you used to do'\n\nSo \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" is in the simple past column, not past habitual. The claim incorrectly assigns it as past habitual.\n\nNow for the second part: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas is the probable future.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Second person singular low-grade:\n  - probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e \u0938\u094d\n  - simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\n\nWait, so \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" is in the 'simple present / future' column. The claim says it's the probable future, which would be under the 'probable future' column. But according to the table, 'probable future' for second person singular low-grade is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e \u0938\u094d. So \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" is in the wrong category.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" is simple past, not past habitual; and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" is simple present/future, not probable future.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly categorizes both words. \"\u0917\u0930\u093f \u0938\u094d\" belongs to the simple past, and \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" belongs to the simple present/future.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do' be the imperative and \u0917\u0930\u093fs gari 'you did' be the past habitual.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the two parts of the claim.\n\n1. The first part says that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is an imperative.\n2. The second part says that \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" is a past habitual.\n\nI need to check these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, the columns are: simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative.\n\nEach row corresponds to different grammatical persons (first singular, first plural, etc.) and in some cases, middle grade or high grade for second person.\n\nLet's tackle each part of the claim.\n\nStarting with \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" being an imperative. I'll look at the imperative column. Let's find where \"gares\" is mentioned.\n\nLooking through the imperative column:\n\n- Second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do' \u2013 this matches exactly what the claim says for the imperative form. So, that part seems correct.\n\nNow, checking if it's under the imperative column and the correct row. The row is second person singular low-grade.\n\nNext, the second part: \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" being past habitual. Let me check the past habitual column.\n\nIn the past habitual column:\n\n- Second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you used to do' \u2013 but wait, the claim says \"gari\" is 'you did', which might be a mistake because in the table, the past simple is under 'simple past'. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the simple past column for second person singular low-grade: it's \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis with the translation 'you did'.\n\nBut in the claim, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" as past habitual. In the table, past habitual for second person singular low-grade is \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis, but the translation is 'you used to do', which aligns with past habitual. However, the term in the claim is \"gari\", but in the table it's spelled \"garis\". So there might be a discrepancy here because of an extra 's' or not.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look again. The second person singular low-grade under past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis with translation 'you used to do'. But in the claim, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\", which seems like a typo because the table has \"garis\". Alternatively, perhaps the claim misspelled it as \"gari\" instead of \"garis\".\n\nSo if the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" is past habitual, but in reality, it should be \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\", then that would make the claim incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up rows. Let me check all the rows for the past habitual column to see where \"gari\" appears.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- First person singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd 'i used to do'\n- First person plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\n- Second person singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you used to do'\n- Second person middle/plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094c garthyau\n- High grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo\n- Third person singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\n- Third person plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe\n\nI don't see \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" in the past habitual column. The closest is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\", which is under second person singular low-grade, but it's spelled with an 's'. So if the claim says \"gari\" without the 's', that might not match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again: in the table, for past habitual, second person singular low-grade is \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis. The claim states \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\". Maybe it's a typo in the claim where they omitted the 's' or added an extra 's'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong row. Let me check all the past habitual entries again.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the transcription of the claim. The claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\", but in the table, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\". So if the word is spelled as \"gari\" without the 's', that might not be present in the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong column or row. Let me check each part carefully.\n\nFor the first part of the claim: imperative form \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" \u2013 found correctly under second person singular low-grade in the imperative column.\n\nSecond part: past habitual as \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\". Looking through the past habitual column, I don't find exactly \"gari\"; it's either \"garis\" or other forms. So this suggests that the claim is incorrect because the correct form is \"garis\", not \"gari\".\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: one correct and one incorrect.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check:\n\n- The imperative part is correct.\n- The past habitual part in the claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" as past habitual. But in reality, the past simple for second person singular low-grade is \"garis\", not \"gari\". So if the claim refers to past habitual, then it's mixing up with the simple past.\n\nWait, no: the past simple is under 'simple past', which for second person singular low-grade is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\" meaning 'you did'. The past habitual is a different tense. In the table, past habitual for that row is also \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\", but the translation is 'you used to do'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused because both simple past and past habitual have similar forms here.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\n- Simple past: second person singular low-grade is \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you did'\n- Past habitual: same row has \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you used to do'\n\nSo in this case, the form \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\" serves both? Or perhaps they are different.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me check again:\n\nIn the table:\n\nFor second person singular low-grade:\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you did'\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you used to do'\n\nSo in this specific case, both forms are same \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\", but with different translations.\n\nTherefore, if the claim says that \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" is past habitual, it's referring to the correct form because in the table, under past habitual for that row, it's \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis. But the claim writes it as \"gari\" without the 's', which doesn't exactly match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be \"garis\". If so, then the claim is correct because it refers to the same form but with a different translation.\n\nWait, no. The claim says \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" as past habitual, while in reality, under past habitual, it's spelled \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\".\n\nSo if the claim has an error in spelling (omitting 's'), then that part is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the imperative part is correct, but the past habitual part may not be because of the spelling difference or because it's referring to a different row.\n\nWait another thing: maybe \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" is in another row. Looking through all rows:\n\n- First person singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947\u0901 garth\u1ebd\n- First plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0901 garthya\u0169\n- Second singular low-grade: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\n- Second middle/plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094c garthyau\n- High grade: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo\n- Third singular: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo\n- Third plural: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 garthe\n\nI don't see \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" except in the second person singular low-grade as \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\". So unless it's a typo, the claim might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe the user intended to refer to \"garis\" but wrote \"gari\".\n\nIn that case, if we consider that, then both parts would be correct: imperative as \"gares\" and past habitual as \"garis\".\n\nBut given the exact wording of the claim is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\", which doesn't match exactly with what's in the table (which is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\"), this suggests an error.\n\nTherefore, the first part is correct, but the second part has a typo or is incorrect because it refers to \"gari\" instead of \"garis\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe there's another row where \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\" appears as past habitual.\n\nWait, no. Looking through all rows in the table, I don't see any other occurrence of \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\". So unless it's a different person or number, which doesn't seem to be the case here, the claim is partially correct.\n\nTherefore, considering this analysis:\n\nThe imperative form is correctly identified as \"gares\".\n\nHowever, the past habitual form in the claim is incorrectly spelled as \"gari\" instead of \"garis\", making that part incorrect.\n\nThus, only one part is correct. But wait, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, let me read the table again to make sure:\n\nLooking at second person singular low-grade:\n\n- imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\n- simple past: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you did'\n- past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093fs garis 'you used to do'\n\nSo in this case, both simple past and past habitual share the same form \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\", but with different translations.\n\nTherefore, if the claim refers to past habitual as \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs gari\", which is a typo (missing 's'), then it's incorrect. But if we assume it's a typo and they meant \"garis\", then both parts are correct.\n\nBut given that the claim has \"gari\" without 's', I think the answer should be that only one form is correctly identified, so the number of correct answers is 1.\n</think>\n\nThe task requires determining how many of the two forms in the claim are correct. The first form (imperative) is correct, while the second form (past habitual) has a typo and is incorrect.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{1}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. The table is in markdown format and shows different verb forms in Nepali along with their English translations. The claim states: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do' be the injunctive and \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he did' be the past habitual.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has six columns: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. Each row corresponds to different persons (like first person singular, plural, etc.) and their respective verb forms.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific entries:\n1. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo as the injunctive for \"he used to do.\"\n2. \u0917\u0930\u094d\u094b garyo as the past habitual for \"he did.\"\n\nI need to check each part against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: injunctive form for \"he used to do.\" In the table, the injunctive column has entries under different rows. I'll look through each row's injunctive column to find where \"he\" is involved.\n\nLooking at the third person singular low-grade row (row index 6), the injunctive column shows \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos with the translation 'may he do.' That doesn't match the claim. Next, in the third person middle-grade/plural masculine row (row index 7), the injunctive is \u0917\u0930\u0942\u0928\u094d gar\u016bn, translating to 'may they do.' Still not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other rows. The high-grade row (row index 5) has an injunctive form of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo with the translation 'you used to do.' Hmm, that's in the second person middle/plural context. But the claim refers to \"he,\" which is third person singular.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake. The third person singular low-grade row (row index 6) has in the past habitual column: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo with 'he used to do.' So that's under past habitual, not injunctive. That contradicts the claim.\n\nNow for the second part of the claim: garyo as the past habitual for \"he did.\" Looking at row index 6 again, the simple past column has \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo with 'he did.' So that's correct in the context of simple past, not past habitual. The past habitual for he is actually garthyo (third person singular low-grade), which is under the past habitual column.\n\nSo putting it together: the claim says garthyo is injunctive and garyo is past habitual. But from the table, garthyo is in the past habitual column for third person singular, and garyo is in the simple past column. Therefore, the claim has mixed up these two forms.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE because it incorrectly assigns the forms to the wrong tenses.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The 'past habitual' in that row is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo. So according to this, garyo is simple past, not past habitual.\n\nSo the claim says garyo is past habitual, which doesn't match the table. That would make the first part of the claim incorrect.\n\nNow the second point: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does' be the probable future.\" Looking at the same third person singular low-grade row (row 6), under 'simple present/future' it's \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha with meaning 'he does.' The 'probable future' column for this row is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e garl\u0101, which means 'he will probably do.'\n\nSo the claim says that garcha is probable future, but according to the table, garcha is in simple present/future and garl\u0101 is probable future. Therefore, the second part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. For third person singular low-grade:\n\n- Simple present/future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b (garcha) 'he does'\n- Probable future: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e (garl\u0101) 'he will probably do'\n\nSo the claim says garcha is probable future, which it's not\u2014it\u2019s in simple present/future. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect.\n\nWait another thing\u2014maybe I got confused between rows. Let me check if there's any row where \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b (garcha) is under probable future. Looking through all the rows:\n\nFirst person singular: garchu is simple present/future, gar\u0169l\u0101 is probable future.\nThird person singular low-grade: garcha is simple present/future, garl\u0101 is probable future.\n\nSo no, garcha is not in probable future; it's in simple present/future. Similarly, garyo is in simple past, not past habitual.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on both counts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is about grammatical forms in a language, likely Nepali or similar, given the verbs and endings. It suggests that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" is the past habitual form of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\".\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nEach row corresponds to different grammatical persons and numbers. I need to find where \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d\" is located and then check if its corresponding past habitual form is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\".\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. First person singular: Doesn't apply here since the pronoun in the claim is second person.\n2. Second person singular low-grade: Here, under the 'simple present/future' column, we have \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do'\". So this seems relevant.\n\nNow, to find the past habitual form of \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d\", I should look at the same row but in the 'past habitual' column. In the second person singular low-grade row, under 'past habitual', it's listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d garthis 'you used to do'\". \n\nThe claim says that the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\", which doesn't match with what's in the table (\"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d\"). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n\n- The second person singular low-grade row under 'simple present / future' for \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d\".\n- The same row under 'past habitual' which shows \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0938\u094d\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\".\n\nThis means the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is linking two forms: the past habitual and the imperative. So, it's saying that the imperative form corresponding to the past habitual \"\u0917\u0930\u093f (gari)\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d (gares)\". \n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. Each row corresponds to different grammatical persons.\n\nThe claim mentions the imperative form of the past habitual. So I need to check both the 'past habitual' and 'imperative' columns for the relevant rows.\n\nLet's break down the terms:\n- \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is in the past habitual column. I'll look under that column.\n- The claim says the imperative form is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\", so I need to check the 'imperative' column for the same row where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is found.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" appears. Scanning through the rows:\n\nRow 2: Second person singular low-grade\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f (gari)\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947 (gare)\n\nWait, but in the claim, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\". So I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me double-check. In row 2 of the table:\n\n- Past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f (gari)\"\n- Imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947 (gare)\" \n\nBut the claim states it should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\". Hmm, so according to the table, under the imperative column for this row, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I looking at the correct row? Let me double-check. The claim says \"you did\" in past habitual and \"may you do\" in imperative.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFor second person singular low-grade:\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u093f (gari) 'you did'\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u0947 (gare) 'may you do'\n\nSo the imperative form for this row is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".\n\nWait, but in another row, maybe? Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at row 3: second person middle-grade/plural\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094c (gar yau) 'you did'\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094c (gara u)\n\nHmm, not matching. \n\nRow 4 is high grade:\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garnuhunthyo)\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d (garnuhos)\n\nNo match.\n\nLooking at row 5: third person singular low-grade\n- Past habitual: \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b (garth yo)\n- Imperative: \u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d (gar os)\n\nStill not matching \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The claim says the imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\" but in the table for second person singular low-grade, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\". But wait, let me check if there are any typos or similar forms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the rows. Let me count the rows again.\n\nRows:\n\n0: first person singular\n1: first person plural\n2: second person singular low grade\n3: second person middle grade/plural\n4: high grade (second person?)\n5: third person singular low-grade\n6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a row. Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: first person singular\nRow 1: first person plural\nRow 2: second person singular low-grade\nRow 3: second person middle-grade/plural\nRow 4: high grade (probably second person)\nRow 5: third person singular low-grade\nRow 6: third person middle-grade/plural masculine\n\nYes, so row 2 is second person singular low-grade.\n\nIn that row, the past habitual is \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" and imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\".\n\nBut the claim says the imperative should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". However, in the table, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\".\n\nWait, could there be a typo? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding which rows correspond to which persons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to a different row. Let me check all the imperatives:\n\nRow 0: imperative is \"\u0917\u0930\"\nRow 1: \"\u0917\u0930\u0942\u0901\u0939\u094b\"\nRow 2: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\"\nRow 3: \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\"\nRow 4: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u094b\u0938\u094d\"\nRow 5: \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d\"\nRow 6: \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0907\u090f\"\n\nNone of these match \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". So the claim is saying that \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" (past habitual) corresponds to imperative \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\", but according to the table, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The correct imperative form for the past habitual \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding which part of speech we're looking at. The claim says \"the imperative of the past habitual\". So perhaps it's about conjugation where the past habitual form leads to a specific imperative.\n\nBut in any case, based on the table provided, the imperative for the row where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is present (row 2) is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\", not \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\".\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the imperative form of the past habitual \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\" is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d\". However, according to the table, in row 2 under the imperative column, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n  ],\n  \"is_claim_true\": false,\n  \"explanation\": \"The past habitual form '\u0917\u0930\u093f' corresponds to the imperative form '\u0917\u0930\u0947', not '\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d'.\"\n}\n```",

So, it's claiming that \"garyo\" is the past habitual form corresponding to \"garcha\".\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check two things: what is \"garcha\" and where it appears, and then see if its past habitual form is indeed \"garyo\".\n\nFirst, let's locate \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha\". Scanning through the rows under the \"simple present / future\" column. \n\n- The third person singular low-grade row in the first column has \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b garcha 'he does'\". So this is our starting point.\n\nNext, I need to find what the past habitual form of \"garcha\" would be. Past habitual is a different tense, so looking at the table's columns: there's a column named \"past habitual\".\n\nIn that column, for each subject, we can see the corresponding verb forms. For the third person singular low-grade row (which is where \"garcha\" is located), the past habitual form is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b garyo 'he used to do'\". \n\nSo according to this, \"garyo\" is indeed the past habitual of \"garcha\".

The task is to determine whether the claim \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he use to do , ' be the injunctive of \u0917\u0930\u094d\u094b garyo 'he did'\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. The claim is stating that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive form of \"garyo\". So, my goal is to find where these terms appear in the table and check their respective tenses.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for different verb forms: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. Each row represents a different grammatical person (like first person singular, plural, etc.) and sometimes includes additional details like grade or number.\n\nI'll start by identifying where \"garyo\" is located. Scanning the \"simple past\" column, I find \"garyo\" under the third person singular low-grade entry. So that's row index 6, column \"simple past\". \n\nNext, I need to locate \"garthyo\". Checking the \"injunctive\" column for the same row (third person singular low-grade), I see \"garthyo\" listed as 'he used to do'. This suggests that \"garthyo\" is indeed in the injunctive form.\n\nNow, to verify if \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\", both should be in the same row but under different columns. In this case, they are: \"garyo\" is in \"simple past\" and \"garthyo\" is in \"injunctive\" for the third person singular low-grade.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"garthyo\" is the injunctive of \"garyo\" holds true based on their positions in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

The term \"injunctive\" is one of the columns in the table. So, I need to look at the row where the second person singular low-grade is mentioned and check both the present/future and injunctive forms.\n\nLooking at the table structure, rows are categorized by person and number (singular, plural), and grades (like low, middle). The columns include categories like simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. \n\nThe claim is about a specific form in the injunctive column for the second person singular low-grade. Let me check that row:\n\n- In the \"injunctive\" column of the second person singular low-grade row, the value is \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'. \n- The simple past (third column) for the same row is \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d garis 'you did'.\n\nSo, the claim says that \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares is the injunctive form corresponding to the simple past form \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d. \n\nLooking at the table, I can confirm:\n- For second person singular low-grade, the simple past is indeed \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d (garis).\n- The injunctive for that row is \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares.\n\nThus, the claim correctly states that \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares 'may you do'\" is the injunctive form of \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". \n\nI should also check if there are any other relevant cells to support this. The row index for second person singular low-grade is 3 (if rows start at 0). The columns involved are \"simple past\" and \"injunctive\".\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 3, column \"simple past\": \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari\n- Row 3, column \"injunctive\": \u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\n\nThis fully supports the claim. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part means. The subject here is the past habitual form. The table has several columns: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. Each row represents different persons (first singular, first plural, etc.) and their respective verb forms.\n\nThe claim mentions \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d gari 'you did'\". Looking at the table, I need to find where \"\u0917\u0930\u093f\u0938\u094d\" appears. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Second person singular low-grade: under simple past is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs\" with the meaning \"you did\". So that's row index 3 (since counting starts from 0) in the 'simple past' column.\n\nNow, the claim states that the past habitual of this form should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d gares\", which translates to 'may you do'. Let me check the past habitual column for the same person. The second person singular low-grade's past habitual is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d\" in row 3, column 'past habitual', with the meaning 'you used to do'.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says it should be \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d gares 'may you do'\", but according to the table, the past habitual for second person singular low-grade is indeed \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d\" and the meaning is 'you used to do'. However, the claim associates \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d\" with 'may you do', which actually belongs to the imperative mood.\n\nLooking at the imperative column for second person singular low-grade, it's \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d gares\" with the meaning 'may you do'. So, the confusion is between past habitual and imperative. The claim incorrectly attributes the imperative form to the past habitual.\n\nTherefore, the correct past habitual is in row 3 under 'past habitual', which is \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s\u094d\", but its meaning is not 'may you do' as claimed. Instead, it's 'you used to do'. Hence, the claim is incorrect because it mixes up the imperative form with the past habitual.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the imperative form with the past habitual, making it FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"simple past\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has several columns like 'simple present / future', 'probable future', etc., and rows for different persons and grades.\n\nThe claim is talking about the probable future form of a specific verb form. The given word is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas, which according to the table, falls under the \"simple present / future\" column. Looking at the second person singular low-grade row (row index 2), I see that under 'simple present / future', it's garchas, and its probable future form is garl\u0101s in the same row but under the 'probable future' column.\n\nThe claim states that the probable future of garchas is gari. However, from the table, the probable future for garchas should be garl\u0101s (\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d), not gari (\u0917\u0930\u093f). The word gari actually appears in the 'simple past' column for the same row, which means it's the past tense, not the probable future.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it associates the past form with the probable future.

It's talking about two specific phrases and their corresponding tenses. The first part is about \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e\" which is supposed to be in the simple past tense as \"i will (probably) do.\" The second part is about \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b\" being in the injunctive tense, meaning 'you used to do.'\n\nI'll start by looking at each part separately.\n\nLooking at the table, let's find where \"gar\u0169l\u0101\" appears. Scanning through the rows and columns, I see that in the first person singular row under the probable future column, it says \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do'\". Wait, but according to the table, this is actually under the \"probable future\" tense, not the simple past. So if someone claims that \"gar\u0169l\u0101\" is in the simple past, that would be incorrect because it's listed under probable future.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the claim: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo 'you used to do'\". Let me check where this phrase appears. In the high grade row under the injunctive column, I see \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b garnuhunthyo\" with the meaning 'you used to do.' So that part is correct; it's in the injunctive tense.\n\nPutting it together: The claim says that \"gar\u0169l\u0101\" is in the simple past, which isn't accurate because it's actually in the probable future. Therefore, the first part of the claim is false, even though the second part about \"garnuhunthyo\" being correct. Since one part is wrong and the other is right, but the claim ties both together as a single statement, the overall claim must be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe phrase \"\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101 'i will (probably) do'\" is listed under the probable future tense for the first person singular in the table. The claim incorrectly states it's in the simple past. \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garnuhunthyo\" is correctly in the injunctive tense as per the high grade row, but since the first part is wrong, the entire claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"probable future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"injunctive\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It seems like the claim is comparing two phrases from the table and stating that one should correspond to another under different columns.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nColumns are: simple present / future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, imperative.\n\nRows are divided into different persons and grades.\n\nLet's break down the two parts of the claim.\n\n1. The first part is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169 'we (will) do' in the probable future.\" So, this is under the probable future column for we. Let me check that row.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- First person plural: In the probable future column, it's \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e gar\u0169l\u0101  'i will (probably) do'. Wait, no\u2014actually, first person plural in probable future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0932\u093e gara\u0169l\u0101\" which means 'we will probably do'.\n\nBut the claim says \"garcha\u0169\" for we. Let's check where that is.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nFirst person plural: Probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0932\u093e, not garcha\u0169. So maybe I'm looking elsewhere.\n\nWait, second person middle grade/plural in simple present/future is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c garchau\", and probable future for them is \"\u0917\u0930\u094c\u0932\u093e garaul\u0101\".\n\nSo perhaps the claim refers to the second person middle-grade plural? But the first part says 'we (will) do', which would be first person plural.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The phrase \"garcha\u0169\" in the probable future\u2014so looking for that.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- First person singular: probable future is \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e.\n- Second person middle-grade/plural: probable future is \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0932\u093e.\n- High grade (second person): probable future is garnuhola.\n- Third person singular low-grade: probable future is garl\u0101.\n\nWait, none of these seem to be \"garcha\u0169\" in the probable future. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check all rows under the probable future column.\n\nRow 0 (first person singular): probable future = \u0917\u0930\u0941\u0901\u0932\u093e\nRow 1 (first person plural): probable future = \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0901\u0932\u093e\nRow 2 (second person singular low grade): probable future = \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0938\u094d\nRow 3 (second person middle-grade/plural): probable future = \u0917\u0930\u094c\u0932\u093e\nRow 4 (high grade): probable future = garnuhola\nRow 5 (third person singular low-grade): probable future = garl\u0101\nRow 6 (third person middle-grade/plural masculine): probable future = garl\u0101n\n\nSo \"garcha\u0169\" isn't in the probable future column at all. Instead, garcha\u0169 is under the simple present/future for first person plural: row 1, column 'simple present / future' is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u094c\u0901 garcha\u0169\".\n\nBut the claim says that this phrase (garcha\u0169) is in the probable future. That's incorrect because it's actually in the simple present or future.\n\nNow, looking at the second part of the claim: 'be \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b garthyo 'he used to do' in the imperative.'\n\nWait, so they're saying that garcha\u0169 (from probable future) should be garthyo in imperative. Let's check where garthyo is.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Third person singular low-grade: past habitual is \u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u094b.\nSo row 5, column 'past habitual' is \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u094b\" which translates to 'he used to do'.\n\nIn the imperative column for third person singular low-grade is \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d garos\".\n\nSo, the claim says that the phrase from probable future (garcha\u0169) should be in imperative as garthyo. But according to the table, garthyo is in past habitual, not imperative.\n\nMoreover, looking at the imperative column for third person singular low-grade: it's \"\u0917\u0930\u094b\u0938\u094d\", which is different from garthyo.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nThe claim seems to have two issues:\n1. It incorrectly states that garcha\u0169 is under probable future when in reality, it's under simple present/future.\n2. It claims that this should be garthyo in imperative, but garthyo is actually a past habitual form for third person singular.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect. The answer would be \"FALSE\", and the relevant cells are:\n\n- garcha\u0169 is in row 1 (first person plural) under 'simple present / future'.\n- garthyo is in row 5 (third person singular low-grade) under 'past habitual'.\n\nBut wait, the question asks whether the claim is true based on the table. Since the claim incorrectly assigns these phrases to different columns than they actually are, the answer should be false.\n\nSo, the relevant cells would be where each of these phrases are located:\n\n- garcha\u0169: row 1, 'simple present / future'.\n- garthyo: row 5, 'past habitual'.\n\nBut since the claim is making a connection between them under different columns which isn't accurate, the answer should reflect that.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"past habitual\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas 'you (will) do' be the simple past for \u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares 'may you do'\". Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the table. The columns are different verb forms in Nepali: simple present/future, probable future, simple past, past habitual, injunctive, and imperative. Each row corresponds to a different person and number, like first person singular, plural, second person singular low grade, etc.\n\nThe claim is connecting \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" as the simple past of \"\u0917\u0930\u0947\u0938\u094d gares\". So I need to check where these two forms are located in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\", I see it's under the first column, which is labeled \"simple present / future\", and it's in the row for second person singular low-grade. The translation given is 'you (will) do'.\n\nNext, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is listed under the sixth column, which is \"imperative\". It appears in the same row as \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\", that's the second person singular low-grade row. Its translation is 'may you do'.\n\nThe claim suggests that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is the simple past of \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\". But according to the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" falls under the imperative mood, not the simple past.\n\nLooking at the simple past column (third column), in the second person singular low-grade row, the form is \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\", which translates to 'you did'. That's the actual simple past for this person and number. \n\nSo \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is imperative, not a future or present tense. Therefore, it doesn't have a simple past as per the table; its function is different.\n\nThus, the claim that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is the simple past of \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" isn't supported by the table. The relevant cells are in rows 3 and 2 for these forms.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is the simple past of \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\". From the table, \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is under the imperative mood, while \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" is a future tense. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the forms in question:** The claim mentions \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u091b\u0938\u094d garchas\" and \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\".\n\n2. **Locate them in the table:**\n   - \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\" is found in the \"simple present / future\" column, second person singular low-grade row.\n   - \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is in the \"imperative\" column for the same row.\n\n3. **Determine their grammatical functions:**\n   - \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\" expresses a future action ('you (will) do').\n   - \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" is an imperative form, used to give commands or requests ('may you do').\n\n4. **Check the simple past for this row:** The simple past is listed as \"\u0917\u0930\u093fs garis\", translating to 'you did'.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since \"\u0917\u0930\u0947s gares\" isn't a verb whose past form would be \"\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0938\u094d garchas\", the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"simple present / future\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"imperative\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
