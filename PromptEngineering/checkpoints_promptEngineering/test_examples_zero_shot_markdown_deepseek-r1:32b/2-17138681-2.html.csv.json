    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be more than 12.42 million viewers for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what's needed. The claim refers to an entry in the table that has a specific rating and share combination\u20143.2/8\u2014and it's making a statement about whether the number of viewers is more than 12.42 million.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: rating, share, rating/share (18-49), viewers (millions), and rank (overall). The relevant information here will be in the \"rating / share\" column and the \"viewers (millions)\" column.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table to find where the rating/share is 3.2/8. Scanning down:\n\n- Row 5: rating/share is 3.2 / 8, viewers are 12.42 million.\nWait, that's exactly matching the criteria. So the entry in question is at row index 5.\n\nThe claim says \"more than 12.42 million,\" but looking at row 5, the viewers are exactly 12.42 million. Therefore, it's not more; it's equal.\n\nSo, does the claim hold? No, because 12.42 isn't more than itself. It's exactly that number. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- The row with index 5 (assuming rows are zero-indexed or perhaps starting from the top as row 0). Wait, actually, in the table provided, the first data row is row 0. Let me check the numbering again.\n\nWait, looking back at the table structure, it's given as markdown with headers and then 12 data rows (from index 0 to 11). So the entry with rating/share 3.2 /8 is in row 5 (counting from 0).\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n\n- For that specific entry, we need both \"rating / share\" and \"viewers (millions)\" columns.\n\nTherefore, the two cells are:\n\n- {\"row_ index\":5, \"column_name\":\"rating / share\"}\n- {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"viewers (millions)\"}\n\nThus, putting it all together, since 12.42 is not more than itself, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\":5,\n       \"column_name\":\"rating / share\"\n     },\n     {\n       \"row_index\":5,\n       \"column_name\":\"viewers (millions)\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",
