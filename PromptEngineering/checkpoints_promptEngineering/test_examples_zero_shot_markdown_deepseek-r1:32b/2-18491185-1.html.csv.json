    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says, \"the first episode air on 7 / 02 / 08\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like date and time. The claim mentions the first episode, so I should check the first row in the table since it's labeled as \"one\" under the episode column. \n\nIn the first row (row index 0), the date is listed as 7/02/08. That matches exactly with what the claim states about the air date. The network and time are also provided, but since the claim only mentions the date, I don't need to consider those unless there's a discrepancy that could affect the claim.\n\nI should make sure that \"7 / 02 / 08\" is correctly interpreted as July 2, 2008. The table doesn't specify the format beyond slashes, but it's common for such dates to follow month/day/year or day/month/year. However, since the first number is single-digit (7), and without more context, I'll assume it's month/day/year.\n\nThe claim specifies \"air on\" that date, so as long as the first episode's date in the table matches 7/02/08, the claim holds true. There doesn't seem to be any conflicting information in other rows that would invalidate this statement. \n\nTherefore, since the relevant cell (row index 0, column \"date\") confirms the air date, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
