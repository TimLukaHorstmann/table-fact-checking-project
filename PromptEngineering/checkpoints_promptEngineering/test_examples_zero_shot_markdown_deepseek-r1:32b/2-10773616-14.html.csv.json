    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the size of the crowd when essendon be the away team be 28158\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. The claim states that when Essendon was the away team, the crowd size was 28,158. So I need to find the row where Essendon is listed as the away team and check if the crowd number matches 28,158.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe columns are: home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, date.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0:\nAway team is St Kilda. Not Essendon. So irrelevant.\n\nRow 1:\nAway team is Richmond. Still not Essendon.\n\nRow 2:\nAway team is Hawthorn. No match.\n\nRow 3:\nAway team is Footscray. Nope.\n\nRow 4:\nAway team is Fitzroy. Not this either.\n\nRow 5:\nAway team is Essendon! Yes, here we go. So for this row, the away team is Essendon. Now I need to check the crowd number in this row.\n\nLooking at the crowd column for row 5: it's 28158. That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE because when Essendon was the away team (row 5), the crowd size was indeed 28,158.\n\nI should also note which cells were relevant. The relevant cells are in row 5: \"away team\" to confirm it's Essendon and \"crowd\" to check the number.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"the size of the crowd when Essendon be the away team be 25158.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asking. It's about finding a game where Essendon was the away team and checking if the crowd size for that game was 25,158.\n\nLooking at the table provided, there are six rows of data. Each row represents a game with details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. The claim specifically mentions Essendon as the away team, so I'll scan each row to find where the away team is Essendon.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. First row: Away team is St Kilda.\n2. Second row: Away team is Richmond.\n3. Third row: Away team is Hawthorn.\n4. Fourth row: Away team is Footscray.\n5. Fifth row: Away team is Fitzroy.\n6. Sixth row: Away team is Essendon.\n\nSo, the sixth row is the one where Essendon was the away team. Now, I need to check what the crowd size was for that game.\n\nIn the sixth row, under the \"crowd\" column, the number listed is 28158. The claim states the crowd size should be 25158. Hmm, these numbers are different: 28,158 vs. 25,158. That's a difference of 3,000.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread something? Let me double-check. The row in question is:\n\n| geelong          | 16.14  (110)        | essendon     | 11.10  (76)           | kardinia park      |   28158  | 31 july 1954 |\n\nYes, the crowd is definitely listed as 28,158 for that game. So the claim's number doesn't match what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because when Essendon was the away team, the crowd size was actually 28,158, not 25,158.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the crowd size when Essendon was the away team was 25,158. Checking the table, Essendon was the away team in the sixth row where the crowd was 28,158.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: \"the away team 's score at the game when hawthorn be the home team be 9.11 (65)\". So the key points are:\n\n- Home team is Hawthorn.\n- The away team's score in that game should be 9.11 (65).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with specific details.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to find where Hawthorn is the home team.\n\nRow 0: Collingwood vs St Kilda. Home team isn't Hawthorn.\nRow 1: Carlton vs Richmond. Home team isn't Hawthorn.\nRow 2: Melbourne vs Hawthorn. Wait, here the home team is Melbourne and away is Hawthorn. That's not what we're looking for because the claim says Hawthorn is the home team.\nWait, no\u2014that row has Melbourne as home and Hawthorn as away. So that doesn't fit.\n\nContinuing:\nRow 3: South Melbourne vs Footscray. Home isn't Hawthorn.\nRow 4: North Melbourne vs Fitzroy. No.\nRow 5: Geelong vs Essendon. No.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed it. Let me check again. Maybe the third row?\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 2: home team is Melbourne; away is Hawthorn. So that's the opposite of what we're looking for\u2014Hawthorn as home.\n\nIs there any other row where Hawthorn is the home team? It doesn't look like it in this table. All rows list different home teams, and none have Hawthorn as the home team except perhaps if I missed a row.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check each row's home team:\n\nRow 0: Collingwood\nRow 1: Carlton\nRow 2: Melbourne\nRow 3: South Melbourne\nRow 4: North Melbourne\nRow 5: Geelong\n\nNo Hawthorn as home team in any of these rows. Therefore, the claim refers to a game not present in this table.\n\nSince there's no row where Hawthorn is the home team, the away team's score can't be found here. The claim doesn't hold because the necessary data isn't in the table.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
