    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if the claim \"the philadelphia flyer record be 40 - 11 - 10 as of february 23rd\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim is referring to. The claim mentions two things: the Philadelphia Flyers' record and the date February 23rd. So I'm looking for a row in the table where the opponent is the Philadelphia Flyers and the date is February 23rd, then checking if their record matches 40-11-10.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like the game number, date in February, opponent, score, and the team's record after that game. The columns are \"game\", \"february\", \"opponent\", \"score\", and \"record\".\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find any mention of the Philadelphia Flyers as the opponent. Scanning down, I see that in row 61 (row index 60 since indexing starts at 0), the opponent is listed as \"philadelphia flyers\". That seems like a match.\n\nNext, I need to check if this game was on February 23rd. The \"february\" column for this row shows the number 23, which likely corresponds to February 23rd. So that matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow, looking at the record after this game. The \"record\" column for this row is \"40 - 11 - 10\". This exactly matches the record stated in the claim.\n\nTo make sure there are no other relevant rows, I'll quickly scan through the rest of the table to ensure that Philadelphia Flyers aren't listed as an opponent on any other date, especially around February 23rd. The only mention is in row 61, so that's the only relevant entry.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is supported: the Philadelphia Flyers had a record of 40-11-10 as of February 23rd.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the table shows that after their game against the Philadelphia Flyers on February 23rd (row index 60), the team's record was 40 - 11 - 10.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 60, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
