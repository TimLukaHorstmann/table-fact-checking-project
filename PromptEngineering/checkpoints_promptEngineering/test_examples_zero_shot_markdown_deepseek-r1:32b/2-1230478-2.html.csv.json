It has columns: year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, album. So, the relevant column here is \"us dance\" since the claim is about hitting number 1 in that category.\n\nNext, I need to find the rows where the single is either \"i don't know\" or \"i like you.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- Row 2: Single is \"i don't know,\" us dance rank is 1.\n- Row 3: Single is \"i like you,\" us dance rank is also 1.\n\nSo both singles have a us dance rank of 1.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. Each row represents a different entry with these details.\n\nThe claim is about Phyllis Nelson making it to the US Hot 100 twice. So, I need to check how many times her singles appear in the 'us hot 100' column and if that number is two.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 0: Year 1981, single \"don't stop the train\", us hot 100 is '-'. This means it didn't chart on US Hot 100.\n- Rows 1 and 2: Both are from 1985. The singles are \"move closer\" and \"i don' t know\". For row 1, 'us hot 100' is '-', so no. Row 2 has us hot 100 as 61, which means it did chart.\n- Row 3: Also from 1985, single \"i like you\", us hot 100 is 61 again. So that's another hit on the US Hot 100.\n- Row 4: Year 1994, single \"move closer (re-issue)\", but 'us hot 100' is '-', so no.\n\nSo, in total, there are two entries where the single reached the US Hot 100: row 2 and row 3. Both are singles from Phyllis Nelson, as indicated by the album names matching the singles. \n\nTherefore, the claim that she made it twice is TRUE. The relevant cells are the 'us hot 100' entries in rows 2 and 3.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nThe claim states: \"only 1 of f phyllis nelson's single, don't stop the train make it to the us dance chart, but not the us hot 100 or us r&b.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse this correctly. It seems to say that only one single by F. Phyllis Nelson made it to the US Dance chart, which is \"Don't Stop the Train,\" and that this same single did not make it to the US Hot 100 or US R&B charts.\n\nNow, looking at the table:\n\nThe table has columns: year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, album.\n\nI'll go through each row to see which singles are mentioned and their corresponding chart rankings.\n\nRow 0:\n- Year: 1981\n- Single: don't stop the train\n- US Hot 100: -\n- US Dance: 20\n- US R&B: -\n- Album: move closer\n\nSo, this single made it to the US Dance chart at position 20 but didn't make it to US Hot 100 or US R&B.\n\nRow 1:\n- Year: 1985\n- Single: move closer\n- US Hot 100: -\n- US Dance: -\n- US R&B: -\n- Album: move closer\n\nThis single didn't make any of the charts mentioned.\n\nRow 2:\n- Year: 1985\n- Single: i don't know\n- US Hot 100: 61\n- US Dance: 1\n- US R&B: 65\n- Album: i don't know\n\nThis single made it to all three charts, so it's not \"don't stop the train.\"\n\nRow 3:\n- Year: 1985\n- Single: i like you\n- US Hot 100: 61\n- US Dance: 1\n- US R&B: 65\n- Album: i like you\n\nSame as above, made it to all three charts.\n\nRow 4:\n- Year: 1994\n- Single: move closer (re-issue)\n- US Hot 100: -\n- US Dance: -\n- US R&B: -\n- Album: move closer\n\nNo chart entries here either.\n\nSo, looking at the table, \"don't stop the train\" is the only single that made it to the US Dance chart (position 20). It didn't make it to US Hot 100 or US R&B. The other singles did not reach any charts except for rows 2 and 3, which actually made all three.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems correct based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"move closer and move (re - issue) be the only single not to make it to the chart.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the singles mentioned in the claim:** The two singles are \"move closer\" and \"move (re-issue)\".\n\n2. **Check if these singles didn't make it to any chart:**\n   - For \"move closer\":\n     - In 1981, \"don't stop the train\" is listed as the single under \"single\". It doesn't make the US Hot 100 but appears on the US Dance chart at position 20.\n     - In 1985, \"move closer\" is the single. Here, all charts (US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B) have '-' which means they didn't chart in those categories. The album is also named \"move closer\".\n   - For \"move (re-issue)\" in 1994:\n     - The single is \"move closer (re-issue)\". Again, all charts show '-', so it didn't chart in any of these categories.\n\n3. **Determine if there are other singles that didn't make the charts:**\n   - In 1985, \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" both charted on US Hot 100 at position 61, Dance at 1, and R&B at 65. So these did make it to some charts.\n   - The only other single is \"don't stop the train\" from 1981, which didn't chart in US Hot 100 but did chart on US Dance at position 20.\n\n4. **Check if there are any other singles that didn't make any charts:**\n   - \"move closer\" (1985) and \"move closer (re-issue)\" (1994) both didn't chart in any of the listed categories.\n   - But wait, \"don't stop the train\" from 1981 did chart on US Dance. So it's not one of the singles that didn't make any charts.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The claim says only \"move closer\" and its re-issue are the singles that didn't make any charts. However, looking at all the data, those two don't have any chart positions, but other singles did chart except for these two. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because there's no other single in the table that also failed to chart.\n\nWait, let me double-check: Are there any other singles besides \"move closer\" and its re-issue that didn't make it? The 1985 entries for \"i don't know\" and \"i like you\" both have numbers in the charts. The 1981 single did chart on Dance. So yes, only those two mentioned in the claim didn't make any of the listed charts.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"single\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us hot 100\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine if the claim about Phyllis Nelson's chart placements is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"Out of the 7 chart placements achieved by Phyllis Nelson, 6 are in 1985.\" My goal is to verify this against the data given in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for year, single, US Hot 100, US Dance, US R&B, and album. There are five rows of data.\n\nI need to count how many chart placements there are each year. A \"chart placement\" would be when a song appears in any of the three charts: US Hot 100, US Dance, or US R&B. Even if a single is listed multiple times with different chart entries, I think each entry counts as a separate placement.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (1981):**\n   - Single: \"don't stop the train\"\n   - US Hot 100: -\n   - US Dance: 20\n   - US R&B: -\n   So, only one chart placement here in US Dance at position 20.\n\n2. **Row 1 (1985):**\n   - Single: \"move closer\"\n   - All charts: -, -, -\n   No placements here.\n\n3. **Row 2 (1985):**\n   - Single: \"i don't know\"\n   - US Hot 100: 61\n   - US Dance: 1\n   - US R&B: 65\n   This single has three chart placements across all charts.\n\n4. **Row 3 (1985):**\n   - Single: \"i like you\"\n   - US Hot 100: 61\n   - US Dance: 1\n   - US R&B: 65\n   Another single with three chart placements.\n\n5. **Row 4 (1994):**\n   - Single: \"move closer (re-issue)\"\n   - All charts: -, -, -\n   No placements here.\n\nNow, let's tally the total chart placements:\n\n- 1981: 1 placement\n- 1985: 3 (from row 2) + 3 (from row 3) = 6 placements\n- 1994: 0\n\nTotal across all years: 7 placements, as mentioned in the claim.

Looking at the rows:\n- 1981: No entry in US Hot 100.\n- 1985: Two singles (\"I Don't Know\" and \"I Like You\") both have 61 in US Hot 100, which suggests they charted but I don't see a connection to Phyllis Nelson.\n- 1994: No entry again.\n\nSince there's no mention of Phyllis Nelson in the table, especially not under the \"US Hot 100\" column, and given that she isn't linked to any singles listed, it seems impossible for her to have made the US Hot 100 list four times based on this data.

I need to determine whether the claim \"move closer, along with i like you be rank number 1 for us dance\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table carefully to understand what data we're dealing with. The table has six columns: year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. There are five rows of data spanning from 1981 to 1994.\n\nThe claim mentions two singles: \"move closer\" and \"i like you.\" It states that both were ranked number 1 in the US Dance chart. So, I need to check each of these singles in the table to see their rankings under the \"us dance\" column.\n\nStarting with \"move closer\": Looking at the rows, there are two entries for this single. The first is from 1981 where it's listed as a single and part of the album \"move closer.\" The \"us dance\" ranking here is 20. Then, in 1994, there's another entry for \"move closer (re-issue),\" but the \"us dance\" column shows \"-\", which I assume means it didn't chart or isn't listed.\n\nNext, checking \"i like you\": There's a row from 1985 where this single is listed. The \"us dance\" ranking here is 1. So, that part of the claim holds true for \"i like you.\"\n\nNow, putting it together: The claim says both singles were rank number 1 in US Dance. However, \"move closer\" has a ranking of 20 in 1981 and \"-\" in 1994, so it never reached number 1. On the other hand, \"i like you\" did reach number 1. Since one part of the claim is false (\"move closer\" didn't rank 1), the entire statement isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.

The claim says: \"Phyllis Nelson was unable to hit the US Hot 100 and US Dance chart for both 'I Like You' as well as 'Don't Stop the Train'.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about two songs by Phyllis Nelson: \"I Like You\" and \"Don't Stop the Train.\" The claim is asserting that neither of these songs made it onto both the US Hot 100 chart nor the US Dance chart.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there are columns for \"year,\" \"single,\" \"us hot 100,\" \"us dance,\" \"us r&b,\" and \"album.\" Each row represents a song release in a particular year. The relevant singles here are \"I Like You\" and \"Don't Stop the Train.\"\n\nStarting with \"I Like You\": I check the table for this single. It's listed in 1985. Looking at the columns under US Hot 100 and US Dance, both have numbers: 61 and 1 respectively. This means that \"I Like You\" did chart on both the US Hot 100 (position 61) and the US Dance chart (position 1). So this part of the claim is incorrect because the song did make it onto both charts.\n\nNext, checking \"Don't Stop the Train\": It's listed in 1981. Under US Hot 100, there's a dash \"-\", which I assume means it didn't chart there. The US Dance column has a 20, indicating it reached number 20 on that chart. So while it didn't hit the US Hot 100, it did chart on the US Dance chart.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because \"I Like You\" did make both charts and \"Don't Stop the Train\" made the US Dance chart. The relevant cells are the ones under \"us hot 100\" and \"us dance\" for both singles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that neither song hit both charts, but \"I Like You\" did.

It seems like it's saying that in the year 1985, Phyllis Nelson had two songs that charted. So I need to check if there are two entries for her songs in the table from 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll focus on the rows where the year is 1985. There are three such rows:\n\n1. The first row in 1985 has \"move closer\" as the single.\n2. The second row lists \"i don't know\".\n3. The third row mentions \"i like you\".\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these singles belong to Phyllis Nelson. However, looking at the table, there's no column that specifies the artist. All the entries under the \"single\" column are just song titles: \"move closer,\" \"i don't know,\" and \"i like you.\" There's no mention of Phyllis Nelson anywhere in the table.\n\nSince the table doesn't provide any information about the artists, I can't confirm if these songs were by Phyllis Nelson or someone else. Therefore, based solely on this table, there's no way to verify that Phyllis Nelson charted twice in 1985 because her name isn't listed. \n\nTherefore, the claim cannot be fully supported by the data provided. It might be TRUE if other sources confirm she was the artist behind those singles, but with just this table, I have to go with what's here.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim is FALSE because there's no information linking Phyllis Nelson to these songs in 1985.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"don' don't stop the train, record in 1985 never hit the us dance list.\" Wait, actually, looking back, it says \"don' don't stop the train,\" which seems like a typo. I think it's supposed to be \"Don't Stop the Train\" by Paul McCartney or someone else? But in any case, focusing on what's given.\n\nThe table has several columns: year, single, us hot 100, us dance, us r&b, and album. The claim is about a record from 1985 not hitting the US Dance list. So I need to check if \"Don't Stop the Train\" was released in 1985 and whether it charted on the US Dance list.\n\nLooking at the table, let's go row by row. \n\nRow 0: Year is 1981. Single is \"don' don't stop the train.\" The us dance column has a value of 20. So this record was in 1981 and did chart on US Dance at position 20.\n\nNow, looking for records from 1985. There are three rows with year 1985:\n\nRow 1: Single is \"move closer,\" us dance is \"-\", meaning it didn't chart there.\n\nRow 2: Single is \"i don' know,\" us dance is 1. So this one did chart on US Dance at position 1.\n\nRow 3: Single is \"i like you,\" us dance is also 1, so same as above.\n\nThere's another row for 1994, but that's after 1985 and not relevant here.\n\nSo the claim mentions a record from 1985. The only single in 1985 with \"don't stop the train\" is in row 0, which was in 1981, so it doesn't apply to 1985. \n\nWait, but does the table have any other entries for \"don't stop the train\"? It seems not. The only entry is in 1981.\n\nSo if the claim says that a record from 1985 never hit US Dance, we need to see which records were released in 1985 and whether they appeared on US Dance. For row 1 (move closer), us dance is \"-\", so it didn't chart. But for rows 2 and 3, their singles did chart on US Dance.\n\nBut the claim specifically refers to \"don't stop the train.\" Since that single was released in 1981, not 1985, perhaps the claim is incorrectly associating it with 1985. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the claim, but according to the table, \"don't stop the train\" wasn't a 1985 release; it was 1981.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the years again. The first row is 1981 with \"don't stop the train,\" and the other entries for 1985 don't include that single. So if someone claims that in 1985, \"don't stop the train\" didn't hit US Dance, that's correct because it wasn't released then. But the claim says \"record in 1985 never hit us dance list.\" Wait, but does the claim refer to another record? Or is it mistakenly referring to \"don't stop the train\" as a 1985 release?\n\nWait, let me parse the claim again: \"Don't Stop the Train, record in 1985 never hit the US Dance list.\" So it's saying that the record from 1985 called \"Don't Stop the Train\" didn't chart on US Dance. But according to the table, \"Don't Stop the Train\" was released in 1981, not 1985. Therefore, if there were a release of \"Don't Stop the Train\" in 1985, we'd have to check, but looking at the table, I don't see any entry for that single in 1985.\n\nWait again, let's look at all entries:\n\n- Row 0: 1981, \"don' don't stop the train,\" US Dance is 20. So it did chart there.\n- Rows 1,2,3 are 1985, singles are move closer, i don't know, i like you. No mention of \"don't stop the train.\"\n- Row 4: 1994, re-issue of \"move closer,\" but not relevant to 1985.\n\nSo if someone claims that in 1985, \"Don't Stop the Train\" didn't chart on US Dance, they're correct because it wasn't released then. But wait, maybe the claim is trying to say that the record from 1985 (i.e., any single in 1985) never hit US Dance. Let me read it again: \"Don't Stop the Train, record in 1985 never hit the US Dance list.\" So perhaps the claim is about a specific record from 1985 called \"Don't Stop the Train\" not charting on US Dance.\n\nBut according to the table, \"Don't Stop the Train\" was released in 1981. There's no entry for that single in 1985. Therefore, if such a record existed in 1985, it wouldn't be listed here, but since it's not in the table, we can only rely on what's given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is mistakenly referring to \"Don't Stop the Train\" as being released in 1985, which it wasn't. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that there was no such record from 1985 called \"Don't Stop the Train,\" but since it's not present, perhaps the claim is about another record.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:\n\nThe claim states: The record titled \"Don't Stop the Train\" released in 1985 never charted on US Dance.\n\nFrom the table, \"Don't Stop the Train\" was released in 1981 and did chart on US Dance (position 20). There's no entry for that single in 1985. So if someone is talking about a 1985 release of that song, the claim would be TRUE because there's no such record in the table\u2014so it didn't hit US Dance.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the claim is that any record from 1985 (regardless of title) never hit US Dance. But looking at rows 2 and 3, which are 1985 releases, their us dance values are both 1, meaning they did chart on US Dance.\n\nWait, now I'm getting more confused because the claim seems to refer specifically to \"Don't Stop the Train\" in 1985. But according to the table, that single was released in 1981, so if someone is talking about a 1985 release of that song, it didn't exist (as per the data), hence didn't chart on US Dance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is incorrectly associating \"Don't Stop the Train\" with 1985. But regardless, based on the table, in 1985, the singles were different, and some of them did chart on US Dance.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break it down:\n\n- Is there a record titled \"Don't Stop the Train\" released in 1985? According to the table: No. Only one entry for that single, which is in 1981.\n- Therefore, if someone claims that the 1985 release of \"Don't Stop the Train\" didn't chart on US Dance, they are correct because such a record doesn't exist (in our data). So the claim would be TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is mistakenly saying it was released in 1985 when it was actually in 1981. But from the table's perspective, since there's no 1985 entry for that single, we can say that if such a record existed (which it doesn't), it didn't chart on US Dance.\n\nBut to clarify: The claim is about \"Don't Stop the Train\" as a 1985 release not hitting US Dance. Since in our data, that single wasn't released then, so effectively, it's TRUE that it didn't hit the list because it wasn't even released in 1985.\n\nBut perhaps another way: The claim could be interpreted as \"In 1985, the record 'Don't Stop the Train' was released and did not chart on US Dance.\" From our data, there's no such release, so we can only say that based on the given information, it didn't chart because it wasn't even present. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently:\n\n- The task is to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the table.\n- The claim: \"Don't Stop the Train, record in 1985 never hit the US Dance list.\"\n- Looking at the table:\n   - There's an entry for \"don' don't stop the train\" in 1981 with US Dance = 20.\n   - No entries for that title in 1985.\n\nSo, based on the data:\n\n- If someone is talking about a 1985 release of \"Don't Stop the Train,\" our table doesn't have such an entry. Therefore, we can infer that such a record didn't exist or at least isn't listed here.\n- Since it's not present, we can assume it didn't chart on US Dance.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because there was no 1985 release of \"Don't Stop the Train\" in our data to have hit the US Dance list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is about another record from 1985, but that's not how it's worded. The claim specifically mentions \"Don't Stop the Train.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim refers to a 1985 release of \"Don't Stop the Train\" not charting on US Dance. Since our table shows that single was released in 1981 and did chart, but there's no such entry for 1985. Therefore, if someone claims that the 1985 version didn't chart, it's TRUE based on our data (because it wasn't even released then).\n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes \"record in 1985\" could mean any record from 1985, but given how it's phrased, it seems to refer specifically to that single.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the claim is mistakenly referring to the 1981 release as 1985. But regardless, according to our data, in 1985, other singles did chart on US Dance (rows 2 and 3 have US Dance = 1). So if someone says that \"records from 1985 didn't hit US Dance,\" they'd be wrong because some did.\n\nBut the claim is about a specific single: \"Don't Stop the Train\" in 1985. Since our data shows it was released in 1981, and there's no such entry for 1985, we can say that in 1985, this particular record didn't exist, so it didn't hit the list.\n\nTherefore, based on the given table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Don't Stop the Train,\" a record released in 1985, never charted on the US Dance list. According to the provided data:\n\n- The single \"don' don't stop the train\" was released in 1981 and did chart on the US Dance list at position 20.\n- There is no entry for this song in 1985.\n\nBased on this information, since there is no record of \"Don't Stop the Train\" being released in 1985, it cannot have charted that year. Therefore, the claim is:\n\n**True**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",
