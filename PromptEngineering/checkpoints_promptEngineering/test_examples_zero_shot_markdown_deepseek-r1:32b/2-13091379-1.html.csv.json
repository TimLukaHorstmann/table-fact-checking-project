    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"the engine alfa romeo 3.0 v8 ford cosworth dfv have f tyre\".\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that a specific combination of engines (Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 and Ford Cosworth DFV) uses 'f' tyres. So, I need to check if there are any rows in the table where both these engines are used together with 'f' tyres.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a year with various details including chassis, engine(s), tyres, and points. The relevant columns here are \"engine (s)\" and \"tyres\".\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **1970**: Engine is Ford Cosworth DFV, Tyres 'f'. But the claim mentions both Alfa Romeo and Ford engines, so this row only has one of them.\n\n2. **1971**: Engines are Alfa Romeo 3.0 V8 and Ford Cosworth DFV. Here, both engines mentioned in the claim are present. Now, checking the tyres: they're 'f'. So this seems to match the claim exactly.\n\n3. **Other years (1972-1992)**: Most of these rows either have only Ford Cosworth engines or other types like Judd V8 or Ilmor V10. The tyres in 1972 onwards are mostly 'g', except for some later years with different codes.\n\nSo, the key row is 1971 where both engines from the claim are used and the tyre type is 'f'. Therefore, the claim is TRUE because it's supported by that specific entry.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the 1971 row shows both engines with 'f' tyres.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"engine (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tyres\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the march 741 chassis have f tyre and 6 point\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look for the row where the chassis is March 741. Scanning through the table, I see that in 1974, the chassis listed is \"march 741\". So that's row index 5 (since counting starts at 0). \n\nNow, checking the claim: it mentions two things\u2014tyre type and points. The claim says the tyres are 'f' and the points are 6.\n\nLooking at the tyres column for that row, I see \"g\" listed. So that's not matching because the claim says 'f'. \n\nWait, maybe I should check if there are other rows with March 741? Let me double-check. No, only in 1974 is March 741 mentioned as a single chassis.\n\nSo for the tyres, it's 'g' instead of 'f', which means that part of the claim isn't correct.\n\nNext, checking the points column for row 5: yes, it says 6. So the point part matches.\n\nBut since one part (tyres) doesn't match, the entire claim is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are the tyres and points columns from row 5.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the March 741 chassis has 'f' tyres and 6 points. Checking the table:\n\n- **Row Index 5** (year 1974):\n  - Chassis: march 741\n  - Tyres: g\n  - Points: 6\n\nThe tyres are listed as 'g', not 'f', so the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"tyres\"},\n     {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\":\"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
