The claim says: \"jerzy janowicz be the only opponent \u00e9douard roger- vasselin be runner up to.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse the claim correctly. It seems like it's saying that Jerzy Janowicz was the only opponent that \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin lost to when he was a runner-up. So, we're looking for rows where the outcome is \"runner-up\" and check if the opponent is Jerzy Janowicz.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five entries. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Outcome is winner, so not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Outcome is winner, irrelevant.\n3. Row 2: Outcome is runner-up. The opponent here is Jerzy Janowicz. So this matches the claim.\n4. Rows 3 and 4: Both have outcome as winner, so no.\n\nNow, checking if there's only one instance where \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin was a runner-up against Jerzy Janowicz. From the table, only row 2 fits that description. There are no other rows where the outcome is runner-up and the opponent is Janowicz. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Janowicz is indeed the only opponent in the runner-up entries.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"Of the 2 game plays in 2010 \u00e9douard roger- vasselin only won the game play on 14 march 2010.\"\n\nWait, I notice that the name \"\u00e9douard roger-vasselin\" isn't mentioned anywhere in the table. All the opponents are Roko Karanu\u0161i\u0107, Karol Beck, Jerzy Janowicz, Matthias Bachinger, and Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment. So it seems like \u00e9douard isn't an opponent but possibly a player whose outcomes we need to check.\n\nLooking at the 'outcome' column, I see that in 2010, there are two entries: one on March 14 where the outcome is \"winner\" and another on September 12 where the outcome is \"runner-up\". The claim states that of these two games in 2010, \u00e9douard only won on March 14. \n\nBut since \u00e9douard isn't listed as an opponent, I have to assume he's the player whose results we're evaluating. So checking the outcomes: on March 14, 2010, the outcome was a win, and on September 12, it was a runner-up finish. \n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because in 2010, \u00e9douard won only once, on March 14.\n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems to list various outcomes of matches that Vasselin has played in. Each row corresponds to a different match with details like date, tournament location, surface type, opponent, and score.\n\nThe claim is about whether Vasselin has ever been a runner-up. In sports terminology, \"runner-up\" means the player who came in second place, so I need to check if any of the rows indicate that outcome for Vasselin.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. The first row shows Vasselin as the winner.\n2. The second row also lists him as a winner.\n3. The third row has \"runner - up\" in the outcome column. Wait, is this about Vasselin? Hmm, I need to make sure that the runner-up refers to Vasselin and not his opponent.\n\nWait, actually, each row represents a match where Vasselin was either the winner or the runner-up. So if any of these rows have \"runner - up\" as the outcome for him, then the claim is false.\n\nLooking at the third row:\n- Outcome: runner - up\n- Date: 12 September 2010\n- Tournament: Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence, France\n\nSo in this case, Vasselin was the runner-up. Therefore, the claim that he has never been a runner-up is false.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check all rows:\n4. Winner again.\n5. Winner once more.\n\nOnly the third row shows him as the runner-up. So the relevant cell is row index 2 in the \"outcome\" column.

The claim states: \"Vasselin have his best score ever on September 11, 2011 and his worst on June 27, 2005.\"\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any mention of Vasselin in the table. Looking through the 'opponent' column, I see names like Roko Karanu\u0161i\u0107, Karol Beck, Jerzy Janowicz, Matthias Bachinger, and Arnaud Cl\u00e9ment. There\u2019s no entry with \"Vasselin\" as an opponent. So, that's a red flag because if Vasselin isn't in the table, how can we assess his scores?\n\nNext, let's consider what the claim is about: best and worst scores on specific dates. The table includes columns for 'outcome', 'date', 'tournament', 'surface', 'opponent', and 'score'. To evaluate the claim, I need to look at the scores corresponding to those two dates.\n\nLooking at September 11, 2011: There's a row with that date where the outcome is \"winner.\" The score is listed as \"6-4, 6-3.\" That seems like a solid win. For June 27, 2005: Another row shows a win with scores \"6-4, 6-4.\" Both dates resulted in wins with relatively similar scores.\n\nWait, but since Vasselin isn't listed as an opponent or player here, maybe the claim is referring to someone else? Or perhaps it's a typo. The table doesn\u2019t have any data about Vasselin's performance, so we can't compare his best and worst scores based on this information alone.\n\nTherefore, without any mention of Vasselin in the relevant columns, the claim can't be supported by the provided table. It\u2019s likely FALSE because there's no evidence to back it up.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a player named \"Vasselin\" having his best and worst scores on specific dates.

The table has several columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. Each row represents a match that Vasselin participated in.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that Vasselin never plays on a hard surface. To verify this, I need to check each row in the table to see if there are any instances where the surface was hard and whether Vasselin played in those matches.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. The first row has an outcome of \"winner\" with a surface type \"clay.\" Since it's clay, not hard, this doesn't contradict the claim.\n2. The second row is also a win, but the surface here is \"hard (i).\" Wait, that does indicate a hard surface. So Vasselin did play on a hard surface in this case.\n3. The third row shows Vasselin as \"runner-up\" with the surface being \"hard.\" Again, another instance of playing on a hard court.\n4. The fourth and fifth rows are both wins on \"hard\" surfaces.\n\nSo from the table, there are multiple instances where Vasselin played on a hard surface.
