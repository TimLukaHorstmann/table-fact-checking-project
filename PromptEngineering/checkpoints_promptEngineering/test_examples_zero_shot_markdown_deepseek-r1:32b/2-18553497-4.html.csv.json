    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim again: \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in more than 1 event.\" So, the claim states that these two players are the only ones who scored in more than one event. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player or category, and there are columns for different events: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup,CAF Champions League, and Total goals.\n\nTo verify if a player has scored in more than one event, I need to check their scores across the three competition columns (Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, CAF Champions League). If a player has non-zero goals in two or all of these categories, then they have scored in multiple events.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Sherif Ashraf**: 6 in Premier League, 0 elsewhere.\n2. **Mahmoud Fathallah**: 5 in Premier League, 0 elsewhere.\n3. **Junior Agogo**: 3 in Premier League, 0 in Egypt Cup, and 1 in CAF Champions League. So he has goals in two events (Premier League and CAF).\n4. **Abdel Halim Ali**: 3 in Premier League, others zero.\n5. **Hani Said**: Same as above.\n6. **Shikabala**: Also same pattern.\n7. **Gamal Hamza**: 1 in Premier League, 0 in Egypt Cup, and 2 in CAF Champions League. So he has goals in two events as well.\n8. **Ahmed Magdy**: 2 in Premier League, others zero.\n9. **Mostafa Gaafar**: Same as Ahmed Magdy.\n10. **Alaa Kamal**: 1 in Premier League, others zero.\n11. **Mahmoud Samir**: 1 in Premier League, others zero.\n12. **Ricardo Alves Fernandes**: 1 in Premier League, others zero.\n13. **Sabry Raheel**: 1 in Premier League, others zero.\n14. **Wisam El Abdy**: Same as above.\n15. **Amr El-Safty**: 0 in all competitions except CAF Champions League with 1. But since Egypt Cup is also zero, he only has goals in one event.\n16. **Own Goals**: 1 in Premier League, others zero.\n\nSo, from the table, Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the two players who have scored in more than one event (both have entries in two competitions each). All other players either scored in just one or none of the events listed.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only these two meet the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only players to score in more than one event. Checking the table:\n\n- **Junior Agogo**: 3 (Egyptian Premier League) + 1 (CAF Champions League)\n- **Gamal Hamza**: 1 (Egyptian Premier League) + 2 (CAF Champions League)\n\nAll others have non-zero scores in only one category.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"hani said scored 3 goal total and sabry raheel score 1 goal total\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the structure of the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player's name along with their goals in three competitions: Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, andCAF Champions League. The last column shows the total goals scored by each player across all competitions.\n\nFirst, I'll locate \"hani said\" in the table. Scanning through the names, I see that hani said is listed on row 4 (row index starts at 0). Let me check his totals. Under 'total', he has 3 goals. So, according to the claim, hani said scored 3 goals total\u2014this part seems correct.\n\nNext, I'll look for \"sabry raheel\". Scanning down, I find him on row 12 (row index 12). Checking his totals column, it shows 1 goal. The claim states that sabry raheel scored 1 goal total, which also matches the table data.\n\nI should ensure there are no other players with similar names or entries that might be confused. In this case, both names seem unique in the table, so there's no ambiguity. \n\nTo confirm, I'll cross-verify each part of the claim against the relevant cells:\n\n- For \"hani said\": Egyptian Premier League is 3 goals, Egypt Cup 0, CAF Champions League 0, total 3.\n- For \"sabry raheel\": Egyptian Premier League 1 goal, others 0, total 1.\n\nEverything checks out. Both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and I'll list the relevant cells for each player to support this conclusion.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to determine whether the claim \"shikabala score 2 more goal total than sabry raheel\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The columns are: name, egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and total. Each row represents a player's statistics across these competitions.\n\nThe claim compares shikabala and sabry raheel in terms of their total goals. Specifically, it states that shikabala scored 2 more goals than sabry raheel.\n\nTo verify this, I should look for the rows corresponding to both players and check their total goals.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Shikabala's row: The 'total' column shows 3.\n- Sabry Raheel's row: The 'total' column also shows 1.\n\nSo, shikabala has scored 3 goals in total, while sabry raheel has 1. The difference between their totals is 2 goals (3 - 1 = 2). Therefore, the claim that shikabala scored 2 more goals than sabry raheel holds true.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For Shikabala: row index 5 (assuming rows are zero-indexed), column 'total'.\n- For Sabry Raheel: row index 13, column 'total'.\n\nThese are the two cells needed to evaluate the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup,CAF Champions League, and Total. Each row lists a player's goals in these competitions.\n\nI need to find Gamal Hamza's entry. Scanning down the \"name\" column, I see Gamal Hamza is on row 6 (indexing from 0). \n\nLooking at his CAF Champions League goals: it's 2. Now, I should check all other players' CAF Champions League goals to see if anyone has more than 2.\n\nGoing through each player:\n- Sherif Ashraf: 0\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: 0\n- Junior Agogo:1\n- Abdel Halim Ali:0\n- Hani Said:0\n- Shikabala:0\n- Gamal Hamza:2\n- Ahmed Magdy:0\n- Mostafa Gaafar:0\n- Alaa Kamal:0\n- Mahmoud Samir:0\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes:0\n- Sabry Raheel:0\n- Wisam El Abdy:0\n- Amr El-Safty:1\n- Own goals:0\n\nSo the highest in CAF is 2, achieved only by Gamal Hamza.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"amr el - safty be the only player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. The claim is asserting that Amr El-Safty is the sole individual in the list who did not score any goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: \"egyptian premier league,\" \"egypt cup,\" \"caf champions league,\" and \"total.\" Each row represents a player's performance across these competitions. \n\nI need to focus on the \"egyptian premier league\" column because that's where the claim is centered. Specifically, I'm looking for players who have zero goals in this category.\n\nStarting from the top of the table:\n\n1. Sherif Ashraf has 6 goals.\n2. Mahmoud Fathallah has 5 goals.\n3. Junior Agogo has 3 goals.\n4. Abdel Halim Ali has 3 goals.\n5. Hani Said has 3 goals.\n6. Shikabala has 3 goals.\n7. Gamal Hamza has 1 goal.\n8. Ahmed Magdy has 2 goals.\n9. Mostafa Gaafar has 2 goals.\n10. Alaa Kamal has 1 goal.\n11. Mahmoud Samir has 1 goal.\n12. Ricardo Alves Fernandes has 1 goal.\n13. Sabry Raheel has 1 goal.\n14. Wisam El Abdy has 1 goal.\n15. Amr El-Safty is listed next with 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nWait, but looking again at row 15: \"amr el - safty\" does have 0 in the egyptian premier league column. Now, I need to check if there are any other players who also have zero here. \n\nContinuing down the list:\n\n16. Own goals: 1 goal.\n17. Totals: 34 goals.\n\nSo, all other rows except for Amr El-Safty and possibly others? Let me go back up. The first few entries have varying numbers but all are above zero except for row 15 (Amr) and then looking at the rest:\n\nWait, actually, in the table as provided, row 14 is \"wisam el abdy\" with 1 goal, so that's one. Then row 15: \"amr el - safty\" has 0. The next rows are Own Goals with 1 and Totals.\n\nBut wait, looking again at the table structure, I might have miscounted. Let me list all players:\n\n- Sherif Ashraf: 6\n- Mahmoud Fathallah:5\n- Junior Agogo:3\n- Abdel Halim Ali:3\n- Hani Said:3\n- Shikabala:3\n- Gamal Hamza:1\n- Ahmed Magdy:2\n- Mostafa Gaafar:2\n- Alaa Kamal:1\n- Mahmoud Samir:1\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes:1\n- Sabry Raheel:1\n- Wisam El Abdy:1\n- Amr El-Safty:0\n- Own Goals:1\n\nSo, from this list, only Amr El-Safty has 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League. All others have at least 1 or more. Therefore, he is indeed the only player on the list with zero goals there.\n\nBut wait, looking back at row 7: Gamal Hamza has 1 goal. So yes, all except Amr El-Safty have scored in the Egyptian Premier League. \n\nThus, the claim that \"amr el - safty be the only player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league\" is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are where Amr El-Safty's Egyptian Premier League goals are zero and all other players' entries in that column are non-zero. So, I need to note the row index for Amr El-Safty (row 15) under \"egyptian premier league\" and also check each player above him to ensure they have non-zero values.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"gamal hamza and junior agogo be the only player to score in at least 1 event\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim is saying. It states that Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo are the only players who have scored in at least one of the events listed (Egyptian Premier League, Egypt Cup, CAF Champions League). So, I need to check each player's scores across these three competitions and see if any other player besides Gamal and Junior has a score of 1 or more in any of these columns.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several players with their respective scores in each event. The total column sums up all their goals across the three events. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Sherif Ashraf**: 6 (Egyptian Premier League), 0 (Cup), 0 (Champions League). Total is 6.\n   - He has scored in at least one event, specifically the Egyptian Premier League.\n\n2. **Mahmoud Fathallah**: 5, 0, 0. Total 5.\n   - Also scored only in the Premier League.\n\n3. **Junior Agogo**: 3, 0, 1. Total 4.\n   - Scored in both the Premier League and Champions League. So, he meets the condition.\n\n4. **Abdel Halim Ali**: 3, 0, 0. Total 3.\n   - Only in the Premier League.\n\n5. **Hani Said**: 3, 0, 0. Total 3.\n   - Same as above.\n\n6. **Shikabala**: 3, 0, 0. Total 3.\n   - Again, only Premier League.\n\n7. **Gamal Hamza**: 1, 0, 2. Total 3.\n   - Scored in both Premier League and Champions League.\n\n8. **Ahmed Magdy**: 2, 0, 0. Total 2.\n   - Only Premier League.\n\n9. **Mostafa Gaafar**: 2, 0, 0. Total 2.\n   - Same as Ahmed.\n\n10. **Alaa Kamal**: 1, 0, 0. Total 1.\n    - Premier League only.\n\n11. **Mahmoud Samir**: 1, 0, 0. Total 1.\n    - Premier League only.\n\n12. **Ricardo Alves Fernandes**: 1, 0, 0. Total 1.\n    - Premier League.\n\n13. **Sabry Raheel**: 1, 0, 0. Total 1.\n    - Premier League.\n\n14. **Wisam El Abdy**: 1, 0, 0. Total 1.\n    - Premier League.\n\n15. **Amr El-Safty**: 0, 0, 1. Total 1.\n    - Scored in Champions League only.\n\n16. **Own Goals**: 1, 0, 0. Total 1.\n    - Not a player, so we can ignore this row.\n\nLooking at all these rows, I notice that several players have scores in the Egyptian Premier League (Sherif Ashraf, Mahmoud Fathallah, Junior Agogo, Abdel Halim Ali, Hani Said, Shikabala, Ahmed Magdy, Mostafa Gaafar, Alaa Kamal, Mahmoud Samir, Ricardo Alves Fernandes, Sabry Raheel, Wisam El Abdy). Each of these has at least one goal in the Premier League. Additionally, Gamal Hamza and Amr El-Safty have goals in the Champions League.\n\nThe claim specifies that only Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo scored in \"at least 1 event.\" However, from the data, multiple players have scores across different events. For example, Sherif Ashraf has 6 goals in the Premier League, which clearly means he's scored in an event.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are many more players who have scored in at least one event beyond just Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. I'll focus on the rows of players other than Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo who have non-zero scores in any of the events. \n\nFor instance:\n- Sherif Ashraf: egyptian premier league (6)\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: egyptian premier league (5)\n- Abdel Halim Ali: egyptian premier league (3)\n- Hani Said: same as above\n- Shikabala: same\n- Ahmed Magdy: 2 in Premier League\n- Mostafa Gaafar: 2\n- Alaa Kamal:1 \n- Mahmoud Samir:1\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes:1\n- Sabry Raheel:1\n- Wisam El Abdy:1\n\nEach of these has at least one goal, so their respective cells in the egyptian premier league column are relevant. Also, Amr El-Safty scored 1 in Champions League.\n\nSo, the relevant cells include all rows except Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo where any of the event columns (egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league) have a value >=1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because multiple players beyond Gamal Hamza and Junior Agogo have scored in at least one event.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"amr el  safty be only 1 of 2 player on the list to not score in the egyptian premier league.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Amr El-Safty is one out of two players who did not score any goals in the Egyptian Premier League.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The relevant columns for this claim are \"name\" and \"egyptian premier league.\"\n\nI need to find all players with a score of 0 in the Egyptian Premier League column. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. Sherif Ashraf: 6 goals - scored, so not part of the count.\n2. Mahmoud Fathallah: 5 goals - scored.\n3. Junior Agogo: 3 goals - scored.\n4. Abdel Halim Ali: 3 goals - scored.\n5. Hani Said: 3 goals - scored.\n6. Shikabala: 3 goals - scored.\n7. Gamal Hamza: 1 goal - scored.\n8. Ahmed Magdy: 2 goals - scored.\n9. Mostafa Gaafar: 2 goals - scored.\n10. Alaa Kamal: 1 goal - scored.\n11. Mahmoud Samir: 1 goal - scored.\n12. Ricardo Alves Fernandes: 1 goal - scored.\n13. Sabry Raheel: 1 goal - scored.\n14. Wisam El Abdy: 1 goal - scored.\n15. Amr El-Safty: 0 goals - didn't score.\n16. Own Goals: 1 goal, but this isn't a player, so we can ignore it.\n\nWait, looking back at the table, row 14 is \"Amr el  safty\" with 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League. Now, checking for others who have 0:\n\nLooking through all rows, only Amr El-Safty has a score of 0 in the Egyptian Premier League column. The rest either have 1 or more. Therefore, there is only one player (Amr El-Safty) with 0 goals, not two as the claim suggests.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because only one player did not score, not two.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Amr El-Safty is the only player with 0 goals in the Egyptian Premier League. No other players have a score of 0 there.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Data:** Check each player's \"egyptian premier league\" score.\n2. **Count Players with 0 Goals:** Only Amr El-Safty has 0 goals in that category.\n3. **Evaluate Claim:** The claim states two players have 0, but only one does.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"egyptian premier league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "gamal hamza score the second highest goal in the caf champion league",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"gamal hamza score the second highest goal in the caf champion league\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided. It has five columns: name, egyptian premier league, egypt cup, caf champions league, and total. There are 17 rows of data, each representing a different player or category (like totals).\n\nThe claim is about Gamal Hamza's performance in the CAF Champions League. So I need to focus on two things: his goals in that specific competition and how they compare to others.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan down the \"name\" column until I find \"gamal hamza.\" Once located, I check the corresponding value in the \"caf champions league\" column for that row. According to the table, Gamal Hamza has 2 goals in the CAF Champions League.\n\nNext, I need to determine if this is indeed the second highest number of goals scored by any player in that competition. To do this, I'll go through each row and note down the values under \"caf champions league.\"\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Sherif Ashraf: 0\n- Mahmoud Fathallah: 0\n- Junior Agogo: 1\n- Abdel Halim Ali: 0\n- Hani Said: 0\n- Shikabala: 0\n- Gamal Hamza: 2\n- Ahmed Magdy: 0\n- Mostafa Gaafar: 0\n- Alaa Kamal: 0\n- Mahmoud Samir: 0\n- Ricardo Alves Fernandes: 0\n- Sabry Raheel: 0\n- Wisam El AbdY: 0\n- Amr El-Safty: 1\n- Own Goals: 0\n- Totals: 4 (but this is a total, not an individual player)\n\nFrom this, the highest goals in the CAF Champions League are 2, scored by Gamal Hamza. The next highest is 1, achieved by Junior Agogo and Amr El-Safty.\n\nTherefore, Gamal Hamza has the highest number of goals (2) in that competition, not the second highest. This means the claim is incorrect.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells for this determination:\n- For Gamal Hamza's CAF Champions League goals: row index 6 (since counting starts at 0), column name \"caf champions league.\"\n- To confirm he has the highest, I would look at all entries in \"caf champions league,\" but since the claim is about him being second, only his cell is necessary to show he actually leads.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cell is Gamal Hamza's CAF Champions League entry.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"caf champions league\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
