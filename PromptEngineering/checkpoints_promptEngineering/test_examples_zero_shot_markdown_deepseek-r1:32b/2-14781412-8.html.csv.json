    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a specific claim about an equestrian event in the Asian Games is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim: \"equestrian at the asian game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010 , except for in 1990.\" The key points here are:\n\n1. Equestrian events occurred every four years.\n2. This happened from 1982 to 2010, with the exception of 1990.\n\nNext, I'll examine the table provided. It lists equestrian results for various years and locations. The years listed are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.\n\nNow, I need to check if these events happened every four years as claimed. Let's list the intervals between each consecutive year:\n\n- From 1982 to 1986: That's a gap of 4 years. So far, it fits.\n- From 1986 to 1994: Wait, that's an 8-year gap. Hmm, that doesn't align with the claim of every four years.\n\nThe next intervals are:\n\n- 1994 to 1998: 4 years\n- 1998 to 2002: 4 years\n- 2002 to 2006: 4 years\n- 2006 to 2010: 4 years\n\nBut the problematic part is between 1986 and 1994. The claim says every four years except for 1990, but there's no event in 1990 either. However, the gap here is 8 years, which suggests that perhaps the events didn't occur in 1990 as intended.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check: The claim states \"except for in 1990,\" implying that while most events were every four years, there was an exception in 1990. But looking at the table, there's no event listed for 1990, but also, after 1986 (which is a multiple of 2), the next event is in 1994. That skips not just 1990 but also 1994 minus 1986 is 8 years, which is more than four.\n\nSo, according to the table, the events didn't occur every four years consistently because there's an 8-year gap between 1986 and 1994. Therefore, the claim that it happened every four years from 1982 to 2010 except for 1990 is not entirely accurate. The exception in 1990 doesn't align with the table because there's a larger gap than just skipping one year.\n\nHence, the relevant cells are those corresponding to each year listed, showing that events occurred only in specific years and not every four years as claimed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the user is asking for here. They provided a table in markdown format with information about gold, silver, and bronze medalists in equestrian events at various Asian Games from 1982 to 2010. The claim they want me to verify is: \"nadia al - moutawaa be the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the asian game.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table. So, looking through each row of the table, the relevant information would be under the \"gold\" column since we're checking for gold medalists.\n\nStarting from the earliest year, 1982 in New Delhi, the gold medalist listed is nadia al - moutawaa. That's the first entry in the table, so if this is indeed the first time someone won a gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games, then the claim should be TRUE.\n\nI should also ensure that there are no earlier entries before 1982 because the table starts from 1982. Since the first row corresponds to 1982 and nadia al - moutawaa is listed as the gold medalist, she would be the first person in this context.\n\nSo, confirming the claim, it's TRUE that she was the first gold medalist in equestrian at the Asian Games based on the provided data.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"equestrian at the asian game have be locate in a different city every year that it occur.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It seems like it's saying that each time equestrian events are held at the Asian Games, they take place in a different city each year. So, for each occurrence of the event, the location should change.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"location.\" Each row represents an instance of the event with its respective year and location. I'll need to check if any two entries have the same location in different years or the same city in consecutive years.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 1982 - New Delhi\n2. 1986 - Seoul\n3. 1994 - Hiroshima\n4. 1998 - Bangkok\n5. 2002 - Busan\n6. 2006 - Doha\n7. 2010 - Guangzhou\n\nNow, I'll compare the locations year by year:\n\n- 1982 vs. 1986: New Delhi vs. Seoul \u2013 different cities.\n- 1986 vs. 1994: Seoul vs. Hiroshima \u2013 different.\n- 1994 vs. 1998: Hiroshima vs. Bangkok \u2013 different.\n- 1998 vs. 2002: Bangkok vs. Busan \u2013 same country (South Korea), but two different cities.\n- 2002 vs. 2006: Busan vs. Doha \u2013 different countries and cities.\n- 2006 vs. 2010: Doha vs. Guangzhou \u2013 different.\n\nLooking through all these, I don't see any repetition of the same city in consecutive or non-consecutive years. Each year's event is held in a unique city without any repeats. Therefore, the claim holds true because each occurrence is in a different city every year.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are the \"year\" and \"location\" columns across all rows. So I'll list each row with these two column names to show where the data supporting the claim comes from.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have be different in every year they have occur.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems to list the results of some event across various years and locations. Each row has a year, location, and then three columns for gold, silver, and bronze medalists.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"equestrian\" specifically. However, looking at the table, I don't see any column that specifies the sport or category. All rows just list medalists without indicating if they're from equestrian events. This makes me think the table might be for a specific sport, possibly equestrian, but it's not explicitly stated.\n\nAssuming this is about equestrian events based on the claim, I'll proceed under that assumption since there's no other data to contradict it. Now, looking at each row's gold medalist:\n\n1982: nadia al - moutawaa\n1986: takashi tomura\n1994: konoshin kuwahara\n1998: jin kanno\n2002: mikaela mar\u00e3\u00ada jaworski\n2006: ali yousuf al - rumaihi\n2010: ramzy al duhami\n\nI need to check if all these gold medalists are different each year.

The claim says that \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul and doha (and incheon, but that be only find elsewhere on the source page)\". \n\nFirst, let me parse the table. I'll look through each row and note where the location is a city in South Korea.\n\nLooking at the locations column:\n- 1982: New Delhi (India)\n- 1986: Seoul (South Korea)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (Japan)\n- 1998: Bangkok (Thailand)\n- 2002: Busan (South Korea)\n- 2006: Doha (Qatar)\n- 2010: Guangzhou (China)\n\nSo South Korea hosted in Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). The claim mentions Seoul and doha, but doha is Qatar. So the table shows that South Korea has hosted twice: in Seoul and Busan.\n\nThe claim says \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time\" \u2014 looking at other countries:\n- India once (1982)\n- Japan once (1994)\n- Thailand once (1998)\n- Qatar once (2006)\n- China once (2010)\n\nSo South Korea is indeed the only country with more than one hosting. However, the claim incorrectly includes doha as a host for South Korea, which it's not. The table shows Doha as Qatar.\n\nWait, the user instruction says to check each condition in the claim against the table. So the main points are: South Korea being the only country to host more than once, and hosting in Seoul and Doha. But according to the table, Doha is in Qatar, not South Korea. So the part about Seoul and doha is incorrect.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread. The claim says \"south korea be... more than 1 time, in seoul and doha\". That would mean the country is South Korea, which hosted in Seoul and Doha? But in the table, Doha is a different country (Qatar). So that part of the claim is false because Doha isn't a South Korean city. Therefore, the overall claim is incorrect.\n\nWait no, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The claim says \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time, in seoul and doha\". So it's saying South Korea hosted in Seoul and Doha. But according to the table, Doha is a different location (Qatar). Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes Doha as a hosting city for South Korea.\n\nWait but maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure of the claim. Let me re-express: \"south korea be the only country... in seoul and doha\". So it's saying that South Korea hosted in both Seoul and Doha. But in reality, Doha is Qatar, so this part is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim has an error because Doha isn't a host by South Korea but by Qatar. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that South Korea hosted in 1986 (Seoul) and 2002 (Busan).

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"equestrian at the asian game happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It says that equestrian events in the Asian Games occur every four years between 1982 and 2010. So, I'm looking for entries in the table that show equestrian events happening at those intervals.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several years: 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. These are all the years when the Asian Games took place. The event mentioned here is equestrian because the table's context seems to be about medalists in that sport.\n\nNow, let me check the intervals between these years:\n\n- From 1982 to 1986: That's a gap of 4 years.\n- Then from 1986 to 1994: Wait, that's 8 years apart. Hmm, that doesn't fit every four years.\n  \nWait, maybe I should double-check the gaps:\n\n1982 to 1986 is 4 years (correct). \nThen 1986 to 1994 is indeed 8 years\u2014so that's a problem because it skips two expected events in 1990 and 1994? Or does the table have entries only for specific years?\n\nLooking at the table, I see entries for 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010. So between 1986 and 1994, there's a gap of 8 years because the next Asian Games after 1986 was in 1994? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how often the Asian Games are held.\n\nWait, actually, I remember that the Asian Games are held every four years as well. So according to the table, they should occur every four years. But from 1982 to 1986 is four years, then from 1986 to 1990 would be next, but in the table, there's no entry for 1990. The next year listed is 1994, which skips two years\u20141990 and 1994? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait no, from 1986 to 1994 is eight years. That would mean there are two Asian Games in between: 1990 and 1994. But the table skips 1990 and lists 1994 as the next one. So that breaks the every-four-year pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the event listed here isn't the entire set of Asian Games but only specific equestrian events or maybe incomplete data? Or maybe the claim is incorrect because it's missing some years.\n\nWait, looking at the table again: 1982 (New Delhi), 1986 (Seoul), then next in 1994 (Hiroshima). So between 1986 and 1994, there's an eight-year gap. That doesn't support the claim of every four years.\n\nTherefore, the intervals aren't consistent with happening every four years because there's a longer gap between 1986 and 1994. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo the relevant cells are all the years in the table to check the gaps.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that equestrian events at the Asian Games occur every four years from 1982 to 2010. Checking the intervals between the years listed (1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010), we find that not all gaps are four years apart. Specifically, there is an eight-year gap between 1986 and 1994.

Nadia Al-Moutawaa won a gold medal in equestrian.\n2. She also won a silver medal in another year.\n\nI need to check both these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists medalists from various years, including 1982 and subsequent years.

Therefore, she didn't win a silver medal in another year as per the table.\n\nSince both conditions are required (winning gold and then silver in another year), but the second condition isn't met, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"silver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"silver\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have be different in every year they have occur except 1994 and 1998.\" Hmm, first, let me understand what this means.\n\nThe claim is saying that each year, there was a different gold medalist in equestrian events at the Asian Games. However, it mentions an exception for 1994 and 1998, implying that these two years had the same gold medalist.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to check the 'gold' column across all rows to see if any names repeat except possibly in 1994 and 1998. Let's go through each year one by one:\n\n- **1982**: Nadia al-moutawaa\n- **1986**: Takashi Tomura\n- **1994**: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- **1998**: Jin Kanno\n- **2002**: Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski\n- **2006**: Ali Youssef al-rumaihi\n- **2010**: Ramzy al duhami\n\nNow, I'll check for duplicates. Scanning through each name:\n\n- Nadia al-moutawaa appears only once in 1982.\n- Takashi Tomura is unique to 1986.\n- Konoshin Kuwahara is only listed in 1994.\n- Jin Kanno is specific to 1998.\n- Mikaela Mar\u00e3\u00ada Jaworski appears once in 2002.\n- Ali Youssef al-rumaihi is unique to 2006.\n- Ramzy al duhami is listed only in 2010.\n\nI don't see any names that repeat except possibly the same name across different years. Wait, looking again: Konoshin Kuwahara is in 1994, and I don't see him in other years. Jin Kanno is only in 1998. So there's no repetition between these two or any others.\n\nSo according to this table, each gold medalist from 1982 through 2010 is unique; none of them won in multiple years except for checking if 1994 and 1998 have the same name. But looking at those two:\n\n- **1994**: Konoshin Kuwahara\n- **1998**: Jin Kanno\n\nThese are different names, so even these two years don't share a gold medalist.\n\nTherefore, the claim says they were all different except 1994 and 1998. But in reality, according to the table, every year had a unique gold medalist without any repeats. So the exception mentioned in the claim (that 1994 and 1998 had the same) isn't supported by the data.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nNo, Konoshin Kuwahara is only in 1994, and Jin Kanno is only in 1998. So there's no duplication between these years or any others. Therefore, all gold medalists are different every year without exception.\n\nSo the claim says that except for 1994 and 1998, but according to the table, even those two years had different winners. Hence, the claim is incorrect because it claims an exception where there isn't one\u2014so the statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because each gold medalist from 1982 through 2010 is unique; none of them won in multiple years except for checking if 1994 and 1998 have the same name. However, Konoshin Kuwahara (1994) and Jin Kanno (1998) are different names, so there's no duplication.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"gold\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "equestrian at the asian game have be locate in a different city every year that it occur except 1994 and 1998",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"Equestrian at the Asian Game have been located in a different city every year it occurs except 1994 and 1998.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that equestrian events in the Asian Games took place in different cities each year, except for two years: 1994 and 1998. So, I need to check if these two years share the same location as their previous or next years.\n\nLooking at the table, it shows data from 1982 to 2010 with various locations each year. Let's list out the years and their corresponding locations:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- 1998: Bangkok\n- 2002: Busan\n- 2006: Doha\n- 2010: Guangzhou\n\nWait, the table only starts at 1982. The claim mentions equestrian events except in 1994 and 1998. So I need to check if 1994 and 1998 have different locations than their adjacent years.\n\nLooking at 1994: It's located in Hiroshima. The previous event was in 1986 (Seoul), next is 1998 (Bangkok). So 1994 is a one-off, so it didn't repeat the location of its immediate neighbors.\n\nFor 1998: Located in Bangkok. Previous year's event was in Hiroshima (1994) and the next in Busan (2002). Again, different locations each time.\n\nWait, but does the claim say that except for 1994 and 1998, all other years have different cities? So I need to see if any of the other years besides 1994 and 1998 had repeated locations.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Each year from 1982 onwards has a unique city except for checking between the given years. Let's check each adjacent pair:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi\n- 1986: Seoul \u2192 different.\n- 1994: Hiroshima \u2192 different from Seoul and Bangkok.\n- 1998: Bangkok \u2192 different from Hiroshima and Busan.\n- 2002: Busan \u2192 different from Bangkok and Doha.\n- 2006: Doha \u2192 different from Busan and Guangzhou.\n- 2010: Guangzhou.\n\nSo, all the years except perhaps any that repeat locations are unique. Wait, is there any repetition in the table? It doesn't look like it. Each location appears only once. Therefore, equestrian events have been held in different cities each year except when they occurred in 1994 and 1998.\n\nWait, no. The claim says that they were located in a different city every year except for 1994 and 1998. But from the table, all locations are unique across years. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to consecutive years. Let me think again: \"except 1994 and 1998.\" Hmm, but in the table, there's a gap between years\u2014like 1982, then 1986, 1994, etc. So perhaps the claim is about all the years except 1994 and 1998 having different cities each time they occurred.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me list all locations:\n\n- New Delhi\n- Seoul\n- Hiroshima\n- Bangkok\n- Busan\n- Doha\n- Guangzhou\n\nEach is unique, so every occurrence was in a different city. So why does the claim say except 1994 and 1998? That suggests those two years might have been held in the same location as another year.\n\nBut from the table, Hiroshima (1994) isn't repeated elsewhere, and Bangkok (1998) is also unique. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the claim refers to consecutive years, but looking at the table, the events are spaced every 6-8 years apart. So maybe the original data is about equestrian events in the Asian Games which were held in different cities each time except for two instances where they were in the same city as another year.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any two entries have the same location regardless of year. From the table:\n\n- All locations are unique across years.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"equestrian at the Asian Game have been located in a different city every year it occurs except 1994 and 1998\" is not supported because according to the table, all cities are unique each time. So perhaps the claim is false because there's no repetition except for maybe two instances where they were same.\n\nWait, but looking again: The years in the table are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010. Each has a unique city. So if the claim says that except for 1994 and 1998, every occurrence was in a different city, but since all cities are different, including 1994 and 1998, perhaps the claim is incorrect because there's no repetition except maybe elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the original data isn't complete. But based on what's given, each year's location is unique. So the claim that they were held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998 would be false because all are unique.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait a second. The claim says \"except 1994 and 1998,\" implying that in those two years, it was not in a new city, but perhaps repeated from previous or next years. But looking at the table:\n\n- 1994: Hiroshima\n- Previous year's event (1986): Seoul \u2192 different.\n- Next year's event (1998): Bangkok \u2192 different.\n\nSimilarly for 1998: Bangkok, which isn't repeated elsewhere.\n\nSo if all cities are unique, the claim is false because it says except those two years, but in reality, all are unique. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait again. The claim might be saying that from the given data, 1994 and 1998 are exceptions to being held in different cities. But since each is unique, perhaps the claim is correct because except for those two years (which were unique), all others were also unique? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim refers to more occurrences outside the given data. For example, if equestrian events were held multiple times in the same city but not shown here. But based on the provided table, each location is unique.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the claim is incorrect because according to the given data, all locations are different, so there's no exception except for 1994 and 1998\u2014meaning those two years were exceptions where they weren't in a new city. But since in the data, both are unique, it contradicts.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase: The task is to determine if equestrian events have been held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998. From the table, all locations are unique across years, so the claim that it's only not different in those two years is false because actually, all were different.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that equestrian events at the Asian Games have been held in different cities every year except for 1994 and 1998. However, based on the provided data, each event listed occurs in a unique city without any repetitions. Therefore, the claim is incorrect as all instances are in distinct locations.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false because according to the given data, all cities where equestrian events were held are unique, including those for 1994 and 1998. Thus, there are no exceptions where the same city was used consecutively or otherwise within the provided years.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "claim": "south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul 2 time",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul 2 time\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this a bit. It seems like the claim is stating that South Korea is the sole country that has hosted equestrian events at the Asian Games more than once, specifically mentioning Seoul hosting twice.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"year\" and \"location\". Each row represents an event in a particular year with its location. \n\nLet me check each row for locations in South Korea:\n\n- 1982: New Delhi (India)\n- 1986: Seoul (South Korea)\n- 1994: Hiroshima (Japan)\n- 1998: Bangkok (Thailand)\n- 2002: Busan (South Korea)\n- 2006: Doha (Qatar)\n- 2010: Guangzhou (China)\n\nSo, South Korea hosted in Seoul (1986) and Busan (2002). That's two times. \n\nNow, checking other countries:\n\n- India: once\n- Japan: once\n- Thailand: once\n- Qatar: once\n- China: once\n\nNo other country has hosted more than once. So South Korea is the only one with two instances.\n\nThe claim mentions \"in Seoul 2 time,\" but looking at the table, Seoul was only in 1986. Busan was another hosting city for South Korea in 2002. So, it's two times overall for South Korea, not specifically twice in Seoul. \n\nSo, the part about being the only country to host more than once is correct. However, the specific mention of Seoul hosting twice isn't accurate because it only hosted once there.\n\nBut wait, maybe the claim is just saying that South Korea has hosted equestrian events at two Asian Games (in 1986 and 2002), regardless of the city within South Korea. The wording says \"host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time\" without specifying the same location. So, considering that, the claim's first part is correct\u2014South Korea hosted twice. But the second part claims that it was in Seoul two times, which isn't true.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The table shows South Korea hosting in 1986 and 2002, each time in different cities (Seoul and Busan). So overall, they hosted twice as a country, not necessarily both times in Seoul. \n\nSo the claim says \"in seoul 2 time,\" which would be incorrect because Seoul was only once. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe it's saying that South Korea has hosted equestrian events more than once, and one of those times was in Seoul twice? Or maybe the user made a typo and meant that as a country, they've hosted twice, with Seoul being one of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is trying to say that South Korea has hosted equestrian events at two Asian Games (which is correct) but mistakenly attributes both to Seoul. So while the first part about hosting more than once is true, the second part about it being in Seoul twice is false.\n\nTherefore, since the entire claim includes an incorrect statement, the overall answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
