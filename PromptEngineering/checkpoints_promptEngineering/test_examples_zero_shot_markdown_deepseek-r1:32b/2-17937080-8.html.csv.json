    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the player on rank 11 have less than 1.237 goal per match.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table and find the row where the rank is 11. Let me scan through the ranks column. I see rank numbers like 1, 2, 4, 5, etc., but when does it hit 11? Hmm, looking down the list... Oh, here we go. At the bottom of the table, row index 10 has a rank of 11. The player is Alfredo di St\u00e9fano from Real Madrid in the 1956/57 season.\n\nNow, I need to check his goals per match. In that same row, under the \"goals per match\" column, it says 1. So, his average is exactly 1 goal per match.\n\nThe claim is asking if this player has less than 1.237 goals per match. Since 1 is indeed less than 1.237, the statement holds true.\n\nI should also make sure there's only one player with rank 11. Scanning through the ranks again, I don't see another row with rank 11 besides Alfredo di St\u00e9fano. So, that's clear.\n\nTherefore, based on this information, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the player ranked 11 has a goals per match of exactly 1, which is less than 1.237.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"11.0 be the rank that have goal per match more than 1.237\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It seems a bit unclear at first glance because of the wording. The phrase \"11.0 be the rank...\" suggests that the rank 11.0 (which is actually just 11) should have players with goals per match more than 1.237.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by checking all rows where the rank is 11. Let's see:\n\nRow index 10 has rank 11. The \"goals per match\" for this row is 1.0, as seen in column \"goals per match\". \n\nNow, the claim says that rank 11 should have goals per match more than 1.237. But in the table, the value at rank 11 is exactly 1.0, which is less than 1.237.\n\nSo, since there are no players ranked 11 with goals per match exceeding 1.237, the claim is FALSE.\n\nThe relevant cell here is row index 10, column \"goals per match\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"goals per match\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in markdown format and a claim about Lionel Messi's performance during the 2011/12 season. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"lionel messi rank 2 and score 73 goal during the 2011 / 12 season.\" So, there are two main points here:\n\n1. Messi's rank was 2.\n2. He scored 73 goals in that season.\n\nI need to verify both of these against the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for rank, name, season, club, goals, apps (appearances), and goals per match. I'll focus on the rows where the name is \"lionel messi\" because that's who the claim is about.\n\nScanning through the table:\n\n- Row 0: Lionel Messi, rank 1, season 2011/12, 73 goals.\n- Row 5: Another entry for Messi in a different season (2010/11), but not relevant here.\n  \nWait, the claim says rank 2, but according to row 0, Messi's rank is 1 during the 2011/12 season. That seems conflicting.\n\nAlso, checking the goals: In row 0, he scored 73 goals in that season, which matches the claim. However, his rank is listed as 1, not 2. \n\nLooking at other rows to see if there's another entry for Messi in the same season with a different rank:\n\nRow 1 also mentions Lionel Messi but during the 2012/13 season, so that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, based on this, the claim says Messi was ranked 2 and scored 73 goals. The table shows he was actually rank 1 but did score 73 goals. Therefore, part of the claim is correct (goals) but the rank is incorrect.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misread something. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking again at row 0: Rank is indeed 1 for Messi in 2011/12. There's another entry for him in row 5 with season 2010/11 and rank 5. No other entries for the same season with a different rank.\n\nSo, the claim states rank 2, but according to the table, it's rank 1. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because one of its conditions (rank) isn't met.\n</think>\n\nThe claim partially matches the data: Messi scored 73 goals in 2011/12, but his rank was 1, not 2.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
