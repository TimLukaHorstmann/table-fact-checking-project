Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, and record. Each row represents a game with these details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"montreal\" as the visitor on \"march 6.\" So, I need to find the row where the date is March 6th and check if the visitor column has Montreal listed there.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. The first row is March 1st: visitor is Philadelphia.\n2. Second row, March 2nd: visitor is NY Rangers.\n3. Third row, March 4th: visitor is Philadelphia.\n4. Fourth row, March 6th: Here's the date we're interested in. Let me check the visitor column for this row.\n\nIn the fourth row (index starts at 0, so it's index 3), the visitor is listed as Montreal. So yes, on March 6th, Montreal was the visitor team.\n\nTo confirm, I'll note that the relevant cells are the date \"march 6\" and the visitor \"montreal.\" These correspond to row_index 3 for both columns since each cell in a row shares the same index.\n\nThus, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are row 3's 'date' and 'visitor' columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"before march 6 montreal be the visitor\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down what this claim means and how I can check it against the data.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that before March 6th, Montreal was the visitor. So, I need to look at all the dates before March 6th in the table and see if Montreal ever appeared as a visitor.\n\nLooking at the table, the dates are listed in order from March 1 to March 28. The row with date \"march 6\" is when Montreal was visiting Philadelphia. But I need to check if there's any date before March 6 where Montreal was the visitor.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- March 1: Visitor is Philadelphia.\n- March 2: Visitor is NY Rangers.\n- March 4: Visitor is Philadelphia.\n- March 6: Visitor is Montreal.\n\nWait, March 6 is the first occurrence of Montreal as a visitor. The dates before that (March 1, 2, 4) don't have Montreal as the visitor. So there's no date before March 6 where Montreal was the visitor.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Montreal wasn't visiting before March 6; they were only visitors on March 6 and not earlier.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Montreal visited on March 6th but does not have any entries of Montreal as a visitor before that date. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
