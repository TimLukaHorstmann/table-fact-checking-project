    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The claim says: \"when the 1st leg be 1 - 2 the club be paok fc in the 2011 - 12 uefa europa league.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. It's stating that when the first leg score is 1-2, the club involved should be PAOK FC and this happened during the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.\n\nNow, I need to check the table provided to see if such a scenario exists. Let me scan through each row to find entries related to PAOK FC and the 2011-12 season in the UEFA Europa League.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that there are multiple entries for the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League. Specifically, rows 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35 are all under this competition. \n\nChecking each of these:\n- Row 30: Club is PAOK FC, first leg score is 1 - 2. Wait, no\u2014the 1st leg here is 1 - 2? Let me check again. No, looking at the table, row 30 shows \"paok fc\" with a 1 - 2 in the '1st leg' column. So that matches.\n\nWait, actually, let me verify. The table lists multiple entries for PAOK FC in 2011-12 UEFA Europa League group stages. For example:\n- Row 30: paok fc, 1 - 2\n- Row 31: paok fc again, another match with 1 - 3\n\nBut the claim mentions \"the\" club, which might imply a singular instance. However, the table shows that PAOK FC had two matches where they were involved in group stages with specific scores.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me look again. The claim is about when the first leg was 1-2, does the club become PAOK FC? So I need to find a row where '1st leg' is 1 - 2 and see if the club is PAOK FC in that same row.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 30: Club is paok fc, 1st leg is 1 - 2. Yes, this matches exactly what the claim states. The competition is indeed the 2011-12 uefa europa league.\n\nSo according to this, the claim is correct because in row 30, when the first leg was 1-2, the club was PAOK FC during that specific season and competition.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"club\"}, {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"In the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League season, Juventus FC have a 1st leg of 0-1 while in the 2011-12 season, FC Flora Tallinn have a 1st leg of 1-0.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts. The first part is about the 2010-11 season involving Juventus FC with a scoreline of 0-1 in their first leg. The second part refers to the 2011-12 season where FC Flora Tallinn has a 1-0 result.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find the relevant rows for each season and club mentioned.\n\nStarting with the 2010-11 UEFA Europa League season: Scanning through the rows, I see two entries that mention this season. The first is row index 30: \"2010  - 11 uefa europa league | uefa europa league | third qualifying round | juventus fc | 0  - 1\". So Juventus FC's 1st leg score here is indeed 0-1, which matches the claim.\n\nNext, checking the 2011-12 season for FC Flora Tallinn: I look through the table and find row index 34: \"2011  - 12 | uefa champions league | second qualifying round | fc flora tallinn | 1  - 0\". This shows that in the 2011-12 season, FC Flora Tallinn had a 1st leg score of 1-0, which also aligns with what's claimed.\n\nI should ensure there are no conflicting entries. Looking further down the table, I see other rows for the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League and Champions League, but none that contradict these findings.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are correctly supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"the largest first leg be 0 - 7 for team g\u00f3rnik zabrze in the 1994 - 95 season.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part of the claim refers to. The key points are:\n\n1. **Largest First Leg Score**: This likely means the highest score recorded in a first leg match.\n2. **Score 0-7**: The specific result where one team scored 0 and the other 7 goals.\n3. **Team G\u00f3rnika Zabrze**: We need to find their entry in the table.\n4. **Season 1994 - 95**: The particular season being referred to.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find entries related to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze and the 1994-95 season.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few rows are about different clubs like Manchester United, OGC Nice, etc., but none mention G\u00f3rnik Zabrze.\n- I continue until I reach row 18: Season 1994 - 95, competition UEFA Cup, round preliminary, club G\u00f3rnik Zabrze, and the first leg score is 0 - 7.\n\nSo that's the relevant row. The claim mentions \"largest first leg be 0-7.\" I need to check if this is indeed the largest (highest) score in any first leg across all rows.\n\nLooking through other entries:\n- Most scores are low, like 0-6, 2-3, etc.\n- There's another 0-7? Let me check. No, it seems only one occurrence of 0-7 in row 18. \n\nTherefore, the claim is correct because this is the highest first leg score noted as 0-7 for G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in that season.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is at row index 18 under the 'first leg' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"first leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In 2003 at the UEFA Intertoto Cup, the first and second round were tied in the first leg.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim. It's about the year 2003, the competition is UEFA Intertoto Cup, specifically looking at the first and second rounds, and whether their first legs ended in a tie.\n\nLooking through the table, I need to find all entries where the season includes 2003 and the competition is the UEFA Intertoto Cup.
