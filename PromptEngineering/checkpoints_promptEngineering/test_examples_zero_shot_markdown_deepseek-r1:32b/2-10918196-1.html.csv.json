    "claim": "6 game have an attendance of over 7000 during the 1993 new york jet season",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"6 games have an attendance of over 7000 during the 1993 New York Jets season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The claim states that there are six games where attendance was more than 7000 people. So, my task is to check each game's attendance from the table and count how many meet this criterion.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week of the season with details like date, opponent, result, game site, and attendance. The column we're interested in here is \"attendance.\" Each entry under this column gives the number of attendees for that particular game.\n\nI'll start by going through each row and noting down the attendance figures:\n\n1. **Week 1**: Attendance is 68,130.\n2. **Week 2**: Attendance is 70,314.\n3. **Week 4**: Attendance is 64,836.\n4. **Week 5**: Attendance is 72,593.\n5. **Week 6**: Attendance is 41,627.\n6. **Week 8**: Attendance is 71,541.\n7. **Week 9**: Attendance is 71,659.\n8. **Week 10**: Attendance is 71,306.\n9. **Week 11**: Attendance is 47,351.\n10. **Week 12**: Attendance is 64,264.\n11. **Week 13**: Attendance is 42,810.\n12. **Week 14**: Attendance is 45,799.\n13. **Week 15**: Attendance is 47,970.\n14. **Week 16**: Attendance is 73,233.\n15. **Week 17**: Attendance is 70,817.\n16. **Week 18**: Attendance is 61,040.\n\nNext, I need to count how many of these attendances are over 70,000 because the claim mentions \"over 7000,\" but looking at the data, all numbers are much higher than that. It's possible there might be a typo in the claim, perhaps meaning over 70,000. Alternatively, if it's indeed 7000, then all games except maybe some would qualify.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The claim says \"over 7000.\" Given the attendance numbers are all in the tens of thousands, like 68,130 and so on, which is way more than 7000. So if we take it literally, every game has attendance over 7000. But that can't be right because the claim says only 6 games meet this condition. Therefore, there's likely a misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps the intended threshold was 70,000 instead of 7000. That makes more sense given the context of sports game attendances. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the claim meant over 70,000 attendees.\n\nNow, let's count how many games have attendance exceeding 70,000:\n\n- Week 1: 68,130 \u2192 No\n- Week 2: 70,314 \u2192 Yes (70k+)\n- Week 4: 64,836 \u2192 No\n- Week 5: 72,593 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 6: 41,627 \u2192 No\n- Week 8: 71,541 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 9: 71,659 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 10: 71,306 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 11: 47,351 \u2192 No\n- Week 12: 64,264 \u2192 No\n- Week 13: 42,810 \u2192 No\n- Week 14: 45,799 \u2192 No\n- Week 15: 47,970 \u2192 No\n- Week 16: 73,233 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 17: 70,817 \u2192 Yes (but wait, it's exactly 70,817 which is over 70k)\n- Week 18: 61,040 \u2192 No\n\nWait a second, I think I made an error in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Week 2: 70,314 \u2192 Yes (70,314 > 70,000)\n- Week 5: 72,593 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 8: 71,541 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 9: 71,659 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 10: 71,306 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 16: 73,233 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 17: 70,817 \u2192 Yes\n\nWait, that's seven games over 70k. But the claim says six games. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n1. Week 2: 70,314 \u2192 Yes\n2. Week 5: 72,593 \u2192 Yes\n3. Week 8: 71,541 \u2192 Yes\n4. Week 9: 71,659 \u2192 Yes\n5. Week 10: 71,306 \u2192 Yes\n6. Week 16: 73,233 \u2192 Yes\n7. Week 17: 70,817 \u2192 Yes\n\nThat's seven games with attendance over 70,000. But the claim states six. So either I'm missing something or there's a mistake in the claim.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to over 70,000 attendees per game, but only considering away games or home games? Let me check where each game was played.\n\nLooking at \"game site\" column:\n\n- Week 1: Away (opponent is Giants)\n- Week 2: Home\n- Week 4: Home\n- Week 5: Away (Raiders in Oakland)\nWait, no\u2014the opponent for Week 5 is Raiders, but the game site isn't specified as home or away. Wait, actually, looking at the \"game site\" column:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier because some of these games might have been played elsewhere, affecting attendance.\n\nWait, the table shows \"Game Site,\" which for Week 1 is Giants Stadium (so New York), so it's an away game for the Jets? Or is it a home game?\n\nActually, if the opponent is the New York Giants in Week 1, then theJets are playing away at Giants Stadium. So attendance might be lower because it's not their home games.\n\nSimilarly, other weeks:\n\n- Week 2: Home\n- Week 4: Home\n- Week 5: Away (Oakland)\n- Week 8: Home\n- Week 9: Home\n- Week 10: Home\n- Week 16: Home\n- Week 17: Away (Baltimore)\n\nSo, let's recast the attendance considering whether it's a home or away game.\n\nBut regardless, the claim is about any games with over 70k attendees. So if there are seven such games, but the claim says six, then it would be FALSE because the actual count is higher than claimed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread some attendances. Let me double-check:\n\n- Week 2: 70,314 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 5: 72,593 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 8: 71,541 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 9: 71,659 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 10: 71,306 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 16: 73,233 \u2192 Yes\n- Week 17: 70,817 \u2192 Yes\n\nThat's seven games with attendance over 70,000. Therefore, the claim that only six games had over 70k is incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, let me check if perhaps some attendances were exactly on 70k or below. For example:\n\n- Week 17: 70,817 is over 70k.\n- Week 2: 70,314 is just over 70k.\n\nSo all seven are indeed over 70k.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the claim is FALSE because there were more than six games with attendance over 70,000.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me list them:\n\n1. Week 2: 70,314\n2. Week 5: 72,593\n3. Week 8: 71,541\n4. Week 9: 71,659\n5. Week 10: 71,306\n6. Week 16: 73,233\n7. Week 17: 70,817\n\nYes, seven games. Therefore, the claim of six is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted because maybe some of these games were not actually played in New York or had other factors. Alternatively, maybe the attendances are for different years or something else. But based on the data provided, there are seven games with attendance over 70k.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the claim is incorrect; there were more than six such games.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that only six games had an attendance of over 70,000 is incorrect. Based on the data provided, there were seven games with attendance exceeding 70,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**Answer:** The statement is false; there were more than six games with attendance over 70,000.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{False}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the new york jet take the same amount of win as loss during the 1993 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's any mention of the New York Jets in the table. Looking through each row, I notice that all entries are for games against other teams like Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, etc., but none of them list \"New York Jets\" as an opponent. So, it seems the team represented in this table isn't the Jets.\n\nWait, maybe the team in question is actually a different one. The table shows opponents, so perhaps we're looking at another team's schedule where they played against various opponents including possibly the Jets elsewhere. But since there are 18 rows and no mention of the Jets as an opponent here, it might mean that either theJets didn't play against this particular team or the data doesn't include all their games.\n\nBut according to the table given, I can see the results for each game (win or loss) and count them. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Loss\nRow 1: Win\nRow 2: Win\nRow 3: Loss\nRow 4: Loss\nRow 5: Loss\nRow 6: Win\nRow 7: Win\nRow 8: Win\nRow 9: Win\nRow 10: Win\nRow 11: Win\nRow 12: Win\nRow 13: Loss\nRow 14: Win\nRow 15: Loss\n\nCounting the wins and losses:\n\nWins: Rows 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14 \u2192 That's 10 wins.\nLosses: Rows 0,3,4,5,13,15 \u2192 That's 6 losses.\n\nWait, but that totals 16 games. The table has 18 rows because it's missing week 3 and week 7? Wait no, looking back at the table, weeks are numbered up to 18, so all weeks are present except perhaps some are missing due to a typo or error. Let me recount carefully:\n\nRows (0-17):\nRow 0: L\nRow 1: W\nRow 2: W\nRow 3: L\nRow 4: L\nRow 5: L\nRow 6: W\nRow 7: W\nRow 8: W\nRow 9: W\nRow 10: W\nRow 11: W\nRow 12: W\nRow 13: L\nRow 14: W\nRow 15: L\n\nWait, that's rows 0 to 15. Rows 16 and 17 are missing? No, looking back, the table has weeks from 1 to 18, so perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me recount:\n\n- Week 1: L\n- Week 2: W\n- Week 4: W (Wait, week 3 is missing in the data. So the table skips some weeks but still lists up to week 18.)\n\nBut regardless of the week numbers, each row represents a game. Let me count all results:\n\nTotal wins:\nWeeks 2,4,9,10,11,12,13 (Wait, no: looking back at the table:\n\nRow indices and results:\n\n0: L\n1: W\n2: W\n3: L\n4: L\n5: L\n6: W\n7: W\n8: W\n9: W\n10: W\n11: W\n12: W\n13: L\n14: W\n15: L\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list each row's result:\n\nRow 0: L\nRow 1: W\nRow 2: W (New England)\nRow 3: L (Philadelphia Eagles? Wait no, opponent is New York Giants maybe?)\nWait, actually, the opponents are not all listed as Jets. So perhaps this table is for a different team.\n\nBut regardless of which team it is, to check if their wins equal losses in the season based on this data.\n\nSo, counting W and L:\n\nW: Rows 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14 \u2192 That's 10 wins.\nL: Rows 0,3,4,5,13,15 \u2192 6 losses. Wait, but the table has 18 rows (weeks 1 to 18), so I must have miscounted.\n\nWait the table provided shows 18 entries because week indices go up to 17 (since starting at 0). Let me recount correctly:\n\nRow index 0: Week 1: L\nRow 1: Week2: W\nRow2: Week4: W\nRow3: Week5: L\nWait, looking back at the table data:\n\nThe weeks are listed as 1,2,4,5,... up to 18. So some weeks might be missing because of byes or other reasons, but in terms of games played, each row is a game.\n\nSo total rows (games) = 18? Wait no, looking at the table provided:\n\nIt starts from week 1 (row0) and goes up to row17 which is week18. So 18 games.\n\nNow, counting W and L in all 18 games:\n\nRow0: L\nRow1: W\nRow2: W\nRow3: L\nRow4: L\nRow5: L\nRow6: W\nRow7: W\nRow8: W\nRow9: W\nRow10: W\nRow11: W\nRow12: W\nRow13: L\nRow14: W\nRow15: L\n\nWait, that's 16 rows. Rows 16 and 17 are:\n\nRow16: Week17: opponent is Cleveland Browns, result W (row index16)\nRow17: Week18: opponent is Buffalo Bills, result L (row index17)\n\nSo adding those:\n\nRow16: W\nRow17: L\n\nNow total wins and losses:\n\nWins: Rows 1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,16 \u2192 That's 11 wins.\nLosses: Rows0,3,4,5,13,15,17 \u2192 7 losses.\n\nWait that totals 18 games (11+7=18). So the team in this table has 11 wins and 7 losses. Therefore, they don't have equal number of wins and losses; it's more wins than losses.\n\nBut wait, the claim is about the New York Jets. Since none of the opponents are Jets here, perhaps the data isn't showing their games against Jets. But according to this table, the team has 11 wins and 7 losses. So unless the Jets have equal wins and losses elsewhere, but based on this data alone, it's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the New York Jet take the same amount of win as loss during the 1993 season.\" But in the table provided, there's no mention of the Jets as opponents, so perhaps this is a different team's schedule. Therefore, without data about the Jets' games, I can't confirm their wins and losses.\n\nAlternatively, if this table represents all of the Jets' games, then 11W-7L, which isn't equal. But since the opponents don't include Jets, it's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps the team in question is the New York Giants or another team, but regardless, for the claim to be true, the Jets must have equal W and L. Since I can't find any mention of Jets in this table, perhaps this data isn't about them. Therefore, the claim can't be supported by this data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo, but based on the given table, there's no information about Jets' wins and losses. So without that info, we can't say if they have equal W and L.\n\nWait, perhaps the team represented here is the Jets? Let me see: opponents are Denver, Miami, NY Giants, etc. So perhaps this is another team's schedule, not the Jets. Therefore, the data doesn't include Jets' games, so we can't determine their record from this table.\n\nIn that case, the claim isn't supported by the given data, so answer would be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because the New York Jets are not mentioned in the provided data. Therefore, based on the available information, it's impossible to confirm if they had an equal number of wins and losses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": \"false\"\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"the new york jet play the denver bronco before the miami dolphins during the 1993 season.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It suggests that the New York Jets played against the Denver Broncos earlier in the season than they played against the Miami Dolphins.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify when the Jets played each of these opponents. The table shows various weeks and dates for each game.\n\nI'll start by checking which row has the opponent \"denver broncos.\" Scanning through, week 1 is against Denver Broncos on 1993-09-05.\n\nNext, I look for games against Miami Dolphins. Week 2 is against Miami on 1993-09-12.\n\nSo, the Jets played Denver in week 1 and Miami in week 2. Since week 1 comes before week 2, the claim that they played Denver before Miami is correct.\n\nNow, I need to extract the relevant cells from the table to support this conclusion. For Denver Broncos, it's row index 0 (since tables are zero-indexed), under \"opponent.\" For Miami Dolphins, it's row index 1, same column.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Jets played Denver in week 1 and Miami in week 2.

The claim says: \"the new york jet have 992 more crowd attendance in their second game against the miami dolphins then from their first game play against them during the 1993 season.\"\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions two games against Miami Dolphins by New York Jets. I need to find both these games in the table and compare their attendance numbers.\n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column, I see Miami Dolphins appear twice: once in week 2 (row index 1) and again in week 10 (row index 9). \n\nIn week 2, the game was on September 12, 1993.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It says that the New York Jets played against the Miami Dolphins before they played against the Denver Broncos in the 1993 season. So I need to check if the game against Miami Dolphins occurred earlier in the season than the game against Denver Broncos.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week of games for the team in question (which appears to be the New York Jets since they are mentioned in the claim). Each row has details like date, opponent, result, etc. \n\nI should look for the rows where the opponent is Miami Dolphins and Denver Broncos. The relevant columns here would be \"date\" and \"opponent\".\n\nLet me go through each week:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is Denver Broncos, Date is 1993-09-05.\n- Week 2: Opponent is Miami Dolphins, Date is 1993-09-12.\n\nSo the first game against Denver was on September 5th, and the next game against Miami was on September 12th. That means Denver was played before Miami in this case. But wait, the claim says that Jets played Miami before Denver. So according to the table, they actually played Denver first and then Miami, which would make the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me double-check. The opponent for week 1 is Denver Broncos on September 5th, and opponent for week 2 is Miami Dolphins on September 12th. So in the season order, Denver came before Miami. Therefore, the Jets did not play Miami before Denver; instead, they played Denver first.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Miami was a later game than Denver.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the New York Jets played against Denver Broncos on September 5, 1993 (Week 1) and against Miami Dolphins on September 12, 1993 (Week 2). Therefore, they played Miami after Denver, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the new york jet take 3 more win over loss during the 1993 season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check if there's a team named \"New York Jets\" in the table. Looking at the opponent column, I see opponents like Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, etc. Wait, but I don't see \"New York Jets\" listed as an opponent anywhere. Hmm, that's confusing because the claim is about the Jets.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the team we're looking at isn't theJets but another team. Let me check the game sites. The games are played at places like The Meadowlands, which I think is where the New York Giants and New Jersey Devils play, but not necessarily the Jets. Oh wait, maybe the Jets are the home team here because some games are listed as \"The Meadowlands\" without a specific opponent being from there.\n\nBut in the table, each row lists an opponent, so perhaps the team we're focusing on is playing against these opponents. The claim says \"the New York Jet take 3 more win over loss\", meaning their total wins minus losses equal three.\n\nSo I need to count how many wins and losses the Jets had during the 1993 season based on this table. However, looking at the 'opponent' column, none of them are \"New York Jets\". So does that mean theJets weren't involved in any games listed here? That can't be right because if they played against these opponents, their record would be reflected in wins or losses.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the team whose season we're looking at is theJets themselves. But in the table, each row shows a game where the team (let's assume it's theJets) is playing against another opponent. So for each game, if the result is 'W', that's a win for theJets; if it's 'L', that's a loss.\n\nSo let me count all the wins and losses in the table to determine their total W-L difference.\n\nLooking through the results column:\n\nRow 1: L\nRow 2: W\nRow 3: W\nRow 4: L\nRow5: L\nRow6: L\nRow7: W\nRow8: W\nRow9: W\nRow10: L\nRow11: W\nRow12: W\nRow13: W\nRow14: L\nRow15: W\nRow16: L\nRow17: L\nRow18: L\n\nWait, let's count again. Wait the table has 18 rows, each representing a game.\n\nSo:\n\n- Wins (W): Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 2: W \u2192 1\nRow3: W \u2192 2\nRow7: W \u21923\nRow8: W \u21924\nRow9: W \u21925\nRow10: L\nRow11: W \u21926\nRow12: W \u21927\nRow13: W \u21928\nRow15: W \u21929\n\nSo total wins are 9.\n\nLosses (L):\n\nRow1: L \u21921\nRow4: L \u21922\nRow5: L \u21923\nRow6: L \u21924\nRow10: L \u21925\nRow14: L \u21926\nRow16: L \u21927\nRow17: L \u21928\nRow18: L \u21929\n\nSo total losses are 9.\n\nWait, that's 9 wins and 9 losses. So the difference is zero. The claim says they took 3 more wins over losses, which would mean a difference of +3 (like 9-6). But here it's equal.\n\nBut wait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me list each row:\n\nRow1: L\nRow2: W \u21921\nRow3: W \u21922\nRow4: L \u21921\nRow5: L \u21922\nRow6: L \u21923\nRow7: W \u21923\nRow8: W \u21924\nRow9: W \u21925\nRow10: L \u21924\nRow11: W \u21926\nRow12: W \u21927\nRow13: W \u21928\nRow14: L \u21925\nRow15: W \u21929\nRow16: L \u21926\nRow17: L \u21927\nRow18: L \u21928\n\nWait, that's 9 wins and 8 losses. Because row18 is the 8th loss.\n\nSo total wins:9, losses:8. So difference is +1 (9-8=1). But the claim says 3 more wins than losses, which would require a difference of +3.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me list all the results:\n\nRow1: L\nRow2: W\nRow3: W\nRow4: L\nRow5: L\nRow6: L\nRow7: W\nRow8: W\nRow9: W\nRow10: L\nRow11: W\nRow12: W\nRow13: W\nRow14: L\nRow15: W\nRow16: L\nRow17: L\nRow18: L\n\nSo counting W's:\n\nRows 2,3,7,8,9,11,12,13,15 \u2192 that's 9 wins.\n\nL's:\n\nRows1,4,5,6,10,14,16,17,18 \u2192 that's 9 losses.\n\nSo total wins:9, losses:9. So difference is zero.\n\nTherefore, the claim says they have 3 more wins than losses, which would be a difference of +3, but here it's zero. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misread the table. Let me double-check each row:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 17 (since 18 rows). Wait no, in JSON, row indices start at 0? Or is it 1-based? The example given uses \"row_0\", so probably 0-based.\n\nSo let's recount using 0-based index:\n\nRow 0: L\nRow1: W \u21921\nRow2: W \u21922\nRow3: L \u21921\nRow4: L \u21922\nRow5: L \u21923\nRow6: W \u21923\nRow7: W \u21924\nRow8: W \u21925\nRow9: L \u21924\nRow10: W \u21926\nRow11: W \u21927\nRow12: W \u21928\nRow13: L \u21925\nRow14: W \u21929\nRow15: L \u21926\nRow16: L \u21927\nRow17: L \u21928\n\nSo total wins:9, losses:8.\n\nWait that's 9 wins and 8 losses. So difference is +1.\n\nHmm, this contradicts my previous count. Wait in row indices:\n\nRow0: L \u2192 loss 1\nRow1: W \u2192 win1\nRow2: W \u2192win2\nRow3: L \u2192loss2\nRow4: L\u2192loss3\nRow5:L\u2192loss4\nRow6:W\u2192win3\nRow7:W\u2192win4\nRow8:W\u2192win5\nRow9:L\u2192loss5\nRow10:W\u2192win6\nRow11:W\u2192win7\nRow12:W\u2192win8\nRow13:L\u2192loss6\nRow14:W\u2192win9\nRow15:L\u2192loss7\nRow16:L\u2192loss8\nRow17:L\u2192loss9\n\nSo total wins:9, losses:9. So difference is zero.\n\nBut in this recounting, row0 is L (loss 1), and row17 is loss 9.\n\nWait, but in the initial table, does each row represent a game? The table has 18 rows, which would be 18 games. If they have 9 wins and 9 losses, that's 18 games, so difference zero.\n\nBut the claim says \"3 more wins over loss\", meaning (W - L) =3.\n\nSince in this case W-L=0, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, with relevant cells being all the result columns where W and L are counted.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows 9 wins and 9 losses for the team, resulting in a difference of zero. Therefore, the claim that they had 3 more wins than losses is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n      { \"row\": 0, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 1, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 2, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 3, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 4, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 5, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 6, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 7, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 8, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 9, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 10, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 11, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 12, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 13, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 14, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 15, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 16, \"column\": \"Result\" },\n      { \"row\": 17, \"column\": \"Result\" }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the New York Jets have 992 more crowd attendance in their second game against the New England Patriots than from their first game play against them during the 1993 season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what exactly needs verification. The key points are:\n- It's about the New York Jets.\n- They played two games against the New England Patriots during the 1993 season.\n- The second game had 992 more attendees than the first.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to identify which rows correspond to these games between the Jets and the Patriots. \n\nI'll scan through each row to find instances where the opponent is \"new england patriots.\" Let's go through them one by one:\n\n- Row 4: Week 4, Date 1993-09-26, Opponent New England Patriots, Result W 45-7, Game Site The Meadowlands, Attendance 64836.\n- Row 13: Week 13, Date 1993-11-28, Opponent New England Patriots, Result W 6-0, Game Site Foxboro Stadium, Attendance 42810.\n\nSo there are two games against the New England Patriots. The first game was in week 4 with an attendance of 64,836 and the second in week 13 with an attendance of 42,810.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the difference in attendance between these two games. However, according to the claim, the second game should have higher attendance by 992 people. Let's compute:\n\nSecond game attendance: 42,810\nFirst game attendance: 64,836\n\nDifference = 42,810 - 64,836 = -22,026\n\nWait, that's a negative number, meaning the second game had fewer attendees than the first. This is contrary to what the claim states.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread which team was the home team. The claim refers to \"New York Jets,\" so perhaps we need to consider whether they were playing at their home stadium or not.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- In week 4: Game site is The Meadowlands, which is the Jets' home stadium.\n- In week 13: Game site is Foxboro Stadium, which was the Patriots' home stadium (now known as Gillette Stadium).\n\nSo, in the first game (week 4), the Jets were at home and had an attendance of 64,836. The second game (week 13) was away, with an attendance of 42,810.\n\nThe claim is about the Jets' attendance difference in their two games against the Patriots. So it's comparing the Jets' crowd in their home game vs. their away game against the same opponent.\n\nWait, but actually, when a team plays at home, the attendance reflects their home support. When they play away, the attendance is from the opposing team's fans and neutral fans. However, for the purpose of this claim, it's about the Jets' two games against the Patriots, regardless of location.\n\nSo, the first game (week 4) had an attendance of 64,836, and the second game (week 13) was in Foxboro with 42,810. The difference is indeed a decrease of 22,026, which doesn't support the claim of +992.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe I got the rows wrong. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 4 (week 4): opponent New England Patriots, attendance 64836.\nRow 13 (week 13): opponent New England Patriots, attendance 42810.\n\nSo that's two games: one in week 4 with higher attendance and another in week 13 with lower. The difference is 64,836 - 42,810 = 22,026. So the second game had fewer attendees by 22,026, not more.\n\nThus, the claim that the second game had 992 more attendees than the first is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which games are considered \"first\" and \"second.\" Maybe the claim refers to the two meetings between the Jets and Patriots, regardless of location. Let's list all meetings:\n\nLooking at the table, there are only two instances where the opponent is New England Patriots: week 4 (Jets' home) and week 13 (Patriots' home). So that's the first meeting and the second meeting.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is considering both games as \"first\" and \"second,\" regardless of location. However, in that case, the attendance numbers don't match the claim.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe I need to check if there are more than two meetings between Jets and Patriots? Let's go through all rows:\n\n- Row 4: New England Patriots\n- Row 13: New England Patriots\n\nOnly two entries. So no, only two games. Therefore, the attendance difference is -22,026, meaning the second game had fewer attendees.\n\nHence, the claim of 992 more attendees in the second game is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because the second game against the New England Patriots had a significantly lower attendance than the first, not higher by 992.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
