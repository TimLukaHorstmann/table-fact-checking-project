    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close, in 2012.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions two stadiums, edgeley park and firhill, closing in 2012. They are supposed to be the most recent large rugby union stadiums to close that year.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows with stadium names, their capacities, cities, countries, and closure years. My task is to check if these two stadiums closed in 2012 and whether they were the most recent ones among all large stadiums.\n\nWait, the claim specifies \"large rugby union stadium.\" So first, I need to consider what qualifies as a large stadium based on capacity. The table doesn't specify if each stadium is for rugby or another sport, but given that some are in countries where rugby is popular, perhaps we can assume they are rugby stadiums.\n\nLooking at the closure years, edgeley park closed in 2012 (row index 10), and firhill also closed in 2012 (row index 11). Now, I need to check if any other stadium in the table closed after 2012. \n\nScanning through all rows:\n\n- The national stadium: 1997\n- lansdowne road: 2007\n- petco park: 2010\n- athletic park: 1999\n- carisbrook: 2011\n- stubhub center: 2007\n- loftus road: 2001\n- meadowbank stadium: 2006\n- racecourse ground: 2009\n- stade jean - bouin: 2010\n- edgeley park: 2012\n- firhill: 2012\n\nSo, the latest closure is 2012. Both edgeley park and firhill closed in that year. Are there any other stadiums that closed in 2012 besides these two? No, just these two. So they are indeed the most recent ones to close based on this table.\n\nNow, about being \"large.\" The capacities vary:\n\n- edgeley park: 10900\n- firhill: 10887\n\nLooking at other closed in later years before 2012, like carisbrook (29000) closed in 2011. So yes, both edgeley and firhill are relatively large compared to others that closed around the same time.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"large.\" Is there a specific threshold? The table doesn't define it, so I have to assume based on context. Given that these two are among the higher capacities in the table after 2010, they can be considered large.\n\nSo, putting it all together: both edgeley park and firhill closed in 2012, which is the most recent year in the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"england, scotland, wale, the united state and new zealand each have 2 rugby stadium with a capacity of over 10000 that close.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the countries mentioned in the claim: England, Scotland, Wales, United States, and New Zealand. Each of these is supposed to have two rugby stadiums meeting certain criteria\u2014capacity over 10,000 and closed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a stadium with details like name, capacity, city, country, and closure year. I need to check for each country how many of their stadiums meet the capacity and closure conditions.\n\nStarting with England: The table shows two stadiums\u2014Loftus Road (London) and Edgeley Park (Stockport). Loftus Road has a capacity of 18,500 and closed in 2001. Edgeley Park has 10,900 capacity and closed in 2012. Both are over 10k and closed, so England meets the condition.\n\nNext is Scotland: The table lists Meadowbank Stadium (Edinburgh) with 16,500 capacity, closed in 2006, and Firhill (Glasgow) with 10,887 capacity, closed in 2012. Both are over 10k and closed, so Scotland is good.\n\nWales: There's the National Stadium (Cardiff) with 53,000 capacity closed in 1997 and Racecourse Ground (Wrexham) with 15,500 capacity closed in 2009. Both over 10k, so Wales is covered.\n\nUnited States: The table has Petco Park (San Diego) with 42,445 capacity closed in 2010 and Stubhub Center (Carson) with 27,000 capacity also closed in 2007. Both meet the criteria, so US is fine.\n\nNew Zealand: There are Athletic Park (Wellington) with 39,000 closed in 1999 and Carisbrook (Dunedin) with 29,000 closed in 2011. Both are over 10k, so New Zealand is okay.\n\nNow, checking each country: England has two, Scotland has two, Wales has two, US has two, NZ has two. So all the countries mentioned have at least two rugby stadiums that fit the criteria.\n\nI should also make sure there's no mistake in counting or misreading capacities. Looking again:\n\n- England: 18500 and 10900 \u2014 both over 10k.\n- Scotland: 16500 and 10887 \u2014 both over 10k.\n- Wales: 53000 and 15500 \u2014 both over.\n- US: 42445 and 27000 \u2014 yes.\n- NZ: 39000 and 29000 \u2014 yes.\n\nSo the claim is correct. All countries have two such stadiums each.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}",

The task is to determine if the claim \"lansdowne road be the only rugby union stadium in ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have close\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim states that Lansdowne Road is the sole rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity exceeding 10,000 that has closed down. So, there are three key points here: \n\n1. **Rugby Union Stadium**: We're specifically looking at stadiums used for rugby union matches.\n2. **Capacity Over 10,000**: The stadium must have had a capacity of more than 10,000 when it closed.\n3. **Only One Such Stadium in Ireland**: No other stadium in Ireland should meet these criteria.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided:\n\n- The table lists various stadiums with their capacities, cities, countries, and closure years.\n- I'll need to filter the data based on country as 'ireland' and check if any of those have a capacity over 10,000 and are closed.\n\nFrom the table, I see only one stadium listed under Ireland: Lansdowne Road. Its details are:\n- Capacity: 49,000\n- Closed in 2007\n\nSince it's the only stadium from Ireland in the table with a capacity over 10,000 and closed, at first glance, the claim seems to hold true.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that there aren't other rugby union stadiums in Ireland not listed here. The problem is, we're limited by the data provided. If the table includes all relevant rugby union stadiums from Ireland with capacities over 10,000, then Lansdowne Road would indeed be the only one. However, if there are other stadiums outside this table that meet the criteria, the claim could be false.\n\nBut since we have to base our answer solely on the given data, and there's only one such stadium in Ireland in this table, I can't find any evidence contradicting the claim based on this information.\n\nTherefore, according to the provided table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because, according to the table, Lansdowne Road is the sole rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10,000 that has closed. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table has several entries, so I'll need to find which one is the National Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row is \"the national stadium\" located in Cardiff, Wales. Okay, that matches the claim. Now, let's check each detail:\n\n1. **Capacity**: The claim states 10887. But according to the table, the capacity for the National Stadium is 53000. That's a big difference. So this part doesn't match.\n\n2. **Closure Year**: The claim says it closed in 1997. Checking the table, yes, that's correct\u2014the National Stadium was closed in 1997.\n\nWait, but the capacity is way off. Also, looking at other rows, I see \"firhill\" with a capacity of 10887, which matches the number in the claim. Firhill is located in Glasgow, Scotland and closed in 2012. So the claim mistakenly attributes Firhill's capacity to the National Stadium.\n\nSo putting it together: The stadium in Cardiff (National Stadium) did close in 1997, but its capacity was much higher than stated. Therefore, the claim has both correct and incorrect parts, making the overall statement false because of the incorrect capacity.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because although the National Stadium closed in 1997 as stated, its actual capacity was 53000, not 10887.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So England doesn't have three.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The table has two in England: Loftus Road and Edgeley Park. Both are closed and over 10k capacity. But the claim requires three per country. So England falls short here.\n\n- **Scotland**: Looking for 3 stadiums.\n   - Meadowbank Stadium (16500) - Closed\n   - Firhill (10887) - Closed\n   Again, only two. So Scotland also doesn't meet the requirement.\n\nWait a minute, in my initial list, I might have missed some. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- England: Loftus Road and Edgeley Park.\n- Scotland: Meadowbank Stadium and Firhill.\n- Wales: The National Stadium and Racecourse Ground.\n- United States: Petco Park and Stubhub Center.\n- New Zealand: Athletic Park, Carisbrook.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all again:\n\n1. England:\n   - Loftus Road (Row 7)\n   - Edgeley Park (Row 10)\n\nThat's two.\n\n2. Scotland:\n   - Meadowbank Stadium (Row 8)\n   - Firhill (Row 11)\n\nTwo as well.\n\n3. Wales:\n   - The National Stadium (Row 0)\n   - Racecourse Ground (Row 9)\n\nAlso two.\n\n4. United States:\n   - Petco Park (Row 2)\n   - Stubhub Center (Row 5)\n\nTwo again.\n\n5. New Zealand:\n   - Athletic Park (Row 3)\n   - Carisbrook (Row 4)\n\nThat's two for New Zealand as well.\n\nSo, each country only has two stadiums that meet the capacity and closure criteria, not three.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"edgeley park and firhill be the most recent large rugby union stadium to close, in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. The columns are stadium name, capacity at closure, city, country, and the year closed. There are 12 rows of data. \n\nThe claim mentions two specific stadiums: edgeley park and firhill. Let me locate these in the table. Looking down the 'stadium' column:\n\n- Edgeley Park is listed on row index 10 (since counting starts at 0). Its closure year is 2012.\n- Firhill is on row index 11, with a closure year of 2012 as well.\n\nThe claim states that both closed in 2010. However, according to the table, both actually closed in 2012. So there's an inconsistency here. \n\nNext, I'll check if they're considered 'large' rugby union stadiums. The capacity column might help determine this. Edgeley Park has a capacity of 10900 and Firhill has 10887. Comparing these to other rows:\n\n- Petco Park in San Diego has the highest capacity at 42,445.\n- Stade Jean-Bouin in Paris is listed with 12,000.\n\nSo, Edgeley Park and Firhill are among the smaller stadiums in this table, not necessarily 'large'. \n\nAdditionally, the claim refers to them as the \"most recent\" to close. Looking at all closure years:\n\n- The most recent closures are in 2012 (Edgeley Park and Firhill), followed by 2011 (Carisbrook) and others from 1997 to 2010.\n\nSince Edgeley Park and Firhill closed in 2012, they would indeed be the most recent. However, the claim incorrectly states that this happened in 2010. \n\nSo, there are two issues: \n1. The closure year is wrong.\n2. They might not be considered 'large' compared to others.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully supported by the data provided. It's FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"closed\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"closed\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "athletic park , in wellington , be new zealand 's second largest stadium , with a total capacity of 39000",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim about \"athletic park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim carefully: \"athletic park, in wellington, be new zealand's second largest stadium, with a total capacity of 39000.\"\n\nI should break this down into parts to check against the table. The key points are:\n1. Stadium name is Athletic Park.\n2. It's located in Wellington, New Zealand.\n3. It is claimed to be New Zealand's second largest stadium.\n4. Its capacity is 39,000.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- I'll scan through each row to find \"athletic park\". Found it in row index 3 (since counting starts from 0). The stadium is indeed named Athletic Park and located in Wellington, New Zealand. That's correct.\n\nNext, checking the capacity: According to the table, the capacity is 39000, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, the tricky part is determining if it's the second largest stadium in New Zealand. I need to look at all stadiums in New Zealand and see their capacities.\n\nFrom the table:\n- Athletic Park (Wellington): 39,000\n- Carisbrook (Dunedin): 29,000\n\nAre there any other New Zealand stadiums listed? No, only these two. So, with just these two, Athletic Park would be the larger one since 39k is more than 29k. But wait, the claim says it's the second largest. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait a minute\u2014maybe I should consider all the data in the table regardless of country for size comparison? No, because the claim specifies New Zealand's second largest. So within New Zealand, we have only two entries: Athletic Park and Carisbrook. Since 39k is higher than 29k, Athletic Park is actually the largest stadium in New Zealand as per this data.\n\nBut the claim says it's the second largest. That doesn't align with the table because there are no other stadiums from New Zealand listed that have a larger capacity than 39k. Therefore, the claim about being the second largest might be incorrect unless there's another stadium not mentioned in the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps \"second largest\" refers to within a specific context or data set beyond this table. But according to the given information, since only two New Zealand stadiums are listed and Athletic Park is larger than Carisbrook, it should be considered the largest.\n\nWait another thought\u2014perhaps the term \"largest\" could refer to something else, but in terms of capacity, 39k is higher. So unless there's a stadium with more capacity that isn't listed here, the claim about being second might not hold.\n\nBut according to this table, Athletic Park is the only New Zealand stadium larger than Carisbrook, so it should be first, not second. Hence, the claim is incorrect on that point.\n\nHowever, let me double-check all rows again:\n\n- Row 3: Athletic Park, Wellington, New Zealand, capacity 39k.\n- Row 4: Carisbrook, Dunedin, New Zealand, capacity 29k.\n\nNo other NZ stadiums. So in this table, Athletic Park is the largest. Thus, the claim that it's the second largest is false because there's no larger stadium listed for NZ.\n\nTherefore, even though the other details (name, location, capacity) are correct, the part about being the second largest is not supported by the data here.\n\nWait, but maybe \"second largest\" refers to globally? That doesn't make sense because it's specified as New Zealand's. So I think the claim is incorrect in that aspect.\n\nSo overall, since part of the claim isn't accurate based on the table, the entire statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"stadium\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"city\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"capacity (at time of closure)\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"Lansdowne Road be the 1 of 2 rugby union stadium in Ireland with a capacity over 10000 to have closed.\"\n\nFirst, I need to verify if Lansdowne Road is indeed one of two rugby union stadiums in Ireland that had a capacity over 10,000 and were closed. \n\nLooking at the table, there's only one stadium listed under Ireland: Lansdowne Road. It has a capacity of 49,000 and was closed in 2007. I don't see any other stadium from Ireland in this table. So, if there are supposed to be two such stadiums, but the table only shows one, that means the claim might not hold true.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check all rows. The countries listed are Wales, Ireland, United States, New Zealand, England, Scotland, France. Only Ireland has Lansdowne Road as a stadium with over 10,000 capacity in this table. There's no other entry for Ireland. \n\nSo the claim says there should be two such stadiums, but according to the data provided, only one exists. Therefore, the claim is false because the table doesn't support that there are two rugby union stadiums in Ireland meeting those conditions.\n\nI need to identify which cells are relevant. For Lansdowne Road, I look at its capacity (49,000), country (Ireland), and whether it closed. So, the relevant cells would be capacity and country for that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there should be two rugby union stadiums in Ireland with over 10,000 capacity that closed.
