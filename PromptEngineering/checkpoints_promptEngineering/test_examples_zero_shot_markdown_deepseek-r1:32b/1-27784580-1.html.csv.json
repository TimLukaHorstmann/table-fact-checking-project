    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 7 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, \"arienai kisu\" is one of the episode titles in the table. Looking at the table, that's episode 2. The broadcast date for arienai kisu is May 17, 2010.\n\nNext, I need to find out which title has the earliest broadcast date. Scanning through all the broadcast dates:\n\n- Episode 1: May 10, 2010\n- Episode 2: May 17, 2010\n- Episode 3: May 24, 2010\n- Episode 4: May 31, 2010\n- Episode 5: June 7, 2010\n- Episode 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010 for episode 1. The title of that episode is \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\" (romanized as omae ga hosii).\n\nNow, the claim says that arienai kisu was broadcast 7 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date. So, let's calculate the difference between May 17 and May 10. That's exactly 7 days later. \n\nSo, the claim is correct because episode 2 (arienai kisu) aired on May 17, which is 7 days after episode 1 (the earliest broadcast date).\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are:\n- The broadcast date for arienai kisu (episode 2)\n- The broadcast date for the earliest episode (episode 1)\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what each part of the claim refers to. \n\n1. **Identify the Episode \"arienai kisu\":**\n   Looking at the table, I see that the episode titled \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" has a romanized title \"arianai kisu\". So, this is the second row in the table (row index 1).\n\n2. **Determine the Rating for \"arianai kisu\":**\n   The ratings column shows 19.2% for this episode.\n\n3. **Find the Title with the Earliest Broadcast Date:**\n   I need to look at the \"broadcast date\" column and find which episode was aired first.\n   - ep 1: May 10, 2010\n   - ep 2: May 17, 2010\n   - ep 3: May 24, 2010\n   - ep 4: May 31, 2010\n   - ep 5: June 7, 2010\n   - ep 6: June 14, 2010\n\n   The earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to episode 1 titled \"\u304a\u307e\u3048\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044\" with a rating of 22.4%.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Ratings:**\n   The claim states that \"arienai kisu\" has 3.2% less than this earliest episode.\n   Let's subtract the ratings:\n   22.4% (earliest) - 19.2% (\"arianai kisu\") = 3.2%.\n\n5. **Verify the Claim:**\n   The difference is exactly 3.2%, so the claim holds true.\n\n6. **Identify Relevant Cells for Verification:**\n   - For \"arienai kisu\": row index 1, columns are romanized title and ratings.\n   - For earliest broadcast date: row index 0, columns are episode title (or broadcast date) to confirm it's the first one, and its rating.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify which row corresponds to the episode titled \"suki to ietara iinoni\". Looking at the table, each row has a column named \"romanized title\", and I can scan through those to find the match. \n\nLooking at row 0: \"omae ga hosii\" doesn't match.\nRow 1: \"arianeai kisu\" nope.\nRow 2: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" not it.\nRow 3: \"konna ni suki dattanda\u2026\" close but not exactly the same as the claim.\nWait, row 4 has \"suki to ietara iinoni\". That's a match. So this is the episode in question.\n\nNow, I need to check its broadcast date. The claim says it has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. To verify this, I should list out all the broadcast dates and see their order from earliest to latest.\n\nThe broadcast dates are as follows:\n- ep1: May 10, 2010\n- ep2: May 17, 2010\n- ep3: May 24, 2010\n- ep4: May 31, 2010\n- ep5: June 7, 2010\n- ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nArranged in order, the latest is June 14 (ep6), then June 7 (ep5), then May 31 (ep4), followed by May 24 (ep3), May 17 (ep2), and May 10 (ep1).\n\nThe claim says that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" is the 2nd most recent. Since ep5 was broadcast on June 7, which is earlier than ep6's June 14, then ep5 would be the second latest. So checking the broadcast date for ep5: it's June 7, 2010.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014the claim says \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. Let me make sure which one is actually ep5. Yes, looking back, row index 4 (since counting starts at 0) corresponds to ep5, and its broadcast date is June 7, 2010.\n\nNow, how does this rank in terms of recency? The most recent is June 14 (ep6), then June 7 (ep5). So ep5 would be the second most recent. Therefore, the claim should be TRUE.\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I mixing up row indices and episode numbers? Let me double-check: ep1 is row 0, ep2 row1, up to ep6 as row5. The broadcast dates are increasing from May 10 to June 14. So in order of broadcast dates:\n\nearliest: ep1 (May10), ep2 (May17), ep3 (May24), ep4 (May31), ep5 (June7), ep6 (June14).\n\nSo the most recent is ep6, then ep5, so ep5 is indeed the 2nd most recent. Therefore, the claim holds.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells: I need the row where \"romanized title\" is \"suki to ietara iinoni\", which is row index 4, and check its broadcast date in column \"broadcast date\". So the cell for ep5's broadcast date is in row4, column \"broadcast date\".\n\nAdditionally, to determine if it's the second most recent, I need to compare all the broadcast dates. But since the claim specifically refers to this episode being the 2nd, I think only the relevant cells are those of the episode in question and perhaps the others to confirm their order. However, according to the instructions, I should list the cells that were directly checked to verify the claim.\n\nIn this case, the key cell is the broadcast date for \"suki to ietara iinoni\" which is row4's \"broadcast date\". So the relevant cells are just that one.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"}]}",

So, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nThe claim states: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 2.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down what each part of this claim refers to in the table.\n\n1. **Identify 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu':** Looking at the \"romanized title\" column, the third episode is \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\". Its rating is 15.6%, according to the \"ratings\" column in row index 2.\n\n2. **Find the most recent broadcast date:** The table shows episodes from May 10, 2010, up to June 14, 2010. The most recent broadcast date is June 14, 2010. Checking which episode that corresponds to: it's \"saish\u016bsh\u014djomakuwakare\" in row index 5 with a rating of 13.4%.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:** The claim says that 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' has a 2.2% higher rating than this most recent episode. So, let's compute: 15.6% (fukusy\u016b) minus 13.4% (most recent). That gives us a difference of 2.2%, which matches the claim.\n\n4. **Check relevant cells:** To verify this, I need to look at the ratings for both episodes and their respective broadcast dates. The relevant cells are:\n   - For 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu': row index 2 under \"ratings\".\n   - For the most recent episode: row index 5 under \"ratings\" and \"broadcast date\".\n\nEverything adds up, so the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as the rating difference matches exactly.

The claim says: \"arienai kisu be broadcast 14 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"arienai kisu\" is one of the episode titles in Japanese. Looking at the table, I see that \"arienai kisu\" corresponds to Episode 2. The broadcast date for this episode is May 17, 2010.\n\nNext, the earliest broadcast date among all episodes should be identified. Let's check the broadcast dates:\n\n- Episode 1: May 10, 2010\n- Episode 2: May 17, 2010\n- Episode 3: May 24, 2010\n- Episode 4: May 31, 2010\n- Episode 5: June 7, 2010\n- Episode 6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010, which is for Episode 1. The claim states that \"arienai kisu\" was broadcast 14 days after the earliest episode. \n\nSo I need to check if May 17 is indeed 14 days after May 10. Let's calculate:\n\nFrom May 10 to May 17: That's exactly one week, which is 7 days. So it's only a week later, not two weeks (14 days).

The claim states: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 4% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand the components of this claim.\n\nThe episode in question is titled \"suki to ietara iinoni\" which I can see from the table. Looking at the table, each row represents an episode with details like the episode number, title in Japanese, romanized title, translation, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nI need to find two things: \n\n1. The rating of \"suki to ietara iinoni.\"\n2. The lowest rating among all episodes.\n3. Check if the first is 4% higher than the second.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Episode 5 has the romanized title \"suki to ietara iinoni,\" and its rating is 17.4%.\n\nNow, I'll check the ratings of all episodes to find the lowest one. Let's list them out:\n\n- Ep 1: 22.4%\n- Ep 2: 19.2%\n- Ep 3: 15.6%\n- Ep 4: 15.5%\n- Ep 5: 17.4%\n- Ep 6: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating here is 13.4% for episode 6.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the difference between Episode 5's rating (17.4%) and the lowest rating (13.4%). \n\n17.4 - 13.4 = 4.0\n\nSo, Episode 5 has exactly a 4% higher rating than the episode with the lowest rating.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For \"suki to ietara iinoni,\" that's row index 4 (since counting starts at 0) and column \"ratings.\"\n- The lowest rating is in row index 5, also under \"ratings.\"\n\nSo the relevant cells are both from the ratings column but different rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Episode 5 has a 4% higher rating than the episode with the lowest rating.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"arienai kisu have 5.8% more rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to in the table. Let's break down the claim into two main parts:\n\n1. Identify the episode titled \"arienai kisu\".\n2. Find the episode with the earliest broadcast date.\n3. Compare their ratings to see if \"arienai kisu\" has 5.8% higher rating than the earliest episode.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and note down the necessary information.\n\nStarting with the first part: locating \"arienai kisu\". Scanning the 'romanized title' column:\n\n- ep1: omae ga hosii\n- ep2: arienai kisu \u2192 This matches. So, this is our episode in question.\n  \nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the earliest broadcast date. The 'broadcast date' column lists the dates as follows:\n\n- ep1: May 10, 2010\n- ep2: May 17, 2010\n- ep3: May 24, 2010\n- ep4: May 31, 2010\n- ep5: June 7, 2010\n- ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nThe earliest date here is May 10, 2010, which corresponds to ep1. So, the title with the earliest broadcast date is \"omae ga hosii\".\n\nNext, I need their ratings:\n\n- arienai kisu (ep2) has a rating of 19.2%\n- ome ga hosii (ep1) has a rating of 22.4%\n\nThe claim states that \"arienai kisu\" has 5.8% more than the earliest episode. Let's calculate the difference between these two ratings.\n\nWait, no. Actually, if we're checking whether arienai kisu is higher by 5.8%, we need to see if 19.2% is equal to 22.4% plus 5.8%. That would mean:\n\n22.4% + 5.8% = 28.2%\n\nBut arienai kisu's rating is 19.2%, which is actually lower than 22.4%, not higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim meant that arienai kisu has 5.8% less? Let me check:\n\nThe difference between ep2 and ep1 is 22.4 - 19.2 = 3.2%. So it's 3.2% lower, not 5.8% higher.\n\nTherefore, the claim that arienai kisu has 5.8% more rating than the earliest episode (ep1) is incorrect because the numbers don't add up. In fact, ep2 has a lower rating than ep1.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"arienai kisu\" has 5.8% higher ratings than the earliest broadcasted episode. From the table:\n\n- \"arienai kisu\" (ep2) has 19.2%\n- Earliest episode (ep1) has 22.4%\n\nCalculating the difference: 19.2 is less than 22.4, not higher by 5.8%.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim refers to an episode titled \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" Looking at the table, I can see that in row index 2 (since counting starts from 0), the romanized title is indeed \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu,\" which translates to \"the proposal out of revenge.\" So this episode is Episode 3.\n\nNext, the claim says it has the 2nd most recent broadcast date. I need to check the broadcast dates of all episodes to see where Episode 3 falls in terms of recency.\n\nLooking at the \"broadcast date\" column:\n\n- Ep1: May 10, 2010\n- Ep2: May 17, 2010\n- Ep3: May 24, 2010\n- Ep4: May 31, 2010\n- Ep5: June 7, 2010\n- Ep6: June 14, 2010\n\nArranging these dates in order from earliest to most recent:\n\nMay 10 < May 17 < May 24 < May 31 < June 7 < June 14.\n\nSo the most recent broadcast date is Ep6 on June 14.

The goal is to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states: \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have 3.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.\" So, I'm looking at two main parts here:\n\n1. The rating for the episode titled \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\"\n2. The rating of the episode that was broadcasted most recently.\n3. Then, checking if the first rating is 3.2% higher than the second.\n\nLet's start by finding each relevant piece of information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Each row represents an episode with details like episode number, title, etc.\n- The columns are: Unnamed: 0 (which seems to be just \"ep x\"), episode title, romanized title, translation, broadcast date, and ratings.\n\nFirstly, I need to find the rating for \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" Scanning through the 'romanized title' column, I see that ep 3 has the romanized title \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu.\" So, looking at its corresponding 'ratings' cell, it's 15.6%.\n\nNext, I need to identify which episode was broadcasted most recently. The 'broadcast date' column lists dates starting from May 10, 2010, and going up to June 14, 2010. So the most recent broadcast is June 14, 2010, which corresponds to ep 6. The rating for this episode is 13.4%.\n\nNow, I need to check if \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (ep 3 with a rating of 15.6%) has a rating that's 3.2% higher than the most recent episode (ep 6 with a rating of 13.4%).\n\nCalculating the difference: 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2%. \n\nThe claim states it should be a 3.2% difference, but according to the table, the actual difference is only 2.2%. Therefore, the claim is not accurate.\n\nTo ensure I didn't make any mistakes, let me double-check:\n\n- Ep 3: 15.6%\n- Most recent ep (ep 6): 13.4%\n- Difference: 15.6 - 13.4 = 2.2%\n\nYes, the difference is indeed 2.2%, which is less than the claimed 3.2%. So, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu,\" we look at row index 2 (since counting starts from 0; ep 1 is index 0, ep 2 is 1, ep 3 is 2) under 'ratings'.\n- For the most recent broadcast date, that's row index 5 (ep 6), and again under 'ratings'.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 2, column 'ratings'\n- Row 5, column 'ratings'\n\nThese are the two data points needed to evaluate the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by comparing the ratings of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" (15.6%) and the most recent episode (13.4%). The difference is 2.2%, which is less than the claimed 3.2%. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two things:\n1. The rating of the episode titled \"suki to ietara iinoni.\"\n2. The lowest rating among all episodes.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying which row corresponds to \"suki to ietara iinoni.\" Scanning through the 'romanized title' column, I see that in row 5 (since counting starts at 0), the romanized title is \"suki to ietara iinoni\" with a rating of 17.4%.\n\nNext, I need to find the episode(s) with the lowest rating. Looking at all the ratings:\n- ep 1: 22.4%\n- ep 2: 19.2%\n- ep 3: 15.6%\n- ep 4: 15.5%\n- ep 5: 17.4%\n- ep 6: 13.4%\n\nThe lowest rating is 13.4%, which belongs to ep 6. So, the claim says that \"suki to ietara iinoni\" has a rating 5.8% higher than this lowest rating.\n\nCalculating the difference: 17.4% - 13.4% = 4%. According to the calculation, the difference is 4%, not 5.8%. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states a 5.8% higher rating when the actual difference is only 4%.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"ratings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
