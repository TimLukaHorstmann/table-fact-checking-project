    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim about West Berkshire Brewery's \"good old boy\" beer having 5 awards between 1995 and 2009 is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are year, beer name, prize, category, and competition. My focus is on rows where the beer name is \"good old boy.\"\n\nI'll scan each row to find entries for \"good old boy.\" Starting from the top:\n\n- 1995: There's a row with \"good old boy\" as the beer name. It won an overall winner prize in the category of beer of the festival at the CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival.\n\nNext, looking through other years:\n- 2002: \"good old boy\" appears again. It got a gold medal for best bitter and also a second reserve champion in the overall category.\n  \nContinuing to check each subsequent year until 2009:\n- In 2005, there's another entry for \"good old boy\" with a silver medal in the best bitter category.\n\nI don't see any other entries beyond these three instances. So, from 1995 to 2009, \"good old boy\" was awarded three times: once in 1995 and twice in 2002, and another time in 2005.\n\nThe claim states that there are five awards between those years. But according to the table, it's only three. Therefore, the claim is incorrect; it should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"beer name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"west berkshire brewery's maggs magnificent mild be its most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what the claim is saying. It claims that West Berkshire Brewery's beer called \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" was their most decorated (i.e., won the most prizes) from 1995 to 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several entries for \"maggs magnificent mild.\" Let me go through each row and count how many times it appears and what kind of prizes it received.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 2003: Gold medal in Mild and Porter category\n- 2005: Gold medal in Mild category, third place overall, another gold medal in Mild at SIBA competition, and a bronze medal in the same competition\n- 2006: Silver medals twice for Mild\n- 2009: Silver medal in category\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Looking back:\n\nIn 2005:\n- Gold medal (Mild) at CAMRA Reading Branch Beer Festival\n- Third place overall at the same festival\n- Another gold medal (Mild) at SIBA South East Region Beer Competition\n- Bronze medal in the same competition\n\nThat's four entries for 2005.\n\nIn 2003:\n- Gold medal in Mild and Porter category.\n\nIn 2006:\n- Silver medal (Mild) at both CAMRA Reading Branch and SIBA National competitions. So two more entries.\n\nIn 2009, looking back, I don't see any entry for \"maggs magnificent mild\" except in 2005 and others. Wait, checking again:\n\nWait, the table shows in 2003: maggs got gold. In 2004: overall winner as beer of the festival at Bracknell. Then 2005 has multiple entries for maggs. 2006 also has two silvers.\n\nSo total entries for \"maggs magnificent mild\" are:\n\n- 2003: 1\n- 2004: 1 (overall winner)\n- 2005: 4\n- 2006: 2\n\nWait, in 2004, the beer is \"maggs magnificent mild\"? Let me check:\n\nLooking at row index 9: year 2004, beer name maggs, prize overall winner, category beer of festival.\n\nYes, that's another entry for maggs.\n\nSo total entries from 1995 to 2009:\n\n- 2003: 1\n- 2004: 1\n- 2005: 4\n- 2006: 2\n\nThat's a total of 8 entries. Now, let me count how many prizes that is.\n\nWait, each row represents a prize or achievement, so \"maggs\" has 8 rows in the table between 1995 and 2009.\n\nNow, checking other beers from West Berkshire Brewery to see if any have more than 8 entries. The main competitors seem to be \"good old boy,\" \"dr hexter's healer,\" and others.\n\nLooking at \"good old boy\":\n- 1995: overall winner\n- 2002: gold medal, second reserve champion (same competition)\n- 2005: silver medal\n\nSo that's three entries. Wait, but in the table, 2002 has two entries for good old boy.\n\nYes, rows 2 and 3 are both for \"good old boy\" in 2002. So total of 3 or 4? Let me recount:\n\n- 1995: row 0\n- 2002: rows 2 and 3 (two entries)\n- 2005: row 7\n\nSo that's four entries for \"good old boy.\"\n\n\"Dr Hexter's Healer\":\nLooking through the table, I see:\n\nRow 4: 2002, dr hexter's healer, gold medal\nRow 6: 2003, same beer, gold\nRow 8: 2005, gold\nRow 10: 2009, silver\n\nSo that's four entries.\n\n\"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" has more entries than the others in this period. Therefore, it seems to be the most decorated.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other beers from West Berkshire Brewery that might have more entries. For example, \"Bracken\" or others?\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 9: 2004, maggs again as overall winner\n\nNo, I think only \"maggs,\" \"good old boy,\" and \"dr hexter's\" are mentioned multiple times.\n\nSo since \"maggs magnificent mild\" appears in eight rows (assuming each row is a separate prize or achievement), it seems to have more wins than the others. Therefore, the claim would be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" from West Berkshire Brewery has numerous entries between 1995 and 2009, indicating multiple awards and recognitions. Comparing this with other beers listed, such as \"good old boy\" and \"dr hexter's healer,\" none surpass the number of achievements for \"maggs magnificent mild.\" Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"beer_name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"west berkshire brewery's dr hexter healer beer win 3 gold medal between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I should check the table for entries related to 'dr hexter healer' and see how many times it won a gold medal within that time frame. \n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and pick out those where the beer name is \"dr hexter's healer\" or similar variants.\n\n1. Row 1 (index 1): Beer is 'dr hexter's healer', prize is 'runner up'. Not a gold medal.\n2. Row 6 (index 6): Beer is 'dr hexter's healer', prize is 'silver medal' in the category 'strong ale'. Again, not a gold.\n3. Row 24 (index 24): The year is 2008, beer name 'dr hexter's healer' wins 'gold medal' for 'best local beer'.\n4. Row 25 (index 25): Year 2009, same beer again gets a gold in 'in category' at the London competition.\nWait, that's two golds so far.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each row with 'dr hexter's healer':\n\n- 1997: Runner up (row 1) \u2192 no medal\n- 2002: Silver medal in strong ale (row 6)\n- 2008: Gold medal for best local beer (row 24)\n- 2009: Two entries. First, gold in 'best local beer' at Reading festival (row 25), and another gold in 'in category' at London competition (row 26). Wait, but the claim is about winning three golds between 1995 and 2009.\n\nSo that's two golds in 2008 and 2009. But wait, in row 25 and 26, it's the same beer in 2009 but different competitions? Let me check:\n\nRow 24: 2008, Reading festival, gold for best local beer.\nRow 25: 2009, Reading festival, gold again for best local beer.\nRow 26: Also 2009, London competition, another gold in 'in category'.\n\nSo that's three gold medals: 2008 (1), 2009 (two). So total of three. \n\nWait, but the claim says \"between 1995 and 2009.\" The years are from 1995 to 2009 inclusive? Let me confirm the table's dates.\n\nThe earliest year is 1995, and the latest is 2009. So yes, all three golds fall within that period.\n\nWait, but in row 24 (index 23), prize is 'gold medal' for category 'best local beer'. Then row 25 (index 24) same year? No, wait no\u2014row 24 is 2008, index starts at 0. Let me recount the indices:\n\nWait, the table has rows from 1995 to 2009. Each row's index is as follows:\n\nRow 0: 1995\nRow 1: 1997\nRow 2: 2002\nRow 3: 2002\nRow 4: 2002\nRow 5: 2002\nRow 6: 2002\nRow 7: 2002 (maybe, but not for this beer)\nWait no, actually each row is a separate entry. Let me list all rows with 'dr hexter's healer':\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1 (index 1): 1997, prize runner up.\n- Row 6 (index 6): 2002, silver medal.\n- Row 24 (index 24): 2008, gold.\n- Row 25 (index 25): 2009, gold.\n- Row 26 (index 26): 2009, gold.\n\nWait no, the rows are:\n\nLooking at the table provided earlier, perhaps I should list all occurrences of 'dr hexter's healer':\n\nRow indexes where beer name is 'dr hexter's healer' or similar:\n\n- index 1: 1997, runner up\n- index 6: 2002, silver medal in strong ale\n- index 24: 2008, gold for best local beer\n- index 25: 2009, gold for best local beer at Reading festival\n- index 26: 2009, another gold in 'in category' at London competition.\n\nWait no, that would be more than three. Or perhaps I'm miscounting the rows.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the table provided earlier, each row is a separate entry. Let me list all entries for 'dr hexter's healer':\n\n- Row 1 (index 1): 1997, runner up.\n- Row 6 (index 6): 2002, silver medal in strong ale.\n- Row 24: 2008, gold in best local beer at Reading festival.\n- Row 25: 2009, gold in best local beer at Reading festival again?\nWait no, let me check the exact rows:\n\nRow indices:\n\nLooking back to the table, perhaps I'm confusing row counts. Let's clarify.\n\nThe initial table is as follows (assuming each entry is a row):\n\nIndex | Year | Beer Name             | Prize      | ...\n0     | 1995 | some beer            | ... \n1     | 1997 | dr hexter's healer   | runner up\n2     | 2002 | another beer         | ...\n3     | 2002 | yet another beer     | ...\n4     | 2002 | dr hexter's          | silver medal (maybe)\nWait no, perhaps each row is a separate entry. Let me list all rows where the beer name includes 'dr hexter's healer':\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices with 'dr hexter's heater' or similar:\n\n- Row 1: 1997, 'dr hexter's heater', runner up\n- Row 6: 2002, 'dr hexter's heater', silver medal in strong ale\n- Then later entries for 2008 and 2009.\n\nWait perhaps the exact rows are:\n\nRow 1 (index 1): beer name is 'dr hexter's heater', prize runner up.\nRow 6 (index 6): same beer, 2002, silver medal.\nThen in 2008: row index 24: 'dr hexter's heater' wins gold.\nIn 2009: two entries for this beer, both winning gold.\n\nSo that's three gold medals between 1995 and 2009. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to collect all relevant cells:\n\nFor each of these rows where 'dr hexter's heater' won a gold medal between 1995 and 2009, we have three instances:\n\n- 2008: row index 24\n- 2009: two entries at indexes 25 and 26.\n\nWait no, perhaps the rows are as follows:\n\nLooking back, let me count each row's index properly. Assuming the table starts with row 0 being 1995.\n\nRow indices:\n\n0: 1995\n1: 1997\n2-3: 2002 entries\n4: 2002\n5: 2002\n6: 2002 (dr hexter's heater)\nThen other years up to 2008 and 2009.\n\nWait, perhaps the exact rows are:\n\nRow 1: 1997, dr hexter's heater, runner up.\nRow 6: 2002, dr hexter's heater, silver.\nRow 24: 2008, dr hexter's heater, gold.\nRow 25: 2009, same beer, gold.\nRow 26: 2009, another entry for the same beer, gold.\n\nThus, three gold medals in 2008 and two in 2009? Wait no, perhaps only one in each year but with multiple entries in the table. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nIn any case, the user wants to collect all rows where 'dr hexter's heater' won a prize (specifically gold) between 1995 and 2009.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For each such row: Year, Beer Name, Prize.\n\nThus, for each of these rows, we have three instances of gold medals.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task, we need to identify all entries where \"dr hexter's heater\" won a prize between 1995 and 2009. Specifically, we are looking for instances where the prize is a gold medal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows**: We will go through each row of the table provided and check if the beer name matches \"dr hexter's heater\" and if the year falls between 1995 and 2009.\n2. **Extract Prize Information**: For each matching entry, we will note the prize awarded. In this case, we are particularly interested in entries where the prize is a gold medal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Assuming 'table' is a list of dictionaries representing each row with keys: Year, Beer Name, Prize\n\nrelevant_entries = []\nfor row in table:\n    beer_name = row['Beer Name']\n    year = row['Year']\n    prize = row['Prize']\n    \n    if beer_name == \"dr hexter's heater\" and 1995 <= year <= 2009:\n        relevant_entries.append({\n            'Year': year,\n            'Beer Name': beer_name,\n            'Prize': prize\n        })\n\n# Output the entries where the prize is gold\ngold_prizes = [entry for entry in relevant_entries if entry['Prize'] == \"Gold\"]\n\nprint(gold_prizes)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Relevant Rows**: We iterate through each row of the table and check if the beer name matches \"dr hexter's heater\" and if the year is within the specified range (1995 to 2009).\n- **Extract Prize Information**: For each relevant entry, we collect information about the prize. If the prize is a gold medal, it is added to the list of gold prizes.\n\n### Output\nThe code will output a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents an entry for \"dr hexter's heater\" that won a gold medal between 1995 and 2009. This includes details such as the year, beer name, and prize.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently gather all necessary information from the table and focus only on the relevant data points, providing a clear and concise solution to the problem.",

The claim says that \"west berkshire brewery 's good old boy beer do not win a single award between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any entries in the table where the beer name is \"good old boy\" within those years. Looking at the table:\n\n- In 1995, there's an entry for \"good old boy\" with an overall winner prize. So that's a win.\n- Then in 2002, there are two entries: one for gold medal and another for second reserve champion. Both of these are awards.\n- Also in 2005, \"good old boy\" gets a silver medal.\n\nSo, the beer did win multiple times between 1995 and 2009. Therefore, the claim that it didn't win any awards is false.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each occurrence of \"good old boy\" with their respective years and prizes.

The claim states that \"West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter Healer beer has only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify all entries in the table related to \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" and check their prizes during the specified years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1997 (row index 1), Dr. Hexter's Healer is a runner-up, which isn't a silver medal.\n- From 2002 onwards, I see multiple entries for Dr. Hexter's Healer:\n  - Row 6: Silver medal in the strong ale category at SIBA competition.\n  - Rows 8, 9, etc., but focusing on \"Dr Hexter's Healer\" only.\n\nWait, actually, looking again:\n\n- In row index 1 (year 1997), it's a runner-up, so not silver.\n- In row index 6 (2002), it's a silver medal in strong ale category. So that's one silver.\n- Then, in rows 28 and 29 for 2008 and 2009:\n  - Row 28: Gold medal as best local beer in Reading festival.\n  - Row 30: Another gold medal in the London competition.\n\nSo Dr Hexter's Healer received a silver medal in 2002, but also gold medals in 2008 and 2009. Therefore, the claim that it only received a silver medal is false because there are instances where it got gold medals.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Dr Hexter's Healer received multiple medals including silver and gold between 1995 and 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 28, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 30, \"column_name\": \"prize\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"West Berkshire Brewery's Maggs Magnificent Mild have won a gold medal every single instance in which it wins a prize between 1995 and 2009.\"\n\nFirst, I'll check if all instances where \"Maggs Magnificent Mild\" received a prize resulted in a gold medal. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 2003: Gold Medal (mild and porter category)\n- 2004: Overall Winner (beer of the festival) \u2014 this is a different award, but still a prize.\n- 2005: Gold Medal (mild), Bronze Medal (overall) \u2014 here's where it gets tricky. While it won gold in mild, it also received bronze overall. The claim says every time it won a prize, it was a gold medal.\n\nSince in 2005, Maggs Magnificent Mild won both a gold and a bronze medal, that means not all prizes were gold. Therefore, the claim isn't fully supported because there's at least one instance where it didn't get a gold medal when it won a prize.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"prize\"},\n     {\"row_10\", \"column_name\": \"prize\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"west berkshire brewery's maggs magnificent mild 2 time receive a bronze award at the siba national beer competition between 1995 and 2005.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be verified:\n- The brewer is west berkshire brewery.\n- The beer is maggs magnificent mild.\n- It received two bronze awards.\n- These were awarded at the SIBA National Beer Competition.\n- The time period for these awards is between 1995 and 2005.\n\nLooking through the table, I'm checking each row to see if it meets all these criteria.\n\nStarting with the beer name: \"maggs magnificent mild\" appears in multiple rows. Let me list those out:\nRow indices where 'beer name' is 'maggs magnificent mild':\n- 4 (2002)\n- 8 (2003)\n- 12 (2005)\n- 16 (2006)\n- 24 (2008)\nWait, the table goes up to row index 29. Let me double-check:\n\nRow indices for maggs magnificent mild:\nLooking through each row, I see it appears in rows:\n4: 2002\n8: 2003\n12: 2005\n16: 2006 (twice)\n24: 2008\n\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nRow indices where beer name is maggs magnificent mild:\n- Row 4 (2002): yes.\n- Row 8 (2003): yes.\n- Row 12 (2005): yes.\n- Row 16: two entries in 2006, both under camra reading branch and siba national. So row 16 is for 2006?\nWait, the table has rows from 1995 up to 2009.\n\nSo maggs magnificent mild appears multiple times, but I need to focus on entries between 1995 and 2005.\n\nLooking at each entry:\n- Row 4: year 2002\n- Row 8: year 2003\n- Row 12: year 2005\nSo these are within the time frame of 1995 to 2005.\n\nNow, for each of these entries, I need to check:\n- Competition is SIBA National Beer Competition.\n- Prize is bronze medal.\n\nLooking at row 4 (year 2002):\nCompetition: siba south east region beer competition\nPrize: gold medal\nSo not the national one and not bronze. So this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 8 (2003):\nCompetition: siba national beer competition\nPrize: gold medal\nAgain, prize is gold, not bronze. So no.\n\nRow 12 (2005):\nCompetition: camra reading branch beer festival and siba south east region beer competition. Wait, looking at the table, row 12 has two competitions? Or perhaps it's one row with multiple entries?\n\nWait, actually each row is a separate entry. So for maggs magnificent mild in 2005:\nRow 12: prize is gold medal, category mild and porter, competition siba south east region beer competition.\nRow 13: prize is bronze medal, overall, same competition.\n\nSo in 2005, it got a gold and a bronze. The bronze is at the siba south east region, not national. So that's one bronze but not national.\n\nLooking further, any other entries for maggs magnificent mild between 1995-2005 with SIBA National and bronze?\n\nRow 8: prize is gold in SIBA National.\nRow 12: gold in siba south east region.\nRow 13: bronze in same competition.\n\nNo entries where the competition is SIBA National Beer Competition and prize is bronze between 1995-2005. So, no two bronzes at SIBA National in that period.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there are no instances of maggs magnificent mild receiving a bronze award at SIBA National between those years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"Competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Prize\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"Year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
