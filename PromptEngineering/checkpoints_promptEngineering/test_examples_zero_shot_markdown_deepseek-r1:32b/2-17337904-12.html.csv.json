Its royal house is also a \"-\", so that's good.\n- Next, state 'song' is found at row index 13. Here again, the royal house is a dash.\n- The state 'wey' is in row index 14.

The claim says: \"li be the name for both the duke of song and the marquis of wey.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. So, the claim mentions two people named 'li' who hold different titles in their respective states.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find entries where the name is 'li'. Let's scan the 'name' column:\n\n- Row 13: state = song, type = sovereign, name = li, title = duke.\n- Row 14: state = wey, type = sovereign, name = li, title = marquis.\n\nSo there are two entries where the name is 'li'. \n\nNext, I need to check their titles. For Song, the title is 'duke', and for Wey, it's 'marquis'. That matches exactly what the claim states: one is a duke under Song, and the other is a marquis under Wey.\n\nI should also make sure that there are no other entries with name 'li' or any discrepancies.

It states that Wu is not the Duke of Chen and also not the Duke of Lu. So, my goal is to check if Wu holds the title of Duke for either of these two states.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different state with details about the sovereign's name, type, title, and royal house. The relevant columns here are \"state\", \"name\" (sovereign), and \"title\".\n\nI'll start by identifying all the rows where the \"name\" is Wu because the claim specifically mentions Wu. Scanning through the table:\n\n1. Row 0: State Cai, Name Wu, Title Marquis.\n2. Row 9: State Qi, Name Wu, Title Duke.\n\nSo there are two instances of Wu in the table. Now I need to check their titles and corresponding states to see if either is a Duke of Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking at row 0: The state is Cai, title is Marquis. This doesn't relate to Chen or Lu, so it's irrelevant for this claim.\n\nRow 9: State Qi, Name Wu, Title Duke. Here, Wu is the Duke of Qi, not Chen or Lu. \n\nNext, I need to check if there are any Dukes in the states Chen and Lu. \n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- For state Chen (row 2): The name is You, title Duke.\n- For state Lu (row 7): The name is Shen, title Duke.\n\nNeither of these Dukes is named Wu.

The claim says: \"the royal house be available for the state cao, chen, song, wey, and yan.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: state, type, name, title, and royal house. My task is to check each of these states mentioned in the claim (cao, chen, song, wey, yan) and see if their corresponding 'royal house' cells are filled or not.\n\nLet me go through each state one by one.\n\nStarting with Cao: I'll search for \"cao\" in the state column. Looking at the table, row 1 has state cao. The royal house for that row is a dash (\"-\"), which usually means it's empty or unavailable. So, no royal house listed here.\n\nNext up is Chen. Scanning through the states, Chen is in row 2. Checking the 'royal house' column for that row, I see another dash. That indicates the royal house isn't available either.\n\nMoving on to Song: Looking at the table, Song is in row 14. The 'royal house' here is also a dash. So no royal house listed for Song.\n\nThen there's Wey (or Wei). In the table, Wey is in row 15. Checking the 'royal house' column again, it's a dash. No royal house available for Wey either.\n\nLastly, Yan: I'll check for that state. Row 16 has Yan as the state, and the 'royal house' column is another dash. So, no royal house listed here as well.\n\nPutting this all together, each of the states mentioned in the claim (Cao, Chen, Song, Wey, Yan) doesn't have a royal house listed; they're marked with a dash. Therefore, the claim that their royal houses are available is false because none of them have an entry in that column. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, I'll determine the answer as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that each of the specified states has an available royal house.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It seems a bit unclear due to possible grammar issues, but I think it's asking if \"Li\" isn't the name exclusively associated with both the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey. In other words, is there more than one person named Li holding these titles?\n\nLooking at the table, let me identify all entries where the 'name' column is 'li'. I'll go through each row:\n\n1. The first few rows don't have 'li' as the name.\n2. Then, in row 13 (if we start counting from 0), I see:\n   - state: song\n   - type: sovereign\n   - name: li\n   - title: duke\n   - royal house: -\n\nSo this is one instance where Li is the Duke of Song.\n\nContinuing further down, in row 14:\n- state: wey\n- type: sovereign\n- name: li\n- title: marquis\n- royal house: -\n\nHere's another entry with 'li' as the name, this time as the Marquis of Wey.\n\nNow, checking if there are any other rows where the name is 'li'. I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: wu\nRow 1: yi\nRow 2: you\nRow 3: xiong yan the elder\nRow 4: xiong yong\nRow 5: jing\nRow 6: xi\nRow 7: shen\nRow 8: wu\nRow 9: marquis (name is missing, but likely not 'li')\nRow 10: gongbo\nRow 11: qin zhong\n\nSo only rows 13 and 14 have the name 'li'.\n\nThe claim suggests that Li isn't exclusively the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey. But from the table, it appears that these are the only two instances where the name is Li.\n\nWait a minute\u2014does \"only\" in the claim mean that there's more than one person with those titles? Or does it mean that Li holds both titles?\n\nLooking back at the claim: \"li be not the name for only the duke of song and the marquis of wey\". It seems to suggest that Li isn't solely the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey; perhaps implying there's another person or more contexts where 'li' is used.\n\nBut in the table, 'li' appears exactly twice: once as Duke of Song and once as Marquis of Wey. So if the claim is saying that 'li' isn't exclusively for these two roles (i.e., maybe there are other roles), but according to the data, these are the only two.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. The claim might mean that 'li' is not only used as Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey\u2014implying there's more than those two entries. But in our table, there are exactly two 'li's with those titles. So if the claim says that 'li' isn't exclusively for these roles (i.e., it's used elsewhere too), but in reality, it's only used here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misphrased and meant to say that 'li' is not solely the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey, implying perhaps there are more titles. But the table doesn't show that; 'li' holds exactly those two titles.\n\nSo, according to the data, Li is only the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey, appearing in rows 13 and 14. Therefore, the claim that \"Li is not the name for only these roles\" would be FALSE because there are no other instances of 'li' elsewhere. The claim suggests that 'li' isn't exclusively those two roles, but in reality, those are the only ones present.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's break it down:\n\nThe claim is: \"Li be not the name for only the Duke of Song and the Marquis of Wey.\"\n\nWhich could mean that Li is not just used as those two titles; perhaps implying there are more uses. But in our table, 'li' is used twice with these specific titles. So if the claim is suggesting that 'li' isn't exclusively these roles (i.e., it's also elsewhere), but in reality, 'li' only appears here.\n\nTherefore, since the table shows exactly two instances of 'li' as those roles and no others, the claim would be FALSE because 'li' is indeed only used for those two titles. The claim says that Li isn't only for these roles, but according to the data, it's only for these roles.\n</think>\n\nThe claim suggests that \"Li\" isn't exclusively the Duke of Song and Marquis of Wey.

It says that Wu is the Duke of either Chen or Lu. So, I'm looking for entries where the name is Wu and the title is Duke in the states Chen or Lu.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row has state 'cai', name 'wu', title 'marquis'.

So that's a Duke in Chen, but not Wu.\n- Next rows for Chu: no, names are Xiong Yan and Xiong Yong, titles viscount. Not relevant.\n- Jin has two entries: both have name 'jing' and 'xi', title marquis. No Wu there.\n- Lu has name 'shen', title duke. Again, not Wu.\n- Qi has 'wu' as the name, but title is Duke? Let me check. Wait, state is 'qi', type sovereign, name 'wu', title 'duke'. So here's a Wu who's a Duke in Qi. But the claim is about Chen or Lu. So that's not matching.\n- Qin entries: no Wu there.\n- Song and wey have 'li' as names, not relevant.\n- Yan has 'hui', so no.\n\nWait, did I miss anything?

So here's a Wu who is a Duke in Qi, but the claim is about Chen or Lu.\n\nSo, for Chen and Lu, their Dukes are You and Shen respectively. There's no entry where Wu is the Duke of Chen or Lu. Therefore, the claim is false because Wu isn't listed as the Duke for those states.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"wu be the duke of both chen or lu\" is FALSE based on the table data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Entries:** Look for entries where 'name' is 'wu' and 'title' is 'duke'.\n2. **Check Chen State:** For state 'chen', name is 'you', title 'duke'. Not Wu.\n3. **Check Lu State:** For state 'lu', name is 'shen', title 'duke'. Not Wu.\n4. **Other Entries:** Only in Qi does 'wu' have the title 'duke', but not in Chen or Lu.\n\n**Answer:**\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"title\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim states: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin, which do not have either jing and xi.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this sentence. It seems a bit complex, so let me try to rephrase it for clarity. The main parts are:\n\n1. The royal house is not \"ji\" for the state \"jin.\"\n2. State \"jin\" does not have either \"jing\" or \"xi.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't make much sense because the table shows that state \"jin\" actually has both \"jing\" and \"xi.\" Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For state \"jin,\" there are two entries:\n  - Name: jing, Title: marquis\n  - Name: xi, Title: marquis\n\nSo, the royal house for these entries is listed as \"ji.\" The claim says that the royal house should not be \"ji\" for state \"jin.\" But according to the table, it is. That might make the first part of the claim FALSE.\n\nBut then the second part says that state \"jin\" does not have either \"jing\" or \"xi.\" Wait, no\u2014the wording seems a bit off. The original claim says: \"...which do not have either jing and xi.\" Hmm, perhaps it's meant to say that the royal house is not ji because state jin doesn't have jing and xi? But in reality, jin does have both.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the claim again carefully: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin, which do not have either jing and xi.\" So it's saying that because state jin doesn't have jing or xi, their royal house is not ji. But in reality, state jin does have both jing and xi as names, so the premise of the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is structured differently: \"the royal house be not ji for the state jin which do not have either jing and xi.\" So it's saying that for state jin, their royal house isn't ji because they don't have jing or xi. But in reality, state jin does have both jing and xi, so this reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it methodically.\n\nFirst, check if the royal house for state \"jin\" is not \"ji.\" Looking at the table:\n\n- For state \"jin,\" there are two rows:\n  - Row index 5: name jing, type sovereign, title marquis, royal house ji\n  - Row index 6: name xi, type sovereign, title marquis, royal house ji\n\nSo both entries for state jin have the royal house as \"ji.\" Therefore, the claim that their royal house is not ji is FALSE.\n\nNext, the second part says that state jin does not have either jing or xi. But according to the table, it does have both. So this part of the claim is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the structure. Maybe the claim is trying to say that for state jin, which does not have either jing or xi, their royal house isn't ji. But since state jin does have jing and xi, the condition doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a conditional: if state jin didn't have jing and xi, then their royal house wouldn't be ji. But that's not what the claim is stating; it's making an assertion about state jin as it is.\n\nPutting it all together, since both parts of the claim are incorrect\u2014state jin does have jing and xi, and their royal house is ji\u2014the entire claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim asserts two things: that the royal house for state Jin isn't \"ji\" and that Jin doesn't have individuals named Jing or Xi. However, the table shows that Jin's royal house is indeed \"ji\" and includes both Jing and Xi.\n\n**Answer:**  \n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_6\", \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_5\", \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_6\", \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nBut since the correct JSON should have row indices as integers, let me adjust:\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"royal house\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}",
