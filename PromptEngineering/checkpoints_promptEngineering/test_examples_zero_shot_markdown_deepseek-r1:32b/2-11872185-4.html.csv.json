    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"no lifetime india distributor share be give earlier than 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the table to understand what each column represents. The columns are: rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. The claim mentions that no shares were given before 2009, so I should focus on the 'year' and 'lifetime india distributor share' columns.\n\nLooking at the years in the table, they range from 2009 to 2013. The earliest year is 2009 for the movie \"3 idiots.\" However, the claim is about whether any shares were given earlier than 2009. That means I need to check if there are any movies with a year prior to 2009 that have a non-zero distributor share.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Chennai Express (2013): Share is 114,25,00000.\n2. Ek Tha Tiger (2012): Share is 106,00,00000.\n3. 3 Idiots (2009): Share is 99,02,00000.\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013): Share is 91,00,00000.\n5. Dabangg 2 (2012): Share is 84,00,00000.\n6. Bodyguard (2011): Share is 79,49,00000.\n7. Dabangg (2010): Share is 76,84,00000.\n8. Rowdy Rathore (2012): Share is 74,00,00000.\n9. Agneepath (2012): Share is 65,53,00000.\n10. Ready (2011): Share is 64,58,00000.\n\nAll the years are from 2009 onwards. There's no movie in the table with a year before 2009. The earliest is 2009, and all have some distributor share numbers listed. \n\nBut wait, the claim says \"no shares were given earlier than 2009.\" Since all entries are from 2009 or later, there's no data showing any shares before that. Therefore, based on this table, the claim holds true because there are no entries with a year prior to 2009 that have a distributor share.\n\nI should also check if \"lifetime india distributor share\" could imply something else, but it seems straightforward as the numbers provided are for each respective movie's performance up to now. So all shares listed are from 2009 onwards, supporting the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any movies released before 2009 with a lifetime India distributor share, so the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lifetime india distributor share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"lifetime india share earlier than 2009 be 0\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that for movies released before 2009, their lifetime India distributor share should be zero. So, my goal is to check if all movies with a year earlier than 2009 have a 'lifetime india distributor share' of zero.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and identify which ones were released before 2009. The years are listed in the \"year\" column:\n\n1. Chennai Express (2013)\n2. Ek Tha Tiger (2012)\n3. 3 Idiots (2009)\n4. Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013)\n5. Dabangg 2 (2012)\n6. Bodyguard (2011)\n7. Dabangg (2010)\n8. Rowdy Rathore (2012)\n9. Agneepath (2012)\n10. Ready (2011)\n\nI notice that the earliest year in the table is 2009 for \"3 Idiots.\" The claim refers to movies released earlier than 2009, so any movie with a year less than 2009 should be considered. However, looking at all the rows, none of them have a year before 2009. The earliest is exactly 2009.\n\nSince there are no movies in the table released before 2009, I need to consider what this means for the claim. The claim states that such movies should have a lifetime India share of zero. But since there's no data available for years prior to 2009 in this table, we can't confirm or deny the claim based on the given information.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's referring to any movie in general, not just those listed. However, the problem instructs us to only consider the provided table. Therefore, within the scope of this table, there are no movies released before 2009. \n\nIf the claim is that all movies earlier than 2009 have a lifetime share of zero, and since we don't have any such entries here, does that mean the claim is TRUE because there's nothing contradicting it? Or is it FALSE because we can't verify it?\n\nI think in this context, if the table doesn't contain any movies from before 2009, we cannot assert the claim as TRUE. The absence of data means we don't have evidence to support or refute the claim. Therefore, since there are no rows with a year earlier than 2009, the relevant cells to check for their 'lifetime india distributor share' do not exist in this table.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the claim cannot be verified as TRUE because there's no data point from before 2009. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table doesn't contain any movies released before 2009, so we can't confirm if their lifetime India share was zero.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 2009 ek tha tiger be first release\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that in the year 2009, the movie \"ek tha tiger\" was the first release. That means it should have been released before any other movies listed in 2009 or earlier years, right? Or at least in 2009, it was the first one out.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime India distributor share. The relevant information here is the \"year\" column for each movie to check when they were released.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find movies released in 2009. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. Rank 1: Chennai Express, Year 2013\n2. Rank 2: Ek Tha Tiger, Year 2012\n3. Rank 3: 3 Idiots, Year 2009\n4. Rank 4: Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, Year 2013\n5. Rank 5: Dabangg 2, Year 2012\n6. Rank 6: Bodyguard, Year 2011\n7. Rank 7: Dabangg, Year 2010\n8. Rank 8: Rowdy Rathore, Year 2012\n9. Rank 9: Agneepath, Year 2012\n10. Rank 10: Ready, Year 2011\n\nFrom this, I notice that \"3 Idiots\" is the only movie listed with a release year of 2009. Ek Tha Tiger was released in 2012, according to the table.\n\nThe claim says that in 2009, ek tha tiger was first released. But based on the table, \"ek tha tiger\" was actually released in 2012, not 2009. So that's a discrepancy right there.\n\nAdditionally, looking at all the rows, the only movie from 2009 is \"3 Idiots.\" Therefore, if we're considering releases within 2009, \"3 Idiots\" would be the first release of that year in this table. Since ek tha tiger wasn't even released until 2012, it can't have been the first release in 2009.\n\nSo putting this together: The claim incorrectly states both the year and the movie's release details. Ek Tha Tiger was not released in 2009; instead, it came out three years later. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"ek tha tiger\" was first released in 2009. According to the table, \"ek tha tiger\" has a release year of 2012 and is ranked second. The only movie from 2009 listed is \"3 Idiots,\" which would be the first release for that year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"agneepath be release first in 2010\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are rank, movie, year, studio(s), and lifetime india distributor share. So, for each movie, there's a release year listed in the \"year\" column.\n\nThe claim is about \"agneepath.\" Let me find where \"agneepath\" appears in the table. Scanning through the movies, I see it's listed at row index 8 (since counting starts from 0). So that's row index 9 if we consider the header, but in zero-based indexing used here, it's row 8.\n\nLooking at row 8, the movie is \"agneepath,\" and the year is 2012. The claim says it was released first in 2010. So according to the table, agneepath was released in 2012, not 2010. Therefore, the claim doesn't match the information in the table.\n\nI should also check if there's any other entry for \"agneepath\" in a different year, but looking through the table, it only appears once at row 8 with the year 2012. There are no duplicates or other entries for this movie.\n\nSo, based on the relevant cell (row index 8, column \"year\"), which shows the release year as 2012, the claim that it was released in 2010 is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"agneepath\" was released first in 2010. Checking the table, agneepath's release year is listed as 2012. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
