    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in leo palace resort soccer field, yona\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. The claim states that a specific event\u2014the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier\u2014was played at a particular venue called Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona.\n\nNext, I'll look through the table to see if there are any entries related to the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier. Scanning the \"competition\" column, I notice two rows that mention this competition:\n\n- Row 14: Date 20 July 2012, Venue Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona, Score 4-1, Result 5-1, Competition 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier.\n- Row 15: Date 20 July 2012, Venue same as above, Score 5-1, Result 5-1, Same competition.\n\nThese two rows both mention the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier and specify that it was held at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona. The dates are both on July 20, 2012, which is a bit earlier than 2013, but considering qualifiers often take place before the main event, this makes sense.\n\nSince the table clearly shows that the 2013 qualifier was indeed played at the specified venue, the claim appears to be accurate. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are rows 14 and 15 in the competition column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"competition\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the 2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier be play in rizai memorial stadium, manila\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It's saying that the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier was held at Rizal Memorial Stadium in Manila.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row to find any entries related to the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup qualifier and see where they were played.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first few rows are about different years and competitions, not relevant.\n- Then I see a row on 20 July 2012 at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field, Yona. The competition is listed as \"2013 eaff east asian cup qualifier\". The venue here is Yona, so that doesn't match the claim.\n\nContinuing down:\n- Another row on 20 July 2012 same place and competition.\n- Then a row on 25 September 2012 at Rizal Memorial Stadium, Manila. The competition here is \"2012 philippine peace cup\", not the EAFF qualifier.\n\nSo in the table, the 2013 EAFF qualifiers were played at Leo Palace Resort Soccer Field in Yona, and Rizal was used for a different competition in 2012.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the 2013 qualifier was held at Rizal Memorial Stadium is FALSE. There are no rows where both the competition is 2013 EAFF qualifier and venue is Rizal.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
