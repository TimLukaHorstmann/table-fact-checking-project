    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"4 of usui's fight end before the 5-minute period be up\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that four of Usui's fights ended before the 5-minute mark. So, we're looking for rows in the table where the fighter (Usui) has a fight that ended before the full 5 minutes were up. The relevant columns here would be 'time' since it indicates how long each fight lasted.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that there's a column named 'res', which probably stands for result, and then other details like 'record', 'opponent', etc. However, the user hasn't specified whether Usui is the one in the 'res' column or if he's listed under 'opponent'. Since the claim refers to \"usui's fight,\" I assume that each row represents a fight involving Usui as either the fighter or the opponent.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, the table doesn't have a separate column for the fighter; it seems all entries are from Usui's perspective. So each row is about a fight where Usui was involved. The 'res' column shows whether he won, lost, or drew against an opponent.\n\nNow, focusing on the 'time' column: most of the fights went the full 5 minutes, as indicated by \"5:00\". However, there are a few exceptions:\n\n1. Row 12 (index starting at 0): Time is 4:51\n2. Row 13: Time is 2:38\n3. Row 16: Time is 4:58\n4. Row 19: Time is 2:06\n\nSo, these four fights ended before the 5-minute mark. Each of these rows has a 'time' value less than 5:00.\n\nNext, I need to check if all these entries are indeed Usui's fights. Since each row represents a fight involving Usui (as per the table structure), and the claim is about four of his fights ending early, these four entries support the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"4 of usui's fight end before the 5-minute period be up\" is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that four of Usui's fights ended before the 5-minute mark. These are identified by their time entries being less than 5:00 in the 'time' column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"hayate usui be only 1 time defeat in round 3\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I should look for entries where the fighter is Hayate Usui and check his outcomes in round 3 matches.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- The first row shows a loss against Issei Tamura with res as \"loss\", opponent \"issei tamura\", event \"shooto\", round 2.\n- Second row: another loss, but round is 3. Opponent is Hiroshi Nakamura. So this is a defeat in round 3.\n\nI'll check all other rows to see if there are any more losses for Hayate Usui specifically in round 3. \n\nLooking through the rest of the table:\n\n- Other rows have res as \"win\", \"draw\", or \"loss\" but none mention \"hayate usui\". The opponents listed don't include his name, so I can infer that this second row is the only defeat for him in round 3.\n\nTherefore, the claim states he was defeated once in round 3, which matches the table. Hence, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n     {\"row__index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the defeat by a ko do not occur in the same tournament as the drawn match.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. A \"defeat by KO\" refers to a loss where the outcome was via knockout (ko). A \"drawn match\" is when the result is a draw instead of a win or loss.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find all instances where the method of defeat is KO and see if any of them occurred in the same event as a drawn match.\n\nLet me go through each row to identify these cases.\n\n1. The first few rows are losses, wins, etc., but looking for 'ko' as the method. \n2. Scanning down, I find at row 14: \"ko (punch)\" which is a loss by KO against Takeshi Inoue in the shooto event.\n3. Now, check if there's any drawn match in the same event. The only draw is in row 8: opponent Ed Newalu, method 'draw', event 'pip - east vs west'.\n\nSo, the KO loss happened in the shooto event (row 14), and the draw was in a different event called pip - east vs west (row 8). Since they are in different events, the claim holds true because the defeat by KO didn't occur in the same tournament as the drawn match.\n\nI don't see any other KO defeats or draws that would contradict this. Therefore, the relevant cells are row 14 for the KO loss and row 8 for the draw.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"usui defeat daisuke ishizawa more convincingly than he defeat manabu inoue\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant rows for both Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue. Looking at the table:\n\n1. For Daisuke Ishizawa:\n   - The row where \"opponent\" is \"daisuke ishizawa\" is found in row 5 (index starting from 0? Wait, no, let me count: rows start at index 0 for the first data row after headers). Let's see:\n\nRows are:\n- Row 0: loss vs tamura\n- Row 1: loss vs nakamura\n- Row 2: win vs kumazawa\n- Row 3: win vs kasuya\n- Row 4: win vs ishizawa (opponent column)\nSo row 4 is the relevant one for Daisuke.\n\nIn this row, the method is \"decision (unanimous)\", and the record before was 8-6-1. The time is 5:00.\n\n2. For Manabu Inoue:\n   - Looking through each row's opponent column, I find \"manabu inoue\" at row 9.\n\nRow 9: win vs manabu inoue. Method is \"decision (majority)\", record before was 5-5. The time is also 5:00.\n\nNow, the claim says Usui defeated Daisuke more convincingly than Manabu. So I need to compare how convincing each victory was. The method column indicates the type of decision. Unanimous decisions are considered more convincing than majority because all judges agreed, whereas a majority means at least two out of three agreed.\n\nIn row 4 (Daisuke), it's a unanimous decision. In row 9 (Manabu), it's a majority decision. So yes, the defeat against Daisuke was more convincing because it was a unanimous decision compared to a majority for Manabu.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim that needs to be verified against this table. The task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim again: \"3 of usui's wins are by majority decision.\" Hmm, wait, actually the claim says \"3 of usui  's win be by majority decision.\" So, it's about how many of Usui's victories were decided by a majority decision. \n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a fight with details like result (win/loss/draw), record, opponent, method, event, round, and time. The relevant columns here are \"result\" to check if it's a win, \"method\" to see how the win was achieved, and possibly the fighter's name, though I notice that the table doesn't explicitly mention Usui in any row. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo or maybe the table refers to fights by someone named Usui? Alternatively, could it be that all these rows are about Usui's fights?\n\nWait, looking at the \"opponent\" column, none of them say Usui. So perhaps the claim is referring to a fighter named Usui whose wins we need to count from this table. But in the given data, I don't see any row where the opponent is Usui; instead, all opponents are different names like Issei Tamura, Hiroshi Nakamura, etc. Alternatively, maybe the rows represent fights that Usui participated in as the fighter, not as the opponent. Because the \"res\" column shows whether it's a loss or win for Usui.\n\nSo, assuming this table is about Usui's fight record, each row represents one of his fights, with \"res\" indicating if he won or lost. Now, I need to count how many times he won by majority decision.\n\nLooking at the \"method\" column, entries like \"decision (unanimous)\" and \"decision (majority)\" are present. The claim says that 3 of his wins were by majority decision. So, I'll go through each row where the result is a win and check the method.\n\nLet's list out all the wins:\n\n1. Row 2: Win vs Shinya Kumazawa, method \"decision (unanimous)\"\n2. Row 3: Win vs Sakae Kasuya, method \"decision (majority)\" \u2192 This counts.\n3. Row 4: Win vs Daisuke Ishizawa, method \"decision (unanimous)\"\n4. Row 6: Win vs Eiji Murayama, method \"decision (unanimous)\"\n5. Row 7: Win vs Hiroki Kita, method \"decision (unanimous)\"\n6. Row 9: Win vs Manabu Inoue, method \"decision (majority)\" \u2192 This counts.\n7. Row 10: The record is 4-5, result is a win? Wait, the row shows \"win\" with record 4-5? That seems odd because usually the record increases on wins. But regardless, the method here is \"decision (unanimous)\".\n8. Wait, actually looking again at each row:\n\nRow indices in markdown tables start from 0.\n\nLet me list all rows where \"res\" is 'win':\n\nRow index 2: Win vs Shinya Kumazawa \u2192 method unanimous\nRow index 3: Win vs Sakae Kasuya \u2192 method majority (count as 1)\nRow index 4: Win vs Daisuke Isizawa \u2192 method unanimous\nRow index 6: Win vs Eiji Murayama \u2192 method unanimous\nRow index 7: Win vs Hiroki Kita \u2192 method unanimous\nRow index 9: Win vs Manabu Inoue \u2192 method majority (count as 2)\nRow index 10: Record is 4-5, but result is 'win'? Wait, that might be a typo because the record should reflect the outcome. Maybe it's a mistake in the table. But regardless, let's check if it's a win and the method.\n\nWait, row index 9 is \"res\": \"win\", method: decision (majority) \u2192 count as third?\nRow 12? Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me go through each row:\n\nLooking at the table provided by the user, let's list all rows where 'res' is 'win':\n\n- Row 0: res=Loss\n- Row 1: Loss\n- Row 2: Win (method unanimous)\n- Row 3: Win (method majority) \u2192 count 1\n- Row 4: Win (unanimous)\n- Row 5: Loss\n- Row 6: Win (unanimous)\n- Row 7: Win (unanimous)\n- Row 8: Draw? No, 'res' is draw, so not a win.\n- Row 9: res=win, method=majority \u2192 count 2\n- Row 10: res=win, but method is \"decision (unanimous)\"?\nWait, in the user's table, row index 9 has res=win and method=majority. Then, looking further down:\n\nRow index 10: res=win? Wait no, let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me list all rows where 'res' is 'win':\n\n- Row index 2: Win vs Shinya Kumazawa \u2192 method unanimous\n- Row index 3: Win vs Sakae Kasuya \u2192 majority (count 1)\n- Row index 4: Win vs Daisuke Isizawa \u2192 unanimous\n- Row index 6: Win vs Eiji Murayama \u2192 method? Looking at the user's table, row 6 is res=win, method=\"decision (unanimous)\"?\nWait no, in the initial table provided by the user:\n\nThe rows are as follows:\n\n0: res=Loss, method=...\n1: Loss\n2: Win vs Shinya Kumazawa, method=decision (unanimous)\n3: Win vs Sakae Kasuya, method=decision (majority)\n4: Win vs Daisuke Isizawa, method=decision (unanimous)\n5: res=Loss\n6: Win vs Eiji Murayama, method=decision (unanimous)\n7: Win vs Hiroki Kita, method=decision (unanimous)\n8: Draw\n9: res=win vs Manabu Inoue, method=decision (majority) \u2192 count 2\n10: res=win vs [opponent], method=decision (unanimous)?\nWait no, in the user's table, row index 9 is res=win with method=majority.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow indices and their methods:\n\n- Row 3: majority \u2192 1\n- Row 9: majority \u2192 2\n\nWait, only two wins by majority. So the claim says three. Therefore, it should be FALSE.\n\nWait, did I miss any other rows? Let me check each row carefully:\n\nLooking through all rows where 'res' is 'win':\n\nRow 2: method=unanimous \u2192 no\nRow 3: method=majority \u2192 yes (1)\nRow 4: method=unanimous \u2192 no\nRow 6: method=unanimous \u2192 no\nRow 7: method=unanimous \u2192 no\nRow 9: method=majority \u2192 yes (2)\n\nSo only two wins by majority.

Therefore, without any relevant data supporting or contradicting the claim, it's impossible to verify it based on the provided information.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Looking at the markdown:\n\nAfter the draw row (row index 8), next rows are:\n\n| loss   | 3 -5      | Katsunori Kikuno     | Decision                      | shooto              |       2  | 4:51    |\n| win    | 2 -2      | Masakazu Iwata        | Decision                      | shooto              |       2  | 4:58    |\n| loss   | 2 -3      | Yukiya Yamamoto       | Decision                      | Rizin                |       2  | 5:00    |\n\nSo, row index 12 has time 4:51\n\nRow index 13 has time 4:58\n\nRow index 14:5:00\n\nSo the relevant rows are:\n\n- Row 12 (index 12): time 4:51\n\n- Row 13 (index13): time 4:58\n\nThese times are less than 5:00, so any fight with these durations would have ended before the 5-minute period.\n\nBut wait, does the claim refer to Usui's fights? The table doesn't specify whose fights these are. Wait, looking at the 'opponent' column, perhaps all these are Usui's fights, as the opponents are listed.\n\nAssuming that all these rows are about Usui's fights, then since there are two instances where time is less than 5:00 (4:51 and 4:58), the claim that none ended before 5 minutes is FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are row indices 12 and 13 in the 'time' column.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that two of Usui's fights ended before the 5-minute mark. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 of usui's win be by majority decision\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check if there are any entries in the table where the opponent is named 'usui'. Looking through the 'opponent' column:\n\n- The opponents listed are: issei tamura, hiroshi nakamura, shinya kumazawa, sakae kasuya, daisuke ishizawa, shintaro ishiwatari, eiji murayama, hiroki kita, ed newalu, manabu inoue, michihisa asano, akitoshi tamura, naosuke mizoguchi, takeshi inoue, seigi fujioka, takeshi matsushita, keisuke yamada, takashi inoue, hiroyuki takaya.\n\nI don't see 'usui' listed anywhere. Therefore, there are zero wins by usui with a majority decision because usui isn't an opponent in any of the matches. \n\nThe claim says only one win is by majority decision for usui, but since usui doesn't appear as an opponent, this claim can't be true. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the defeat by a ko occur in the same tournament as the drawn match",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the defeat by a ko occur in the same tournament as the drawn match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. There was a defeat by KO (knockout).\n2. This defeat occurred in the same tournament as a drawn match.\n\nI'll start by looking for any rows where the method of defeat was KO. Scanning through the \"method\" column:\n\n- Row 0: Decision\n- Row 1: Decision\n- Row 2: Decision\n- Row 3: Decision (majority)\n- Row 4: Decision\n- Row 5: Decision\n- Row 6: Decision\n- Row 7: Decision\n- Row 8: Draw\n- Row 9: Decision (majority)\n- Row 10: Decision\n- Row 11: Submission (rear naked choke) \u2013 not KO\n- Row 12: Submission (armlock) \u2013 not KO\n- Row 13: KO (punch) \u2013 this is the first KO method I found. Let's note this row.\n- Row 14: Decision\n- Row 15: Decision\n- Row 16: Decision\n- Row 17: Decision\n- Row 18: Decision (majority)\n- Row 19: Decision (unanimous)\n- Row 20: TKO \u2013 which is a type of KO, but the method here is specified as \"tko\". However, in this case, it's noted as KO.\n\nWait, row 13 shows a loss via KO. Let me check row 13:\n\nRow 13 details:\n- res: loss\n- record: 2-4\n- opponent: Takeshi Inoue\n- method: ko (punch)\n- event: shooto\n- round: 2\n- time: 4:58\n\nNow, I need to check if there's a drawn match in the same tournament. The events are listed under the \"event\" column.\n\nLooking through each row for 'drawn' results:\n\nRow 8 is the only draw:\n- res: draw\n- record: 5-5-1\n- opponent: Ed Newalu\n- method: draw\n- event: pip - east vs west\n- round: 2\n- time: 5:00\n\nSo, the drawn match occurred in the \"pip - east vs west\" event. The KO defeat is in the \"shooto\" event. Therefore, they are not in the same tournament.\n\nThus, the claim that the KO defeat and the draw happened in the same tournament is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"Usui defeat Daisuke Ishizawa in the same manner he defeat Manabu Inoue.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim refers to. It seems like Usui is the fighter whose record we're looking at, and the table shows his fight results against various opponents.\n\nSo, I'm supposed to check two things:\n1. How did Usui defeat Daisuke Ishizawa?\n2. How did he defeat Manabu Inoue?\n\nIf both victories used the same method, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table, let's identify the relevant rows for each opponent.\n\nFor Daisuke Ishizawa:\n- I'll scan through the \"opponent\" column to find \"daisuke ishizawa\". Let me see... row 4 shows \"win\" against \"daisuke ishizawa\", method is \"decision (unanimous)\", event is \"shooto\", round 2, time 5:00.\n\nFor Manabu Inoue:\n- Looking for \"manabu inoue\" in the opponent column. There's a row with \"win\" against him, under \"gcm - dog 5\". The method here is \"decision (majority)\", same round and time as others.\n\nNow, comparing the methods:\n- Daisuke Ishizawa: decision (unanimous)\n- Manabu Inoue: decision (majority)\n\nThe claim says Usui defeated both in the same manner. However, one was a unanimous decision and the other a majority decision. These are different types of decisions. Therefore, they were not defeated \"in the same manner.\"\n\nSo, the claim is false because the methods of victory differ between the two opponents.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Usui defeated both Daisuke Ishizawa and Manabu Inoue in the same manner. Checking the table:\n\n- Against Daisuke Ishizawa (row 4), the method was a unanimous decision.\n- Against Manabu Inoue (row 10), it was a majority decision.\n\nSince the methods differ, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
