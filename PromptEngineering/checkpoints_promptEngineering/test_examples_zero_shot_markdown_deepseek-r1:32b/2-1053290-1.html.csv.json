Let me look through the table step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll search for \"brighton\" in the location column since that's what the claim is about. Scanning down the rows:\n\n- Year 1984: The event is listed as \"brighton hotel bombing\", and the location is \"brighton , uk\". \n\nSo this row directly matches the claim. There are no other entries mentioning Brighton, so I don't need to check further.\n\nThe relevant cells here are the 'event' and 'location' columns for that specific row. Therefore, since the table confirms that the event occurred in Brighton, UK, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"brighton hotel bombing happen in enniskillen, uk\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim says and then checking each part against the table.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions two main pieces of information: the event name, which is \"brighton hotel bombing,\" and its location as \"enniskillen, uk.\" I need to verify both details from the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows with different events. I'll go through each row one by one to find where \"brighton hotel bombing\" and \"enniskillen\" appear.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 1871: attack on the mosel in bremerhaven\n- 1910: Los Angeles Times bombing\n- 1916: Preparedness Day bombing in San Francisco\n- 1920: Wall Street bombing\n- 1939: B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller in Munich\n- 1942: St Nazaire raid\n- 1944: July Plot in Wolf's Lair, Poland (wartime)\n- 1955: United Airlines Flight 629 over Longmont, Colorado\n- 1972: Aldershot bombing\n- 1974: M62 coach bombing and Birmingham pub bombings\n- 1977: Lucona sinking\n- 1984: Brighton hotel bombing in Brighton, UK\n- 1987: Korean Air Flight 858 and Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland\n- 1988: Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland\n- 1989: Deal barracks bombing\n- 1994: Philippine Airlines Flight 434\n- 1996: Centennial Olympic Park bombing\n- 1998: Omagh bombing\n- 1999: Russian apartment bombings in Buynaksk, Moscow, Volgodonsk\n- 2006: Moscow market bombing\n\nFrom this, I notice that the \"brighton hotel bombing\" is listed in 1984 with a location of Brighton, UK. However, the claim says it happened in Enniskillen, UK. There's another entry in 1987 for the Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, which was carried out by IRA.\n\nSo the \"brighton hotel bombing\" is correctly located in Brighton, not Enniskillen. The event at Enniskillen is a different bombing on a different year. Therefore, the claim incorrectly associates the Brighton bombing with Enniskillen.\n\nThe relevant cells are:\n- For the Brighton hotel bombing: row index 14 (assuming rows start from 0) under 'event' and 'location'.\n- For the Remembrance Day bombing in Enniskillen: row index 16 under 'event' and 'location'.\n\nBut since the claim is about the location of the Brighton event, it's incorrect. Thus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the \"brighton hotel bombing\" occurred in Enniskillen, UK. Checking the table:\n\n- The \"brighton hotel bombing\" is listed with a location of \"brighton  , uk.\"\n- There's another event, the \"remembrance day bombing,\" located at \"enniskillen  , northern ireland.\"\n\nThe claim incorrectly associates the Brighton bombing with Enniskillen.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
