    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim \"the longest gap in time between years be 4 year from 2009 to 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table's structure. The table lists various badminton events and their winners each year starting from 1990 up to 2013. The years are in the first column as \"year\".\n\nTo find gaps between years, I need to check the sequence of years listed. Let me list out all the years present:\n\n- 1990\n- 1991\n- 1992\n- 1993\n- 1994\n- 1995\n- 1996\n- 1997\n- 1998\n- 2000\n- 2002\n- 2003\n- 2004\n- 2005\n- 2006\n- 2007\n- 2008\n- 2009\n- 2013\n\nNow, I'll check the gaps between consecutive years:\n\n- Between 1998 and 2000: that's a gap of 2 years.\n- Then from 2000 to 2002: another 2-year gap.\n- From 2003 to 2004: only 1 year apart.\n- Moving on, the next significant gaps are between 2009 and 2013, which is a 4-year gap.\n\nLooking through all the other consecutive years listed, I don't see any gap longer than 4 years. For example:\n\n- From 2008 to 2009: that's just one year.\n- The only larger jump is from 2009 to 2013, which skips 2010, 2011, 2012.\n\nSo the claim says that the longest gap is 4 years between 2009 and 2013. From what I can see in the table, this seems accurate because there are no other gaps longer than four years, and the next entry after 2009 is indeed 2013.\n\nTherefore, the claim appears to be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"li feng be the most common women 's single , appear 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. My focus is on the \"women's singles\" column since that's what the claim is about.\n\nThe claim states that Li Feng appears three times as the winner in women's singles. So I need to check how many times her name appears in the \"women's singles\" column across all the years listed.\n\nLet me go through each row and count the occurrences of Li Feng:\n\n- 1990: Stephanie Spicer\n- 1991: Anna Oi Chan Lao\n- 1992: Julie Still\n- 1993: Rhona Robertson\n- 1994: Song Yang\n- 1995: Song Yang\n- 1996: Li Feng (First occurrence)\n- 1997: Li Feng (Second occurrence)\n- 1998: Li Feng (Third occurrence)\n- 2000: Rhona Robertson\n- 2002: Kim Ji-Hyun\n- 2003: Lenny Permana\n- 2004: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2005: Adriyanti Firdasari\n- 2006: Huang Chia-Chi\n- 2007: Zhou Mi\n- 2008: Zhou Mi\n- 2009: Sayaka Sato\n- 2013: Deng Xuan\n\nSo, looking at the \"women's singles\" column, Li Feng appears in 1996, 1997, and 1998. That's three times. Now I need to check if she is indeed the most common winner.\n\nI should also verify if any other player appears more than three times in that column. Let's count each occurrence:\n\n- Rhona Robertson: She wins in 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994 (wait, no\u2014checking again). Wait, actually looking back:\n\nWait, let me recount all entries to see if any other player has more than three wins.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- 1990: Stephanie Spicer\n- 1991: Anna Oi Chan Lao\n- 1992: Julie Still\n- 1993: Rhona Robertson\n- 1994: Song Yang\n- 1995: Song Yang (two wins)\n- 1996: Li Feng (first)\n- 1997: Li Feng (second)\n- 1998: Li Feng (third)\n- 2000: Rhona Robertson (second win)\n- 2002: Kim Ji-Hyun\n- 2003: Lenny Permana\n- 2004: Huang Chia Chi\n- 2005: Adriyanti Firdasari\n- 2006: Huang Chia-Chi (second win)\n- 2007: Zhou Mi\n- 2008: Zhou Mi (two wins)\n- 2009: Sayaka Sato\n- 2013: Deng Xuan\n\nSo, let's tally the number of wins per player in women's singles:\n\n- Rhona Robertson: 1993 and 2000 \u2192 2 times\n- Song Yang: 1994 and 1995 \u2192 2 times\n- Li Feng: 1996, 1997, 1998 \u2192 3 times\n- Zhou Mi: 2007 and 2008 \u2192 2 times\n- Others appear once or less.\n\nSo, Li Feng has three wins, which is more than any other player. Therefore, she is the most common women's singles winner, appearing three times. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says that \"daniel shirley john gordon be the only men's double partner to appear more than 1 time.\" Hmm, I need to check the table for entries in the men's doubles column where Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are partners and see how many times they appeared together.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row in the \"men's doubles\" column. Let me start from the top.\n\nLooking at the years:\n\n1990: nicholas hall dean galt \u2013 not them.\n1991: peter blackburn darren mcdonald \u2013 nope.\n1992: dean galt andrew compton \u2013 still not our pair.\n1993: dean galt kerrin harrison \u2013 not them either.\n1994: michael helber michael keck \u2013 no.\n1995: he tim chan siu kwong \u2013 not matching.\n1996: ma che kong chow kin man \u2013 nope.\n1997: ma che kong liu kwok wa \u2013 still not our pair.\n\nAh, 1998! Here it is: daniel shirley dean galt. Wait, that's Daniel Shirley with Dean Galt, not John Gordon. So that's different from the claim. The claim mentions both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon as partners.\n\nContinuing on:\n\n2000: daniel shirley john gordon \u2013 yes! This is our pair. They're listed together here.\n2002: Also, daniel shirley john gordon \u2013 again, same pair. So they appeared in both 2000 and 2002.\n\nLooking further down:\n\n2003 onwards: I don't see them appearing again as partners. Other pairs include ashley brehaut travis denney, suichi nakao suichi sakamoto, etc., but none have Daniel Shirley and John Gordon together beyond 2002.\n\nWait a second \u2013 in the claim, it says they are the \"only\" men's doubles pair to appear more than once. But from what I see, their partnership appears twice (2000 and 2002). Are there any other pairs that appear multiple times?\n\nLet me check if any other men's doubles pairs repeat. For example, Dean Galt was in the 1990s with different partners but not as a fixed pair with someone else beyond his initial appearances.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- 1998: daniel shirley dean galt\n- 2000 and 2002: Daniel Shirley and John Gordon\n\nI don't see any other pairs that repeat. So their specific pairing of Daniel Shirley and John Gordon occurs twice, making them the only pair to do so.\n\nWait, but in 1998, it's Daniel Shirley with Dean Galt, not John Gordon. So their team of Daniel and John is unique to those two years. No other pairs beyond that have repeated appearances together.\n\nTherefore, the claim seems correct: Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are the only men's doubles pair to appear more than once.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells show that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon appeared together in 2000 and 2002, making them the only pair in men's doubles to repeat. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"men's doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"geoffrey bellingham be the most common men's single appear 3 time.\" Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is stating. It seems to say that Geoffrey Bellingham appeared as the men's singles champion three times and that he's the most common in that category.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column here is \"men  's singles.\" So I'll focus on that column. Let me go through each row and count how many times Geoffrey Bellingham appears.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- 1990: Nicholas Hall\n- 1991: Wei Yan\n- 1992: Dean Galt\n- 1993: Dean Galt again\n- 1994: Oliver Pongratz\n- 1995: Tam Kai Chuen\n- 1996: Tam Kai Chuen again\n- 1997: Nicholas Hall\n- 1998: Geoffrey Bellingham (first occurrence)\n- 2000: Geoffrey Bellingham again (second time)\n- 2002: Geoffrey Bellingham a third time (third occurrence)\n- 2003: Shoji Sato\n- 2004: Andrew Smith\n- 2005: Sairul Amar Ayob\n- 2006: Lee Tsuen Seng\n- 2007: Andre Kurniawan Tedjono\n- 2008: Lee Tsuen Seng again\n- 2009: Chan Yan Kit\n- 2013: Riichi Takeshita\n\nWait, from this count, Geoffrey Bellingham appears in the men's singles column three times: 1998, 2000, and 2002. That checks out.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that no other player appears more than three times in the men's singles category. Let me scan through again:\n\n- Nicholas Hall appears twice (1990 and 1997).\n- Dean Galt appears twice (1992 and 1993), plus another mention in doubles but not singles.\n- Tam Kai Chuen appears twice as well (1995 and 1996).\n\nOthers like Wei Yan, Oliver Pongratz, etc., only appear once.

It states that Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are the most common pair in women's doubles, appearing four times together.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns are: year, men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, mixed doubles.\n- For each year from 1990 to 2013, there are entries for each category.\n\nI need to focus on the \"women's doubles\" column and check how many times Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together as a pair. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **1990**: Women's doubles - rhona robertson lynne scutt\n   - Pair: Rhona Robertson & Lynne Scutt \u2192 Not both Rhona and Tammy.\n\n2. **1991**: women's doubles - rhonda cator anna oi chan lao\n   - Rhonda Cator & Anna Oi Chan Lao \u2192 Neither is Tammy Jenkins.\n\n3. **1992**: women's doubles - rhona robertson tammy jenkins\n   - Pair: Rhona Robertson & Tammy Jenkins \u2192 This counts as one appearance.\n\n4. **1993**: women's doubles - rhona robertson liao yue jin\n   - Rhona Robertson & Liao Yue Jin \u2192 Not both together with Tammy.\n\n5. **1994**: women's doubles - lisa campbell amanda hardy\n   - Lisa Campbell & Amanda Hardy \u2192 Neither is Rhona or Tammy.\n\n6. **1995**: women's doubles - rhona robertson tammy jenkins\n   - Pair: Rhona Robertson & Tammy Jenkins \u2192 Second appearance.\n\n7. **1996**: women's doubles - rhona robertson tammy jenkins\n   - Pair: Rhona Robertson & Tammy Jenkins \u2192 Third appearance.\n\n8. **1997**: women's doubles - rhona robertson tammy jenkins\n   - Pair: Rhona Robertson & Tammy Jenkins \u2192 Fourth appearance.\n\n9. **1998**: women's doubles - rhona robertson tammy jenkins\n   - Wait, looking at 1998, it says \"rhona robertson tammy jenkins\" again? Let me check the table:\n\nLooking back at the 1998 row, yes, under women's doubles: rhona robertson tammy jenkins.\n\nSo that would be a fifth time if I count 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998. But wait, in 1993, it was Rhona with someone else, so only from 1992 to 1997 (inclusive) and then again in 1998?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- 1992: Yes\n- 1995: Yes\n- 1996: Yes\n- 1997: Yes\n- 1998: Yes\n\nThat's five times. However, the claim says they appear four times. So perhaps I miscounted or missed a year.\n\nWait, maybe some years don't have both names together? Let me check each row:\n\n- 1992: Rhona & Tammy \u2192 1\n- 1993: Rhona with someone else \u2192 not counted\n- 1994: Different pair \u2192 no\n- 1995: Rhona & Tammy \u2192 2\n- 1996: Rhona & Tammy \u2192 3\n- 1997: Rhona & Tammy \u2192 4\n- 1998: Rhona & Tammy \u2192 5\n\nSo actually, they appear together five times. But the claim says four times.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the years. Let me go through each year again:\n\n- **1990**: No\n- **1991**: No\n- **1992**: Yes \u2192 1\n- **1993**: No\n- **1994**: No\n- **1995**: Yes \u2192 2\n- **1996**: Yes \u2192 3\n- **1997**: Yes \u2192 4\n- **1998**: Yes \u2192 5\n\nSo from 1992 to 1998, they are together in five years. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it states four times, but actually, it's five times.\n\nWait, maybe I misread some rows. Let me check each row again carefully:\n\n- **1990**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Lynne \u2192 Not Tammy.\n- **1991**: Women's doubles: Rhonda and Anna \u2192 Neither is Tammy or Rhona together with her.\n- **1992**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Tammy \u2192 Count 1\n- **1993**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Liao \u2192 Not Tammy.\n- **1994**: Women's doubles: Lisa and Amanda \u2192 Neither is Rhona or Tammy.\n- **1995**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Tammy \u2192 Count 2\n- **1996**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Tammy \u2192 Count 3\n- **1997**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Tammy \u2192 Count 4\n- **1998**: Women's doubles: Rhona and Tammy \u2192 Count 5\n\nSo they appear together five times. The claim says four times, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the years or miscalculated. So based on this, the claim is FALSE because they appear five times, not four.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are the most common pair in women's doubles, appearing four times.

Therefore, Song Yang did not win more than any other player; instead, Li Feng won more.\n\nThus, the claim is false because Song Yang only won twice, while another player (Li Feng) won three times.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"women's singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"daniel shirley john gordon win the men's double event 4 time as a team\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The key points here are:\n1. Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are the pair.\n2. They won the men's doubles event four times.\n3. They did so as a team, meaning both were partners in each win.\n\nNow, looking at the table structure, it lists various events from 1990 to 2013 with columns for Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, etc. My focus is on the \"men's doubles\" column.\n\nI'll go through each year and check if both Daniel Shirley and John Gordon are listed as winners in that year's men's doubles event.\n\nStarting from 1990:\n- 1990: The men's doubles winners are Nicholas Hall and Dean Galt. Not our pair.\n  \nContinuing down the years until I find mentions of either Daniel Shirley or John Gordon:\n\nLooking through each row, I notice that in several years, like 2000, 2002, etc., both names appear together in men's doubles.\n\nWait, let me check each occurrence:\n\n- 1998: Men's Doubles are Daniel Shirley and Dean Galt. So not both our pair.\n  \n- 2000: Men's Doubles winners are Daniel Shirley and John Gordon. That's the first win for this team.\n\n- 2002: Again, Daniel Shirley and John Gordon win men's doubles. Second time.\n\n- Next, I'll check other years beyond 2002 but within the table. Looking at 2003 onwards:\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, I don't see both names in the men's doubles together again. For example:\n- 2004: Men's Doubles are suichi nakao and suichi sakamoto.\n- 2005: Boyden Cooper and Travis Denney.\n  \nSo, from this table, Daniel Shirley and John Gordon only appear together as winners in 2000 and 2002. That's two times, not four.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they won four times is incorrect based on the data provided. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Daniel Shirley and John Gordon won men's doubles four times as a team. The table shows their victories in 2000 and 2002, totaling two wins.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"men 's doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"rhona robertson and tammy jenkins win the event more than any other team, win 5 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It states that Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins are a team that has won an event five times, and no other team has won more than them in those events.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists winners for various categories each year from 1990 to 2013. The relevant columns here would be \"women's doubles\" since that's where teams of two women are listed as winners.\n\nI'll start by examining each row under the \"women's doubles\" column to see how many times Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins appear together as a team.\n\nGoing through each year:\n\n- 1990: Rhona Robertson & Lynne Scutt. Not both with Tammy.\n- 1991: Rhonda Cator & Anna Oi Chan Lao. Not our pair.\n- 1992: Rhona Robertson & Tammy Jenkins. This is the first occurrence of them together.\n- 1993: Rhona Robertson & Liao Yue Jin. Not with Tammy.\n- 1994: Lisa Campbell & Amanda Hardy. Different team.\n- 1995: Rhona Robertson & Tammy Jenkins. Second win.\n- 1996: Same pair, third win.\n- 1997: Still together, fourth win.\n- 1998: Again, fifth win. So up to here, that's five times.\n\nLooking beyond 1998:\n\n- 2000: Rhona Robertson is in women's singles, but the doubles have a different team.\n- Other years don't show them together again.\n\nSo they've won five times from 1992 to 1998. Now I need to check if any other team has more than five wins.\n\nLooking through other entries:\n\n- Rhona Robertson appears in multiple teams, but not always with Tammy.\n- Other frequent winners like Lisa Campbell and others don't seem to surpass five wins together.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds as TRUE because no other team has won more than five times. The relevant cells are each instance where Rhona and Tammy are listed together in women's doubles from 1992 through 1998.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Rhona Robertson and Tammy Jenkins won the women's doubles event five times consecutively, and no other team achieved more than that.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"women 's doubles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"tam kai chuen win the men's single event more than any other player\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It lists winners of various badminton events from 1990 to 2013. The columns are Year, Men's Singles, Women's Singles, Men's Doubles, Women's Doubles, and Mixed Doubles. Each row corresponds to a year with the respective champions in each category.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"men's single event,\" so I should focus on the \"Men's Singles\" column. My goal is to count how many times Tam Kai Chuen appears in this column compared to other players.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- In 1995, Tam Kai Chuen is listed as the winner.\n- In 1996, he also wins the Men's Singles.\n  \nChecking the rest of the years:\n- Other notable winners include Nicholas Hall (1990, 1997), Dean Galt (1992, 1993), and Geoffrey Bellingham (1998, 2000). Each of these players wins twice as well. \n\nSo, Tam Kai Chuen has two victories in the Men's Singles category. However, other players like Nicholas Hall, Dean Galt, and Geoffrey Bellingham also have two each. This means that while he did win multiple times, he isn't the only one with two wins; there are others who have the same number of wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that Tam Kai Chuen won more than any other player, which isn't accurate since several players share his count of two wins. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"men  's singles\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"men  's singles\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
