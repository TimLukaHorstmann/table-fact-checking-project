    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the opponent in final on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand on hard surface be katerina kramperov\u00e1\". \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to see what each part refers to in the table.\n\n1. **Date**: The claim mentions \"6 February 2000.\" Looking at the 'date' column in the table, I need to find a row where the date is exactly this. Scanning through the dates:\n   - Rows 0: 2 May 1999\n   - Row 1: 11 July 1999\n   - Row 2: 6 February 2000 \u2192 This matches.\n   So, row index 2 is relevant.\n\n2. **Location**: The location given is \"Wellington, New Zealand.\" Checking the 'location' column for row 2:\n   - It says \"wellington, new zealand\" which is a match. Case doesn't matter here since it's just about content.\n\n3. **Surface**: The surface mentioned is \"hard\". Looking at the 'surface' column in row 2:\n   - It lists \"hard\", so that matches as well.\n\n4. **Opponent in final**: According to the claim, the opponent should be \"Katerina Kramperov\u00e1.\" Checking the 'opponent in final' column for row 2:\n   - The name listed is \"mirielle dittmann\". \n\nWait a minute, that's different from the claim. So the opponent on 6 February 2000 was Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperov\u00e1. Therefore, the claim is incorrect regarding who the opponent was.\n\nTo further confirm, I'll check if there's another row where Katerina Kramperov\u00e1 is listed as an opponent. Looking through all rows:\n- Row 8 has \"katerina kramperov\u00e1\" as the opponent in final on 12 February 2006. But that's a different date, location (Taupo), and surface.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The row matching the date, location, and surface is row 2, but the opponent there isn't Katerina. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"on 2 may 1999, the surface be hard\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. Each row represents a specific event with details filled under these columns.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the date \"2 may 1999\" and the surface being \"hard.\" My task is to check if on that particular date, the surface was indeed hard.\n\nI'll start by scanning the 'date' column for the entry \"2 may 1999.\" Looking through each row:\n\n- The first row has a date of \"2 may 1999.\" So this is the relevant row.\n  \nNow, I need to check what the surface was on that date. In the same row as \"2 may 1999,\" the 'surface' column says \"hard.\"\n\nSo, according to the table, on May 2, 1999, the surface was hard.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because it accurately reflects the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"surface\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"mirielle dittmann be the opponent in the final on hard surface on 6 february 2000 in wellington new zealand.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim to understand what each part refers to in the table. The key elements here are:\n1. Opponent's name: mirielle dittmann\n2. Surface type: hard\n3. Date: 6 february 2000\n4. Location: wellington new zealand\n\nNext, I'll go through each row of the table to see if there's a match for all these conditions.\n\nLooking at the first row:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 2 may 1999\n- Location: coatzacoalcos, mexico\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent in final: candice jairala\n\nThis doesn't match because the date is different and the opponent isn't mirielle dittmann.\n\nMoving to the second row:\n- Outcome: winner\n- Date: 11 july 1999\n- Location: felixstowe, england\n- Surface: grass\n- Opponent in final: karen nugent\n\nAgain, different date and opponent. Not relevant.\n\nThird row:\n- Outcome: runner-up\n- Date: 6 february 2000\n- Location: wellington, new zealand\n- Surface: hard\n- Opponent in final: mirielle dittmann\n\nThis seems promising. The date matches (6 February 2000), location is wellington, surface is hard, and the opponent is mirielle dittmann. So all conditions are met here.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll check the remaining rows to ensure there's no other entry that could also satisfy the claim, but it looks like this third row is the only one with all these specifics.\n\nSo, putting it together, the claim is TRUE because the third row in the table contains all the necessary details matching the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects a specific row in the table where Mirielle Dittmann was the opponent on a hard surface in Wellington, New Zealand on 6 February 2000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"surface\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"opponent in final\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, and score. My focus is on the 'surface' and 'date' columns because the claim mentions both.\n\nLooking for the row with the date \"2 may 1999\". Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Date is 2 May 1999.
