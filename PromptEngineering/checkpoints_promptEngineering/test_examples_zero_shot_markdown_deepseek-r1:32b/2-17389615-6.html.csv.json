The table lists several football teams with details about when they played, their venue, and championships.\n\nThe claim in question is: \"there be 5 team with no championship, and only 1 with a championship.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this claim carefully. It's saying that out of all the teams listed, five have no championships, and one has at least one championship. So, my goal is to check how many teams in the table have 'none' under the championships column and see if exactly five do, while only one team lists a championship.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants: Championships - none\n2. Evansville Vipers: Championships - none\n3. Evansville Bluecats: Championships - none\n4. Evansville Express: Championships - none\n5. Tri-State Titans: Championships - none\n6. Ohio River Bearcats: Championships - \"gmfl title 2008\"\n\nSo, counting the teams with 'none' in championships: that's five teams (rows 0-4).

It's stating that Goebel Soccer Complex was the most frequently used venue among all the teams listed. So, I need to check each team's venue and count how many times Goebel Soccer Complex appears compared to other venues.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows of data. Each row represents a different football team with details about when they played and where their games were held. The relevant column here is \"venue.\"\n\nLet me go through each team one by one:\n\n1. **Evansville Crimson Giants**: Played from 1921 to 1922 at Bosse Field.\n   - Venue: Bosse Field\n\n2. **Evansville Vipers**: Played from 2000 to 2007 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n   - Venue: Goebel Soccer Complex (First occurrence)\n\n3. **Evansville Bluecats**: Played from 2003 to 2007 at Roberts Municipal Stadium.\n   - Venue: Roberts Municipal Stadium\n\n4. **Evansville Express**: Played from 2004 to 2005 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n   - Venue: Goebel Soccer Complex (Second occurrence)\n\n5. **Tri-State Titans**: Played from 2008 to 2009 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n   - Venue: Goebel Soccer Complex (Third occurrence)\n\n6. **Ohio River BeeCats**: Played from 2008 to 2010 at Reitz Bowl.\n   - Venue: Reitz Bowl\n\nNow, I'll tally the number of times each venue was used:\n\n- **Bosse Field**: 1 time\n- **Goebel Soccer Complex**: 3 times (by Evansville Vipers, Evansville Express, and Tri-State Titans)\n- **Roberts Municipal Stadium**: 1 time\n- **Reitz Bowl**: 1 time\n\nFrom this tally, it's clear that Goebel Soccer Complex was the most frequently used venue among the listed teams.

Evansville Crimson Giants\n2. Evansville Vipers\n3. Evansville Bluecats\n4. Evansville Express\n5. Tri-State Titans\n6.

So I need to check this against the table provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, there are six rows of data about different teams. Each row has details like the team name, sport, years played, venue, and championships won. The relevant columns here seem to be \"team\" and \"championships\".\n\nThe claim is about whether the Tri-State Titans are not the team that won the GMFL title in 2008. To verify this, I should check which team won that championship.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Evansville Crimson Giants: They played from 1921-1922 and have no championships.\n2. Evansville Vipers: Played 2000-2007, also no championships.\n3. Evansville Bluecats: Played 2003-2007, again no championships listed.\n4. Evansville Express: Played 2004-2005, same as above.\n5.

Ohio River Bearcats: Played 2008-2010 and won the GMFL title in 2008.\n\nSo the Ohio River Bearcats are the ones who won the GMFL title in 2008, not the Tri-State Titans. The claim is stating that the Tri-State Titans did not win it, which matches what I see here.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For the Tri-State Titans, we look at their championships column (row index 4). It's \"none\", so they didn't win any titles.\n- For the Ohio River Bearcats, checking their championships (row index 5) shows they did win the GMFL title in 2008.\n\nTherefore, both these cells are relevant to confirming that the Tri-State Titans weren't the champions in 2008.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because the table shows that the Ohio River Bearcats won the GMFL title in 2008, not the Tri-State Titans.

There are six rows of data for different football teams with their respective details.\n\nThe claim mentions \"bosse field\" as being the most used venue. So, my first step is to check how many times each venue appears in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'venue' column:\n\n1. Row 0: bosse field\n2. Row 1: goebel soccer complex\n3. Row 2: roberts municipal stadium\n4. Row 3: goebel soccer complex\n5. Row 4: goebel soccer complex\n6.

Scanning through again, all venues except goebel have fewer occurrences. So, my conclusion remains that bosse field is not the most used venue; it's actually less used than goebel soccer complex.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"bosse field\" is the most used venue.

The claim is: \"the event robert municipal stadium take place before the event at bosse field.\" Hmm, that wording seems a bit off, maybe it should be \"took place\" instead of \"take place,\" but I'll go with what's written.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the table and find the relevant information about Robert Municipal Stadium and Bosse Field. Let me look through each row:\n\n1. The first row is about the Evansville Crimson Giants. They played football from 1921-1922 at Bosse Field, and they have no championships listed.\n2. The second row mentions Evansville Vipers playing from 2000-2007 at Goebel Soccer Complex with none in championships.\n3. The third row is about the Evansville Bluecats, who played from 2003-2007 at Robert Municipal Stadium, again no championships.\n4. The fourth row talks about the Evansville Express playing from 2004-2005 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n5. The fifth row is the Tri-State Titans from 2008-2009 at Goebel Soccer Complex.\n6. The last row is Ohio River Bearcats, football team, played from 2008-2010 at Reitz Bowl, with a GMFL title in 2008.\n\nSo, I need to compare the events at Robert Municipal Stadium and Bosse Field. Let's see which teams played where:\n\n- Evansville Crimson Giants: Bosse Field (1921-1922)\n- Evansville Bluecats: Robert Municipal Stadium (2003-2007)\n\nNow, the claim is that the event at Robert Municipal Stadium took place before the one at Bosse Field. Wait, but looking at the years:\n\nBosse Field was used by the Crimson Giants from 1921-1922, which is much earlier than the Bluecats' time in Robert Municipal Stadium (2003-2007). So, actually, events at Bosse Field occurred way before those at Robert Municipal Stadium. Therefore, the claim that Robert's events happened first would be false.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. It says \"the event robert municipal stadium take place before bosse field.\" So it's stating that something at Robert happened before Bosse Field. Since 2003 is way after 1921, this is not true. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells in the table:\n\nLooking for \"venue\" column and check which rows have Robert Municipal Stadium and Bosse Field.\n\n- Row index 0 has venue Bosse Field.\n- Row index 2 has venue Robert Municipal Stadium.\n\nSo the relevant cells are row 0, column \"venue,\" and row 2, column \"venue.\" That's all I need to determine that Robert's events were later than Bosse Field's.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me check other entries to see if any other team won a championship.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n- evansville crimson giants: none\n- evansville vipers: none\n- evansville bluecats: none\n- evansville express: none\n- tri-state titans: none\n- ohio river bearcats: gmfl title 2008, venue reitz bowl.\n\nSo the only team with a championship is ohio river bearcats, but they played at reitz bowl, not goebel soccer complex. The evansville vipers (plural) didn't win any championships according to the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"evansville viper\" won a championship at goebel soccer complex isn't supported by the data in the table. There's no mention of them winning a championship or hosting a championship there.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because the evansville vipers did not win any championships and the venue doesn't host any for them.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"championships\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
