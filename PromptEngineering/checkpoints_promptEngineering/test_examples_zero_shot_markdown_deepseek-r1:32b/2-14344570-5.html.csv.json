    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the philadelphia flyer score no point against the new york ranger on january 13, 1996.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find a game where the opponent was the New York Rangers and the date was January 13. Scanning the 'opponent' column, I see two entries for the New York Rangers: games 44 and 47.\n\nFor game 44, the date is January 13 (column \"january\"), opponent is New York Rangers, score is 0-4, record becomes 23-13-9, points total is 55. The team scored 0 goals in this game, so they didn't get any points because they lost.\n\nIn game 47, the date is January 24, opponent again New York Rangers, but that's a different date and not relevant to the claim about January 13.\n\nSo focusing on game 44: since the score was 0-4, the team (Philadelphia Flyers) didn't earn any points. In hockey, a win gives 2 points, an overtime loss (OT) gives 1 point, and a regulation loss gives 0. Here, it's a regulation loss, so they got 0 points.\n\nThus, the claim that they scored no points against the Rangers on January 13 is TRUE. The relevant cells are from row 4: opponent, january, score, record, and points to confirm all details.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"january\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"the philadelphia flyer tie the colorado avalanche on january 4, 1996.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions two teams: Philadelphia Flyers and Colorado Avalanche, and a date of January 4, 1996. It states that they tied, which I assume means the game ended in a tie, possibly with overtime.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it's structured with columns like \"game,\" \"january,\" \"opponent,\" \"score,\" \"record,\" and \"points.\" Each row represents a different game played by what appears to be a team (maybe the Philadelphia Flyers, though not explicitly stated). \n\nI'll start by checking which games in the table took place on January 4. Scanning through the \"january\" column:\n\n- Game 40: Jan 3\n- Game 41: Jan 4\n- Game 42: Jan 9\n- And so on.\n\nSo, only Game 41 is on Jan 4. Now, looking at Game 41's details:\n\nOpponent: Colorado Avalanche  \nScore: 2 - 2 ot (which likely stands for overtime)  \nRecord: 23-11-7 (so the team has 23 wins, 11 losses, and 7 ties?)  \n\nWait, but in hockey, a tie usually means both teams have the same score at the end of regulation. The \"ot\" suggests that it went into overtime, so the result might not be a tie but rather one team winning in overtime. However, sometimes scores with ot can still mean a tie if it's an overtime loss or something else.\n\nBut looking at the table, Game 41 has a score of 2-2 ot and the record is 23-11-7. Assuming that ties are recorded as 't' in the record, so 23 wins, 11 losses, 7 ties. So the team tied against Colorado Avalanche on Jan 4.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"the philadelphia flyer tie the colorado avalanche.\" The table is from a specific team's perspective\u2014probably Philadelphia Flyers since that's mentioned in the claim. In Game 41, they played against Colorado and ended with a score of 2-2 ot. Since the record increased by one tie (from previous games), it seems like this was a tied game.\n\nSo the relevant cells are from row 40 (index starts at 0?), but wait:\n\nWait, the table rows start at index 0. Let's recount:\n\nRow indices as per the JSON example should be integers starting from 0 for the first data row after headers. So Game 40 is row 0, Game 41 is row 1, etc.\n\nSo Game 41 is in row 1.\n\nRelevant columns are \"january\" to check the date, \"opponent\" to confirm it's Colorado Avalanche, and \"score\" to see if it was a tie (or 2-2 ot). Also, perhaps checking the \"record\" to see if it reflects an additional tie. \n\nWait, the record before Game 41 is 23-11-6 in row 0 (Game 40) and after Game 41, it's 23-11-7. So that shows a tie was added, confirming that the game ended in a tie.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 1 (Game 41), \"january\" to confirm Jan 4\n- Row 1, \"opponent\" to see it's Colorado Avalanche\n- Row 1, \"score\" to check if it was a tie or not (2-2 ot)\n- Maybe also row 1, \"record\" to see the change\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should only include cells that are directly used to verify each part of the claim.\n\nThe claim has three parts: team (Philadelphia Flyers), opponent (Colorado Avalanche), date (Jan 4, 1996), and outcome (tie). \n\nAssuming the table is for Philadelphia Flyers, we don't need to check that explicitly. So:\n\n- Checking \"january\" column in row 1 to confirm it's Jan 4\n- Checking \"opponent\" column in row 1 to see if it's Colorado Avalanche\n- Checking \"score\" to see if it was a tie (2-2 ot)\n- The \"record\" may not be necessary unless we're checking for the outcome\n\nBut since the claim is about whether they tied, the score shows 2-2, which indicates a tie in regulation before overtime. So yes, that supports the claim.\n\nSo relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1 (Game 41), column_name: \"january\"\n- row_index: 1, column_name: \"opponent\"\n- row_index: 1, column_name: \"score\"\n\nAlternatively, since the date is Jan 4 and opponent is Colorado Avalanche, we can confirm that they played on that date. The score being a tie (2-2) supports the claim.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by these cells.\n</think>\n\nThe table confirms that on January 4, Philadelphia Flyers tied with Colorado Avalanche with a score of 2-2 ot. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"january\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the 1995 - 96 philadelphia flyer go into overtime in 6 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that during the 1995-96 season, the Philadelphia Flyers went into overtime in six games. So, I need to check how many times they played overtime games according to the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like opponent, score, record, etc. The \"score\" column shows whether a game went into overtime (OT) or not. If the score ends with \"ot\", that means the game was decided in overtime. Let me go through each game one by one.\n\nGame 40: Score is 3 - 1. No OT mentioned here.\nGame 41: Score is 2 - 2 ot. So, this went into overtime.\nGame 42: Score is 2 - 2 ot. Another overtime game.\nGame 43: Score is 4 - 4 ot. Overtime again.\nGame 44: Score is 0 - 4. No OT here.\nGame 45: Score is 6 - 1. No OT.\nGame 46: Score is 1 - 1 ot. This is another overtime game.\nGame 47: Score is 4 - 4 ot. Another one in overtime.\nGame 48: Score is 4 - 7. No OT.\nGame 49: Score is 2 - 3 ot. So, this went into overtime as well.\n\nNow, let's count the number of games that went into overtime:\n- Game 41: Yes\n- Game 42: Yes\n- Game 43: Yes\n- Game 46: Yes\n- Game 47: Yes\n- Game 49: Yes\n\nThat makes a total of six games where the Flyers went into overtime. Each of these games has \"ot\" in their score, so they qualify.\n\nThe claim states that they went into overtime in six games, which matches exactly with what I've counted from the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, each game that went into overtime contributes to this count. So, I'll list all these rows along with their \"score\" column since that's where the OT indication is present.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}, {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}]}",

There are 10 rows, each representing a game played in January 1996 (I assume since the claim mentions 1996, but the table doesn't specify the year; however, given the context, I'll proceed with that assumption).\n\nThe claim has three main parts:\n1. The opponent is Pittsburgh Penguins.\n2. The date is January 27.\n3. Philadelphia Flyers lost by a 3-point margin.\n\nLooking at the table for January 27 (since the 'january' column likely represents the date in January), row index 8 shows game number 48 on january 27 against pittsburgh penguins. The score is 4-7, which means Philadelphia scored 4 and Pittsburgh scored 7.\n\nThe loss margin is 7-4 = 3 points. So the Flyers lost by exactly 3 points as stated in the claim.

I need to determine whether the claim \"the philadelphia flyer beat the dallas star by 5 points on january 15, 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim and see if it's supported by the table.\n\nThe claim has four main components:\n1. The team involved: Philadelphia Flyers.\n2. The opponent: Dallas Stars.\n3. The date: January 15, 1996 (though the year isn't specified in the table, so I'll focus on January 15).\n4. The score difference: A 5-point victory.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date (in January), opponent, score, record, and points.\n\nStarting with the date: January 15 is mentioned in the claim. Scanning the \"january\" column, I see that game 45 took place on January 15. Let me check that row more closely.\n\nIn row index 4 (since counting starts at 0), the opponent for game 45 was Dallas Stars. So that matches the opponent part of the claim.\n\nNext, checking the score: The score is listed as 6 - 1 in favor of the team we're considering. Wait, but I need to confirm which team won. Since the table doesn't specify the home or away status, I'm assuming it's from the perspective of the team being discussed (Philadelphia Flyers). So a score of 6-1 would mean they scored 6 points and the opponent (Dallas) scored 1.\n\nCalculating the point difference: 6 - 1 = 5 points. That matches the claim of beating by 5 points.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n- The game against Dallas Stars was on January 15.\n- The score was 6-1 in favor of Philadelphia Flyers.\n- The point difference is indeed 5 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.

The opponent here is Colorado Avalanche. That seems to match part of the claim.\n\nNow, what was the score? In row index 1, under \"score,\" it says 2 - 2 ot. OT usually stands for overtime, which means the game ended in a tie after regulation time. So both teams scored 2 goals each, leading to an overtime period where no further goals were scored, resulting in a tie.\n\nBut wait, does this row belong to the Philadelphia Flyers? The table shows the opponent as Colorado Avalanche, so I assume that's the team they played against. But whose perspective is this table from? If it's the Philadelphia Flyers' schedule, then each game listed would be their games against other teams.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the philadelphia flyer score no point against the dallas star on january 13 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the table represents. It seems to be a list of games played by a team, possibly the Philadelphia Flyers given the context of the claim. Each row corresponds to a game with details like game number, date in January 1996 (since the column is labeled 'january'), opponent, score, record after the game, and points.\n\nThe claim mentions three key pieces of information: the team involved (\"philadelphia flyer\"), the opponent (\"dallas star\"), and the date (\"january 13, 1996\"). I need to check if there's a game in the table that matches these details and then determine if they scored any points.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"game\" number, \"january\" (date), \"opponent\", \"score\", etc. So, let's search for the date January 13. Scanning through the 'january' column:\n\n- Game 40: January 3\n- Game 41: January 4\n- Game 42: January 9\n- Game 43: January 11\n- Game 44: January 13 \u2013 Okay, this matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow, let's look at the opponent for game 44. The opponent is listed as \"dallas stars\". That's a match with \"dallas star\" mentioned in the claim (assuming it's a typo and should be plural). So we're looking at game number 44 against Dallas Stars on January 13.\n\nNext, I need to check the score of this game. The 'score' column for game 44 is \"0 - 4\". This means the team scored 0 goals and conceded 4. Since hockey uses points where a win gives 2 points (or sometimes 1 for overtime loss), but in this case, the score is a loss, so they probably got no points.\n\nLooking at the 'points' column for game 44: it's 55 before the game and remains 55 after. So the team didn't gain any points from that game. Therefore, they scored zero points against Dallas Stars on January 13, 1996.\n\nWait a second, but in hockey, if you lose in regulation, you get 0 points. If it's an overtime loss or shootout, sometimes teams get 1 point for losing in OT. Let me check the 'score' again: it's \"0 - 4\", no indication of overtime (like \"ot\") so it's a regulation loss.\n\nThus, they got 0 points, which supports the claim that they scored no points against Dallas on that date.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that on January 13, the team lost 0-4 to Dallas and didn't earn any points. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"january\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the philadelphia flyer lose by 2 points to the pittsburgh penguins on january 27, 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what information each part of the claim requires and then check against the table. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. **Opponent**: The opponent in question is the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n2. **Date (January 27, 1996)**: We need to find a game on January 27th.\n3. **Outcome**: Philadelphia Flyers lost by 2 points.\n\nLooking at the table columns, we have \"opponent\", \"january\", and \"score\". The relevant rows are those where \"opponent\" is Pittsburgh Penguins or where \"january\" is 27.\n\nLet's go through each part:\n\n- **Opponent Check**: I'll scan the \"opponent\" column for any mention of the Pittsburgh Penguins. From the table, in row 8 (index starting from 0), the opponent is listed as \"pittsburgh penguins\".\n  \n- **Date Check**: The claim mentions January 27, so I look at the \"january\" column for the value 27. Checking each row:\n  - Row 0: january=3\n  - Row 1: january=4\n  - ...\n  - Row 8: january=27. This matches.\n\n- **Outcome Check**: The score in this game is \"4 - 7\" (Flyers scored 4, Penguins 7). The Flyers lost by 3 points, not 2 as the claim states. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nSince the outcome doesn't match\u2014Flyers lost by 3 points instead of 2\u2014the claim isn't fully supported. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n- Row 8, \"opponent\" column to confirm it's against Pittsburgh Penguins.\n- Row 8, \"january\" column to check the date is indeed January 27th.\n- Also, row 8, \"score\" column to verify the points difference, which shows a loss by 3, not 2.\n\nWait, in my initial thought, I only considered the opponent and date. But perhaps the score is also relevant because it directly affects whether the claim's outcome is correct. So including that would make sense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"january\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the philadelphia flyer beat the florida panther by 5 point on january 15, 1996\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll check for any mention of Philadelphia Flyers in the table. Looking through the 'opponent' column, I see teams like San Jose Sharks, Colorado Avalanche, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, etc., but no entry for Philadelphia Flyers. This suggests that either the team isn't listed or perhaps it's a different year.\n\nNext, I'll check for the date January 15, 1996. The 'january' column shows numbers which likely represent the day in January. Scanning through, I find row 44 with january=15, opponent as New York Rangers, and row 45 where january=15 is not present; instead, it's 15 for Dallas Stars on january=15? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, row 45 has 'january' value 15. The opponent there is Dallas Stars, not Florida Panthers. The score was 6-1 in favor of the team (I assume it's the same team as the table is about a single team's games). So on January 15, they played against Dallas and won 6-1.\n\nThe claim mentions beating Florida Panthers by 5 points on January 15. However, looking at the 'january' column for 15, the opponent was Dallas Stars, not Florida Panthers. Additionally, Florida Panthers appear in row 46 on january=22, where the game ended in a 1-1 OT.\n\nSo there's no mention of Philadelphia Flyers beating Florida Panthers by 5 points on January 15, 1996. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 44, \"column_name\": \"january\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
