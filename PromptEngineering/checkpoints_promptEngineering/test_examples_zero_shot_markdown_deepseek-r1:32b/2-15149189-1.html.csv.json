    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"danny cipriani, born november 2 1987 be a fly half\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Danny Cipriani and provides his birthdate as November 2, 1987, and states that he plays as a fly-half. I'll need to check these details against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several columns: player, position, date of birth (age), caps, club/province. The rows list various players with their respective information. My task is to find the row for Danny Cipriani and verify his position and date of birth.\n\nI'll scan through the \"player\" column to locate Danny Cipriani. Scrolling down, I find a player named \"danny cipriani\". Let me check the details in that row.\n\nIn the same row as Danny Cipriani, under the \"position\" column, it says \"fly- half\". That matches the claim's assertion about his position. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I'll look at the \"date of birth (age)\" column for Danny Cipriani. The date listed is \"2 november 1987\", which is exactly what the claim states. Therefore, both his birthdate and position are correctly mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince all parts of the claim align with the information in the table, I can confidently say that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 34, \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the claim \"prop steve borthwick be leicester 's best know player in that position\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table and the claim. The table lists various rugby players with details like their position, date of birth, caps (which I believe refers to the number of times they've been selected for their team), and their club/province. \n\nThe claim is about Steve Borthwick being Leicester's best-known player in the prop position. So, I need to verify two things: whether Steve Borthwick plays as a prop and which club he belongs to.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each row. Let me check for \"prop\" under the position column because that's the key here. I see several entries with the position \"prop\". The relevant rows are:\n\n- Jason Hobson: Prop, Club/Province: Bristol\n- Tim Payne: Prop, Club: Wasps\n- Andrew Sheridan: Prop, Club: Sale\n- Matt Stevens: Prop, Club: Bath\n- Phil Vickery (c): Prop, Club: Wasps\n\nWait, Steve Borthwick is listed under the lock position. Let me double-check that. Yes, in row 8, it says \"steve borthwick\" with position \"lock\". His club is Bath, according to column 4.\n\nSo, the claim states he's a prop for Leicester, but according to the table, he's a lock for Bath. That means the claim has two inaccuracies: his position and his club.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are Steve Borthwick's row, specifically the \"position\" and \"club/province\" columns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"club/province\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the position of the player born on 2 November 1987 be fly-half, and the only one for a sale player.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which player was born on 2 November 1987. Looking through the table, I'll go row by row checking the \"date of birth (age)\" column. \n\n- The first few rows don't have that date. Then I see \"danny cipriani\" with a birthdate of 2 november 1987. That's the one.\n\nNext, I check his position. According to the table, Danny Cipriani is a fly-half, which matches the claim. So far, so good.\n\nNow, the second part of the claim says he's the only Sale player with that birthdate and position. Wait, looking at Danny Cipriani's club/province, it's listed as \"wasps,\" not \"sale.\" Hmm, that doesn't align with the claim. \n\nBut wait, I should double-check if there are any other players from Sale who were born on 2 November 1987 and play fly-half. Scanning through the table again:\n\n- Looking at all entries for \"fly- half\" under position:\n   - Danny Cipriani (Wasps)\n   - Shane Geraghty (London Irish)\n   - Charlie Hodgson (Sale)\n   \nWait, Charlie Hodgson is a fly-half and plays for Sale. His birthdate is 12 November 1980, which doesn't match the claim's date of 2 November 1987. So he's not the one.\n\nBut Danny Cipriani is a fly-half from Wasps, so there are no Sale players in the table who were born on that specific date and play fly-half. Therefore, the part about being the only Sale player doesn't hold because there isn't even one; the claim might be confusing or misstated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"the only 1 for a sale player,\" which could mean that among all players born on that date, he's the only one from Sale. But since Danny Cipriani is from Wasps, and no other player born on 2 November 1987 is in the table except him, there might be an error here.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the claim meant that among fly-half players, Danny is the only one from Sale. But looking back, Charlie Hodgson is a fly-half from Sale but born on a different date. So the claim's specifics don't align correctly because Danny isn't from Sale, and no one else in the table fits both being a fly-half, born on that date, and from Sale.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two parts: position and uniqueness as a Sale player. The first part is correct (Danny Cipriani is a fly-half), but the second part isn't because he's not from Sale. So the entire claim isn't fully supported.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"date of birth (age)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 40, \"column_name\": \"club/province\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
