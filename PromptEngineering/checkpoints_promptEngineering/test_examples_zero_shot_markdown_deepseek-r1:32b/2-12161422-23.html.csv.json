    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"kevin murray be the only player who have a 3 year break in between\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Kevin Murray is the only player with a three-year break during his career span.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player and their details, including \"career span.\" The career spans are listed in years, sometimes with breaks indicated by commas.\n\nI should examine each player's career span to check for any breaks. The claim specifically mentions Kevin Murray, so I'll start with him.\n\nKevin Murray is in row 9. His career span is listed as \"1955 - 1964 , 1967 - 1974.\" There are two periods here: 1955 to 1964 and then from 1967 to 1974. The break between them is from 1965 to 1966, which is a two-year gap, not three years. So, the claim says he has a three-year break, but according to this data, it's only a two-year break.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me count: From 1964 to 1967, that's three years (1965, 1966, 1967). But the second period starts in 1967, so actually, the break is from 1964-12-31 to 1967-01-01. Depending on how you count, that could be considered three years (inclusive), but typically, a break between two periods would exclude the start and end years. So from 1965 to 1966 is two full years.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other players have breaks in their career spans. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 1: Michael Tuck - single span without a break.\n- Row 2: Kevin Bartlett - same.\n- Row 3: Robert Harvey - single span.\n- Row 4: Dustin Fletcher - present, no break noted.\n- Row 5: Craig Bradley - single span.\n- Row 6: Brad Johnson - single span.\n- Row 7: Brent Harvey - present, no break.\n- Row 8: Andrew McLeod - single span.\n- Row 9: Kevin Murray - as discussed.\n- Row 10: Adam Goodes - present, no break.\n- Row 11: Ian Nankervis - single span.\n- Row 12: Simon Black - present, no break.\n- Row 13: Tony Shaw - single span.\n- Row 14: David Neitz - single span.\n- Row 15: Matthew Pavlich - present, no break.\n- Row 16: Glen Jakovich - single span.\n- Row 17: Kane Cornes - present, no break.\n- Row 18: Roger Merrett - single span.\n- Row 19: Bert Hurrey - single span.\n- Row 20: Gary Ablett - present, no break.\n- Row 21: Jonathan Giles - present, no break.\n\nOnly Kevin Murray has a period listed as two separate spans. However, the break is only two years, not three. Therefore, the claim that he's the only player with a three-year break is false because there is no three-year break in his career span, and no other players have any breaks at all.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"career span\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Scanning through the table:\n\n- Michael Tuck is at row index 0 (the first data row), with 426 games.\n- Kevin Bartlett is at row index 1, with 403 games.\n\nThe claim states that Michael played 23 more games than Kevin. Let me calculate the difference: 426 - 403 = 23. That matches exactly what the claim says.\n\nSo, since the numbers in the table support the claim, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to note the relevant cells used for this verification. These are:\n\n- For Michael Tuck: row index 0, column \"games\".\n- For Kevin Bartlett: row index 1, column \"games\".\n\nThat's all I need.

Looking at the rows:\n\n- Michael Tuck is in row 0 with a career span of 1972 - 1991.\n- Brad Johnson is in row 6 with a career span of 1994 - 2010.\n\nNext, I'll calculate each player's career duration. For Michael Tuck, subtracting the start year from the end year: 1991 - 1972 = 19 years. But wait, since both years are inclusive, I should add 1 to include the starting year. So, 19 + 1 = 20 years.\n\nFor Brad Johnson, it's 2010 - 1994 = 16 years. Again, adding 1 gives 17 years.\n\nNow, checking if Michael Tuck's career is 3 years longer than Brad Johnson's: 20 (Michael) vs. 17 (Brad). The difference is exactly 3 years.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"as of the september 2013 source, 8 players on the list be still play.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It mentions September 2013 as the source date, so I should look at data that reflects player statuses around that time. The key point is identifying how many players were still playing as of that date.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column named \"career span\" which shows when each player started and ended their career. If the end year is listed as \"present,\" it implies they were still active in 2013 because the data source is from September 2013. Conversely, if their career span ends before 2013 or has a specific ending year, they wouldn't be considered active.\n\nI'll go through each row to check the \"career span\" and see which players were still playing in 2013:\n\n1. Michael Tuck: Career from 1972 - 1991 \u2192 retired long before 2013.\n2. Kevin Bartlett: 1965 - 1983 \u2192 retired.\n3. Robert Harvey: 1988 - 2008 \u2192 retired by 2008.\n4. Dustin Fletcher: 1993 - present (as of 2013, he was still playing).\n5. Simon Madden: 1974 - 1992 \u2192 retired.\n6. Craig Bradley: 1986 - 2002 \u2192 retired.\n7. Brad Johnson: 1994 - 2010 \u2192 retired by 2010.\n8. Brent Harvey: 1996 - present (active in 2013).\n9. Andrew McLeod: 1995 - 2010 \u2192 retired.\n10. Kevin Murray: 1955-1964 and 1967-1974 \u2192 retired long ago.\n11. Adam Goodes: 1999 - present (active in 2013).\n12. Ian Nankervis: 1967 - 1983 \u2192 retired.\n13. Simon Black: 1998 - present (active in 2013).\n14. Tony Shaw: 1977 - 1994 \u2192 retired.\n15. David Neitz: 1993 - 2008 \u2192 retired.\n16. Matthew Pavlich: 2001 - present (active in 2013).\n17. Kane Cornes: 1997 - present (active in 2013).\n18. Roger Merrett: 1988 - 1996 \u2192 retired.\n19. Bert Hurrey: 1908-1913 \u2192 definitely retired.\n20. Gary Ablett: 2011 - present (active in 2013).\n21. Jonathan Giles: 2012 - present (active in 2013).\n\nNow, let's count the players still active as of September 2013:\n\n- Dustin Fletcher (row 4)\n- Brent Harvey (row 7)\n- Adam Goodes (row 10)\n- Simon Black (row 12)\n- Matthew Pavlich (row 15)\n- Kane Cornes (row 17)\n- Gary Ablett (row 20)\n- Jonathan Giles (row 21)\n\nThat's a total of 8 players who were still playing in September 2013.

The claim says, \"essendon be the club when dustin fletcher and simon madden be the player.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden are players from the Essendon club. So, my task is to check if both of these players are indeed associated with Essendon as per the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has details about a player including their rank, games played, name, club, and career span. The relevant columns for this claim would be \"player\" and \"club.\"\n\nI'll start by searching through the rows to find Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Row 3: Dustin Fletcher is listed with Essendon as his club.\n- Continuing down, row 4 also mentions Simon Madden, and his club is Essendon as well. \n\nSo both players are indeed from Essendon according to the table. There's no conflicting information here. \n\nNow, I need to make sure there are no other entries that might confuse this. For example, checking if either player has a different club listed elsewhere. But in this case, each of them is only listed once with Essendon as their club.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because both players are associated with Essendon.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden play for Essendon.

Looking at the \"player\" column, I find Kevin Murray listed at row index 9 (since rows are zero-indexed). The relevant columns here are \"player\", \"club\", and \"career span\".\n\nNext, I need to examine his career span. According to the table, his career span is listed as \"1955 - 1964, 1967 - 1974\". This indicates that there's a break between these two periods.\n\nCalculating the gap: from 1964 to 1967. That's a three-year break (1965, 1966, 1967).

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"kevin bartlett played 23 more games than michael tuck did in their career\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns and rows for both players mentioned: Kevin Bartlett and Michael Tuck. The table has a column named \"games,\" which indicates the number of games each player participated in during their career.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Michael Tuck, he is listed in row 0 (assuming the first data row after headers is index 0). The \"games\" column shows he played 426 games.\n  \n- Kevin Bartlett is in row 1. His \"games\" count is 403.\n\nThe claim says that Kevin Bartlett played 23 more games than Michael Tuck. To verify this, I need to calculate the difference between their game counts. So, let's subtract Kevin's games from Michael's: 426 (Michael) - 403 (Kevin) = 23. \n\nWait, that gives a result of 23, which suggests that Michael played 23 more games than Kevin. However, the claim states the opposite\u2014that Kevin played 23 more. This would mean the difference should be positive if we subtract in the correct order.\n\nLet me double-check: If we calculate Kevin's games minus Michael's games, it's 403 - 426 = -23. A negative number here indicates that Kevin actually played fewer games than Michael by 23. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because Kevin did not play more games; he played fewer.\n\nSo, based on these calculations, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are the \"games\" column for both row 0 (Michael Tuck) and row 1 (Kevin Bartlett).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Kevin Bartlett played 23 more games than Michael Tuck, but according to the table, Michael Tuck played 426 games and Kevin Bartlett played 403.

The claim is: \"michael tuck's career span be 3 year shorter than brad johnson's.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table provided and find the relevant information for both players.\n\nMichael Tuck is listed in row 0 (since tables usually start counting from 0). His career span is given as 1972 - 1991. To calculate the duration, I subtract 1972 from 1991, which gives me 19 years.\n\nNext, Brad Johnson is in row 5. His career span is listed as 1994 - 2010. Calculating that, 2010 minus 1994 equals 16 years.\n\nWait a second, the claim says Michael Tuck's career span should be 3 years shorter than Brad Johnson's. But according to my calculations, Michael played for 19 years and Brad for 16 years. That means Michael's career is actually longer by 3 years, not shorter. \n\nSo the claim is saying that Michael's time is 3 years less than Brad's, but in reality, it's the opposite. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake here because sometimes when calculating spans, people subtract the start year from the end year and then add one if they count both the starting and ending years as full years. Let me check that again.\n\nFor Michael Tuck: 1972 to 1991 is (1991 - 1972) + 1 = 20 years.\nBrad Johnson: 1994 to 2010 is (2010 - 1994) + 1 = 17 years.\n\nHmm, that's still a difference of 3 years in the opposite direction. Michael's career was longer by 3 years than Brad's. So regardless of whether we add one or not, the conclusion remains the same\u2014the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Michael Tuck's career span is three years shorter than Brad Johnson's. However, Michael played for 19 (or 20) years while Brad played for 16 (or 17), meaning Michael's career was longer by three years.

Still active in 2013.\n\nNow, let's count how many players were retired by September 2013:\n\nLooking at each row:\n- Row 1: Retired\n- Row 2: Retired\n- Row 3: Retired\n- Row 4: Not retired\n- Row 5: Retired\n- Row 6: Retired\n- Row 7: Retired\n- Row 8: Not retired\n- Row 9: Retired\n- Row 10: Retired\n- Row 11: Not retired\n- Row 12: Retired\n- Row 13: Not retired\n- Row 14: Retired\n- Row 15: Retired\n- Row 16: Not retired\n- Row 17: Retired\n- Row 18: Not retired\n- Row 19: Retired\n- Row 20: Retired (though this row is beyond the initial list, as per numbering)\n\nWait, in the table provided, there are only 22 rows. Let me recount without confusion.\n\nLet's go through each player again:\n\n1. Michael Tuck - retired\n2. Kevin Bartlett - retired\n3. Robert Harvey - retired\n4. Dustin Fletcher - active\n5. Simon Madden - retired\n6. Craig Bradley - retired\n7. Brad Johnson - retired\n8. Brent Harvey - active\n9. Andrew McLeod - retired\n10. Kevin Murray - retired\n11. Adam Goodes - active\n12. Ian Nankervis - retired\n13. Simon Black - active\n14. Tony Shaw - retired\n15. David Neitz - retired\n16. Matthew Pavlich - active\n17. Glen Jakovich - retired\n18. Kane Cornes - active\n19. Roger Merrett - retired\n20. Bert Hurrey - retired\n21. Gary Ablett - active\n22. Jonathan Giles - active\n\nNow, counting the retired players:\n\nRows 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,12,14,15,17,19,20 are retired.\n\nThat's a total of 14 retired players as of September 2013. The claim states that 8 were retired, but according to this count, it's 14. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again:\n\nRows with \"present\" are active, others are retired.\n\nCounting each row where career span does not end at \"present\":\n\nRow 1: 1972-1991 - retired\nRow 2: 1965-1983 - retired\nRow 3: 1988-2008 - retired\nRow 4: present, active\nRow 5: 1974-1992 - retired\nRow 6: 1986-2002 - retired\nRow 7: 1994-2010 - retired\nRow 8: present, active\nRow 9: 1995-2010 - retired (assuming as of Sep 2013, yes)\nRow 10: two spans ending in 1964 and 1974 - retired\nRow 11: present, active\nRow 12: 1967-1983 - retired\nRow 13: present, active\nRow 14: 1977-1994 - retired\nRow 15: 1993-2008 - retired\nRow 16: present, active\nRow 17: 1991-2004 - retired\nRow 18: present, active\nRow 19: 1988-1996 - retired\nRow 20: 1908-1913 - retired\nRow 21: present, active\nRow 22: present, active\n\nSo total retired players are rows 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,12,14,15,17,19,20. That's 14 players.\n\nBut the claim says 8 were retired. So the answer is FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted or misunderstood the claim. The claim might mean that 8 players had already retired by September 2013, but according to my count, it's more than 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some players are still active beyond 2013, but as of Sep 2013, their status is \"present,\" meaning they were still playing then. So the count should be correct.\n\nTherefore, since the number of retired players is higher than 8, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row\": 1, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 2, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 3, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 5, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 6, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 7, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 9, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 10, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 12, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 14, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 15, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 17, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 19, \"column\": \"Career Span\"},\n     {\"row\": 20, \"column\": \"Career Span\"}\n   ]\n}\n\nThe claim that only 8 players were retired by September 2013 is incorrect. According to the data, there are 14 players who had already retired as of that date.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"st kilda be the club when dustin fletcher and simon madden be the player.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It seems like it's saying that both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden play for St Kilda. But wait, looking at the table, I should check each player's club to verify.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Row 4: Dustin Fletcher is listed under Essendon.\n- Row 5: Simon Madden is also listed under Essendon.\n\nSo both of them are with Essendon, not St Kilda. The claim mentions St Kilda as their club, which doesn't align with what's in the table.\n\nWait, row 3 shows Robert Harvey playing for St Kilda. So maybe there was a mix-up? But no, the players mentioned in the claim are Fletcher and Madden, who are both with Essendon.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because neither Dustin Fletcher nor Simon Madden are associated with St Kilda based on the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that both Dustin Fletcher and Simon Madden play for St Kilda when they are actually with Essendon. Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"club\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"player\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"player\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
