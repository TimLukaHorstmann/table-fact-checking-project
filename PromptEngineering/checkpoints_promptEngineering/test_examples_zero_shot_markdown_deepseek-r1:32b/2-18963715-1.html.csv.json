    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"neil labute be nominate for best play in 2009\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, and result. The rows are indexed starting from 0.\n\nThe claim mentions Neil Labute being nominated for \"best play\" in 2009. So, I need to check each row where the year is 2009, the award ceremony could be anything, but the category should be \"best play,\" and see if the nominee's name matches Neil Labute.\n\nLooking at the first row (index 0), the year is 2009, the award ceremony is Tony Award, and the category is \"best play.\" The nominee listed here is Neil Labute, and the result is \"nominated.\" That seems to directly support the claim. So this row should be relevant.\n\nI'll also check other rows to make sure there's no conflicting information or other nominations for the same award that might affect the conclusion. Rows 1 through 3 are about different categories like performance by leading actor and featured actress, so they don't affect the \"best play\" category. Rows 4,5,6 refer to Drama Desk and Theatre World awards, which are separate from the Tony Awards in this context.\n\nTherefore, only row 0 is relevant because it directly ties Neil Labute's nomination for best play at the Tony Awards in 2009.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the table. The first row shows that Neil Labute was nominated for \"best play\" in 2009 at the Tony Award.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"award ceremony\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim is: \"reason to be pretty be nominate for best play more than 1 time.\" Hmm, first off, I need to parse this correctly because there's a typo or maybe some confusion in the wording.\n\nLet me break it down. The user probably meant something like \"Reason to Be Pretty was nominated for Best Play more than once.\" So, focusing on that: is the play \"Reason to Be Pretty\" (or similar) nominated multiple times for Best Play awards?\n\nLooking at the table, I see two entries under the Tony Award category. The first one is in 2009, with the category being \"best play,\" and the nominee is Neil LaBute. The second entry in the same year under Tony Award is \"best performance by a leading actor in a play,\" which is Thomas Sadoski. Then there's another for Marin Ireland as well.\n\nWait, so only one nomination for Best Play in 2009. But are there any other years? The table only has data from 2009. So the claim is suggesting that it was nominated more than once, but according to this table, it was only nominated once for Best Play. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the first row where the category is \"best play\" and the result is \"nominated.\" That's just one instance. Since there are no other entries for Best Play in different years or multiple times in 2009, it hasn't been nominated more than once as per this table.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE because the claim isn't supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"reason to be pretty\" was nominated for Best Play more than once. Checking the table, there's only one nomination under \"best play.\" Therefore, the claim is not supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"thomas sadoski be nominate for best performance by a lead actor in a play in 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. The key points are:\n\n1. The person involved is Thomas Sadoski.\n2. He was nominated (not necessarily won) for an award.\n3. The category is \"best performance by a lead actor in a play.\"\n4. This happened in the year 2009.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to see if there's any matching information.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 1: It mentions Thomas Sadoski nominated for \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\" in 2009. That seems like a match.\n  \nWait, let me double-check the exact wording. The claim says \"lead actor,\" and the table uses \"leading actor.\" Are these equivalent? Yes, I think they are referring to the same role. So this row supports the claim.\n\nAre there any other relevant rows?\n\nRow 0 mentions Neil LaBute for best play\u2014doesn't involve Sadoski.\nRow 2 is about Marin Ireland in a different category.\nRows 3-5 relate to Drama Desk Awards, but only row 4 is about Thomas Sadoski again. It's the same year and similar award, but the wording here is \"outstanding actor in a play.\" That also fits the claim.\n\nWait, so both rows 1 and 4 mention Thomas Sadoski being nominated for acting awards in 2009. But does that affect our assessment? The claim is about being nominated for best performance by a lead actor, which matches row 1 directly.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm capturing the correct relevant cells. So for this claim, the key row is row 1 because it's specifically the Tony Award category matching the description in the claim.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The claim is TRUE because Thomas Sadoski was indeed nominated for \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\" at the 2009 Tony Awards. The relevant cell is row 1 (index starting from 0?), wait no\u2014the table starts with year as first column, so let me recount:\n\nWait, looking back at the table structure, each row has: year, award ceremony, category, nominee, result.\n\nSo for Thomas Sadoski's nomination in the Tony Awards for best leading actor, that's the second row (index 1). The relevant cells would be the ones under 'category' and 'nominee' perhaps?\n\nWait no\u2014the claim is about being nominated. So we need to check if he was nominated in that category.\n\nSo the cell with \"best performance by a leading actor in a play\" is the category, which matches, and \"Thomas Sadoski\" as nominee, with result \"nominated.\"\n\nThus, the relevant cells are:\n\n- row_index: 1 (since it's the second row), column_name: \"category\" and \"nominee.\" But wait, according to instructions, we need to list each cell that helps verify the claim.\n\nBut perhaps just including the rows where his nomination is mentioned. Alternatively, maybe multiple cells in that row.\n\nWait no\u2014the user asked for a list of objects with row_index and column_name for each relevant cell.\n\nSo, looking at row 1:\n\n- The 'nominee' column shows Thomas Sadoski.\n- The 'category' column shows the specific award category he was nominated for.\n\nAdditionally, the 'result' is \"nominated,\" which confirms that it's a nomination, not a win. So all these cells are relevant to confirm each part of the claim: year (2009), nominee name, category, and result.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I need to list each cell that helps verify the claim. So for row 1:\n\n- \"year\": 2009\n- \"nominee\": Thomas Sadoski\n- \"category\": best performance by a leading actor in a play\n- \"result\": nominated\n\nSo all these columns are relevant.\n\nBut perhaps the answer expects only the specific cells that directly address each part of the claim. The claim mentions \"nominated\" so we need to check the 'result' column. It also mentions the category, so that's another cell. The nominee is Thomas Sadoski, which is in the 'nominee' column.\n\nSo all three columns (year, nominee, category, result) are relevant.\n\nWait, but row 4 of the table (index 3) also has Thomas Sadoski nominated for Drama Desk Award, which might also be related. So does that affect our answer?\n\nBut the claim is specifically about being nominated in a play category, and both Tony and Drama Desk awards fall under that. However, the claim doesn't specify the award ceremony, just that he was nominated in 2009.\n\nTherefore, row 1 (Tony Award) and row 4 (Drama Desk) both show nominations for Thomas Sadoski in acting categories in 2009.\n\nWait, but the Drama Desk category is \"outstanding actor in a play,\" which also fits. So actually, there are two relevant rows where he was nominated.\n\nSo I need to include both row 1 and row 4 as relevant cells because they both show that Thomas Sadoski was nominated for acting awards in 2009, fitting the claim's description.\n\nThus, each of these rows would have their respective columns (year, nominee, category, result) as relevant. However, perhaps just including the specific cells that match the claim's elements: year, nominee name, and category.\n\nBut to keep it simple, maybe just include all four columns for both rows where he was nominated.\n\nWait no\u2014the user said to list each cell in the table, meaning row index and column name for each relevant cell. So if a cell is used to verify any part of the claim, we list its row index and column name.\n\nSo, looking at row 1 (index 0?), wait let me check:\n\nThe table has rows starting from 0?\n\nWait, no\u2014the first data row is |2009| tony award | best play | neil labute | nominated |\n\nThat's row 0. Then the next row is Thomas Sadoski in Tony Awards: row 1.\n\nSo for row 1:\n\n- column \"year\" (value 2009)\n- column \"nominee\" (Thomas Sadoski)\n- column \"category\" (best performance by a leading actor in a play)\n- column \"result\" (nominated)\n\nSimilarly, row 4 is Drama Desk award for outstanding actor in a play: same year and nominee.\n\nSo row 3 is the first Drama Desk entry, row 4 is the second.\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nRow indices:\n\n0: neil labute, best play\n1: thomas sadoski, leading actor (Tony)\n2: marin ireland, featured actress (Tony)\n3: outstanding play (Drama Desk)\n4: thomas sadoski, outstanding actor (Drama Desk)\n5: terry kinney, director (Drama Desk)\n6: marin ireland, theatre world award\n\nSo the relevant rows are 1 and 4.\n\nEach of these rows has cells that confirm different parts of the claim. So for each row, we need to list the year, nominee, category, and result.\n\nBut in this case, both rows 1 and 4 have the same year (2009), same nominee (Thomas Sadoski), and their respective categories and results as 'nominated.'\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor row 1:\n- \"year\": 2009\n- \"nominee\": Thomas Sadoski\n- \"category\": best performance by a leading actor in a play\n- \"result\": nominated\n\nFor row 4:\n- \"year\": 2009\n- \"nominee\": Thomas Sadoski\n- \"category\": outstanding actor in a play\n- \"result\": nominated\n\nSo each of these cells is relevant because they confirm that in 2009, Thomas Sadoski was nominated for acting awards related to plays.\n\nTherefore, the list would include all four columns from both rows.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to just mention the specific cells that directly correspond to each element in the claim: year, name, category, and that he was nominated. Since the same applies to both rows, we can include them all.\n\nSo compiling all relevant cells:\n\n- row 1 (index 1), columns: \"year\", \"nominee\", \"category\", \"result\"\n- row 4 (index 4), columns: \"year\", \"nominee\", \"category\", \"result\"\n\nBut perhaps the answer expects just listing each cell once, but given they are in different rows, we need to list all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to include both entries since both confirm that he was nominated twice in 2009 for acting roles in plays.\n\nSo final answer would be a list of cells from both row 1 and row 4.\n</think>\n\nTo address the task, we identified two relevant rows where Thomas Sadoski was nominated in 2009 for acting awards related to plays. Each of these rows provides details confirming his nominations, including the year, his name as the nominee, the specific category, and that he was indeed nominated.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n- **Row 1 (Index 1):**\n  - Year: 2009\n  - Nominee: Thomas Sadoski\n  - Category: Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\n  - Result: Nominated\n\n- **Row 4 (Index 4):**\n  - Year: 2009\n  - Nominee: Thomas Sadoski\n  - Category: Outstanding Actor in a Play\n  - Result: Nominated\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe cells confirming Thomas Sadoski's nominations are:\n\n```\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n]\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony\". Hmm, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's trying to say that before 2009, Reason to Be Pretty was the only one with a nominee at the Drama Desk Awards.\n\nLooking at the table, I see data from 2009 for both Tony and Drama Desk awards. Let me check each row related to the Drama Desk Award.\n\nRow 3: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, nominee is \"outstanding play\", but that's probably a placeholder or maybe just indicating the category. Not sure about the actual show title here. Wait, actually, in this context, it might mean the play was nominated without listing the specific play name.\n\nRows 4 and 5 are also Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Actor in a Play (Thomas Sadoski) and Outstanding Director of a Play (Terry Kinney). All these were nominated but didn't win.\n\nWait, so the table shows that in 2009, there were multiple nominees from \"Reason to Be Pretty\" at the Drama Desk Awards. So before 2009, was this the only year? Or is the claim saying that prior to 2009, Reason to Be Pretty had a nominee?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me parse it again: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony\". So the claim is stating that before 2009, Reason to Be Pretty was the only one with a nomination at the Drama Desk Awards.\n\nBut looking at the table, all the nominations are in 2009. There's no data for years before 2009. Therefore, we can't confirm if there were any nominations before that year. The claim implies that 2009 was the first time, but without prior data, we can't verify it.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see: the table only has entries for 2009. So, according to this data, in 2009, Reason to Be Pretty had several nominees at the Drama Desk Awards. The claim is saying that before 2009, it was the only year with a nominee. But since we don't have any years prior to 2009 in the table, we can't confirm if there were any other years or not.\n\nWait no, actually, the claim says \"before 2009 be the only year\". That would mean that the only time Reason to Be Pretty was nominated before 2009. But since all the data is from 2009, we can't verify if there were any prior years. So the claim isn't supported by the table because there's no information about years before 2009.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the claim is that in 2009, Reason to Be Pretty was the only nominee at the Drama Desk Awards. But looking at the table, it shows multiple nominees: Outstanding Play, Thomas Sadoski for acting, and Terry Kinney for directing. So if the claim suggests that they were the only ones, but actually there are others, then the claim would be false.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's break down the claim again:\n\n\"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony\"\n\nSo it's saying that prior to 2009, the only time Reason to Be Pretty had a nomination was in that year. But since the table doesn't include any data before 2009, we can't confirm if there were other years or not.\n\nWait no, perhaps I should read \"before 2009\" as \"in 2009\". Maybe it's a translation issue. Alternatively, maybe the claim is that in 2009, Reason to Be Pretty was the only nominee at the Drama Desk Awards. But looking at the table, there are multiple nominees from that production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check which cells are relevant. The claim mentions \"drama desk award ceremony\", so I should look for rows where 'award ceremony' is 'drama desk award'. That's rows 3,4,5.\n\nThe claim says \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee\". But all these are in 2009. So perhaps the claim is incorrect because it refers to before 2009 when the data shows it's in 2009.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is trying to say that Reason to Be Pretty had a nomination only in 2009 at the Drama Desk Awards, meaning no prior years. But since we don't have data for earlier years, we can't confirm that. Therefore, the table doesn't support the claim as it lacks information about previous years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because the table shows multiple nominations in 2009, not just one. So if the claim says \"only\" nominee, but there are three, then it's false.\n\nWait, I think I need to approach this differently. Let me look at each part of the claim:\n\n1. The time frame: before 2009.\n2. It was the only year that Reason to Be Pretty had a nominee at the Drama Desk Awards.\n\nBut the table only has data for 2009, so we don't know about years before. Therefore, the claim can't be verified based on this table alone. But since the instruction is to determine if it's TRUE or FALSE based on the given table, and the table doesn't provide any information about prior years, perhaps the answer is FALSE because there's no evidence supporting that 2009 was the only year.\n\nWait, but maybe the claim is misinterpreted. Let me think again: \"before 2009 be the only year...\" Maybe it's saying that in all years before 2009, Reason to Be Pretty had a nominee at the Drama Desk Awards. But since our data starts at 2009 and there are no prior entries, we can't confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because in 2009, they had multiple nominations, not just one, so \"only\" might be misleading.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check which cells relate to Drama Desk Awards and nominees.\n\nRelevant rows are 3,4,5. Each has 'nominated' as result. So in 2009, they had multiple nominations. The claim says that before 2009, it was the only year with a nominee, but since we don't have data before 2009, we can't confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is incorrect because the table shows that Reason to Be Pretty had multiple nominees in 2009, not just one. So if the claim implies only one nomination, it's false.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. The claim says: \"before 2009 be the only year that reason to be pretty have a nominee at the drama desk award ceremony.\"\n\nSo it's stating that in all years before 2009, Reason to Be Pretty had a nominee. But our table doesn't include any data for years before 2009, so we can't confirm this claim.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is trying to say that the only time they had a nomination was in 2009, meaning no prior or subsequent years. Since we don't have data beyond 2009, but the table doesn't support the claim of being the only year before 2009.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that since all the nominations are in 2009 and not earlier, if the claim is about before 2009, then there's no evidence. So maybe the answer is FALSE because the table doesn't show any prior years, making the claim unsupported.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check: The award ceremony is Drama Desk, and in 2009, they had multiple nominees. If the claim says that before 2009 was the only year with a nomination, but our data doesn't include any prior years, so we can't confirm it.\n\nI think I'm stuck here. Let me see which cells to mark as relevant: Rows 3,4,5 are Drama Desk Awards in 2009. So these are the relevant rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions \"before 2009\" but the provided data only includes information from 2009. Since there's no data about years prior to 2009, we can't verify if Reason to Be Pretty had nominations before that year. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the given table.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim cannot be confirmed with the provided data as it lacks information on years before 2009.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The claim refers to years before 2009, but the table only provides data for 2009.
