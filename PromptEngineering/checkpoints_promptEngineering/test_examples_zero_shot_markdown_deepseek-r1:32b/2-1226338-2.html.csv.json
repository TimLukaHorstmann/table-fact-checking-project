    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"marc surer score 4 more point in 1985 compare to 1984\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify relevant columns: year, entrant, chassis, engine, points. The claim mentions Marc Surer's points in two specific years, so I should focus on the 'year' and 'points' columns.\n\nLooking for entries from 1984 and 1985:\n\n- For 1984, there are two rows:\n  - Row 8: Entrant \"barclay nordica arrows bmw\", Points = 1\n  - Row 9: Same entrant but different chassis, Points = 1\n\nTotal points for 1984: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- For 1985:\n  - Row 10: Entrant \"motor racing developments ltd\", Points = 5\n\nSo, in 1985, the team scored 5 points. Comparing to 1984's total of 2 points, the increase is 3 points (5 - 2 = 3), not 4.\n\nThe claim states Marc Surer scored 4 more points in 1985 than in 1984, but according to the table, it's only a 3-point difference. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are the points from both years:\n- 1984: Points from row 8 and 9\n- 1985: Points from row 10\n\nSo, relevant cells include rows 8, 9, and 10 with column 'points'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, the table lists information about different years, entrants, chassis, engines, and points scored. The claim is about Marc Surer scoring a total of 5 points in both 1985 and 1986. Wait, but looking at the table, I don't see any mention of \"marc surer\" or any driver names listed. All the rows have entrants like team ensign, team ats, etc., but no individual drivers are mentioned.\n\nSo, without any data on Marc Surer in the table, it's impossible to determine if he scored 5 points in those years. The points column shows the total for each entrant per year, not individual drivers. Therefore, the claim can't be verified because there's no relevant information about Marc Surer in the provided table.\n\nSince the claim refers to a person who isn't listed in the table and we don't have any data related to him, I should mark this as FALSE. Also, there are no relevant cells to support or refute the claim because the necessary information isn't present.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified due to the absence of Marc Surer's data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"marc surer score 4 point 1 time less than he score 0 point.\" Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the table lists various F1 teams and their points from 1979 to 1986. Each row has details like year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. But I don't see any mention of \"marc surer\" in the table. Marc Surer is a known F1 driver, but looking through the entrants listed here\u2014like team ensign, ats, theodore racing team, arrows, barclay nordica arrows bmw, motor racing developments ltd, and barclay arrows bmw\u2014I don't see his name anywhere.\n\nSo, if Marc Surer isn't in the table, how can we verify anything about his points? The claim talks about him scoring 4 points once and 0 points another time. Without any data about him, we can't confirm or deny those specifics. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could it be that one of these teams had Marc Surer as a driver in the years listed? For example, looking at arrows racing team from 1982 to 1986\u2014maybe he was part of that team during that period. But even if that's true, the table only shows points for the team, not individual drivers. So each row under \"points\" represents the team's total points for the season, not per driver.\n\nTherefore, without any specific data about Marc Surer's personal performance in these teams, we can't verify whether he scored 4 points once or 0 points at all. The claim is based on information that isn't present in the table. \n\nSo, since the necessary details aren't available here to support the claim, I think the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified as there's no data about Marc Surer in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"marc surer score the same amount of point in both race in 1981\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions Marc Surer. I know that Marc Surer was a Formula One driver, but looking at the table, I don't see any mention of his name. The entrant column lists team names like \"team ensign\" or \"theodore racing team,\" but no individual drivers are listed. So, this might be an issue because without knowing which rows correspond to Marc Surer's races, I can't directly check his points.\n\nNext, the claim refers to both races in 1981. Looking at the table, there are two entries for 1981:\n- Row 3: ensign racing with chassis ensign n180b and engine cosworth v8, scoring 4 points.\n- Row 4: theodore racing team with chassis theodore ty01 and same engine, also 4 points.\n\nSince both teams in 1981 scored 4 points each, if Marc Surer was driving for both these teams or participated in both races, then he would have the same points. However, without knowing which driver is associated with each entry, I can't confirm that it's Marc Surer who scored those points.\n\nTherefore, the table doesn't provide information about individual drivers' points; it only shows team points. So, I cannot verify if Marc Surer specifically scored the same points in both races of 1981 based on this data alone.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because the table does not include driver names, only team entries and their respective points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It only lists teams and their corresponding points each year.\n\nThe claim mentions two races in 1981 where Marc Surer scored a total of 8 points. However, the table for 1981 shows two entries: Ensuring Racing with 4 points and Theodore Racing Team also with 4 points. Each entry is likely representing one race or perhaps a team's performance throughout the year.\n\nWait, but the points are per team, not per driver. So even if Marc Surer was part of these teams, the table doesn't provide individual driver points\u2014it only shows team points. Without data on drivers or their individual scores, I can't confirm that Marc Surer scored 8 points in total across two races.\n\nTherefore, since the relevant cells (the points for 1981) don't include information about Marc Surer or individual driver points, the claim isn't supported by the table.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Marc Surer and compares his points in two years: 1986 and 1983. The claim states that in 1986, he scored twice as many points as he did in 1983.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I need to check for any entries related to Marc Surer. However, upon reviewing the table, I notice that none of the rows list \"Marc Surer\" under the 'entrant' column. The entrants listed are teams like Team Ensign, Team ATS, Ension Racing, etc., but no individual driver names are mentioned.\n\nSince there's no mention of Marc Surer in the table, we don't have any data points about his performance in 1983 or 1986. Without this information, it's impossible to verify whether he scored twice as many points in 1986 compared to 1983.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, the claim cannot be supported and must be considered FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any entries related to Marc Surer, so there is no data to support the claim. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"marc surer score a total of 6 point in 1986 3 more than in 1985\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Marc Surer scoring a total of 6 points in 1986, which was 3 more than he scored in 1985. So, I have two things to check: his points in 1986 and whether that's exactly 3 more than his points in 1985.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by identifying the rows corresponding to 1985 and 1986. \n\nFor 1985:\n- The row is: \"motor racing developments ltd | brabham bt54 | bmw str - 4 t / c | 5 points.\"\nSo in 1985, the team scored 5 points.\n\nFor 1986:\n- The row is: \"barclay arrows bmw | arrows a8 | bmw str - 4 t / c | 0 points.\"\nHere, the team scored 0 points.\n\nNow, according to the claim, Marc Surer scored 6 points in 1986. However, looking at the table, the entry for 1986 shows 0 points. This means that either Marc Surer didn't participate in 1986 or the team he was part of didn't score any points that year.\n\nNext, checking if 1986's points are 3 more than 1985's: 1985 had 5 points, so adding 3 would give 8. But according to the table, 1986 has 0 points, which is actually 5 less, not 3 more.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider whether Marc Surer's points are specifically mentioned in the table. The table doesn't list individual drivers but rather teams and constructors. Therefore, without information about individual drivers' points, it's impossible to verify Marc Surer's personal score based solely on this table.\n\nGiven that the team's points for 1986 are 0 (not 6) and that 1985 had 5 points (which doesn't align with the claim of 1986 being 3 more than 1985), the claim is not supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because, according to the table, in 1986 the team scored 0 points, and in 1985 they scored 5 points. Therefore, Marc Surer did not score 6 points in 1986, nor was it 3 more than his 1985 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim step by step. It seems like it's talking about Marc Surer's points. The phrase \"score 6 point 2 time more than he score 2 point in total\" might be a bit confusing, but I think it means that Marc scored 6 points twice, which is two times more than scoring 2 points once or something similar. Or perhaps it's saying he had two instances where he scored 6 points each, making the total higher than if he had only scored 2 points.\n\nWait, maybe another way to interpret it: \"score 6 point 2 time\" could mean that Marc scored 6 points on two occasions, and this was more than when he scored 2 points in total. So perhaps his total from scoring 6 twice is higher than a single score of 2 points?\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns for year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. There's no direct mention of drivers or specific racers like Marc Surer in this table. The \"entrant\" column lists team names, but it doesn't specify individual drivers.\n\nSo, since the table only provides information about teams, their chassis, engines, and points scored each year, there's no data on individual drivers' performances. Without knowing which entries correspond to Marc Surer's races or his specific point contributions, I can't verify whether he scored 6 points twice more than scoring 2 points.\n\nTherefore, the table doesn't provide any relevant information about Marc Surer's scores. Since the claim is about an individual driver's performance and the table lacks that detail, there's no way to confirm or deny the claim based on the given data.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE because we don't have the necessary information in the table to support the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any information about Marc Surer or his points, making it impossible to verify the claim. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"marc surer score the same amount of point in 3 race in 1982.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided and see if there's any mention of Marc Surer. Let me scan through the entrant column. Hmm, looking at each row:\n\n- 1979: Team Ensign\n- 1980: Team ATS (twice)\n- 1981: Ensign Racing and Theodore Racing Team\n- 1982: Arrows Racing Team twice\n- 1983: Arrows Racing Team again\n- 1984: Barclay Nordica Arrows BMW twice\n- 1985: Motor Racing Developments Ltd\n- 1986: Barclay Arrows BMW\n\nI don't see any mention of Marc Surer in the entrant column. The entrants are team names, so maybe the driver's name isn't listed here. That could be a problem because the table doesn't include individual drivers; it only shows teams and constructors.\n\nNext, let's check the points for 1982. In the rows with year 1982, there are two entries:\n\n- Arrows A4: 3 points\n- Arrows A5: 3 points\n\nWait, but that's only two rows. The claim mentions three races where Marc scored the same amount of points. But in the table, for 1982, there are two entries with 3 points each. That would mean two races, not three. So even if Marc was driving both cars, which he might have been, the total points from these entries are only 6 (3+3). But the claim says he scored the same amount in three races, implying that each race had the same point value.\n\nHowever, without knowing how many points each race contributed or how many races there were in total for Marc Surer in 1982, it's hard to confirm. The table doesn't list individual races, just the teams and their points across the year. So if a team has multiple chassis entries, maybe that represents different races? But even then, only two point entries are present.\n\nAdditionally, since the table doesn't mention Marc Surer at all, I can't directly link him to these points. It's possible he was part of Arrows Racing Team in 1982, but without explicit data about his involvement or points from specific races, we can't verify this claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the table, there isn't enough evidence to support that Marc Surer scored the same amount of points in three races during 1982. The relevant cells are the two entries for 1982 with Arrows A4 and A5 both having 3 points each, but this doesn't confirm the claim about three races or Marc's involvement.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not list any entrant named \"marc surer\" in 1982. The relevant cells show that Arrows Racing Team scored 3 points twice in 1982, but there is no information linking this to Marc Surer.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim is: \"marc surer score a total of 9 point in his 4 race in 1982\". Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table and see what information it contains. The columns are year, entrant, chassis, engine, and points. So each row represents an entry for a particular team in a specific year with some details about their car and the points they scored.\n\nLooking at the claim, I notice it mentions \"marc surer\" but checking the table, none of the entrants listed are named marc surer. The entrant names are things like team ensign, team ats, arrows racing team, etc. So maybe that's a red flag because if Marc Surer isn't in the table, how can we attribute points to him?\n\nWait, but perhaps Marc Surer is the driver for one of these teams. However, the table doesn't list drivers; it only lists the entrant (team) names. Without knowing which team Marc Surer was part of, I can't directly link his performance to specific rows in the table.\n\nThe claim says he scored 9 points in 4 races in 1982. Let's see what data we have for 1982. Looking at the year column, there are two entries for 1982:\n\n- Row index 6: arrows racing team with chassis a4 and points 3\n- Row index 7: arrows racing team with chassis a5 and points 3\n\nSo in total for 1982, these two rows give the team 3 + 3 = 6 points. But according to the claim, Marc Surer scored 9 points across four races.\n\nWait, but there are only two entries here, each for different chassis, so maybe each entry represents multiple races? Or perhaps each entry is a single race? That's unclear. The table doesn't specify how many races each entry corresponds to; it just lists the points per row.\n\nIf each row is a separate event or race, then arrows racing team had two races in 1982, scoring 3 points each time, totaling 6 points. But the claim says four races with a total of 9 points for Marc Surer. Without information about how many races each team participated in, it's hard to confirm.\n\nBut wait, maybe the table is summarizing all their races for the year. So if arrows racing team had two rows in 1982, each with 3 points, that totals 6 points. The claim says Marc Surer scored 9 points, which is higher than what's shown here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the points per row are total points from multiple races. But without knowing how many races each chassis was used in, it's speculative. Also, since the claim specifies four races for Marc Surer, but we only have two rows (each possibly representing a single race or multiple), the numbers don't align.\n\nMoreover, the table doesn't mention any points beyond what's listed. For 1982, arrows racing team has points totaling 6, not 9. And since the claim attributes this to Marc Surer specifically, but he isn't listed in the table at all, it's hard to connect him to these points.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states Marc Surer scored 9 points over four races in 1982, but the table shows arrows racing team scoring only 6 points in two entries for that year. Since there's no mention of Marc Surer in the table and the point totals don't match up, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
