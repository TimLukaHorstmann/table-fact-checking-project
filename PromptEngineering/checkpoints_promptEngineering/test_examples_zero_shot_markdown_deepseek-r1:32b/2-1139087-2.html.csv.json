    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"ayrton senna start 13 grand prix race in pole position\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Ayrton Senna started in the pole position for 13 Grand Prix races. To verify this, I need to look at each row in the table and count how many times Ayrton Senna is listed under the \"pole position\" column.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different Grand Prix event with details like date, location, pole position, etc. The relevant column here is \"pole position.\"\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Brazilian Grand Prix**: Pole position is Ayrton Senna.\n2. **San Marino Grand Prix**: Ayrton Senna again.\n3. **Monaco Grand Prix**: Also Ayrton Senna.\n4. **Mexican Grand Prix**: Ayrton Senna.\n5. **Canadian Grand Prix**: Ayrton Senna.\n6. **Detroit Grand Prix**: Ayrton Senna.\n7. **French Grand Prix**: Here, the pole position is Alain Prost, not Senna.\n8. **British Grand Prix**: Gerhard Berger, so no.\n9. **German Grand Prix**: Back to Senna.\n10. **Hungarian Grand Prix**: Senna again.\n11. **Belgian Grand Prix**: Ayrton Senna.\n12. **Italian Grand Prix**: Gerhard Berger, not Senna.\n13. **Portuguese Grand Prix**: Alain Prost.\n14. **Spanish Grand Prix**: Ayrton Senna.\n15. **Japanese Grand Prix**: Senna is the pole here.\n16. **Australian Grand Prix**: Alain Prost.\n\nNow, let's count how many times Senna was in pole position:\n\n- Brazilian: 1\n- San Marino: 2\n- Monaco: 3\n- Mexican:4\n- Canadian:5\n- Detroit:6\n- German:7\n- Hungarian:8\n- Belgian:9\n- Spanish:10\n- Japanese:11\n\nWait, that's 11 times. But the claim says 13. Did I miss any?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRows where \"pole position\" is Ayrton Senna are rows 0 to 5 (that's 6), then row 7,8,9,11,14.\n\nWait, let me list them by row index:\n\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 4: Yes\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 6: No (Prost)\nRow7: Yes\nRow8: Yes\nRow9: Yes\nRow10: No (Berger)\nRow11: Yes\nRow12: No (Prost)\nRow13: Yes\nRow14: Yes\nRow15: No (Prost)\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,13,14. That's 12 times.\n\nWait, that's 12 instances where Senna was in pole position, not 13 as the claim states.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted or missed a row.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRows 0: Senna\nRow1: Senna\nRow2:Senna\nRow3:Senna\nRow4:Senna\nRow5:Senna\nRow7:Senna\nRow8:Senna\nRow9:Senna\nRow11:Senna\nRow13:Senna\nRow14:Senna\n\nThat's 12 rows where Senna is in pole position.\n\nThe claim says 13, so it seems the claim is incorrect.

It has several columns: grand prix, date, location, pole position, fastest lap, winning driver, constructor, and report. The relevant column for determining who won each race is the \"winning driver\" column.\n\nMy goal is to count how many times Ayrton Senna appears in the \"winning driver\" column compared to Alain Prost. If Senna has one more win than Prost, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nI'll start by going through each row and noting down the winning drivers:\n\n1. Brazilian GP: Alain Prost\n2.

French (Row 7)\n5. Portuguese (Row 13)\n6. Spanish (Row 14)\n7.

The claim states: \"Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger be the only drivers in pole position.\" So, I need to check if these three are indeed the only ones who have been in pole positions across all the races listed.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and look at the \"pole position\" column. The goal is to see if any other driver besides Senna, Prost, or Berger appears there.\n\nLooking at the first row: Brazilian GP, Ayrton Senna. That's one of the claimed drivers.\n\nSecond row: San Marino GP, still Senna. So far, consistent.\n\nThird row: Monaco GP, again Senna. Same as before.\n\nFourth row: Mexican GP, Senna once more. No new names here.\n\nFifth row: Canadian GP, Senna again. Okay, moving on.\n\nSixth row: Detroit GP, Senna. Still within the claim.\n\nSeventh row: French GP. Here, the pole position is Alain Prost. That's another of the claimed drivers.\n\nEighth row: British GP, Gerhard Berger. He's also one of the three mentioned in the claim.\n\nNinth row: German GP, back to Senna.\n\nTenth row: Hungarian GP, Senna again.\n\nEleventh row: Belgian GP, Senna once more.\n\nTwelfth row: Italian GP, pole position is still Ayrton Senna.\n\nThirteenth row: Portuguese GP. Wait, here the pole position is Alain Prost again.\n\nFourteenth row: Spanish GP, Senna.\n\nFifteenth row: Japanese GP, Senna.\n\nSixteenth row: Australian GP, Senna.\n\nSo, going through all 16 races, the pole positions are either Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, or Gerhard Berger. I don't see any other driver listed in that column. Therefore, it seems like the claim is accurate because only these three drivers have secured pole positions across all the events in the table.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each row to make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, the Italian GP has Senna as the pole, and the report mentions \"ferrari\" as the constructor but that's unrelated since we're only concerned with drivers. Similarly, other constructors are Mclaren-Honda except for Italian GP.\n\nNo, all rows under \"pole position\" indeed have either Senna, Prost, or Berger.

Each row represents a different Grand Prix event with details like date, location, pole position, fastest lap, winning driver, constructor, and report.\n\nI'll go through each race one by one:\n\n1. **Brazilian GP**: Fastest Lap is Gerhard Berger, Winning Driver is Alain Prost. Not the same.\n2. **San Marino GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winning Driver is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n3. **Monaco GP**: Both Fastest Lap and Winner are Ayrton Senna. Same.\n4. **Mexican GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Alain Prost. Same.\n5. **Canadian GP**: Both are Ayrton Senna. Same.\n6. **Detroit GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n7. **French GP**: Both are Alain Prost. Same.\n8. **British GP**: Fastest Lap is Nigel Mansell, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n9. **German GP**: Both are Ayrton Senna. Same.\n10. **Hungarian GP**: Both are Ayrton Senna. Same.\n11. **Belgian GP**: Fastest Lap is Gerhard Berger, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n12. **Italian GP**: Fastest Lap is Michele Alboreto, Winner is Gerhard Berger. Different.\n13. **Portuguese GP**: Both are Alain Prost. Same.\n14. **Spanish GP**: Both are Alain Prost. Same.\n15. **Japanese GP**: Both are Ayrton Senna. Same.\n16. **Australian GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Alain Prost. Same.\n\nWait, let me recount how many times the fastest lap driver also won:\n\n- Monaco: Yes\n- Mexican: Yes\n- Canadian: Yes\n- French: Yes\n- German: Yes\n- Hungarian: Yes\n- Portuguese: Yes\n- Spanish: Yes\n- Japanese: Yes\n- Australian: Yes\n\nWait, that's 10 times. But the claim says it happened in 6 races. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each row again more carefully:\n\nRow 0:\n- Fastest Lap: Gerhard Berger\n- Winner: Alain Prost \u2192 Different.\n\nRow 1:\n- Fastest Lap: Alain Prost\n- Winner: Ayrton Senna \u2192 Different.\n\nRow 2:\n- Both are Ayrton Senna \u2192 Same. Count = 1.\n\nRow 3:\n- Both Alain Prost \u2192 Same. Count = 2.\n\nRow 4:\n- Both Ayrton Senna \u2192 Same. Count =3.\n\nRow 5:\n- Fastest Lap: Alain Prost; Winner: Ayrton Senna \u2192 Different.\n\nRow 6:\n- Both Alain Prost \u2192 Same. Count=4.\n\nRow7:\n- Fastest Lap: Nigel Mansell; Winner: Ayrton Senna \u2192 Different.\n\nRow8:\n- Both Ayrton Senna \u2192 Same. Count=5.\n\nRow9:\n- Both Ayrton Senna \u2192 Same. Count=6.\n\nRow10:\n- Fastest Lap: Gerhard Berger; Winner: Ayrton Senna \u2192 Different.\n\nRow11:\n- Fastest Lap: Michele Alboreto; Winner: Gerhard Berger \u2192 Different.\n\nRow12:\n- Both Alain Prost \u2192 Same. Count=7.\n\nRow13:\n- Both Alain Prost \u2192 Same. Count=8.\n\nRow14:\n- Both Ayrton Senna \u2192 Same. Count=9.\n\nRow15:\n- Both Alain Prost \u2192 Same. Count=10.\n\nWait, so actually, the count is 10 times where the fastest lap driver also won. But the claim says it's six races. So either I'm misunderstanding the claim or made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim was that in each of the six races, the same driver had both fastest lap and win. If there are more than six such cases, then it would still be TRUE if at least six happened. But the way it's phrased is \"in 6 race,\" which might mean exactly six.\n\nBut according to my count, it's ten times. Therefore, the claim that it happens in six races would be TRUE because ten is more than six. Wait, but maybe I miscounted.\n\nLet me list each row with a check:\n\n1. Brazilian: No\n2. San Marino: No\n3. Monaco: Yes (1)\n4. Mexican: Yes (2)\n5. Canadian: Yes (3)\n6. Detroit: No\n7. French: Yes (4)\n8. British: No\n9. German: Yes (5)\n10. Hungarian: Yes (6)\n11. Belgian: No\n12. Italian: No\n13. Portuguese: Yes (7)\n14. Spanish: Yes (8)\n15. Japanese: Yes (9)\n16. Australian: Yes (10)\n\nSo yes, it's ten times. Therefore, the claim that in six races, the driver with the fastest lap won is TRUE because there are indeed more than six such instances.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check each row again to make sure:\n\nRow 2: Monaco - Ayrton Senna both \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow3: Mexican GP - Alain Prost both \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow4: Canadian GP - Ayrton Senna both \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow6: French GP - Alain Prost both \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow8: German GP - Ayrton Senna both \u2192 Yes.\n\nRow9: Hungarian GP - Ayrton Senna both \u2192 Yes.\n\nSo by row number, the first six yeses are rows 2-3-4-6-8-9. That's six races where it happened. So the claim is TRUE because in at least six races, the fastest lap driver won. The total being ten makes it even more correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in six of the races, the driver with the fastest lap also won. Upon examining each race, we find that this occurs ten times, which includes the required six instances. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"status\": \"TRUE\"\n  }\n}\n```",

It states that Ayrton Senna started 14 Grand Prix races from the pole position. So I need to check how many times Senna was listed as having the pole position across all the races in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different grand prix event with details including the date, location, and key positions like pole position, fastest lap, winning driver, etc. The relevant column here is \"pole position.\"\n\nI'll go through each row and count how many times Ayrton Senna is listed in the \"pole position\" column.\n\n1. Brazilian Grand Prix: Pole Position - Ayrton Senna (Row 0)\n2. San Marino Grand Prix: Ayrton Senna (Row 1)\n3. Monaco Grand Prix: Ayrton Senna (Row 2)\n4. Mexican Grand Prix: Ayrton Senna (Row 3)\n5.

Italian Grand Prix: Ayrton Senna (Row 11) - Wait, looking back, no. Row 11 is the Italian GP where pole position was Ayrton Senna? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the Italian Grand Prix row shows \"ayrton senna\" in the pole position (Row 11), then Portuguese Grand Prix: Alain Prost (Row 12) - Not Senna. Spanish Grand Prix: Ayrton Senna (Row 13). Japanese GP: Ayrton Senna (Row 14). Australian GP: Ayrton Senna (Row 15).\n\nWait, let me recount correctly:\n\nRows are indexed from 0 to 17.\n\n- Row 0: Brazilian - Senna\n- Row 1: San Marino - Senna\n- Row 2: Monaco - Senna\n- Row 3: Mexican - Senna\n- Row 4: Canadian - Senna\n- Row 5: Detroit - Senna\n- Row 6: French - Prost\n- Row 7: British - Berger\n- Row 8: German - Senna\n- Row 9: Hungarian - Senna\n- Row 10: Belgian - Senna\n- Row 11: Italian - Senna\n- Row 12: Portuguese - Prost\n- Row 13: Spanish - Senna\n- Row 14: Japanese - Senna\n- Row 15: Australian - Senna\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different count.

Let me check:\n\nYes, in the table for Italian GP, pole is Ayrton Senna.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 12: Portuguese GP - Alain Prost (No)\nRow 13: Spanish GP - Yes (11)\nRow 14: Japanese GP - Yes (12)\nRow 15: Australian GP - Yes (13)\n\nWait, that's only 13 times. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRows where Senna was pole:\n\n0: Yes\n1: Yes\n2: Yes\n3: Yes\n4: Yes\n5: Yes\n8: Yes\n9: Yes\n10: Yes\n11: Yes\n13: Yes\n14: Yes\n15: Yes\n\nThat's 13 rows where Senna was pole. Wait, but I thought earlier it was 14.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a row. Let me list all the rows:\n\nTotal of 16 races (rows 0-15). Now checking each one:\n\nRow 0: Brazilian - Yes\nRow 1: San Marino - Yes\nRow 2: Monaco - Yes\nRow 3: Mexican - Yes\nRow 4: Canadian - Yes\nRow 5: Detroit - Yes\nRow 6: French - No\nRow 7: British - No\nRow 8: German - Yes\nRow 9: Hungarian - Yes\nRow 10: Belgian - Yes\nRow 11: Italian - Yes\nRow 12: Portuguese - No\nRow 13: Spanish - Yes\nRow 14: Japanese - Yes\nRow 15: Australian - Yes\n\nNow counting: Rows 0-5 (6), then rows 8,9,10,11,13,14,15 (7 more). Total is 13.\n\nWait, that's only 13. So the claim says 14. Did I miss one?\n\nLet me check again:\n\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: Yes\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 4: Yes\nRow 5: Yes (6)\nRow 8: Yes (7)\nRow 9: Yes (8)\nRow 10: Yes (9)\nRow 11: Yes (10)\nRow 13: Yes (11)\nRow 14: Yes (12)\nRow 15: Yes (13)\n\nSo only 13 instances. Therefore, the claim of 14 is incorrect based on this table.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row? Let me check again:\n\nRows are from 0 to 15 (16 rows total).\n\nLooking at each pole position:\n\n- Row 0: Senna\n- Row 1: Senna\n- Row 2: Senna\n- Row 3: Senna\n- Row 4: Senna\n- Row 5: Senna\n- Row 6: Prost\n- Row 7: Berger\n- Row 8: Senna\n- Row 9: Senna\n- Row 10: Senna\n- Row 11: Senna\n- Row 12: Prost\n- Row 13: Senna\n- Row 14: Senna\n- Row 15: Senna\n\nYes, that's 13 times. So the claim is FALSE because it was only 13 races where Senna started from pole position.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 14. Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me try another approach: list each race with Senna as pole:\n\n1. Brazilian\n2. San Marino\n3. Monaco\n4. Mexican\n5. Canadian\n6. Detroit\n7. German\n8. Hungarian\n9. Belgian\n10. Italian\n11. Spanish\n12. Japanese\n13. Australian\n\nThat's 13 races. So the claim is incorrect; it should be 13, not 14.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Ayrton Senna started in pole position for 14 Grand Prix races. Upon examining each row of the table, we find that Senna was listed as having the pole position in 13 instances. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"FALSE\"\n}\n```",

Let's break down the claim and check each part against the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"although michele alboreto have the fastest lap in the italian grand prix, alain prost win the race.\" \n\nFirst, I'll identify which row of the table corresponds to the Italian Grand Prix. Looking through the 'grand prix' column, I find it at row index 12 (since counting starts from 0). The details for this row are:\n\n- date: 11 September\n- location: monza\n- pole position: ayrton senna\n- fastest lap: michele alboreto\n- winning driver: gerhard berger\n- constructor: ferrari\n\nThe claim mentions two key points:\n1. Michele Alboreto had the fastest lap.\n2. Alain Prost won the race.\n\nLooking at the relevant cells in row 12:\n\n- 'fastest lap' is indeed michele alboreto, which matches part of the claim.\n- However, the 'winning driver' is gerhard berger, not alain prost.\n\nSo while the first part of the claim is correct, the second part is incorrect because Alain Prost did not win the Italian Grand Prix; Gerhard Berger did.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"ayrton senna, alain prost be the only driver in pole position\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is saying. It states that Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost are the only drivers who secured pole positions across all the grand prix races listed in the table. So, my goal is to check if every entry under the \"pole position\" column has either Ayrton Senna or Alain Prost as the driver.\n\nLooking at the table, it's structured with several columns: grand prix name, date, location, pole position, fastest lap, winning driver, constructor, and report. For this claim, I'm only interested in the \"pole position\" column.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Brazilian Grand Prix**: Pole position is Ayrton Senna.\n2. **San Marino Grand Prix**: Also Ayrton Senna.\n3. **Monaco Grand Prix**: Again, Ayrton Senna holds the pole.\n4. **Mexican Grand Prix**: Still Senna in pole.\n5. **Canadian Grand Prix**: Senna again.\n6. **Detroit Grand Prix**: Senna is in pole here as well.\n7. **French Grand Prix**: Now we see Alain Prost in pole position.\n8. **British Grand Prix**: Pole goes to Gerhard Berger, who isn't either of the two drivers mentioned in the claim.\n\nAt this point, I've found that in the British Grand Prix row (row index 7), the pole position is Gerhard Berger, not Senna or Prost. This immediately tells me that the claim is FALSE because there's at least one instance where someone other than Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost secured the pole.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll check the remaining races to see if there are more exceptions:\n\n9. **German Grand Prix**: Back to Senna.\n10. **Hungarian Grand Prix**: Again, Senna.\n11. **Belgian Grand Prix**: Still Senna.\n12. **Italian Grand Prix**: Here's Gerhard Berger again in pole for this race.\n13. **Portuguese Grand Prix**: Alain Prost takes pole.\n14. **Spanish Grand Prix**: Back to Senna.\n15. **Japanese Grand Prix**: Senna holds the pole.\n16. **Australian Grand Prix**: Finally, Alain Prost is in pole.\n\nSo, besides the British and Italian Grand Prixes where Gerhard Berger was in pole, all other races had either Senna or Prost. However, since the claim specifies that only those two drivers were in pole positions across all races, the presence of Berger in any row invalidates the claim.\n\nTherefore, after carefully reviewing each entry, I've identified multiple instances where the pole position was held by someone other than Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. This means the original statement is not entirely accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were in pole positions for all races listed. However, looking at the table, we find instances where Gerhard Berger also secured pole positions. \n\n- **British Grand Prix** (row 7): Pole position is Gerhard Berger.\n- **Italian Grand Prix** (row 11): Pole position is Gerhard Berger.\n\nThese entries show that there were other drivers in pole positions besides Senna and Prost, making the claim FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pole position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pole position\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the driver with the fastest lap do win the grand prix in 7 race\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has columns for each Grand Prix event, including details like date, location, pole position, fastest lap, winning driver, constructor, and report. The claim seems to be about whether in seven races, the driver who had the fastest lap also won the grand prix.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the claim correctly. It says \"the driver with the fatest lap do win the grand prix in 7 race\". There might be a typo here. I think they meant \"fastest\" instead of \"fatest,\" so assuming that correction, it's about whether the driver who had the fastest lap in each race went on to win that race, and this happened in seven races.\n\nSo my approach should be: for each row (each Grand Prix), check if the 'winning driver' is the same as the 'fastest lap' driver. Then count how many times this occurs. If it's exactly seven times, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each race one by one.\n\n1. **Brazilian GP**: Fastest Lap is Gerhard Berger, Winner is Alain Prost. Different drivers.\n2. **San Marino GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n3. **Monaco GP**: Fastest Lap is Ayrton Senna, Winner is Alain Prost. Different.\n4. **Mexican GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Alain Prost. Same driver. So that's 1.\n5. **Canadian GP**: Fastest Lap is Ayrton Senna, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Same. Now 2.\n6. **Detroit GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n7. **French GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Alain Prost. Same. Count is 3.\n8. **British GP**: Fastest Lap is Nigel Mansell, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n9. **German GP**: Fastest Lap is Alessandro Nannini, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n10. **Hungarian GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n11. **Belgian GP**: Fastest Lap is Gerhard Berger, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Different.\n12. **Italian GP**: Fastest Lap is Michele Alboreto, Winner is Gerhard Berge. Wait, the winner here is Gerhard Berge? Let me check: Winning driver is Gerhard Berger, Fastest Lap is Michele Alboreto. Different.\n13. **Portuguese GP**: Fastest Lap is Gerhard Berger, Winner is Alain Prost. Different.\n14. **Spanish GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Alain Prost. Same. Now count is 4.\n15. **Japanese GP**: Fastest Lap is Ayrton Senna, Winner is Ayrton Senna. Same. Count is 5.\n16. **Australian GP**: Fastest Lap is Alain Prost, Winner is Alain Prost. Same. Count is 6.\n\nWait, did I miss any?

The claim says it happened in seven races, so my count is off by one.

Wait, row 12 is Portuguese GP. Fastest Lap is Gerhard Berger, Winner is Alain Prost. Different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all rows where the fastest lap driver equals the winner:\n\nMexican (row3)\nCanadian (row4)\nFrench (row6)\nSpanish (row12)\nJapanese (row14)\nAustralian (row15)\n\nThat's six races. So perhaps the claim is incorrect, stating seven instead of six.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a row. Let me go through each race again:\n\n1. Brazil: Fastest - Gerhard, Winner - Alain. No.\n2. San Marino: Fastest - Alain, Winner - Ayrton. No.\n3. Monaco: Fastest - Ayrton, Winner - Alain. No.\n4. Mexico: Fastest - Alain, Winner - Alain. Yes (1)\n5. Canada: Fastest - Ayrton, Winner - Ayrton.

Japan: Fastest - Ayrton, Winner - Ayrton. Yes (5)\n16. Australia: Fastest - Alain, Winner - Alain. Yes (6)\n\nSo only six races where the fastest lap driver won. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted or there's another row.
