    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"toronto lose to cleveland on november 24 , 108 - 111 (ot)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim refers to:\n- The team that lost: Toronto\n- Opponent: Cleveland\n- Date: November 24\n- Score: 108-111 (OT)\n\nI'll go through the table row by row to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the table, I see there's a game on November 24. Let me check that row:\n- Row index 12 corresponds to November 24.\n- The opponent is Cleveland.\n- The score is listed as \"l 108 - 111 (ot)\" under the 'score' column.\n\nBreaking down this information:\n- The team's record after this game is 6-7, indicating a loss since they went from 6-6 to 6-7.\n- The 'score' shows \"l\" which typically means loss. The scores are Toronto 108 and opponent (Cleveland) 111.\n\nSo all parts of the claim match:\n- Team: Toronto lost\n- Opponent: Cleveland\n- Date: November 24\n- Score: 108-111 in overtime\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are the score and team columns for that specific row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly states that Toronto lost to Cleveland on November 24 with a score of 108-111 in overtime.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim first: \"the result of the game on november 20 in dallas be w 110 - 101 (ot)\". \n\nFirst, I'll look for the row where the date is November 20 and the team is Dallas. Scanning through the table:\n\nLooking at each row's date:\n- Row 0: November 2\n- Row 1: November 4\n- Row 2: November 6\n- Row 3: November 7\n- Row 4: November 9\n- Row 5: November 10\n- Row 6: November 14\n- Row 7: November 16\n- Row 8: November 18\n- Row 9: November 20\nOkay, row index 9 is the one with date November 20.\n\nNow, checking the team for that row. The 'team' column shows \"golden state\" in row 9? Wait, no\u2014let me look again. Wait, row 8 is November 18 against golden state. Row 9 is November 20 against dallas. Yes, correct.\n\nSo row index 9: date November 20, team dallas.\n\nNow the claim says the result was \"w 110 - 101 (ot)\". Let me check the 'score' column for that row.\n\nIn row 9, score is \"l 99 - 105 (ot)\". So it's a loss with scores 99-105, not a win as claimed. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\nSo the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the date and team to identify the row, plus the score column for that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that on November 20 against Dallas, the result was a win with scores 110-101 in overtime. Checking the table, the game on November 20 (row 9) against Dallas resulted in a loss (l) with a score of 99-105. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
