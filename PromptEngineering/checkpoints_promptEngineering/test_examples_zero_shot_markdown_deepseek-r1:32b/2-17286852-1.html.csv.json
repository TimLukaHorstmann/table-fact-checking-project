    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"in Stanley the bridge be of the concrete deck girder style\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The columns are name, listed, location, county, and type. So each row represents a bridge with details about its listing date, location, county it's in, and its structural type.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions Stanley as the location and states that the bridge there is of the concrete deck girder style. I need to find if any bridge located in Stanley has this type.\n\nLooking through the table, I'll scan each row for the location \"Stanley.\" Let me go row by row:\n\n1. Beaver Creek Bridge - Finley\n2. Caledonia Bridge - Caledonia\n3. Cedar Creek Bridge - Haynes\n4. Colton's Crossing Bridge - Lisbon\n5. Crystal Bridge - Crystal\n6. Eastwood Park Bridge - Minot\n7. Elliott Bridge - Towner\n8. Fairview Lift Bridge - Cartwright\n9. Grace City Bridge - Grace City\n10. Great Northern Railway Underpass - Stanley (Here we go)\n   The type here is \"concrete deck girder bridge.\" That matches the claim.\n\nSo, yes, in Stanley, there's a bridge called Great Northern Railway Underpass with the concrete deck girder style. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are:\n- Row 9 (assuming rows start at 0), column 'location' which shows Stanley.\n- The same row, column 'type' which specifies concrete deck girder bridge.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"colton's cross the bridge,\" which likely refers to \"Colton's Crossing Bridge.\" So, the claim is stating that the Colton's Crossing Bridge is a Pratt through truss bridge.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided. The table has several columns: name, listed, location, county, type. Each row represents a different bridge with details about them.\n\nI need to find the row where the name is \"colton 's crossing bridge.\" Let me scan through the names:\n\nLooking down the list, I see an entry for \"colton  's crossing bridge\" at row index 3 (since counting starts from 0). The details are as follows: listed on 1997-02-27, located in lisbon, county ransom, and type pratt through truss.\n\nSo, the type of this bridge is indeed \"pratt through truss.\" That matches exactly what the claim states. \n\nAdditionally, checking for any discrepancies or alternative information, I don't see any other entries for Colton's Crossing Bridge that might contradict this. All relevant cells point to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, since the table clearly indicates that the bridge in question is a Pratt through truss type, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"colton 's crossing bridge,\" which is listed as a \"pratt through truss\" bridge in the table.

The name in that row is \"westgaard bridge\".\n\nNext, I need to check the 'type' of this bridge. The claim specifies it's a \"pratt pony through truss\" bridge. Looking at the 'type' column for Westgaard Bridge, it says \"pratt pony through truss\".

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine if the claim \"cooperstown have a pratt through truss type bridge\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully. It says that Cooperstown has a Pratt Through Truss type bridge. So, my goal is to check in the table if there's any entry where the location is Cooperstown and the type of bridge is Pratt Through Truss.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns: name, listed, location, county, and type. I'll need to go through each row and see if any of them have 'cooperstown' in the location column and 'pratt through truss' in the type column.\n\nI'll start scanning the rows one by one:\n\n1. The first few entries are Beaver Creek Bridge, Caledonia Bridge, etc., all with different locations like Finley, Caledonia, Haynes, etc. None of these are Cooperstown.\n2. Moving down, I see Midland Continental Overpass in Jamestown, which isn't Cooperstown either.\n3. Further down, there's a row named \"romness bridge\" located in Cooperstown. Let me check the details:\n   - Name: romness bridge\n   - Listed: 1997-02-27\n   - Location: cooperstown\n   - County: griggs\n   - Type: pratt through truss\n\nYes, that's exactly what the claim is stating. So this row confirms that Cooperstown does have a Pratt Through Truss type bridge named Romness Bridge.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other entries for Cooperstown with different types, just to be thorough. Scanning further down:\n- The next rows after romness bridge include names like Sorlie Memorial Bridge in Grand Forks, Viking Bridge in Portland, etc., none of which mention Cooperstown again.\n  \nTherefore, the claim is supported by the table. I'll note the relevant cells: row 18 (assuming indexing starts at 0), columns location and type.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE, with the relevant cells being row 18 for location 'cooperstown' and type 'pratt through truss'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Nesheim Bridge is located in Mcville. So, my task is to check if there's an entry for \"nesheim bridge\" and see where it's listed as being located.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different bridge with details about its name, listing date, location, county, and type. I'll scan through the \"name\" column to find \"nesheim bridge\".\n\nI see that in the 13th row (row_index: 12 if counting from 0), there's an entry named \"nesheim bridge\". Let me check its details.\n\nThe relevant columns here are \"name\", \"location\", and possibly others, but for this claim, the key information is location. The \"location\" column for nesheim bridge says \"mcville\". \n\nSo, according to the table, the Nesheim Bridge is indeed located in Mcville. That matches the claim exactly.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information or other entries for nesheim bridge elsewhere in the table that might indicate a different location.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll check each part of the claim. The claim mentions \"Cooper town\" and the \"Blanchard Bridge.\" So, I need to see if there's a row in the table that lists both these elements correctly.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan through each name under the 'name' column. There are several bridges listed, including \"blanchard bridge.\" Let me find its details. \n\nThe row for \"Blanchard Bridge\" is near the end of the table. It's located in Blenchard, Traill county, and it's a pratt through truss type. Now, I need to check if this bridge is associated with Cooper Town.\n\nWait, the 'location' column says Blenchard, not Cooper town. So, the Blanchard Bridge is in Blenchard, which might be a different place than Cooper town. \n\nNow, looking for \"Cooperstown\" in the table: I see there's an entry called \"romness bridge\" with a location of Cooperstown. That suggests that Cooperstown does exist in the table as a location. However, this row is about Romness Bridge, not Blanchard Bridge.\n\nSo, the claim says Cooper town is famous for the Blanchard Bridge. But according to the table, the Blanchard Bridge is located in Blenchard, not Cooper town. The only mention of Cooperstown is under a different bridge, which doesn't relate to the Blanchard Bridge.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by the data because the location and the associated bridge don't match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Cooper town is famous for the Blanchard Bridge. However, the table shows that the Blanchard Bridge is located in Blenchard, not Cooper town. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 43, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the grace city bridge be a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. The claim states two main points: that the Grace City Bridge is of type \"concrete deck girder bridge\" and that it's located in Stanley.\n\nI'll start by looking through the table for entries where the name is \"grace city bridge\". Scanning the 'name' column, I find it at row index 7. According to the table, Grace City Bridge has a location of \"grace city\", not Stanley. So that's already a mismatch because the claim says it's in Stanley.\n\nNext, let me check the type. The type for Grace City Bridge is listed as \"pratt through truss\". The claim states it's a \"concrete deck girder bridge\". Since these types are different, this further supports that the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, but I also notice another entry at row index 9: \"great northern railway underpass\" located in Stanley. Its type is \"concrete deck girder bridge\". So there's a bridge in Stanley with that type, but it's not Grace City Bridge; rather, it's the Great Northern Railway Underpass.\n\nSo putting this together, the Grace City Bridge is in Grace City, not Stanley, and its type isn't a concrete deck girder. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"type\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim: \"mcville have goose river bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.\" Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me parse this sentence correctly. It seems like it's saying that mcville has a goose river bridge that's currently under construction because of structural issues. So I need to check two things in the table: if there's an entry for a bridge named \"goose river bridge\" located in mcville, and whether that bridge is currently under construction or has any mention of structural issues.\n\nLooking at the table, let me go through each row. The rows are indexed starting from 0. Let's see:\n\nRow 16: lisbon bridge in lisbon, county ransom.\nRow 23: viking bridge in portland.\nRow 24: west antelope bridge in flora.\nWait, actually I should look for \"goose river bridge\". Scanning through the 'name' column.\n\nLooking down, at row index 28: goose river bridge. Wait no, let's check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me list all bridges:\n\n1. beaver creek bridge\n2. caledonia bridge\n3. cedar creek bridge\n4. colton 's crossing bridge\n5. crystal bridge\n6. eastwood park bridge\n7. elliott bridge\n8. fairview lift bridge\n9. grace city bridge\n10. great northern railway underpass\n11. knife river bridge near stanton\n12. lisbon bridge\n13. midland continental overpass\n14. midway bridge\n15. nesheim bridge\n16. new rockford bridge\n17. northwood bridge\n18. norway bridge\n19. ost valle bridge\n20. romness bridge\n21. sorlie memorial bridge\n22. viking bridge\n23. west antelope bridge\n24. west park bridge\n25. westgaard bridge\n26. blanchard bridge\n27. goose river bridge - Yes, here it is at row index 27.\nWait no, wait the table has more rows. Let me recount properly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow 0: beaver creek\n1: caledonia\n2: cedar creek\n3: colton's crossing\n4: crystal\n5: eastwood park\n6: elliott\n7: fairview lift\n8: grace city\n9: great northern underpass\n10: knife river near stanton\n11: lisbon\n12: midland continental\n13: midway\n14: nesheim\n15: new rockford\n16: northwood\n17: norway\n18: ost valle\n19: romness\n20: sorlie memorial\n21: viking\n22: west antelope\n23: west park\n24: westgaard\n25: blanchard\n26: goose river\n27: liberty memorial\nWait, that's 28 rows. So the goose river bridge is at row index 26.\n\nLooking at its details: name is \"goose river bridge\", location is \"blanchard\" (wait no), let me check:\n\nThe 'location' for row 26: blanchard? No, looking back at the table, each row has columns: name, location, county, type. For goose river bridge, it's located in \"hillsboro\" under column \"location\", as per the data.\n\nWait no, let me look again:\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nThe row for blanchard bridge is listed with a note that it was removed. Then comes goose river bridge: same issue.\n\nWait, actually, rows 26 and 27 have entries with removal dates.\n\nRow index 25: blanchard bridge in blanchard (location), county traill, type pratt through truss. But the 'location' is \"blanchard\" and 'county' is \"traill\".\n\nThen row 26: goose river bridge, located in hillsboro, county traill.\n\nSo the claim says mcville has goose river bridge. So checking the location for goose river bridge: it's in hillsboro, not mcville. Therefore, that part of the claim is incorrect because mcville doesn't have the goose river bridge as per the table; it's located elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, does the table mention any construction or structural issues? Looking at the 'name' column and other details, I see some bridges were removed (e.g., blanchard bridge was removed in 2009), but goose river bridge is listed with a removal date of 2009 as well. The claim says it's currently under construction due to structural issues. But according to the table, it was removed in 2009-3-25. So if it's removed, it can't be under construction now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check row 26 again:\n\n\"geese river bridge\" has \"removed 2009-3-25\" as part of its location info? Wait no: looking back at the table structure, each row's 'location' is given first, then any removal info in parentheses or appended.\n\nWait, in the initial data, for example:\n\nRow 26: goose river bridge | hillsboro | traill | pratt through truss\n\nBut wait, checking again, the actual table entry might have more details. Wait no, looking back at the given table, each row is structured as follows:\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"geese river bridge\" in row index 26: name is goose river bridge, location hillsboro, county traill, type pratt through truss, and it's marked as removed in 2009.\n\nWait no, looking at the initial table data provided by the user, some bridges have additional info in their 'location' or other columns. For example:\n\nLooking back, row for \"geese river bridge\" is listed as:\n\n\"Goose River Bridge | hillsboro | traill | pratt through truss | removed 2009-3-25\"\n\nWait no, actually the way it's presented in the table is that some rows have additional info. Let me recount correctly.\n\nLooking at the user-provided table, each row has four columns: name, location, county, type. But for some bridges, there are notes about removal. For example:\n\n- blanchard bridge | blanchard | traill | pratt through truss | removed 2009-3-25\nBut in the user's table, it's presented as a single cell with \"blanchard bridge\" and then location info including removal.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me look again:\n\nThe table is structured as follows for each row: name, location (which might include additional info like removal date), county, type.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- Row 25: blanchard bridge | blanchard | traill | pratt through truss\nBut in the user's data, it was written as:\n\"blanchard bridge | blanchard | traill | pratt through truss | removed 2009-3-25\"\n\nWait no, looking back, I think each row has four columns: name, location, county, type. But some have notes in parentheses or appended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the table includes additional info as part of the location or other fields. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at how the user presented the data, for example:\n\n\"blanchard bridge | blanchard | traill | pratt through truss\"\n\nBut later entries like:\n\n\"goose river bridge | hillsboro | traill | pratt through truss\"\n\nWait no, perhaps in the initial table, some rows have a note of removal. For instance, looking back at how it's written:\n\nThe user wrote for row 26:\n\"goose river bridge | hillsboro | traill | pratt through truss\"\n\nAnd for row 27:\n\"liberty memorial bridge | ... removed...\"\n\nWait no, actually in the user's table, rows 25 and beyond have entries that include removal dates. For example:\n\n- blanchard bridge: name is \"blanchard bridge\", location \"blanchard\", county \"traill\", type \"pratt through truss\"\nBut perhaps with a note about being removed.\n\nWait no, looking at the user's initial data, I think each row includes four columns and sometimes additional notes in parentheses. For example:\n\n\"blanchard bridge | blanchard | traill | pratt through truss | removed 2009-3-25\"\n\nBut how is this structured? It seems like some rows have more than four fields, but perhaps it's presented as a single cell with the note.\n\nIn any case, focusing on goose river bridge: its location is hillsboro, not mcville. Therefore, the claim that mcville has this bridge is incorrect based on the table. Also, since it was removed in 2009, it's unlikely to be under construction now due to structural issues as per the table.\n\nThus, the answer would involve noting these discrepancies.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that McVille has the Goose River Bridge and that it is currently under construction due to structural issues is incorrect based on the provided data. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Location Discrepancy**: The Goose River Bridge is located in Hillsboro, not McVille.\n\n2. **Status Update**: According to the table, the Goose River Bridge was removed on March 25, 2009. Therefore, it cannot be under construction currently.\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe Goose River Bridge is situated in Hillsboro and was removed in 2009; hence, McVille does not have this bridge, nor is it undergoing construction.",

This doesn't match the county mentioned in the claim.\n\nSince the bridge is in McHenry County and not Traill County, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"type\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"county\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
