    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"active from 1947 - 1964 , titus ozon score 157 goal\". I need to check each part of this statement against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that the columns are rank, name, years, matches, and goals. The claim mentions Titus Ozon being active from 1947-1964 and scoring 157 goals. \n\nI'll start by locating Titus Ozon in the table. Scanning through the names, I find him at row index 9 (since counting starts at 0). His details are: rank 10, name Titus Ozon, years 1947 - 1964, matches 270, and goals 157.\n\nNow, checking each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Active Years**: The claim says Titus Ozon was active from 1947-1964. Looking at his \"years\" column in row 9, it exactly matches this period. So that's correct.\n\n2. **Goals Scored**: The claim states he scored 157 goals. In the same row, under the \"goals\" column, it shows 157. This also matches perfectly.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table, the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Titus Ozon's active years and goals match exactly with what's stated in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"years\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It states that between 1950 and 1965, the number of goals scored was less than 160 each year. So, I need to check if any player in that time frame had a goal count of 160 or more.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their years active, matches played, and goals scored. The claim is about the goal scores during 1950-1965, so I should focus on players whose active years overlap with that period.\n\nLet's examine each player:\n\n1. Dudu Georgescu: Years 1970 - 1986. This doesn't overlap with 1950-1965.\n2. Ionel Danciulescu: Started in 1993, so no overlap either.\n3. Rodion Camataru: Active from 1974 - 1989. No overlap.\n4. Marin Radu: Same as above.\n5. Ion Oblemenco: Years 1964 - 1976. His earliest year is 1964, which is within the claim's timeframe. He scored 170 goals in total, but since he started in 1964, I need to see if his goal count during 1950-1965 was less than 160. However, the table doesn't provide yearly breakdowns; it only gives the total for his entire career. So, without knowing how many goals he scored each year within that range, we can't be certain.\n6. Florea Dumitrache: Years 1966 - 1983. His start in 1966 is just after the claim's end year of 1965, so no overlap.\n7. Mircea Sandu: Active from 1970 onwards, so no overlap.\n8. Victor Piturca: Started in 1975, which is outside the timeframe.\n9. Mihai Adam: Years 1962 - 1976. His active years include part of the claim's period (1962-1965). He scored a total of 160 goals, but again, without knowing his yearly distribution, we can't confirm if during 1950-1965 he had less than 160.\n10. Titus Ozon: Active until 1964. His years are 1947 - 1964. So, he was active in the latter part of the claim's timeframe (up to 1964). He scored 157 goals in total. Again, we don't have yearly data.\n\nThe issue here is that the table provides only total goals for each player over their entire career, not per year. Without knowing how many goals were scored each year during 1950-1965, I can't verify if any of these players exceeded or equaled 160 goals in those years.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, there's insufficient information to support or refute the claim definitively. However, since Ion Oblemenco and Titus Ozon are active during parts of the timeframe and have total goals close to or above 160, it introduces uncertainty. But without per-year data, I can't confirm if their annual goals in that period were less than 160.\n\nWait, actually, let me re-examine. The claim is about the goal score being less than 160 during each year from 1950 through 1965. If any player scored 160 or more in those years, the claim would be false. However, looking at Titus Ozon's total goals are 157, which is below 160. Ion Oblemenco has 170, but if his career started in 1964, perhaps he scored fewer than 160 in that single year. Mihai Adam also has 160 total, but again, without yearly data.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is about whether any player had a goal score of less than 160 during those years. But that interpretation might not fit well. Alternatively, it could mean that overall, the goals scored by all players combined were less than 160 each year between 1950-1965.\n\nBut the table doesn't provide aggregate data; it only lists individual players' totals. So without knowing how many players there were and their contributions each year, we can't sum up to see if the total was under 160 per year.\n\nGiven that, I think the claim is not fully supported by the data provided because the table lacks the necessary details about yearly goals or sufficient information to confirm that all years in the range had goal scores below 160. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be fully verified as true based on the given table since there isn't enough specific data about yearly goal counts during 1950-1965.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
