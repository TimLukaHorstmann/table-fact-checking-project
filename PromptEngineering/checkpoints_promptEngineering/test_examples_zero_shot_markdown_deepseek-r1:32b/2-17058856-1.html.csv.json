    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"at 18:27, meet score and the score be 0 - 2 for met\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each part of the claim means. The time mentioned is 18:27, which I assume refers to the 'time' column in the table. The 'meet score' probably refers to the score at that particular time. The claim states that the score was 0 - 2 for met.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check where the 'time' is 18:27. \n\n- Row 0: Time is 1:28, not relevant.\n- Row 1: Time is 18:27. This matches the time in the claim.\n  \nIn this row, under the 'score' column, it says \"0 - 2 met\". So at 18:27, the score was indeed 0 - 2 for met. \n\nTherefore, the claim aligns with the data in the table. The relevant cell is row 1, specifically the 'time' and 'score' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because at 18:27, the score was 0-2 for Met.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the given claim about a table in markdown format is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"the score be 0 - 2 met when vladimir malenkikh make a goal at 18:27\". So, the claim is stating that after Vladimir Malenkih scores at time 18:27, the score becomes 0-2 in favor of 'met'.\n\nNext, I'll look at the provided table to verify this. The table has columns: period, team, goal, time, and score.\n\nI need to find the row where the goal scorer is Vladimir Malenkih. Scanning through the 'goal' column, I see that the second row mentions \"vladimir malenkikh 1 (pp)\" with a time of 18:27. \n\nLooking at this row, the 'score' after his goal is listed as \"0 - 2 met\". This matches exactly what the claim states. So, when Malenkih scores at 18:27, the score indeed becomes 0-2 for 'met'.\n\nTo ensure there's no mistake, I'll check if any subsequent goals affect this score before or after this time. The first goal was by Denis Platonov at 1:28, which made the score 0-1. Then Malenkih scores next, making it 0-2. After that, Nikolai Zavarukhin scores in the second period for 'met', bringing it to 0-3. Then Chris Drury of 'nyr' starts scoring, changing the score to 1-3 and eventually leading to a tie and then 'nyr' taking the lead.\n\nSince the claim specifically refers to the moment Malenkih scores at 18:27, and the score right after that is indeed 0-2 for 'met', the claim holds true.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the relevant cells are from row index 1 (second row) in the 'goal' and 'score' columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as verified by checking the relevant row where Vladimir Malenkih scored at 18:27, resulting in a score of 0-2 for 'met'.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Chris Drury scored his first goal of the game in a power play at 39:37.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find any mention of Chris Drury. Scanning down, I see that in the second row (row index 1), the team is met, and the player is Vladimir Malenkikh with a goal. That's not him.\n\nNext, looking at row index 3, the team is nyr, and the player is Chris Drury. The time here is 39:37. Now, I need to check if this was his first goal and whether it occurred during a power play (pp). \n\nThe 'goal' column for Chris Drury in this row says \"chris drury 1) ( pp )\". That indicates that it's his first goal of the game and was scored on a power play. The time is exactly 39:37 as stated in the claim.\n\nI should also check if there are any other goals by Chris Drury earlier than this time to confirm it's indeed his first. Looking at row index 5, he scores again at 50:13 with another (pp), which is his second goal. There are no entries before row index 3 for him, so the claim holds.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim match the information in the table. Therefore, it's true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The task is to determine whether the claim \"the score at 18:27 be 0 - 2 met because of chris drury's goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the table to find all entries where the time is 18:27. Looking through the rows, I see that the second row has a time of 18:27. This row corresponds to period 1st, team met, with the goal scored by Vladimir Malenkikh (1) and it's marked as a power play (pp). The score after this goal is 0 - 2 met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim. It states that at 18:27, the score was 0-2 because of Chris Drury's goal. However, from the table, we can see that the goal at 18:27 was scored by Vladimir Malenkikh, not Chris Drury. Chris Drury's goals are listed in different rows with times 39:37 and 50:13.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly attributes the goal to Chris Drury when it was actually Vladimir Malenkikh who scored at that time. Additionally, the score at 18:27 is correctly noted as 0-2 met in the table, but the reason provided in the claim (Chris Drury's goal) doesn't match.\n\nThe relevant cells for this analysis are:\n- The time cell at row index 1 which shows 18:27.\n- The goal scorer cell at row index 1, indicating Vladimir Malenkikh.\n- The score cell at row index 1, showing 0 - 2 met.\n\nSince the claim's attribution is incorrect, despite the correct score, the overall statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"vladimir malenkikh (1) ( pp ), with a score of 3 - 3 met, have a time of 17:38\".\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim into its components to check each part against the table.\n\n1. **Player and Goal Details**: The claim mentions \"vladimir malenkikh (1) ( pp )\". Looking at the table, I see in row index 1 (since rows start at 0), under the 'goal' column, it's exactly \"vladimir malenkikh (1) ( pp )\". So that part matches.\n\n2. **Score**: The claim states a score of \"3 - 3 met\". However, looking at the same row (row index 1), the 'score' column shows \"0 - 2 met\". This doesn't match because the score is 0-2, not 3-3. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\n3. **Time**: The claim mentions a time of \"17:38\". In row index 1, under the 'time' column, it's listed as \"18:27\". These times are different\u201417:38 vs. 18:27.\n\nSince both the score and the time in the claim do not match what's in the table, the overall claim is false.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a table in markdown format and a claim about a specific goal scored during a game. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully to understand its structure. The columns are \"period,\" \"team,\" \"goal,\" \"time,\" and \"score.\" Each row represents a specific event in the game, detailing which team scored, who scored the goal, when it happened (in time format), and the resulting score.\n\nNow, looking at the claim: \"the goal by chris drury 1 (pp) be in the 3rd period, for the time of 52:18.\" I need to verify each part of this statement against the table.\n\nBreaking down the claim:\n1. The goal was scored by Chris Drury.\n2. It's his first goal mentioned in the context (indicated by (1)).\n3. It was a power play goal, denoted by (pp).\n4. This occurred in the 3rd period.\n5. The time of the goal is 52:18.\n\nI'll start by searching for Chris Drury's goals in the table. Scanning through the \"goal\" column:\n\n- In the first row under the \"goal\" column, it says \"denis platonov (1)\" for Met team.\n- The second row has \"vladimir malenkikh (1) ( pp )\" also for Met.\n- Moving to the 4th row, I see \"chris drury (1) ( pp )\", which is scored by Nyr at time 39:37 in the 2nd period. The score after this goal is 1-3 Nyr.\n\nContinuing further:\n- In the 5th row, there's another goal by Chris Drury marked as \"(2)\" at time 50:13 in the 3rd period.\n- There's a third goal by him in the 6th row, but that's \"ryan callahan (1)\", so not relevant.\n\nSo from this, Chris Drury scored two goals. The first was in the 2nd period at 39:37, and the second was in the 3rd period at 50:13. Nowhere do I see a goal by him in the 3rd period at 52:18.\n\nThe claim mentions that this specific goal (Chris Drury's first one) occurred in the 3rd period at 52:18. However, according to the table, his first goal was scored earlier in the 2nd period, and the second was in the 3rd period but at a different time.\n\nAdditionally, checking the times:\n- The claimed time is 52:18, which doesn't match any of Chris Drury's goals. His first goal was at 39:37, and the second at 50:13.\n\nMoreover, looking at all rows in the 3rd period, the times are 45:45, 50:13, and 59:40. None of these match 52:18 either.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect on two counts: the period (it was the 2nd period for his first goal) and the time (the time given doesn't align with any of his goals).\n\nI should note down the relevant cells that were checked to support this conclusion. These include rows where Chris Drury scored, which are row index 3 (first goal) and row index 5 (second goal). The columns checked are \"period,\" \"goal,\" \"time,\" and \"score\" for each of these rows.\n\nIn summary, since the claim states that Chris Drury's first goal was in the 3rd period at 52:18, but according to the table, his first goal was in the 2nd period at 39:37, and there is no goal by him at 52:18, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"period\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"period\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goal\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"time\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
