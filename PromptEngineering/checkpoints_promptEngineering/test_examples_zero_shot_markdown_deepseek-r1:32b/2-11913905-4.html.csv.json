    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the date list for the item that be undergo overhaul, restoration or repair be 1956\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: number & name, description, livery, owner(s), and date. There are several rows with data under these headers.\n\nThe claim is about an item that's undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repairs, specifically mentioning the year 1956 as the date for this process. So, I need to check if there's a row in the table where the \"date\" column is 1956 and another column indicates it's undergoing some form of repair or restoration.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow 0: All entries are \"operational.\" The date here isn't relevant because the status isn't about overhaul. So I can ignore this row.\n\nRow 1: Date is 1919, which doesn't match 1956. Also, it's under operational status.\n\nRow 2: Date is 1920. Not matching 1956.\n\nRow 3: Date is 1946. Still not 1956.\n\nRow 4: Date is 1954. Close but not 1956. The status here isn't about overhaul either; it's operational with a private owner.\n\nRow 5: Date is 1956. Hmm, this matches the year in the claim. Now I need to check if this row mentions anything about undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repair. Let me look at the \"description\" and other columns. The description here says it's an \"andrew barclay 0 - 4 - 0dm,\" which doesn't indicate any maintenance activity. The livery is \"lined green,\" and owner is a private owner. So no indication of overhaul or repair.\n\nRow 6: Date is 1961. Doesn't match.\n\nRow 7: This entire row's entries are about being \"undergoing overhaul, restoration, or repairs.\" However, the date here isn't filled; instead, it says \"undergoing...repairs\" in each cell, including the date column. So there's no specific year listed for this activity.\n\nRow 8: Date is stored as \"stored or static,\" so not relevant to the claim about overhaul in a specific year.\n\nRow 9: Date is 1952. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, looking at all rows, the only one with date 1956 (Row 5) doesn't indicate any overhaul activity. The row that mentions undergoing repairs (Row 7) doesn't have a specific date of 1956; it's more like a status without a year.\n\nTherefore, there's no entry in the table where an item is both undergoing overhaul and has the date 1956. So the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because while there is an entry with date 1956 (Row 5), it doesn't mention any overhaul activity, and the row that does mention repairs doesn't have a specific year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
