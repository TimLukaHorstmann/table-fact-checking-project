    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams do\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim compares the number of times Jordan Farmar and Deron Williams were the top assistors (i.e., led in assists) during their respective games in the table. So, for each game, we'll check who had more assists and count how many times each did that.\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns named \"high assists\" which indicate who led in assists for each game. Each row represents a different game, so there are 8 rows (games) total.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to note down who led in assists:\n\n1. **Game 75**: deron williams 7\n2. **Game 76**: deron williams 9\n3. **Game 77**: deron williams 21\n4. **Game 78**: jordan farmar 11\n5. **Game 79**: jordan farmar 9\n6. **Game 80**: jordan farmar 7\n7. **Game 81**: jordan farmar 9\n\nWait, that's only 7 games, but the table has 8 rows from game 75 to 81 inclusive. Let me recount:\n\n- Game 75: deron williams (assists 7)\n- Game 76: deron williams (assists 9)\n- Game 77: deron williams (assists 21)\n- Game 78: jordan farmar (assists 11)\n- Game 79: jordan farmar (assists 9)\n- Game 80: jordan farmar (assists 7)\n- Game 81: jordan farmar (assists 9)\n\nWait, that's 7 games where either Jordan or Deron led in assists. Wait, but the table has 8 games from game 75 to 81. Did I miss one? Let me check again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nRow indexes are from 0 to 6 because there are 7 rows (games 75-81). So, each row is as follows:\n\n- Row 0: Game 75: deron\n- Row 1: Game 76: deron\n- Row 2: Game 77: deron\n- Row 3: Game 78: jordan\n- Row 4: Game 79: jordan\n- Row 5: Game 80: jordan\n- Row 6: Game 81: jordan\n\nWait, so that's correct. So, in row indices:\n\nDeron led in rows 0, 1, and 2 (3 games).\n\nJordan led in rows 3,4,5,6 (4 games). \n\nSo Jordan led in more games than Deron did.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo support this, I'll list all the relevant cells that were checked. Each cell is under the \"high assists\" column for each game row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"brook lopez lead the team in both points and rebounds in a single game three different times.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is asserting. It's saying that Brook Lopez was the top scorer (highest points) and also had the highest rebounds for his team in the same game, and this happened three separate times across the listed games.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, score, high points, high rebounds, etc. So I need to check each row where Brook Lopez is mentioned as having high points or rebounds and see if in any of those rows he leads both categories simultaneously.\n\nLet's go through each relevant row:\n\nRow 75: April 1 vs Philadelphia\n- High points: Brandan Wright (15)\n- High rebounds: Brandan Wright (11)\nSo Brook isn't leading here in either category.\n\nRow 76: April 3 vs Miami\n- High points: Deron Williams (18)\n- High rebounds: Travis Outlaw (9)\nBrook isn't mentioned here, so he didn't lead in either.\n\nRow 77: April 5 vs Minnesota\n- High points: Brook Lopez (30)\n- High rebounds: Brook Lopez (12)\nHere, Brook leads both. That's one instance.\n\nRow 78: April 6 vs Detroit\n- High points: Brook Lopez (39)\n- High rebounds: Brook Lopez (7)\nAnother time he leads in both categories. Now that's two instances.\n\nRow 79: April 8 vs New York\n- High points: Brook Lopez (27)\n- High rebounds: Jordan Farmar (8)\nHere, Brook leads points but not rebounds. So this doesn't count towards the claim.\n\nRow 80: April 10 vs Toronto\n- High points: Brook Lopez (35)\n- High rebounds: Brook Lopez (11)\nThird time he leads both. Now that's three instances.\n\nRow 81: April 11 vs Charlotte\n- High points: Brook Lopez (31)\n- High rebounds: Dan Gadzuric (8)\nAgain, Brook leads in points but not rebounds, so it doesn't count.\n\nSo from the table, there are three games where Brook Lopez led both in points and rebounds. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Brook Lopez led in both categories three times across the listed games.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"the nets' only win come at the prudential center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the Nets (which is likely a team name) have their only victory in a game held at Prudential Center. So, my task is to check all the games listed and see if any of them resulted in a win for the Nets outside of Prudential Center.\n\nLooking at the table, there are seven rows, each representing a different game (numbered 75 to 81). Each row has details like date, opponent team, score, location attendance, record, etc. The 'score' column shows whether the Nets won or lost; for example, \"w\" indicates a win and \"l\" indicates a loss.\n\nI'll go through each game one by one:\n\n1. Game 75: April 1 vs Philadelphia. Score is L (loss), so no relevance to the claim about wins.\n2. Game 76: April 3 vs Miami. Another loss, so not relevant.\n3. Game 77: April 5 vs Minnesota. The score shows a win (W). Looking at the location attendance column, it's Prudential Center with 13461 attendees. This is one of their wins at Prudential Center, which supports part of the claim.\n4. Game 78: April 6 vs Detroit. A loss again.\n5. Game 79: April 8 vs New York. Another loss.\n6. Game 80: April 10 vs Toronto. Loss as well.\n7. Game 81: April 11 vs Charlotte. The last game is a loss.\n\nFrom the data, I can see that the Nets only have one win in this table, which is Game 77 against Minnesota at Prudential Center. All other games either resulted in losses or were played at different locations like Wells Fargo Center, The Palace of Auburn Hills, and Air Canada Centre.\n\nTherefore, the claim that their only win came at Prudential Center seems to be supported by this data since there's no evidence of a win elsewhere.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"brook lopez led the team in points for 5 straight games\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim means. It says that Brook Lopez was the top scorer (led in points) for five consecutive games. So I need to check each of the five consecutive games and see if Brook Lopez had the highest point total in each of those games.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns for \"game,\" \"date,\" \"team,\" \"score,\" \"high points,\" and others. The relevant column here is \"high points\" because that shows who scored the most in each game.\n\nThe claim mentions five straight games. Let's see how many games are there in the table. There are 7 games listed, from game 75 to game 81. So, I need to check if Brook Lopez was the high scorer in any five consecutive games within these seven.\n\nLet me list out the \"high points\" for each game:\n\n- Game 75: April 1 - Brandan Wright (15)\n- Game 76: April 3 - Deron Williams (18)\n- Game 77: April 5 - Brook Lopez (30)\n- Game 78: April 6 - Brook Lopez (39)\n- Game 79: April 8 - Brook Lopez (27)\n- Game 80: April 10 - Brook Lopez (35)\n- Game 81: April 11 - Brook Lopez (31)\n\nNow, looking at this list:\n\n- In game 75 and 76, Brook Lopez didn't lead. Brandan Wright led in game 75, and Deron Williams in game 76.\n- Starting from game 77, Brook Lopez leads points until game 81.\n\nSo games 77 to 81 are five consecutive games where Brook Lopez was the high scorer:\n\n- Game 77: April 5 - Yes\n- Game 78: April 6 - Yes\n- Game 79: April 8 - Yes\n- Game 80: April 10 - Yes\n- Game 81: April 11 - Yes\n\nThat's five straight games where he led in points. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nNow, to note the relevant cells for each of these games, I'll need their row indices and the \"high points\" column. Looking at the table:\n\n- The rows are indexed from 0 (game75) up to 6 (game81). So game77 is row index 2, game78 is 3, game79 is 4, game80 is 5, and game81 is 6.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 2, column \"high points\"\n- Row 3, column \"high points\"\n- Row 4, column \"high points\"\n- Row 5, column \"high points\"\n- Row 6, column \"high points\"\n\nEach of these shows Brook Lopez as the high scorer. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the claim \"the most highly attended game was against Miami at the Prudential Center\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating two things: \n1. The most attended game (highest attendance) was played against Miami.\n2. That game took place at the Prudential Center.\n\nSo, I should check both these points using the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns like 'date', 'team' (opponent), 'score', and 'location attendance'. The column named \"location attendance\" seems to combine the location and the number of attendees. My goal is to find out which game had the highest attendance and verify both the opponent team and the location for that game.\n\nLet's go through each row in the table and note down the attendance figures:\n\n- Game 75: Wells Fargo Center, 16,695 attendees\n- Game 76: Prudential Center, 18,711 attendees\n- Game 77: Prudential Center, 13,461 attendees\n- Game 78: The Palace of Auburn Hills, 14,554 attendees\n- Game 79: Prudential Center, 18,023 attendees\n- Game 80: Air Canada Centre, 17,755 attendees\n- Game 81: Prudential Center, 13,853 attendees\n\nNow, let's identify the highest attendance. Looking at the numbers:\n\n16,695 (Game 75)  \n18,711 (Game 76) \u2013 this is higher than the others so far  \n13,461 (Game 77)  \n14,554 (Game 78)  \n18,023 (Game 79) \u2013 also high but less than Game 76  \n17,755 (Game 80)  \n13,853 (Game 81)\n\nSo the highest attendance is 18,711 at Game 76.\n\nNow, checking which team they played against in Game 76. The 'team' column for row index 1 (since rows are zero-indexed: row 0 is game 75, row 1 is game 76) says \"miami\". So yes, the opponent was Miami.\n\nNext, confirming the location. In Game 76, the location is Prudential Center as per the 'location attendance' column. \n\nSo both conditions of the claim are satisfied: the most attended game was against Miami at the Prudential Center. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The user has provided a table with data about several games and is asking whether the claim \"brook lopez lead the team in assist for more game than deron williams do\" is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nFirst, I'll break down what the claim is saying. It states that Brook Lopez led his team in assists more times than Deron Williams did across these games. So, my task is to count how many times each player was the top assister and then compare those counts.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for this analysis is \"high assists.\" Each row under this column shows who had the most assists in that game along with their assist count in parentheses. \n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (April 1):** Deron Williams led with 7 assists.\n2. **Row 1 (April 3):** Deron Williams again led with 9 assists.\n3. **Row 2 (April 5):** Deron Williams topped the chart with 21 assists.\n4. **Row 3 (April 6):** Jordan Farmar had the most assists, not either of them.\n5. **Row 4 (April 8):** Jordan Farmar led again, so neither Brook nor Deron.\n6. **Row 5 (April 10):** Jordan Farmar was the top assister once more.\n7. **Row 6 (April 11):** This time, it's not specified who led, but looking back, I see that Jordan Farmar had 9 assists.\n\nWait, in row 6, it says \"jordan farmar (9)\", so again, not Brook or Deron.\n\nSo compiling the counts:\n- **Deron Williams:** Rows 0, 1, and 2. That's 3 games.\n- **Brook Lopez:** Looking at all rows, he doesn't appear in the \"high assists\" column anywhere except maybe if I missed something.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: Deron (7)\nRow 1: Deron (9)\nRow 2: Deron (21)\nRows 3-6: Jordan Farmar or Dan Gadzuric. No mention of Brook Lopez in assists. \n\nTherefore, Brook Lopez led in assists 0 times, while Deron Williams did so 3 times. So the claim that Brook led more games than Deron is clearly FALSE.\n\nNow, regarding the relevant cells, I need to list all instances where either Brook or Deron were the top assister. From the table:\n\n- Row 0: \"high assists\" - Deron\n- Row 1: \"high assists\" - Deron\n- Row 2: \"high assists\" - Deron\n\nSo those three rows are relevant because they show who led in assists each time. Brook doesn't appear, so no other rows are needed beyond these to support the conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE since Brook Lopez did not lead in any games for assists, while Deron Williams did so three times.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"travis outlaw lead the team in both point and rebound in a single game 3 different times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It says that Travis Outlaw led the team in both points and rebounds in three separate games. So, for each of those three games, Travis must be listed as having the highest points and the highest rebounds.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- The columns relevant to this claim are \"high points\" and \"high rebounds\".\n- Each row represents a game, with details about that specific game.\n\nI'll go through each row (game) and check if Travis Outlaw is mentioned in both the \"high points\" and \"high rebounds\" columns for any of them. If he appears in both columns for three games, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me examine each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 75)**:\n   - High Points: Brandan Wright (15)\n   - High Rebounds: Brandan Wright (11)\n   - Travis Outlaw isn't mentioned here.\n\n2. **Row 1 (Game 76)**:\n   - High Points: Deron Williams (18)\n   - High Rebounds: Travis Outlaw (9)\n   - Here, Travis led in rebounds but not in points.\n\n3. **Row 2 (Game 77)**:\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (30)\n   - High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (12)\n   - Travis isn't mentioned here either.\n\n4. **Row 3 (Game 78)**:\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (39)\n   - High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (7)\n   - No mention of Travis in rebounds or points.\n\n5. **Row 4 (Game 79)**:\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (27)\n   - High Rebounds: Jordan Farmar (8)\n   - Travis isn't here.\n\n6. **Row 5 (Game 80)**:\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (35)\n   - High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (11)\n   - No Travis in either.\n\n7. **Row 6 (Game 81)**:\n   - High Points: Brook Lopez (31)\n   - High Rebounds: Dan Gadzuric (8)\n   - Travis isn't listed here.\n\nAfter reviewing all the rows, I notice that Travis Outlaw only appears once in the \"high rebounds\" column (Row 1) but never in the \"high points\". Therefore, there's no instance where he led both categories simultaneously. Since the claim requires this to happen three times, it clearly isn't supported by the data.\n\nHence, the answer is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So, I need to check two things: how many wins the Nets had, and where those wins took place.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one. The \"record\" column shows the team's overall record after each game, but what's more relevant is the outcome of each game listed in the \"score\" column.\n\nStarting with Game 75 on April 1 against Philadelphia: The score is L 90-115 (OT), which means it's a loss. So no win here.\n\nGame 76 on April 3 against Miami: Another loss, as indicated by L 94-108 (OT). No win in this row either.\n\nMoving to Game 77 on April 5 against Minnesota: The score is W 107-105 (OT), indicating a win. Now, I need to check where this game was played. The location attendance column says \"prudential center 13461\". Prudential Center is in New Jersey, not Toronto's Air Canada Centre.\n\nNext, Game 78 on April 6 against Detroit: This is another loss (L 109-116 OT). So no win here.\n\nGame 79 on April 8 against New York: Again, a loss with L 93-116 OT. No win in this row.\n\nGame 80 on April 10 against Toronto: The score is L 92-99 OT, so another loss. But I notice that the location is \"air canada centre\", which is where the claim suggests the only win happened. However, since it's a loss, there's no win here.\n\nFinally, Game 81 on April 11 against Charlotte: Another loss (L 103-105 OT). No win in this row.\n\nFrom all the games listed, the only win for the Nets is at Game 77 against Minnesota. The location was Prudential Center, not Air Canada Centre. Therefore, the claim that their only win came at Air Canada Centre is incorrect because they had a win elsewhere and didn't have any wins there.\n\nSo, putting it all together: There's only one win for the Nets in this table, which occurred at Prudential Center, not at Air Canada Centre. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that the Nets won once against Minnesota on April 5th at Prudential Center, which is not the Air Canada Centre.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Wins:** Look through each row's \"score\" column for 'W'.\n   - Only Game 77 (April 5) shows a win ('W 107-105').\n\n2. **Check Location of Win:** For the winning game, check the \"location attendance\".\n   - Game 77 was at Prudential Center, not Air Canada Centre.\n\n3. **Verify No Other Wins at Air Canada Centre:** Check if any other wins occurred there.\n   - There are no other wins in the table, and the only win is not at Air Canada Centre.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The claim is false because the Nets' only win was elsewhere.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "jordan farmar lead the team in point for 5 straight game",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the claim \"jordan farmar lead the team in point for 5 straight game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. \"Jordan Farmar led the team in points\" implies that in those games, his points were higher than any other player on the team. \"For 5 straight games\" suggests that this happened consecutively over five game entries in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, I see columns like \"high points,\" which lists the top scorer for each game along with their points. So, to verify if Jordan Farmar led in points, I need to check the \"high points\" column across the relevant games.\n\nThe claim doesn't specify which five consecutive games, so I should look through all possible sequences of five consecutive games and see if there's any where Farmar is listed as the high scorer each time.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Game 75: High points are Brandan Wright with 15.\n2. Game 76: Deron Williams scored 18, leading the team.\n3. Game 77: Brook Lopez led with 30 points.\n4. Game 78: Again, Brook Lopez with 39 points.\n5. Game 79: Brook Lopez had 27 points.\n6. Game 80: Brook Lopez again at 35.\n7. Game 81: Farmar isn't listed here; the high scorer is Brook Lopez with 31.\n\nWait, actually, looking back:\n\n- In Game 75: Brandan Wright\n- Game 76: Deron Williams\n- Game 77: Brook Lopez\n- Game 78: Brook Lopez\n- Game 79: Brook Lopez\n- Game 80: Brook Lopez\n- Game 81: Brook Lopez\n\nSo, from Game 77 to Game 81, Brook Lopez is the high scorer in all five games. However, the claim is about Jordan Farmar.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any instance where Farmar led in points except maybe if he's listed as the top scorer somewhere else, but checking each row:\n\n- Games 75: No\n- Game 76: Deron\n- Game 77: Brook\n- Game 78: Brook\n- Game 79: Brook\n- Game 80: Brook\n- Game 81: Brook\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check each \"high points\" column again.\n\nGame 75: Brandan Wright (15)\nGame 76: Deron Williams (18)\nGame 77: Brook Lopez (30)\nGame 78: Brook Lopez (39)\nGame 79: Brook Lopez (27)\nGame 80: Brook Lopez (35)\nGame 81: Brook Lopez (31)\n\nSo in none of these games does Jordan Farmar lead the team in points. Therefore, there's no sequence where he leads for five straight games.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm miscounting or misunderstanding \"straight.\" Maybe it refers to any five games, not necessarily consecutive? But the term \"5 straight\" implies consecutive.\n\nSo, since in all these seven games, Farmar is never the top scorer, there's no way he led for five straight. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jordan Farmar led the team in points for five consecutive games. By examining each game's \"high points\" column, it's clear that Brook Lopez was the leading scorer in all relevant games, and Farmar never led the team in points during these periods.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is true or false based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the most highly attended game be against minnesota at the prudential center.\" \n\nFirst, let me break down what this means. It seems like there are two parts to the claim:\n\n1. That the game against Minnesota was the one with the highest attendance.\n2. That this game took place at the Prudential Center.\n\nI need to check both these points using the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with various details. The relevant columns for this claim are \"team\" and \"location attendance.\"\n\nStarting with the team: I'll scan through each row's \"team\" column to find where the opponent was Minnesota. Scanning the rows:\n\n- Row 75: Philadelphia\n- Row 76: Miami\n- Row 77: Minnesota\n- Row 78: Detroit\n- Row 79: New York\n- Row 80: Toronto\n- Row 81: Charlotte\n\nSo, row 77 is the game against Minnesota.\n\nNext, I need to check where this game was held. Looking at the \"location attendance\" column for row 77, it says \"prudential center 13461.\" So yes, the game against Minnesota was indeed at the Prudential Center.\n\nNow, checking if this was the most attended game. I need to look at all the attendance numbers in the \"location attendance\" column:\n\n- Row 75: 16695\n- Row 76: 18711\n- Row 77: 13461\n- Row 78: 14554\n- Row 79: 18023\n- Row 80: 17755\n- Row 81: 13853\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest attendance is in row 76 with 18711. That's higher than row 77's 13461. So the game against Miami had more attendees than the one against Minnesota.\n\nTherefore, even though the game against Minnesota was at the Prudential Center, it wasn't the most attended. The highest attendance was for a different game (against Miami). \n\nSo the claim is false because while part of it is correct (the location), it's incorrect about it being the most attended.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game against Minnesota at the Prudential Center had the highest attendance, but according to the table, row 76 has a higher attendance than row 77. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 77, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 76, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
