    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"michael bradley jelani mccoy (14) have the highest rebound against miami\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two players, Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy, with a number in parentheses, presumably their rebounds. The claim states they had the highest rebounds against Miami.\n\nLooking at the table, I should find the row where the opponent is Miami. Scanning through the 'team' column, I see that game 75 was against San Antonio, game 76 against New Jersey, game 77 against Miami, and others are different teams. So, the relevant row is row index 7 (since indexing starts at 0).\n\nIn this row (index 7), under 'high rebounds', it lists \"michael bradley  , jelani mccoy (14)\". This indicates that both players had a combined or individual high of 14 rebounds. The claim says they have the highest rebound against Miami, and since their entry is listed in this row, it's accurate.\n\nI'll check other rows to ensure there isn't a higher number elsewhere, but the claim specifically mentions Miami, so only row 7 matters here. No other cells are relevant for verifying this particular claim about Miami.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cell is row index 7 under 'high rebounds'.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that Michael Bradley and Jelani McCoy had the highest rebounds (14) against Miami in game 75. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high rebounds\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
