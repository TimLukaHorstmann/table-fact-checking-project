    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"susan sarandon be the winner nominee in 2001\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the claim. It says Susan Sarandon was a winner nominee in 2001. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because \"winner\" and \"nominee\" are different things. A winner is someone who won an award, while a nominee is someone who was nominated but didn't necessarily win.\n\nNow, looking at the table, I see it has columns: year, category, film, winner/nominee(s), and result. So each row represents either a nomination or a win in that specific year for that category.\n\nI need to find the rows where the year is 2001 because the claim specifies 2001. Scanning through the years: 1997, 1999, 2001, etc. The third row (index 2) has the year 2001.\n\nIn that row, the category is \"favorite voice from an animated movie,\" the film is \"rugrats in paris: the movie,\" and the winner/nominee is Susan Sarandon. The result column says she \"won.\"\n\nSo the claim states that Susan Sarandon was a \"winner nominee\" in 2001. But looking at the table, her result is marked as \"won,\" not just nominated. So technically, she did win, which means she was both nominated and won.\n\nBut the wording of the claim might be mixing up the terms. Maybe it meant to say whether she was a nominee (which she was) or if she won (which she also did). Since the result is \"won,\" her status in that year includes both being a nominee and winning.\n\nTherefore, the claim that she was a winner nominee in 2001 is TRUE because she was nominated and went on to win. The relevant cells are from the row where Susan Sarandon's information is listed.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as Susan Sarandon won in 2001. Relevant cells include her entry with details about being a winner.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"film\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner  / nominee  (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"bruce willis be nominate for the film rugrats go wild\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find entries related to Bruce Willis and the film Rugrats Go Wild.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- 1997: Rosie O'Donnell nominated for Harriet the Spy.\n- 1999: N/A won for The Rugrats Movie.\n- 2001: Susan Sarandon won for Rugrats in Paris.\n- 2004: Bruce Willis is listed here. Let me check this row.\n\nIn the 2004 row, the category is \"favorite voice from an animated movie\" and the film is \"rugrats go wild\". The winner/nominee is Bruce Willis, and the result is \"nominated\".\n\nSo, according to the table, Bruce Willis was nominated for that role in that film. \n\nThe claim says he was nominated, which matches the table's entry.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bruce Willis was nominated for Rugrats Go Wild, which aligns with the table where his result is \"nominated\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"film\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner  / nominee  (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the winner / nominee(s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what we're looking for. We need information about the year 2007 in the category of \"favorite movie actor\" and check who was the winner or nominee.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find any entries from 2007. Scanning the years:\n\n- The first few rows are from 1997, 1999, 2001, etc., but in 2005 and then 2007 appears twice.\n\nSo there are two entries for 2007:\n1. Row index 5: favorite movie actor category, film \"nacho libre\", winner/nominee is jack black, result was nominated.\n2. Row index 6: favorite movie actress category, film \"charlotte's web\", winner is dakota fanning.\n\nWait, the claim mentions \"favorite movie actor,\" so I should focus on row index 5. The nominee there is Jack Black, not Rosie O'Donnell. \n\nLooking back at other rows for any mention of Rosie O'Donnell: She appears in 1997 as a nominee in the \"favorite movie actress\" category for \"harriet the spy.\" But that's a different year and a different category.\n\nSo according to the table, the 2007 favorite movie actor nominee was Jack Black, not Rosie O'Donnell. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Rosie O'Donnell was the winner or nominee for the 2007 \"favorite movie actor\" award. Checking the relevant cells:\n\n- The 2007 entry in the \"favorite movie actor\" category lists Jack Black as the nominee.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner  / nominee  (s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the result of the 1999 favorite movie be nominate.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this claim correctly. It seems like it's trying to say that in 1999, under the category of 'favorite movie,' the result was a nomination.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for entries where the year is 1999 and the category is \"favorite movie.\" Scanning through each row:\n\n- The second row (index 1) has Year: 1999, Category: favorite movie, Film: the rugrats movie, Winner/nominee: n/a, Result: won.\n\nSo in 1999 for favorite movie, it says \"won\" as the result. But the claim says \"be nominate,\" which I interpret as being nominated.\n\nSince the actual result was a win, not a nomination, the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify relevant cells: row 1 (index starting at 0?), or wait, in markdown tables, sometimes rows are counted from 0 or 1. Let me check the table structure:\n\nThe table has headers as the first line after |-------:, so the data starts from row index 0 for year 1997.\n\nWait no, looking back: The table's first data row is 1997 (row index 0), next is 1999 (index 1). So the relevant cell is in row 1.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\n- Row 1, column \"result\" which shows 'won' instead of 'nominated.'\n\nAlso, perhaps checking if there are other entries for favorite movie in 1999. But looking through all rows, only one entry for 1999: category is favorite movie, result won.\n\nSo the claim that it was nominated (result 'nominated') is incorrect because the table says 'won.'\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1999, the \"favorite movie\" category resulted in a nomination. However, according to the table, the result for that entry was \"won,\" not \"nominated.\" Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
