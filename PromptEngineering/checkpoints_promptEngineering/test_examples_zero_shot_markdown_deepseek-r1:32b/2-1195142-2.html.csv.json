    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine whether the claim \"the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography do not go to william ivey long\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and understand what each column represents: year, award, category, nominee, and result. The goal is to find any entries that match the criteria in the claim.\n\nThe claim mentions three key elements: the year (2005), the award (drama desk award), the category (outstanding choreography), and the nominee (william ivey long). It also states that he did not receive this award, so we need to check if William Ivey Long was nominated or won in this category.\n\nLooking through each row of the table:\n\n1. The first few rows are about Tony Awards, which isn't relevant here since the claim is about Drama Desk Awards.\n2. Starting from row 4:\n   - Row 4: Drama Desk Award for outstanding revival of a musical, result is 'won' by the same category (this seems odd but perhaps it's an entry error).\n   - Row 5: Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography, nominee is Jerry Mitchell, and he won.\n   - Row 6: Drama Desk Award for outstanding costume design, nominee is William Ivey Long, result is 'nominated'.\n\nSo, focusing on the category \"outstanding choreography\" in 2005 under Drama Desk Awards. From row 5, we see that Jerry Mitchell was the nominee and he won. There's no entry where William Ivey Long is nominated for outstanding choreography; instead, he was nominated for costume design.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that William Ivey Long did not receive this award, which aligns with the table data because he wasn't even nominated in the choreography category. Hence, the claim is TRUE.\n\nThe relevant cells are row 5, columns \"award\", \"category\", \"nominee\", and \"result\" since they directly pertain to who was recognized for outstanding choreography at the Drama Desk Awards in 2005.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"nominee for best costume design in 2005 at the tony award be qilliam ivey long.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asserting. It says that William Ivey Long was nominated for Best Costume Design in 2005 at the Tony Awards.\n\nLooking at the table, there are multiple rows. Each row has information about a specific award, category, nominee, and result for each year. Since the claim is about 2005, I'll focus on the rows where the year is 2005 and the award is \"tony award.\"\n\nI notice two relevant entries:\n\n1. Row index 3: Award is Tony Award, Category is Best Costume Design, Nominee is William Ivey Long, Result is Nominated.\n2. There's another entry for Drama Desk Award in row index 6 with similar category but that's a different award.\n\nThe claim mentions \"tony award,\" so the relevant cell is from row 3. The nominee there is indeed William Ivey Long, and the result was nominated. \n\nWait, but the name in the claim is spelled \"qilliam ivey long\" which seems like a typo for \"William.\" Since it's likely a misspelling, but the core information matches: the nominee was William Ivey Long for Best Costume Design at the Tony Awards in 2005.\n\nSo, the claim is correct despite the typo in spelling. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that William Ivey Long was a nominee for Best Costume Design at the 2005 Tony Awards, despite a minor typo in his name.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 2 winner of a tony award\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, there are multiple rows with information about awards won in 2005. The relevant columns here are \"award\", \"nominee\", and \"result\".\n\nI'll go through each row to see where Jerry Mitchell is mentioned:\n\n1. Row index 0: This is about a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, but the nominee is listed as \"best revival of a musical\" which doesn't seem right because it's referring to the category itself rather than a person. So this isn't relevant for Jerry.\n\n2. Row index 1: Another Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, nominated by Gary Beach. Not Jerry Mitchell here either.\n\n3. Row index 2: Here's the first mention of Jerry Mitchell. It says he won a Tony Award for Best Choreography. So this is one win.\n\n4. Row index 3: This is about William Ivey Long for Best Costume Design, so not relevant to Jerry.\n\n5. Row index 4 and 5: These are Drama Desk Awards, which are different from Tony Awards, so we can skip these since the claim is specifically about Tony Awards.\n\n6. Row index 6: Again, a Drama Desk Award, not relevant here.\n\nSo in the table, Jerry Mitchell has only one entry for a Tony Award where he won (row index 2). There's no other row in the table where he won another Tony Award. Therefore, the claim that he is \"1 of 2 winners\" isn't supported because the table shows him winning just once.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if there are any other Tony Awards he won elsewhere in the table? Let me double-check all rows again.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Rows 0 to 3 are Tony Award entries. Only row 2 mentions Jerry Mitchell as a winner for Best Choreography. There's no second win listed here.\n\nSo based on this, the claim is incorrect because the table only shows one Tony Award win for Jerry Mitchell, not two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards, but the table only lists one win for him in the category of Best Choreography at row index 2. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that Jerry Mitchell was one out of three nominees for a Drama Desk Award. To verify this, I need to check the table for entries related to Jerry Mitchell and Drama Desk Awards.\n\nLooking at the table, I see multiple rows where the award is \"drama desk award\". Let me go through each relevant row:\n\n1. The fifth row: Award is Drama Desk, category is Outstanding Revival of a Musical. The nominee is listed as \"outstanding revival of a musical\", which seems like it's referring to the production itself rather than an individual. So Jerry Mitchell isn't involved here.\n\n2. The sixth row: Award is Drama Desk, category is Outstanding Choreography. Nominee is Jerry Mitchell, and he won this award. That means he was a nominee here for sure.\n\n3. The seventh row: Another Drama Desk award for Outstanding Costume Design. Nominee is William Ivey Long. Not relevant to Jerry.\n\nSo from the table, there's only one nomination for Jerry Mitchell in the Drama Desk Awards under Outstanding Choreography. But the claim says he was \"1 of 3 nominees\". That implies there should be two other nominees alongside him for a Drama Desk Award.\n\nLooking back at the table, I see that each Drama Desk award category has specific nominees. For Outstanding Revival and Outstanding Costume Design, the nominees aren't Jerry. The only nomination for Jerry is in Outstanding Choreography, which he won. There's no indication of any other nominations for him in this context.\n\nTherefore, according to the table, Jerry Mitchell was not one of three nominees but just a single nominee (and winner) for the Drama Desk Award in his category. Hence, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Jerry Mitchell was a nominee and won for Outstanding Choreography at the Drama Desk Awards, but there's no evidence of two other nominees alongside him. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"category\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that in 2005, the nominee for Best Costume Design won the award. So, I'm looking for entries where the year is 2005, the category is related to costume design, and checking if the result was a win.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Rows 3 and 6 have categories \"best costume design\" and \"outstanding costume design\", both in 2005.\n   - Row 3: Tony Award for Best Costume Design, nominee William Ivey Long, Result: Nominated\n   - Row 6: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design, same nominee, Result: Nominated\n\nSo, in both cases, the result was \"nominated\", not \"won\".

Let's start by understanding the claim: \"william ivey long win the 2005 drama desk award for outstanding choreography.\" Hmm, wait, the name in the claim is \"willam ivey long,\" but looking at the table, I see it's spelled \"William Ivey Long\" in some rows. That might be a typo in the claim, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNext, let me break down the components of the claim:\n1. Person: william ivey long (probably William Ivey Long)\n2. Event: 2005 Drama Desk Award\n3. Category: outstanding choreography\n4. Result: win\n\nNow, I'll go through each row in the table to check if any match these criteria.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n- Row 0: Tony Award for best revival of a musical, result is 'won', but nominee is the category itself, not a person.\n- Row 1: Tony Award for leading actor in a musical, nominee is Gary Beach, result is nominated.\n- Row 2: Tony Award for choreography, won by Jerry Mitchell.\n- Row 3: Tony Award for costume design, William Ivey Long was nominated.\n- Row 4: Drama Desk Award for outstanding revival, won, but the nominee is again the category itself.\n- Row 5: Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography, won by Jerry Mitchell.\n- Row 6: Drama Desk Award for outstanding costume design, William Ivey Long was nominated.\n\nSo focusing on Drama Desk Awards:\n- The claim mentions \"outstanding choreography\" and Drama Desk Award. Checking row 5: category is outstanding choreography, nominee is Jerry Mitchell, result is 'won'.\n- For the same award but in row 6, it's costume design where William Ivey Long was nominated.\n\nTherefore, the claim says that William Ivey Long won for outstanding choreography at the Drama Desk Awards in 2005. But according to the table, Jerry Mitchell won for that category. William Ivey Long only got a nomination in costume design.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because the actual winner was Jerry Mitchell, not William Ivey Long.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that William Ivey Long won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"gary beach be 1 of 4 nominee for a tony award\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim. It states that Gary Beach was one out of four nominees for a Tony Award. So, there should be exactly four nominees in the Tony Awards category where Gary Beach was nominated.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several entries under \"tony award\". Each row represents an award category and nominee. Let me list them:\n\n1. Best revival of a musical - won by \"best revival of a musical\"\n2. Best performance by a leading actor in a musical - Gary Beach nominated\n3. Best choreography - Jerry Mitchell won\n4. Best costume design - William Ivey Long nominated\n\nSo, for the Tony Awards, there are four categories here: best revival (won), leading actor (nominated), choreography (won), and costume design (nominated). Each of these is a separate award category.\n\nThe claim says Gary Beach was one of four nominees. Wait, but each row in the table represents a different award category. So, for each Tony Award category, there's only one nominee listed here. But in reality, each award has multiple nominees; however, the table only shows one per category because it's about who got nominated or won.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The table lists each award and the specific nominee. So, if we count how many times \"tony award\" is mentioned and where Gary Beach is a nominee, that might be relevant.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\n- Row 1: Tony Award for Best Revival - won by itself (but this seems odd; maybe it's indicating that the production won)\n- Row 2: Tony Award for Best Performance by Leading Actor in a Musical - Gary Beach nominated\n- Row 3: Tony Award for Best Choreography - Jerry Mitchell won\n- Row 4: Tony Award for Best Costume Design - William Ivey Long nominated\n\nSo, there are four Tony Award categories listed here. In each category, there is one nominee (though not all are won). But the claim says Gary Beach was one of four nominees. So, if each category has multiple nominees, but only Gary's nomination is shown in his category.\n\nWait, perhaps the table lists all the nominees for each award. For example, in the \"best performance\" category, there are multiple nominees, and Gary Beach is one of them. But the table only shows Gary as a nominee, implying that he was among others.\n\nAlternatively, if the table only lists the nominees where someone won or got nominated, but doesn't list all possible nominees for each award, then we can't be sure how many were in total for each category.\n\nBut according to the claim, Gary is one of four nominees. So, there should be a Tony Award category with four nominees, and Gary is one of them.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"tony award\", the rows are:\n\n1. Best revival: won by itself (probably indicating that the production won)\n2. Leading actor in musical: Gary Beach nominated\n3. Choreography: Jerry Mitchell won\n4. Costume design: William Ivey Long nominated\n\nSo, in the leading actor category, only Gary is listed as a nominee. But does that mean there were four nominees total? Or is Gary just one of multiple?\n\nWait, perhaps the table doesn't list all nominees but only those related to specific individuals or categories where someone either won or was nominated.\n\nBut given the claim, it's about whether Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award. So, in his category (leading actor), were there four nominees? The table doesn't provide that information\u2014it only shows Gary as a nominee but doesn't list others.\n\nTherefore, based solely on this table, we can't confirm if there were exactly four nominees in total for the Tony Award leading actor category. The claim might be true if there were indeed three other nominees besides Gary, but since the table only lists Gary as nominated and others are not shown, we don't have enough data to verify that.\n\nWait, no\u2014another approach: maybe the four Tony Awards listed in the table include Gary's nomination. So, each row is a separate award, and there are four awards where someone was either nominated or won. In that case, the claim might be saying that among these four, Gary is one of them as a nominee.\n\nBut the claim says \"one of 4 nominees for a tony award,\" implying four people nominated in the same category. So, if the table shows only Gary as a nominee in his category, we can't confirm there were three others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four refers to four categories with nominations, and Gary is one in one of those. But that would be misinterpreting the claim.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether \"4 nominees\" refer to four people in one category or four categories each having a nominee. The table shows four Tony Award entries, but in each, it's a different category.\n\nSo, the correct way is: The claim says Gary was one of four nominees for a single Tony Award (category). But the table only lists Gary as nominated and doesn't list others in his category. Therefore, we can't confirm that there were three other nominees; thus, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n\nWait, but looking again: The row where Gary is listed is \"best performance by a leading actor in a musical\" with result \"nominated.\" That means he was nominated for that specific award. If the table only shows him as the nominee, it's possible that others were also nominated but not listed here. So, without knowing how many others were nominated, we can't verify if there were exactly three more, making four total.\n\nThus, the claim is that Gary was one of four nominees. Since the table doesn't list all nominees in his category, just his nomination, we don't know for sure. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE because we can't confirm from the given data that he was one of four.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that Gary Beach was nominated for a Tony Award in the category of Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. However, it doesn't specify how many total nominees were there in that category. Since the claim specifies \"1 of 4 nominees,\" and we don't have enough information to confirm exactly four nominees, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

There are seven rows of data for the year 2005 across different awards.\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Mitchell won two Tony Awards. So, I need to check how many times his name appears in the \"nominee\" column under the \"tony award\" in the \"award\" column and whether the result was a win each time.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: It's about a Tony Award for best revival of a musical. The nominee is listed as \"best revival of a musical,\" which seems to be a category, not a person. So this doesn't apply to Jerry Mitchell.\n\nRow 1: Another Tony Award for best performance by a leading actor in a musical. The nominee is Gary Beach, so that's not Jerry either.\n\nRow 2: Here, it's a Tony Award for best choreography with Jerry Mitchell as the nominee and result \"won.\" So that's one win for Jerry from the Tony Awards.\n\nRow 3: This is a Tony Award for best costume design, nominated by William Ivey Long. Not Jerry.\n\nThen we have Drama Desk Awards:\n\nRow 4: Outstanding revival of a musical, same category as before, but again not a person.\n\nRow 5: Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography, Jerry Mitchell won here too. So that's another win, but this time it's a Drama Desk Award, not a Tony.\n\nRow 6: Another Drama Desk award, but the nominee is William Ivey Long again.\n\nSo in total, looking specifically at Tony Awards:\n\nOnly Row 2 shows Jerry Mitchell winning a Tony Award for best choreography. The other award he won was from the Drama Desk, which isn't counted here because we're only considering Tony Awards for this claim.\n\nTherefore, Jerry Mitchell won only one Tony Award according to the table, not two.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"jerry mitchell be nominate for a drama desk award 3 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the problem carefully. The table has columns: year, award, category, nominee, result. All entries are from 2005.\n\nThe claim mentions Jerry Mitchell being nominated three times for a Drama Desk Award. So I need to check how many times he was nominated in that award category.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. First row: Tony Award, Best Revival of a Musical. Nominee is \"best revival...\" which seems like it's the category itself, not a person. Not relevant here.\n2. Second row: Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor. Gary Beach was nominated. Not Jerry Mitchell.\n3. Third row: Tony Award for Best Choreography. Jerry Mitchell won this one. But the award is a Tony, not Drama Desk.\n4. Fourth row: Tony Award for Costume Design. William Ivey Long was nominated. Not relevant.\n5. Fifth row: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical. The nominee is the category itself again, so no person here.\n6. Sixth row: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography. Jerry Mitchell won this one.\n7. Seventh row: Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design. William Ivey Long was nominated.\n\nSo, in the table, how many times was Jerry Mitchell nominated for a Drama Desk Award? Let's check:\n\n- Sixth row: He won the Drama Desk for choreography. So he was definitely nominated there.\n- Any other nominations?\n\nLooking back, is there another nomination for him under Drama Desk? The only relevant rows are 5,6,7.\n\nRow 6: Won for Outstanding Choreography (Drama Desk).\nAre there any others where he's a nominee?\n\nNo, the other Drama Desk entries either have categories as nominees or William Ivey Long. So Jerry Mitchell was nominated once for a Drama Desk Award and won it.\n\nThe claim says he was nominated three times. Since in the table he only appears once, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to collect the relevant cells:\n\n- Row 5: award = Drama Desk, category = Outstanding Revival of a Musical (but nominee is not Jerry)\n- Row 6: award = Drama Desk, nominee = Jerry Mitchell\n- Row 7: same as above but for costume design\n\nSo only row 6 and maybe rows 5 and 7 are relevant because they're all under the same award type.\n\nBut wait, let me think. The claim is about nominations. So any rows where the award is Drama Desk and nominee is Jerry Mitchell or if he was nominated in other categories but not sure.\n\nWait, looking at row 6: it's a win, so that counts as a nomination (since you can't win without being nominated). But are there other nominations?\n\nNo. Only one occurrence of Jerry Mitchell under Drama Desk. So he was only nominated once, not three times.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Jerry Mitchell was only nominated once for a Drama Desk Award.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"nominee\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I'm given a table in markdown format and a claim that I need to verify as TRUE or FALSE. The claim is: \"gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the table. It has several columns: year, award, category, nominee, and result. There are seven rows in total, each corresponding to different awards and their results for the year 2005.\n\nNow, looking at the claim, it mentions Gary Beach being one of four winners of a Tony Award. I need to check two things here: whether Gary Beach won any Tony Awards, and how many Tony Awards were given out in total in this table.\n\nLooking through the rows, let's identify which entries are for the Tony Awards. Rows 0 to 4 are Tony Awards. Row 0 is about the best revival of a musical, row 1 is Gary Beach's nomination, row 2 is Jerry Mitchell's win for best choreography, row 3 is William Ivey Long's nomination for best costume design.\n\nSo, from these rows, how many Tony Awards were won? Looking at the 'result' column:\n\n- Row 0: \"won\" \u2013 that's one.\n- Row 1: \"nominated\" \u2013 not a win.\n- Row 2: \"won\" \u2013 that's another.\n- Row 3: \"nominated\" \u2013 not a win.\n\nSo, in total, there are two Tony Awards won according to this table. Now, the claim says Gary Beach is one of four winners. But from the data, only two Tony Awards were won. \n\nWait, but looking back, maybe I missed something. Let me recount:\n\n- Row 0: Best revival \u2013 won by \"best revival...\" (category name as nominee)\n- Row 1: Gary Beach nominated\n- Row 2: Jerry Mitchell won for choreography\n- Row 3: William Ivey Long nominated\n\nSo that's two wins total, not four. Therefore, the claim that Gary Beach is one of four winners can't be true because there are only two Tony Awards listed as won in this table.\n\nAdditionally, checking if Gary Beach actually won an award. In row 1, his result was \"nominated,\" so he didn't win. That further supports the conclusion that the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states Gary Beach is one of four Tony Award winners, but the table shows only two wins (rows 0 and 2). Therefore, the answer is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
