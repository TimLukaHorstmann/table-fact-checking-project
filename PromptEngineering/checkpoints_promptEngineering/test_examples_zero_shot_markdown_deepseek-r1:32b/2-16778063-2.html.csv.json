    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"week 12 be on december 2 , 2001\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table provided in markdown format. The columns are week, date, opponent, result, and attendance. There are multiple rows with data for each week from 1 to 17, each corresponding to a specific game.\n\nThe claim is about week 12 being on December 2, 2001. To verify this, I need to check the row where week equals 12 in the table and see what date it corresponds to.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\n- The first few weeks are September and October.\n- Week 9 is November 11, 2001\n- Week 10: November 18, 2001\n- Week 11: November 25, 2001\n- Week 12: December 2, 2001\n\nSo week 12 is indeed on December 2, 2001. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFor the relevant cells, I'll need to identify which rows and columns support this conclusion. The row in question is week 12, so the specific cells are:\n\n- The \"week\" column for week 12\n- The \"date\" column for that same row\n\nLooking at the table indices (starting from 0), week 12 is in row index 11 (since week 1 is row 0, and it increments up to week 17 as row 16). Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"}\n- {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n\nThis confirms that the date for week 12 is December 2, 2001 as stated in the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that week 12 was on December 2, 2001. Checking the table, week 12 corresponds to that exact date.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "on week 12 the attendance be 64217",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"on week 12 the attendance be 64217\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the table represents. It seems to outline a series of weeks with corresponding dates, opponents, results, and attendances. Each row corresponds to a different week, from week 1 up to week 17.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"week 12\" and an attendance figure of 64217. My goal is to check if this information matches the data in the table.\n\nTo verify this, I need to locate week 12 in the table. Scanning through the rows, I can see that each row starts with a \"week\" number. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance 51521\n- Week 2: Attendance 51121\n- Week 3: Attendance 56048\n- Week 4: Attendance 62335\n- Week 5: Attendance 64217\n- Week 6: Attendance 63408\n- Week 7: Attendance 69343\n- Week 9: Attendance 57161 (Note that week 8 is missing)\n- Week 10: Attendance 63865\n- Week 11: Attendance 72918\n- Week 12: Attendance 52135\n\nWait a second, I just noticed something. The claim refers to week 12 having an attendance of 64217. However, according to the table, week 12's attendance is listed as 52135. That doesn't match. So there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't misread anything. Looking back at the table, week 5 indeed has an attendance of 64217. But that's for week 5, not week 12. Week 12 is December 2, 2001, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with a result of L 16-13 and attendance 52135.\n\nTherefore, the claim states that week 12 had an attendance of 64217, but according to the table, it's actually 52135. This means the claim is incorrect based on the provided data.\n\nNow, considering the relevant cells for this verification: I need to look at the row corresponding to week 12 and check the \"attendance\" column. Additionally, since there's a mention of attendance in another row (week 5), that could be a point of confusion but doesn't affect the claim about week 12.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n- The relevant cells are the ones in week 12 under the \"attendance\" column.\n- Comparing the claimed value (64217) with the table's value (52135), they don't match.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE. The attendance on week 12 was not 64217; it was lower than that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the opponent be at cleveland brown on week 14\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the claim and then checking the relevant parts of the table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim: it seems like it's saying that in week 14, the opponent was the Cleveland Browns. Now, I should look into the table to see what the opponent was for week 14.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different week with details about the date, opponent, result, and attendance. The weeks are listed from 1 to 17, so there's no missing week in between; it goes up to 17 without skipping any numbers except that I notice there is no week 8. However, since the claim refers to week 14, which exists in the table, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nNow, focusing on week 14: I'll scan through each row until I find the one where week equals 14. Let me go row by row:\n\n- Week 1: Opponent is New England Patriots\n- Week 2: Baltimore Ravens\n- Week 3: San Diego Chargers\n- Week 4: Pittsburgh Steelers\n- Week 5: Cleveland Browns (this is a win)\n- Week 6: Chicago Bears\n- Week 7: Detroit Lions\n- Week 9: Jacksonville Jaguars\n- Week 10: Tennessee Titans\n- Week 11: Cleveland Browns again, but this time it's a loss\n- Week 12: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n- Week 13: Jacksonville Jaguars\n- Week 14: New York Jets (and the result is a loss)\n- ... and so on.\n\nSo in week 14, the opponent was the New York Jets. The Cleveland Browns were opponents in weeks 5 and 11. Therefore, the claim that the opponent was the Cleveland Browns in week 14 is incorrect because they faced the New York Jets instead.\n\nTo verify this, I'll extract the relevant cells from the table. For week 14, the opponent column shows \"new york jets\", which contradicts the claim of it being the Cleveland Browns. Additionally, weeks 5 and 11 have \"cleveland browns\" as opponents, but those are different weeks.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the table, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
