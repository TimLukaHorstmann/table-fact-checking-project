    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"when m night shyamalan be the director, the rank be 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for rows where the director is listed as M Night Shyamalan. Scanning the 'director(s)' column, I see that in row index 6 (since counting starts at 0), the director is m night shyamalan. The corresponding rank for this row is 7. So according to the table, when M Night Shyamalan directed a movie, it ranked number 7.\n\nWait, but looking back, the claim says \"the rank be 7\" when he's the director. In the table, the rank is indeed 7 for that specific entry. So this seems correct.\n\nI should also check if there are any other entries where M Night Shyamalan is the director to ensure consistency. Scanning through all rows, I don't see his name listed anywhere else except row 6. Therefore, there's only one instance where he directed a movie in this table, and it was ranked 7th.\n\nSo based on the data provided, the claim holds true because when M Night Shyamalan was the director, the rank was indeed 7.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because M Night Shyamalan directed the movie \"Signs,\" which is ranked 7 in the table. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"rank\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"george lucas be the director for star war episode ii : attack of the clone\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the table's rows to find where the title matches the one mentioned in the claim. The claim refers to \"star wars episode ii: attack of the clones,\" so I scan the 'title' column for that exact phrase.\n\nLooking at row index 3, the title is listed as \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones.\" That's a match. Now, I need to check who the director is for this entry.\n\nIn the same row, under the 'director(s)' column, it says \"george lucas.\" The claim states that George Lucas directed this movie, which aligns with what's in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table. So, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the director entry for that specific title.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director (s)\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim is: \"star war episode ii : attack of the clone be develop by barry sonnenfeld for universal picture\".\n\nFirst, let me break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Title**: The title mentioned is \"star war episode ii : attack of the clone\". I should check if this matches any entry in the table.\n\n2. **Director**: The director is said to be barry sonnenfeld. So, I need to see who directed that movie according to the table.\n\n3. **Studio**: The claim states it's developed by universal picture. I'll check which studio is listed for that movie in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see a row where the title is \"star wars episode ii : attack of the clones\". Let me note the details from that row:\n\n- **Rank 4**\n- **Title**: star wars episode ii : attack of the clones\n- **Studio**: 20th century fox / lucasfilm\n- **Director**: george lucas\n\nSo, comparing with the claim:\n\n1. The title matches \"star war episode ii : attack of the clone\" (though the exact wording is slightly different in the table, it's essentially the same movie).\n\n2. The director according to the table is George Lucas, not Barry Sonnenfeld.\n\n3. The studio listed is 20th century fox / lucasfilm, not universal picture.\n\nTherefore, both the director and the studio parts of the claim are incorrect based on the table data.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- For the title: row_index 3 (since counting starts at 0), column_name \"title\".\n- For the director: same row, column \"director(s)\".\n- For the studio: same row, column \"studio\".\n\nSince both parts of the claim don't match the table, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states the director and studio for \"Star Wars Episode II\". According to the table, it was directed by George Lucas and produced by 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"title\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"director(s)\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"studio\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
