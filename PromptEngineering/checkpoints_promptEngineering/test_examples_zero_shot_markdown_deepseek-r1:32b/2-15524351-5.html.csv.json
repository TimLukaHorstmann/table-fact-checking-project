    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the demon deacon win 2 game and lose 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions the Demon Deacons winning two games and losing nine games. The Demon Deacons are likely referring to a sports team, probably from Wake Forest University since the location in several rows is Winston-Salem, NC, which is where Wake Forest is located.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The 'result' column shows whether it was a win (w) or loss (l), followed by the score.\n\nI need to count how many wins and losses there are in total. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Result is w 26-20 \u2192 Win\n2. Row 1: l 10-56 \u2192 Loss\n3. Row 2: l 6-45 \u2192 Loss\n4. Row 3: l 0-23 \u2192 Loss\n5. Row 4: l 13-42 \u2192 Loss\n6. Row 5: l 0-21 \u2192 Loss\n7. Row 6: l 0-31 \u2192 Loss\n8. Row 7: l 3-35 \u2192 Loss\n9. Row 8: w 9-7 \u2192 Win\n10. Row 9: l 12-15 \u2192 Loss\n11. Row 10: l 9-44 \u2192 Loss\n\nNow, let's count the wins and losses:\n\nWins:\n- Row 0: 1 win\n- Row 8: 1 win\nTotal wins = 2\n\nLosses:\nRows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10: That's 9 losses.\n\nSo according to the table, there are exactly 2 wins and 9 losses. The claim states \"win 2 game and lose 9,\" which matches perfectly with what I've counted.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with various games and their details, and the claim is about whether the lowest attendance figure in a game was 6500. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that the smallest number of people who attended any game listed in the table was exactly 6500. My job is to check if this is true or not by looking at all the attendance numbers in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different game with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The column I'm interested in is \"attendance,\" so I should focus on that.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to check the attendance figures:\n\n1. First row: 09/09/1972 vs Davidson at Groves Stadium, Winston-Salem, NC. Attendance was 17000.\n2. Second row: 09/16/1972 vs SMU at Texas Stadium, Irving, TX. Attendance was 20175.\n3. Third row: 09/23/1972 vs Tennessee at Neyland Stadium, Knoxville, TN. Attendance was 66266.\n4. Fourth row: 10/07/1972 vs Maryland at Byrd Stadium, College Park, MD. Attendance was 15000.\n5. Fifth row: 10/14/1972 vs North Carolina State at Groves Stadium again. Attendance here is 25000.\n6. Sixth row: 10/21/1972 vs North Carolina, same location as some others. Attendance was 27000.\n7. Seventh row: 10/28/1972 vs Clemson at Groves Stadium. Attendance is 16000.\n8. Eighth row: 11/04/1972 vs South Carolina at Williams-Brice Stadium, Columbia, SC. Attendance was 38689.\n9. Ninth row: 11/11/1972 vs Duke at Wallace Wade Stadium, Durham, NC. Attendance is 18025.\n10. Tenth row: 11/18/1972 vs Virginia again at Groves Stadium. Attendance was 18000.\n11. Eleventh row: 11/25/1972 vs Virginia Tech, same location as others. Here's the attendance figure of 6500.\n\nSo, looking through all these numbers, I can see that most attendances are in the tens of thousands, with some higher like 38689 and 66266. The smallest number I notice is 6500, which appears only once in the last row. \n\nNow, to confirm if this is indeed the lowest, I need to ensure that no other game had an attendance lower than 6500. Scanning through again: all the attendances are higher except for that one instance of 6500. So yes, it seems like 6500 was the smallest attendance figure recorded in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the lowest attendance was indeed 6500, and it's supported by the data in the last row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the lowest attendance was 6500. By examining each row, we find that the smallest number listed under \"attendance\" is 6500, occurring only once.\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the deacon be shutout 3 times during the season.\" First, I need to understand what this means. A \"shutout\" in sports usually refers to a game where one team scores zero points, so being shut out would mean their score was zero.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a result column that shows the outcome of each game. The results are listed as either 'W' for win or 'L' for loss, followed by the scores. So I need to check how many times the Deacons (the team in question) had their score as zero.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Result is W 26-20. The team scored 26 points, so no shutout here.\n2. **Row 1**: L 10-56. They scored 10 points; not a shutout.\n3. **Row 2**: L 6-45. Scored 6 points; still not zero.\n4. **Row 3**: L 0-23. Here, the team's score is 0. This is one shutout.\n5. **Row 4**: L 13-42. They scored 13 points; no shutout.\n6. **Row 5**: L 0-21. Another shutout here. That's two.\n7. **Row 6**: L 0-31. Third shutout. Now, three in total.\n8. **Row 7**: L 3-35. They scored 3 points; not a shutout.\n9. **Row 8**: W 9-7. Scored 9 points; no issue here.\n10. **Row 9**: L 12-15. Scored 12 points; not zero.\n11. **Row 10**: L 9-44. They scored 9; again, not a shutout.\n\nSo in total, I found three instances where the team's score was zero: rows 3, 5, and 6. That matches the claim exactly\u2014three times being shut out during the season.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as there are three games where the Deacons scored zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that 7 games were played in North Carolina. So, my task is to check how many games in the table have their location listed as somewhere in North Carolina.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The key column here is \"location.\" I need to go through each row's location and see if it falls within North Carolina.\n\nLet me list out the locations from each row:\n\n1. Row 0: groves stadium winston-salem, nc\n2. Row 1: texas stadium irving, tx\n3. Row 2: neyland stadium knoxville, tn\n4. Row 3: byrd stadium college park, md\n5. Row 4: groves stadium winston-salem, nc\n6. Row 5: groves stadium winston-salem, nc\n7. Row 6: groves stadium winston-salem, nc\n8. Row 7: williams-brice stadium columbia, sc\n9. Row 8: wallace wade stadium durham, nc\n10. Row 9: groves stadium winston-salem, nc\n11. Row 10: groves stadium winston-salem, nc\n\nNow, I'll go through each location to check if they're in North Carolina (abbreviated as 'nc' or the full name). \n\n- Row 0: winston-salem is in NC. So this counts.\n- Row 1: irving, tx \u2192 Texas. Doesn't count.\n- Row 2: knoxville, tn \u2192 Tennessee. Doesn't count.\n- Row 3: college park, md \u2192 Maryland. No.\n- Row 4: winston-salem again. Counts.\n- Row 5: Same as row 4. Counts.\n- Row 6: Again, same location. Counts.\n- Row 7: columbia, sc \u2192 South Carolina. Doesn't count.\n- Row 8: durham is in NC. So counts.\n- Row 9: winston-salem again. Counts.\n- Row 10: Same as above. Counts.\n\nNow let's tally the ones in North Carolina:\n\nRows: 0,4,5,6,8,9,10 \u2192 That's a total of 7 games played in North Carolina.\n\nWait, hold on.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the most point score by a team in 1 game be 56\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. The rows show different games played, each with specific details. My focus should be on the \"result\" column since that's where the points scored would be mentioned.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n1. Row 0 (September 9): Result is W 26-20. So Davidson scored 20.\n2. Row 1 (September 16): Result is L 10-56. SMU scored 56 here; that's a high number.\n3. Row 2 (September 23): L 6-45, Tennessee scored 45.\n4. Row 3 (October 7): L 0-23, Maryland scored 23.\n5. Row 4 (October 14): L 13-42, NC State scored 42.\n6. Row 5 (October 21): L 0-21, UNC scored 21.\n7. Row 6 (October 28): L 0-31, Clemson scored 31.\n8. Row 7 (November 4): L 3-35, SC scored 35.\n9. Row 8 (November 11): W 9-7, Duke scored 7.\n10. Row 9 (November 18): L 12-15, Virginia scored 15.\n11. Row 10 (November 25): L 9-44, Virginia Tech scored 44.\n\nThe claim is about the highest points scored in a single game being 56. From the above, SMU scored 56 on September 16th against this team. That seems to be the highest since other high scores are 45, 42, 35, etc., but none higher than 56.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because in row 1, under the result column, SMU scored 56 points. That's the maximum from all the results listed.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that on September 16, 1972, SMU scored 56 points, which is the highest score in any single game as per the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure and identify which columns are relevant. The table has columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. Since the claim is about attendance numbers, I should focus on that column specifically.\n\nNext, I need to extract all the attendance values from each row. Let's list them out:\n\n1. 17000\n2. 20175\n3. 66266\n4. 15000\n5. 25000\n6. 27000\n7. 16000\n8. 38689\n9. 18025\n10. 18000\n11. 6500\n\nWait, let me make sure I got these right by checking each row:\n\n- Row 0: 17000\n- Row 1: 20175\n- Row 2: 66266\n- Row 3: 15000\n- Row 4: 25000\n- Row 5: 27000\n- Row 6: 16000\n- Row 7: 38689\n- Row 8: 18025\n- Row 9: 18000\n- Row 10: 6500\n\nYes, that's correct. Now, I need to sort these attendance numbers from lowest to highest to determine the ranking.\n\nLet me list them in ascending order:\n\n6500 (Row 10), 15000 (Row 3), 16000 (Row 6), 17000 (Row 0), 18000 (Row 9), 18025 (Row 8), 20175 (Row 1), 25000 (Row 4), 27000 (Row 5), 38689 (Row 7), 66266 (Row 2).\n\nWait, let me double-check the sorting:\n\n- The smallest is 6500\n- Then 15000\n- Next, 16000 comes before 17000? Wait no: 15k, then 16k, then 17k. Yes.\n\nSo the sorted list is:\n\n6500 (Row 10)\n15000 (Row 3)\n16000 (Row 6)\n17000 (Row 0)\n18000 (Row 9)\n18025 (Row 8)\n20175 (Row 1)\n25000 (Row 4)\n27000 (Row 5)\n38689 (Row 7)\n66266 (Row 2)\n\nNow, the claim is that \"the game with an attendance of 6500 be the fourth lowest attendance.\" Let me see where 6500 stands.\n\nLooking at the sorted list:\n\n1st: 6500\n2nd: 15000\n3rd: 16000\n4th: 17000\n\nWait, that can't be right because 6500 is the first. So the fourth lowest would actually be 17000, not 6500.\n\nSo according to this, the attendance of 6500 is the lowest (1st), then 15k (2nd), 16k (3rd), and 17k (4th). Therefore, the game with 6500 is actually the first lowest, not the fourth. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. Let me read it again: \"the game with an attendance of 6500 be the fourth lowest attendance.\" So the claim is that 6500 is the fourth lowest, but according to my sorting, it's actually the first.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me count again:\n\n1st: 6500\n2nd: 15000\n3rd: 16000\n4th: 17000\n\nSo yes, 6500 is the first lowest, so it cannot be fourth. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscounted. Let me list them in order:\n\nPositions (from lowest to highest):\n\n1. 6500\n2. 15000\n3. 16000\n4. 17000\n5. 18000\n6. 18025\n7. 20175\n8. 25000\n9. 27000\n10. 38689\n11. 66266\n\nSo yes, 6500 is first, so the fourth lowest is 17000.\n\nTherefore, the game with 6500 attendance is the first lowest, not the fourth. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the game with an attendance of 6,500 was the fourth lowest. However, upon sorting all attendances from lowest to highest, it's clear that 6,500 is actually the lowest (first position). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is false; the attendance of 6,500 was the first lowest, not the fourth.",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table with some football game results and a claim that says \"the demon deacon win as many games as they lose.\" My job is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It's saying that the Demon Deacons (which I think is a team's nickname) won the same number of games as they lost during these matches. So, I need to count how many wins and losses there are in the results column.\n\nLooking at the table, each row has a \"result\" column where W stands for a win and L stands for a loss. Let me go through each row:\n\n1. The first game is against Davidson on 09/09/1972, result is W (win). So that's one win.\n2. Next, against SMU on 09/16/1972, the result is L (loss). That's one loss.\n3. Then, against Tennessee on 09/23/1972, another L. Now two losses.\n4. Against Maryland on 10/07/1972, L again. Three losses now.\n5. North Carolina State on 10/14/1972, result is L. Four losses.\n6. North Carolina on 10/21/1972, L. Five losses.\n7. Clemson on 10/28/1972, L. Six losses.\n8. South Carolina on 11/04/1972, another L. Seven losses.\n9. Duke on 11/11/1972, result is W. So that's the second win.\n10. Virginia on 11/18/1972, L. Eight losses.\n11. Finally, against Virginia Tech on 11/25/1972, L. Nine losses.\n\nSo in total, the Demon Deacons have two wins and nine losses from this table. The claim says they won as many games as they lost, which would mean equal numbers of wins and losses. But here, it's clearly not equal\u2014there are more losses than wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because they didn't win as many games as they lost; in fact, they lost significantly more games.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells that support this conclusion. I looked at each row's \"result\" column to count the Ws and Ls. So every cell under the \"result\" column is relevant because each contributes to the total number of wins and losses.\n</think>\n\nThe Demon Deacons have 2 wins and 9 losses, which means they did not win as many games as they lost.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the deacon be shutout 3 time , but never by more than 10 point",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"the deacon be shutout 3 times, but never by more than 10 points.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. A \"shutout\" in sports typically refers to a team scoring zero points in a game. So, the first part of the claim is saying that the Deacons (which I assume is the team represented in the table) were shut out three times. The second part says that these shutouts never happened by more than 10 points, meaning in each of those games, the opposing team didn't score more than 10 points against them.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that there are multiple rows with results indicating wins (w) and losses (l). Each row has a result column showing the score. The Deacons' scores are on the left side of the hyphen in each result. So, if it's \"l 0 - 23\", that means the Deacons lost with 0 points, and the opponent scored 23.\n\nI'll go through each row to check for shutouts:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Result is w 26-20. The Deacons won with 26 points. Not a shutout.\n2. **Row 1**: Result is l 10-56. The Deacons scored 10, so not a shutout.\n3. **Row 2**: Result is l 6-45. Again, the Deacons scored 6 points. Not a shutout.\n4. **Row 3**: Result is l 0-23. Here, the Deacons were shut out (0 points). The opponent scored 23. This is one shutout, but the opponent scored more than 10 points.\n5. **Row 4**: Result is l 13-42. The Deacons scored 13, so not a shutout.\n6. **Row 5**: Result is l 0-21. Another shutout for the Deacons. Opponent scored 21, which is more than 10 points.\n7. **Row 6**: Result is l 0-31. Third shutout with opponent scoring 31. Again, over 10 points.\n8. **Row 7**: Result is l 3-35. Deacons scored 3, so not a shutout.\n9. **Row 8**: Result is w 9-7. They won and didn't get shut out.\n10. **Row 9**: Result is l 12-15. Not a shutout as they scored 12.\n11. **Row 10**: Result is l 9-44. Deacons scored 9, so not a shutout.\n\nSo, from this analysis:\n\n- The Deacons were shut out in rows 3, 5, and 6, totaling three times.\n- However, each of these shutouts resulted in the opponent scoring 23, 21, and 31 points respectively. All these are more than 10 points.\n\nThe claim says they were shutout three times but never by more than 10 points. Since all three instances had opponents scoring over 10, this part of the claim is false. Therefore, the entire statement is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine whether the claim \"7 games be play in north caroline , and they be all at the same stadium\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the table correctly. The table has five columns: date, opponent, location, result, and attendance. Each row represents a game with details about that game.\n\nThe claim mentions two main points:\n1. Seven games were played in North Carolina.\n2. All these seven games were at the same stadium.\n\nI'll start by checking each row to see if the location is within North Carolina. Looking through the table, I notice several entries for \"groves stadium winston - salem , nc\" and one for \"wallace wade stadium durham , nc\". \n\nLet me list out the rows where the location includes \"north caroline\":\n\n- Row 0: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- Row 4: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- Row 5: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- Row 6: groves stadium winston - salem , nc\n- Row 9: wallace wade stadium durham , nc\n\nWait, that's five games in North Carolina. The claim says seven, so I'm only finding five.\n\nNext, checking if all these games are at the same stadium. Four of them (rows 0,4,5,6) are at Groves Stadium, while row 9 is at Wallace Wade Stadium in Durham. So they're not all at the same stadium; there's more than one location within North Carolina.\n\nTherefore, the claim that seven games were played in North Carolina and all at the same stadium isn't supported by the data. There are only five games in NC, and two different stadiums.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows five games in North Carolina across two stadiums, not seven in the same stadium. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the highest number of point anyone score be below 50",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the highest number of points anyone score be below 50\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at what the claim is saying. It seems a bit unclear because it mentions both \"points\" and \"score,\" which might refer to different things. However, in the context of sports games, especially American football as indicated by the opponent names and scores, points likely refer to the total points each team scored.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column named \"result.\" Each entry under this column shows two numbers separated by a dash. For example, the first row has \"w 26 - 20.\" I think these represent the points scored by our team and the opponent, respectively. The 'w' stands for win, and 'l' stands for loss.\n\nSo, to check the claim, I need to examine each game's result to find the highest number of points either team scored in any single game. If the highest is below 50, then the claim is TRUE; otherwise, it's FALSE.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0 (September 9, 1972):** Result is \"w 26 - 20.\" Our team scored 26, opponent scored 20. Both below 50.\n2. **Row 1 (September 16, 1972):** Result is \"l 10 - 56.\" We scored 10, opponent 56. Opponent's 56 is above 50. This might make the claim FALSE.\n3. **Row 2 (September 23, 1972):** \"l 6 - 45.\" Our team: 6, Opponent: 45. Both below 50 except opponent's 45 is close but still under 50.\n4. **Row 3 (October 7, 1972):** \"l 0 - 23.\" Low scores, both under 50.\n5. **Row 4 (October 14, 1972):** \"l 13 - 42.\" Opponent scored 42, still below 50.\n6. **Row 5 (October 21, 1972):** \"l 0 - 21.\" Both under 50.\n7. **Row 6 (October 28, 1972):** \"l 0 - 31.\" Opponent's score is 31, below 50.\n8. **Row 7 (November 4, 1972):** \"l 3 - 35.\" Opponent scored 35, still under 50.\n9. **Row 8 (November 11, 1972):** \"w 9 - 7.\" Both teams scored below 50.\n10. **Row 9 (November 18, 1972):** \"l 12 - 15.\" Both under 50.\n11. **Row 10 (November 25, 1972):** \"l 9 - 44.\" Opponent's score is 44, below 50.\n\nWait a second, in Row 1, the opponent scored 56 points. That's above 50. So, if the claim is that no one scored 50 or more points, then this would make it FALSE because an opponent did score 56. However, I should clarify what exactly is being claimed.\n\nThe claim says \"the highest number of point anyone score be below 50.\" The wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that the maximum points any single team scored in all games was below 50. Since Row 1 shows an opponent scoring 56, which is above 50, the highest would indeed exceed 50.\n\nAlternatively, if it's interpreted as whether each individual game's total points were below 50 (i.e., combined score), but looking at that, in some games like Row 2: 6+45=51, which also exceeds 50. However, the claim doesn't specify if it's per team or combined.\n\nBut given the context and typical sports claims, I think it refers to any single team's score in a game. So since one opponent scored 56, which is above 50, the highest isn't below 50, making the claim FALSE.\n\nSo, relevant cells are all \"result\" columns where scores exceed or need checking against 50. The critical cell is Row 1, where an opponent scored 56.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
