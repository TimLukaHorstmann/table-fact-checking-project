    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"february 21 have a score of 5 - 4\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand where each piece of information is located. The columns are: game, february, opponent, score, record, and points. Each row represents a specific game with details about when it was played, who they played against, the score, their record after that game, and the points accumulated.\n\nThe claim mentions February 21 and a score of 5-4. So I need to find any rows where the 'february' column has the value 21 and check if the corresponding 'score' in that row is indeed 5-4.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow indices start from 0, so let's go through each row one by one until we find the relevant date.\n\n- Row 0: february 2\n- Row 1: february 4\n- Row 2: february 5\n- Row 3: february 10\n- Row 4: february 12\n- Row 5: february 14\n- Row 6: february 16\n- Row 7: february 17\n- Row 8: february 19\n- Row 9: february 21\n\nWait, row 9 has 'february' as 21. Let's check the score for that row. The score is listed as \"5 - 4\". That matches exactly with the claim.\n\nSo, the claim states that on February 21, the score was 5-4. From the table, in row index 9 (which is the 10th row if counting from 1), under 'february' it's 21 and the 'score' is 5-4.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"february\"},{\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"score\"}]}",

The columns are: game, february, opponent, score, record, points.\n\nLooking for February 24, I'll scan through the 'february' column. Let's see:\n\n- Row indices go from 0 to 13 since there are 14 rows (games 54 to 67). \n\nChecking each row:\n- Row 0: feb 2\n- Row 1: feb 4\n- Row 2: feb 5\n- Row 3: feb 10\n- Row 4: feb 12\n- Row 5: feb 14\n- Row 6: feb 16\n- Row 7: feb 17\n- Row 8: feb 19\n- Row 9: feb 21\n- Row 10: feb 24 \u2192 This is the one I'm looking for.\n\nNow, looking at row index 10 (game number 64), let's check the score. The 'score' column shows \"3 - 1\". \n\nThe claim says the score was 5-4 on February 24. However, according to the table, it was 3-1. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nRelevant cells are the 'february' and 'score' columns for row index 10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"february\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
