It states that Bobby Hull has scored the highest number of playoff goals among all Chicago Blackhawk players listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different player with columns for their years active and statistics for regular season and playoffs. The relevant column here is \"playoffs\" since it shows the number of playoff goals each player has.\n\nI'll go through each player's playoff numbers:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"bill mosienko have score the fewest number of postseason goal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that Bill Mosienko scored the fewest postseason goals among all the players listed in the table. \n\nLooking at the table, I see there are several columns: name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The relevant column for this claim would be \"playoffs\" since that's where postseason goals are likely recorded.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the playoff numbers:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 62\n2. Stan Mikita: 59\n3. Steve Larmer: 45\n4. Denis Savard: 61\n5. Dennis Hull: 33\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 35\n7. Tony Amonte: 13\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n9. Bill Mosienko: 10\n10. Ken Wharram: 16\n\nNow, I need to identify the smallest number in the \"playoffs\" column. Scanning through the numbers, I see that Tony Amonte has 13 and Bill Mosienko has 10. Comparing these two, 10 is smaller than 13.\n\nWait a minute, but the claim says Bill Mosienko scored the fewest. However, looking again, Tony Amonte's number is actually lower (13 vs. 10). This means that Bill Mosienko did not have the fewest; instead, he has fewer than some but more than Tony Amonte.\n\nWait no, 10 is less than 13, so Bill Mosienko does have a lower number. Let me double-check:\n\nTony Amonte: 13\nBill Mosienko: 10\n\nSo yes, Bill Mosienko's 10 is indeed the smallest in the \"playoffs\" column.\n\nWait, but looking again at all playoff numbers, I see that Bill Mosienko has 10, which is lower than Tony Amonte's 13. So actually, he does have the fewest.\n\nWait no, hold on\u2014Tony Amonte: playoffs = 13; Bill Mosienko: 10. Yes, so Bill Mosienko has fewer playoff goals (10) compared to Tony Amonte's 13. Therefore, among all players listed, Bill Mosienko has the fewest postseason goals.\n\nWait, but I should check if any other player has even fewer. Let me look again:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 62\n- Stan Mikita: 59\n- Steve Larmer: 45\n- Denis Savard: 61\n- Dennis Hull: 33\n- Jeremy Roenick: 35\n- Tony Amonte: 13\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 26\n- Bill Mosienko: 10\n- Ken Wharram: 16\n\nThe smallest number here is 10, which is Bill Mosienko's playoff goals. Therefore, the claim that he scored the fewest is TRUE.\n\nWait a second\u2014no, wait another thing. The table shows Tony Amonte with 13 and Bill Mosienko with 10, so yes, Bill has fewer. So the claim is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bill Mosienko scored the fewest postseason goals.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 398 goal separate the highest scorer from the lowest scorer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim means. It says that there are 398 goals separating the highest scorer and the lowest scorer in the table. So, essentially, we're looking for the difference between the player with the most total goals and the player with the least total goals.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a player with their respective statistics. The columns include name, years, regular season, playoffs, and total. The \"total\" column is where the overall number of goals would be found, so that's the key column to focus on.\n\nNow, I need to identify which players have the highest and lowest totals. Scanning through the \"total\" numbers:\n\n- Bobby Hull: 666\n- Stan Mikita: 600\n- Steve Larmer: 451\n- Denis Savard: 438\n- Dennis Hull: 331\n- Jeremy Roenick: 302\n- Tony Amonte: 281\n- Hubert Pit Martin: 269\n- Bill Mosienko: 268\n- Ken Wharram: 268\n\nFrom this, the highest total is 666 (Bobby Hull), and the lowest totals are both 268, shared by Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram.\n\nNext, I calculate the difference between these two extremes. Subtracting 268 from 666 gives:\n\n666 - 268 = 398\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 398 goals. This matches exactly with the claim made. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nTo ensure that I haven't missed anything, I'll double-check the numbers and calculations:\n\n- Highest scorer: Bobby Hull with 666 total goals.\n- Lowest scorers: Both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram have 268 each.\n- Difference calculation: 666 - 268 = 398.\n\nEverything checks out. The claim accurately states that there is a separation of 398 goals between the highest and lowest scorers in this table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies that the difference between the highest scorer (Bobby Hull with 666 goals) and the lowest scorer(s) (Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram with 268 each) is 398 goals.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table lists players with their years active and goals scored in regular season, playoffs, and total.\n\nThe claim says: \"In the regular season, only 4 players have scored more than 300 goals.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each player's 'regular season' column to check if they've scored over 300.\n\n1. Bobby Hull has 604 goals. That's way over 300.\n2. Stan Mikita has 541 goals. Also over 300.\n3. Steve Larmer: 406 goals. Definitely above 300.\n4. Denis Savard: 377 goals.

I'm given a table with several players and their statistics across different columns: name, years, regular season goals, playoffs goals, and total goals. The claim is that \"bill mosienko and ken wharram have both scored the same total number of goals.\" \n\nFirst, I need to verify this claim by checking the relevant data in the table. Let's start by identifying where Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram are listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Bill Mosienko**: Scanning down the \"name\" column, I see his name appears near the bottom. The row index for him seems to be 8 (assuming indexing starts at 0). His total goals are under the \"total\" column, which is 268.\n\n2. **Ken Wharram**: Continuing my search, I find Ken Wharram just below Bill Mosienko, so his row index would be 9. Checking his \"total\" column as well, it also shows 268 goals.\n\nNow that I've located both players and their total goal counts, the next step is to compare these numbers. Both have a total of 268 goals each. Therefore, the claim that they scored the same number of goals holds true based on the data provided.\n\nTo ensure I'm thorough, I'll double-check the columns and rows:\n\n- **Bill Mosienko**: Row index 8, \"total\" column.\n- **Ken Wharram**: Row index 9, \"total\" column.\n\nBoth entries in their respective \"total\" columns are indeed 268.

To verify this, I'll look at each player's playoff goals and compare them to Bobby Hull's.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column for this comparison is \"playoffs.\" Each row represents a different player with their respective playoff goal counts.\n\nLet me list out each player and their playoff goals:\n\n1.

So the claim that \"all players have scored less than 300\" is clearly not true because Bobby Hull and others are above that threshold.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells to check are the \"regular season\" column for each player's row. Each of these rows needs to be examined to confirm whether their goals meet or exceed 300.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"regular season\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"no two players have scored the same total number of goals\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what the table contains.\n\nLooking at the table, it lists several hockey players with their respective years active, regular season goals, playoff goals, and total goals. The key column here is \"total,\" which sums up all their goals across both regular seasons and playoffs.\n\nThe claim states that no two players share the same total number of goals. So, my task is to check each player's total goal count and see if there are any duplicates.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Bobby Hull: 604 + 62 = 666\n2. Stan Mikita: 541 + 59 = 600\n3. Steve Larmer: 406 + 45 = 451\n4. Denis Savard: 377 + 61 = 438\n5. Dennis Hull: 298 + 33 = 331\n6. Jeremy Roenick: 267 + 35 = 302\n7. Tony Amonte: 268 + 13 = 281\n8. Hubert Pit Martin: 243 + 26 = 269\n9. Bill Mosienko: 258 + 10 = 268\n10. Ken Wharram: 252 + 16 = 268\n\nWait, I see that both Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram have a total of 268 goals each. That means two players share the same total number of goals.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because there are at least two players with the same total goal count.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Bill Mosienko and Ken Wharram both have a total of 268 goals.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Column:** The \"total\" column is relevant as it contains each player's combined regular season and playoff goals.\n2. **Check for Duplicates:** Examine the \"total\" values to see if any are identical.\n3. **Find Matches:** Bill Mosienko (row 8) and Ken Wharram (row 9) both have a total of 268, indicating duplication.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
