Let's break down the claim and check each condition against the data.\n\nThe claim states: \"in the 2002-2003 season there be 6 cash, a match play smaller than 13 and 7 event.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the relevant row in the table for the 2002-03 season. Looking at the table, the first row corresponds to that season (row index 0).\n\nNext, let's check each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Cash**: The claim says there are 6 cashes. Looking at the \"cashes\" column in the 2002-03 row, it shows 6. That matches.\n\n2. **Match play smaller than 13**: The claim mentions match play should be less than 13. In the table, the \"match play\" for 2002-03 is 2. Since 2 is indeed less than 13, this condition holds.\n\n3. **7 events**: The claim states there are 7 events. Checking the \"events\" column in that row, it's listed as 7. That's correct.\n\nAll conditions in the claim are satisfied based on the data from the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"match play\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"events\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"6 cash have earnings of 39380\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It seems to be saying that for a certain row in the table, where the value under the 'cashes' column is 6, the corresponding 'earnings' value is 39380.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n| season     |   events  |   cashes  |   match play  |   tv finals  |   pba titles  |   average  |   earnings  |\n|:----------|---------:|---------:|-------------:|------------:|-------------:|----------:|-----------:|\n| 2002 - 03  |        7  |        6  |            2  |           0  |            0  |    210.88  |       9500  |\n| ... (other rows) |\n\nI'll go through each row to find where 'cashes' equals 6.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: season 2002-03, cashes = 6. The earnings here are 9500.\n- Next rows have cashes values of 15, 19, 22, etc., none equal to 6 except row 0.\n\nSo the only row with 'cashes' as 6 is row 0 (index starts at 0), and in that row, the earnings are 9500, not 39380.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it states that when cashes=6, earnings=39380, but according to the table, when cashes=6, earnings are actually 9500.\n\nSo, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells for verification are the 'cashes' and 'earnings' columns in row 0.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that with 6 cashes, the earnings are 39380. Checking the table, only row 0 has 6 cashes, but its earnings are 9500. Hence, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"cashes\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"earnings\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
