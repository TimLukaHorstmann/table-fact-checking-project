    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"on sunday, september 30, the chicago bear beat the green bay packer 31-20\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. The date is Sunday, September 30.\n2. The winner is Chicago Bears.\n3. They beat Green Bay Packers with a score of 31-20.\n\nNow, I'll look through each row in the table to see if this information matches any entry.\n\nLooking at the years from 1950 onwards:\n\n- **Row 2**: Year 1951, date Sunday, September 30. The winner is Chicago Bears with a result of 31-20 against Green Bay Packers. The location is Green Bay.\n\nThis exactly matches all parts of the claim: the correct date, the correct teams, and the exact score. There's no conflicting information in other rows for this specific date because each row has unique dates within their respective years.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim states: \"the chicago bear be the loser against the green bay packer more than 10 times.\" So, I need to check how many times Chicago Bears lost to Green Bay Packers in these games.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each row of the table and count the instances where 'loser' is 'chicago bears' and the 'winner' is 'green bay packers'.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nRow 0: Winner is Green Bay, Loser is Chicago. That's one loss.\nRow 1: Winner is Chicago, so no.\nRow 2: Winner is Chicago again, so no.\nRow 3: Winner is Chicago, same as above.\nRow 4: Winner is Chicago, still not a loss for them.\nRow 5: Winner is Green Bay, Loser is Chicago. Second loss.\nRow 6: Winner is Chicago, so no.\nRow 7: It's a tie (21-21), so neither is a loser here.\nRow 8: Winner is Chicago, not relevant.\nRow 9: Winner is Chicago again.\nRow 10: Winner is Green Bay, Loser is Chicago. Third loss.\nRow 11: Winner is Chicago, nope.\nRow 12: Winner is Chicago, same as before.\nRow 13: Winner is Chicago, so not a loss.\nRow 14: Winner is Green Bay, Loser is Chicago. Fourth loss.\nRow 15: Winner is Chicago, no.\nRow 16: Winner is Chicago again.\nRow 17: Winner is Chicago, so no.\nRow 18: Winner is Chicago, same as before.\nRow 19: Winner is Chicago.\n\nWait, that's only four losses. Hmm, maybe I missed some rows. Let me recount more carefully:\n\nLooking at the 'winner' and 'loser' columns for each row where the loser is Chicago Bears and winner is Green Bay Packers.\n\nRow 0: Yes (1)\nRow 5: Yes (2)\nRow 10: Yes (3)\nRow 14: Yes (4)\n\nWait, that's four times. But I thought there might be more. Let me check each row again:\n\nLooking at the 'winner' column for Green Bay Packers and 'loser' as Chicago Bears.\n\nRow 0: G.B. wins over C.\nRow 5: G.B. wins over C.\nRow 10: G.B. wins over C.\nRow 14: G.B. wins over C.\n\nAre there any more? Let me check all rows:\n\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: No (C wins)\nRow 2: No (C wins)\nRow 3: No (C wins)\nRow 4: No (C wins)\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 6: No (C wins)\nRow 7: Tie, no loss for C.\nRow 8: No (C wins)\nRow 9: No (C wins)\nRow 10: Yes\nRow 11: No (C wins)\nRow 12: No (C wins)\nRow 13: No (C wins)\nRow 14: Yes\nRow 15: No (C wins)\nRow 16: No (C wins)\nRow 17: No (C wins)\nRow 18: No (C wins)\nRow 19: No (C wins)\n\nSo, only four instances where Chicago Bears lost to Green Bay Packers. That's less than 10 times. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI need to collect all the relevant cells that show these losses. Each of those rows (0,5,10,14) have both 'winner' as G.B. and 'loser' as C., so I'll list their row indices and column names ('winner' and 'loser').\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 0: winner\n- Row 0: loser\n- Row 5: winner\n- Row 5: loser\n- Row 10: winner\n- Row 10: loser\n- Row 14: winner\n- Row 14: loser\n\nWait, but in the instructions, it says to list each cell as an object with row_index and column_name. So for each of these four rows, we have two columns each (winner and loser). So that's eight cells in total.\n\nBut I need to make sure if the user is asking only about Chicago being the loser against Green Bay. So any time Chicago is the loser and Green Bay is the winner counts as one occurrence. So for each row where both conditions are met, we add two relevant cells: 'winner' and 'loser'.\n\nThus, the relevant_cells list will include eight entries.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chicago Bears lost to Green Bay Packers more than 10 times. Upon reviewing the table, there are only four instances where this occurred. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"loser\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"winner\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"loser\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
