This part checks out.\n\n3. **Yani Tseng as Champion in 2011:**\n   - Find the 2011 row.\n   - The \"champion\" column should show Yani Tseng again if she won that year too.\n   - The table for 2011 indeed has Yani Tseng as the champion. So this is also correct.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table. Therefore, the answer is TRUE. The relevant cells include the runner(s)-up and champion entries for the specified years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that \"yani tseng be the runner up in 2008 and become the champion in 2010 and 2011\" is verified by checking the respective rows and columns in the table.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"se ri pak be the champion in 2001, then come 2nd place 2 year after\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll check the relevant rows for the years mentioned. The claim mentions two events: being a champion in 2001 and coming second (runner-up) two years later, which would be 2003.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Year 2001**: The row with year 2001 shows that se ri pak was indeed the champion. So the first part of the claim is supported.\n   \n   - Champion: se ri pak\n   - Year: 2001\n\n2. **Two years after 2001 is 2003**: Checking the row for 2003, I see that Annika S\u00f6renstam was the champion, and the runner-up was se ri pak.\n\n   - Champion: Annika S\u00f6renstam\n   - Runner(s)-up: se ri pak\n\nSo, se ri pak came in second place in 2003, which is exactly two years after winning in 2001. Both parts of the claim are accurately represented in the table.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Verify 2001 Champion**: Check the row for year 2001. The champion is listed as se ri pak, confirming the first part of the claim.\n\n   - Row Index: 13\n   - Column: \"champion\"\n\n2. **Determine 2003 Runner-Up**: Look at the data for two years after 2001, which is 2003. The runner-up in that year is se ri pak, supporting the second part of the claim.\n\n   - Row Index: 11\n   - Column: \"runner(s) - up\"\n\n**Conclusion:** Both conditions stated in the claim are accurately reflected in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runner(s) - up\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what I need to do here. The task is to determine whether the claim \"annika s\u00f6renstam and yani tseng win with the lowest number of stroke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim. It mentions two players: Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng. The statement says they both won with the lowest number of strokes. So, I need to check their winning scores and see if those are indeed the lowest in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here would be \"champion,\" \"score,\" and \"to par.\" But wait, the claim is about the number of strokes, so the \"score\" column should directly reflect that. Lower scores typically mean better performance since they represent fewer strokes taken over the course.\n\nLet me go through each row where Annika S\u00f6renstam or Yani Tseng are listed as champions.\n\nStarting with 2013: Stacy Lewis is the champion here, so not relevant.\n\nIn 2012, Jiyai Shin is the champion. Not either of them.\n\n2011: Yani Tseng is the champion. Her score is 272, which was in 2011 at Carnoustie Golf Links.\n\nLooking further down, in 2010: Yani Tseng again as champion with a score of 277.\n\nContinuing to 2009: Catriona Matthew wins. Not relevant.\n\n2008: Jiyai Shin is the champion, not our focus.\n\n2007: Lorena Ochoa, not either.\n\n2006: Sherri Steinhauer. Nope.\n\n2005: Jeong Jang from South Korea. Not relevant.\n\n2004: Karen Stupples. No.\n\n2003: Annika S\u00f6renstam is the champion here with a score of 278 at Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club.\n\nNow, let's check all scores in the table to see if these are the lowest. The earliest years have lower purse amounts, but I'm focusing on the \"score\" column.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- 2013: 280\n- 2012: 279\n- 2011: 272 (Yani Tseng)\n- 2010: 277 (Yani Tseng)\n- 2009: 285\n- 2008: 270 (Jiyai Shin)\n- 2007: 287\n- 2006: 273\n- 2005: 277\n- 2004: 278\n- 2003: 278 (Annika S\u00f6renstam)\n- 2002: 273\n- 2001: 277\n\nWait, in 2008, Jiyai Shin has a score of 270. That's actually lower than Yani Tseng's 272 and Annika's 278. So that means Jiyai Shin had the lowest number of strokes with 270.\n\nTherefore, the claim that both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng won with the lowest stroke counts is not accurate because there are other players (like Jiyai Shin in 2008) who have lower scores. So their wins don't hold the record for the lowest strokes; someone else does.\n\nSo, the claim isn't fully supported because while they did win, they didn't do so with the absolute lowest stroke counts listed in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that both Annika S\u00f6renstam and Yani Tseng won with the lowest number of strokes. However, examining the \"score\" column reveals that Jiyai Shin had a lower score (270) than both. Thus, their wins aren't the ones with the absolute lowest stroke counts.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"jiyal shin champion by beat inbee park in the 2012 open with 9 stroke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions that Jiyal Shin was the champion who beat Inbee Park in the 2012 Open, and the margin of victory was 9 strokes. I need to check each part of this statement against the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, the years are listed from 2013 down to 2001. So for the 2012 entry, I'll look at the row where \"year\" is 2012. \n\nIn that row, the champion is listed as \"jiyai shin,\" which seems close to what's mentioned in the claim. The runner(s)-up are \"inbee park.\" So the part about Inbee Park being the runner-up checks out.\n\nNext, the margin of victory for 2012 is stated as \"9 strokes.\" That matches exactly with the claim that Jiyal Shin won by 9 strokes. \n\nWait, though\u2014the name in the table is spelled \"jiyai shin,\" while the claim uses \"jiyal shin.\" Could this be a typo or variation in spelling? It's possible; sometimes names are misspelled in claims. Given that the rest of the information aligns and there's no other entry for 2012, I can assume it's referring to the same person.\n\nSo putting it all together: The 2012 Open had Jiyai Shin as champion, Inbee Park as runner-up, and a margin of 9 strokes. This fully supports the claim despite the minor spelling difference in the name.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"runner  (s)  - up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"margin of victory\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"In 2012, Jiyai Shin earned $365,17 more than Yani Tseng in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse this correctly. It seems like it's saying that in 2012, Jiyai Shin's earnings were $365,17 higher than what Yani Tseng earned in 2011. So, I should look at the data for both years and compare their respective winnings.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row has a year, champion, country, purse, winner's share, etc. The relevant columns here are \"year,\" \"champion,\" and \"winner's share.\" \n\nI'll start by finding Jiyai Shin in 2012. Scanning through the rows, I see that in 2012 (row index 1), the champion is Jiyai Shin from South Korea, and her winner's share is $428,650. So, she earned $428,650 in 2012.\n\nNext, I need to find Yani Tseng in 2011. Looking at row index 2 (year 2011), the champion is Yani Tseng from Taiwan, and her winner's share is $392,133. \n\nNow, the claim states that Shin earned $365,17 more than Tseng in 2011. So I'll subtract Tseng's 2011 earnings from Shin's 2012 earnings to see if it equals approximately $365,17.\n\nLet's compute: $428,650 (Shin, 2012) minus $392,133 (Tseng, 2011). \n\n$428,650 - $392,133 = $36,517.\n\nWait, that's exactly the number mentioned in the claim: $36,517. So, Shin earned $36,517 more than Tseng did in 2011. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the numbers match when you subtract Tseng's 2011 winnings from Shin's 2012 winnings.\n\nNow, I need to identify which cells were relevant for this calculation. For Jiyai Shin in 2012: row index 1, \"winner 's share.\" For Yani Tseng in 2011: row index 2, \"winner 's share.\"\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the difference between Jiyai Shin's 2012 earnings and Yani Tseng's 2011 earnings matches exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim \"annika s\u00f6renstam and catriona matthew win with the lowest number of stroke\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions two players: Annika S\u00f6renstam and Catriona Matthew. The claim states that both won with the lowest number of strokes. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year's championship details. The relevant columns here would be \"champion\" to identify who won, and \"score\" which indicates the total strokes taken. Additionally, \"to par\" might be useful as it shows how many strokes under par they were.\n\nI'll start by locating Annika S\u00f6renstam in the table. Scanning through the champions column, I find her in row 12 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). Her score is 278 with a to par of -10.\n\nNext, Catriona Matthew is listed as the champion in row 5. Her score is 285, and to par is -3.\n\nNow, comparing their scores: Annika has 278 strokes, while Catriona has 285. Since 278 is lower than 285, it seems Annika's win was indeed with a lower number of strokes compared to Catriona. However, the claim states that both won with the lowest number of strokes.\n\nWait, but each row represents different years, so their wins are in separate years. The question is about whether they both achieved this distinction individually, not against each other. \n\nLooking at Annika's 2003 win: her score was 278, which seems quite low. However, checking the rest of the table, I notice that in earlier years, like 2010 and 2011, Yani Tseng had scores as low as 272 and even lower in 2011 (272 again). Similarly, Jiyai Shin in 2012 scored 279. \n\nWait a minute, Annika's score of 278 is not the lowest overall because there are other champions with lower scores. So her win wasn't with the absolute lowest number of strokes across all years listed. She has a low score but not the lowest.\n\nCatriona Matthew won in 2009 with a score of 285, which is higher than many other champions' scores, so she didn't have the lowest stroke count either. \n\nTherefore, both Annika and Catriona did not win with the absolute lowest number of strokes as per the data provided. The claim that they \"win with the lowest number of stroke\" isn't accurate because there are entries in the table with lower stroke counts from other champions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any mention of Karrie Webb as a runner-up in 2008. Scanning through each row, when I reach the year 2008, which is the sixth row (row index 5), under the 'runner(s) - up' column, it says \"yani tseng\". So, Karrie Webb isn't listed there. That means she wasn't the runner-up in 2008.\n\nNext, I'll check if Karrie Webb became the champion in 2010 and 2011. For 2010, that's row index 3, and the champion is Yani Tseng, not Karrie Webb. Moving to 2011, which is row index 2, again, the champion is Yani Tseng. So, Karrie Webb didn't win in either of those years.\n\nSince none of the conditions in the claim are met\u2014she wasn't a runner-up in 2008 and she didn't become champion in 2010 or 2011\u2014the claim must be false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"runner  s  - up\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nThe claim states: \"In 2012, Jiyal Shin earned $365,17 less than Yani Tseng in 2011.\" \n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant information from the table. The claim compares the earnings of two golfers, Jiyai Shin in 2012 and Yani Tseng in 2011.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For Jiyai Shin in 2012: The winner's share is listed as $428,650.\n- For Yani Tseng in 2011: The winner's share is listed as $392,133.\n\nWait a minute, that seems off. Let me double-check the numbers to avoid any mistakes.\n\nIn the table:\n\n- 2012 (row index 1): Winner's share is 428650.\n- 2011 (row index 2): Winner's share is 392133.\n\nSo, according to the table, Jiyai Shin earned $428,650 in 2012, and Yani Tseng earned $392,133 in 2011. \n\nNow, calculating the difference between these two amounts: 428,650 - 392,133 = 36,517.\n\nWait, but the claim says Jiyal Shin earned $365,17 less than Yani Tseng in 2011. That would imply that Jiyai Shin's earnings are lower by that amount. However, according to the table, it's the opposite: Jiyai Shin earned more.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because Jiyal Shin actually earned $36,517 more than Yani Tseng in 2011. Therefore, the correct answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that Jiyal Shin earned less when she actually earned more. \n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
