    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states: \"the record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 14489.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this carefully. It seems like the claim is saying that there's a row in the table where the 'record' column shows 4-4 and the 'attendance' is 14489. So I need to check each row to see if both conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Record is 1-0, attendance is 21597 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nRow 1: Record is 2-0, attendance is 15229 \u2192 No.\nRow 2: Record is 2-1, attendance 20462 \u2192 No.\nRow 3: Record 3-1, attendance 18372 \u2192 No.\nRow 4: Record 3-2, attendance 19141 \u2192 No.\nRow 5: Record 4-2, attendance 12683 \u2192 No.\nRow 6: Record 4-3, attendance 13002 \u2192 No.\nRow 7: Record 4-4, attendance 14489. Oh! Here it is. Both conditions are met here. So the claim is true because in row 7 (assuming rows start at 0), the record is 4-4 and attendance is exactly 14489.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Claim:** The claim asserts that there exists a game where the team's record was 4-4 and the attendance was 14,489.\n\n2. **Review Each Row:** Examine each row of the table to check if both 'record' is 4-4 and 'attendance' is 14,489.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Look for rows where 'record' matches 4-4.\n   - In such rows, verify if 'attendance' equals 14,489.\n\n4. **Find the Matching Row:** \n   - The 8th row (index 7 since counting starts at 0) shows a record of 4-4 and attendance of 14,489.\n   \n5. **Conclusion:** Since both conditions are satisfied in this row, the claim is TRUE.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"November 6, 1980 be the only record of a tied game that year\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's stating that there was a tied game on November 6, 1980, and that this is the only such occurrence in that year according to the data.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I notice that all the dates are from 1960, not 1980. The years listed range from September 9, 1960, up to December 10, 1960. So, the claim mentions November 6, 1980, which is way outside the scope of this table since it only covers 1960.\n\nNext, I'll check if there were any tied games in the data provided for 1960. Scanning through the 'result' column, I see several outcomes marked as 'w', 'l', and one entry on week 12 where the result is 't 38-38'. That indicates a tie game between the opposing teams. The date for that tied game is November 27, 1960, not November 6, 1980.\n\nSo, two things are clear: \n1. There's no record of any games in November 1980 because the table only includes data from 1960.\n2. The tied game mentioned in the claim doesn't exist in the table; instead, there was a tie on November 27, 1960.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect both in terms of the year and the specific date. It's also incorrect because it suggests that November 6, 1980, was the only tied game that year, but the table doesn't support this at all.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to a date outside the table's scope (1960 vs. 1980) and incorrectly identifies the date of the tied game in the data provided.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_12\", \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the game on november 13  , 1960 be hold at the cotton bowl site.\" \n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to extract the key details: the date is November 13, 1960, and the location is Cotton Bowl. My task is to check if these two pieces of information align with the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns for 'date' and 'game site'. I'll scan each row's date column to find November 13, 1960. \n\nStarting from the top:\n- Week 1: September 9, 1960\n- Week 2: September 18, 1960\n- Week 3: September 23, 1960\n- Week 4: October 2, 1960\n- Week 6: October 16, 1960 (Note: There's no week 5 in the table)\n- Week 7: October 23, 1960\n- Week 8: October 30, 1960\n- Week 9: November 6, 1960\n- Week 10: November 13, 1960 \u2014 this matches the date in the claim.\n\nNow, I'll check the 'game site' for that row. The relevant cell is under week 10, which shows \"cotton bowl.\" \n\nSo both conditions are met: the date and location match exactly with what's stated in the claim. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the team's record be 4 - 4 when the attendance at the game be 9928\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into its components. It mentions two conditions:\n1. The team's record should be 4-4.\n2. The attendance at that specific game was 9928.\n\nI need to check if there exists a row in the table where both these conditions are met simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week with details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. So, for each row, I'll check the 'record' and 'attendance' columns.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Week 1):** Record is 1-0, Attendance is 21597 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n2. **Row 1 (Week 2):** Record is 2-0, Attendance is 15229 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n3. **Row 2 (Week 3):** Record is 2-1, Attendance is 20462 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n4. **Row 3 (Week 4):** Record is 3-1, Attendance is 18372 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n5. **Row 4 (Week 6):** Record is 3-2, Attendance is 19141 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n6. **Row 5 (Week 7):** Record is 4-2, Attendance is 12683 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n7. **Row 6 (Week 8):** Record is 4-3, Attendance is 13002 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n8. **Row 7 (Week 9):** Record is 4-4, Attendance is 14489 \u2192 Record matches but attendance doesn't.\n9. **Row 8 (Week 10):** Record is 4-5, Attendance is 21000 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n10. **Row 9 (Week 11):** Record is 4-6, Attendance is 20778 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n11. **Row 10 (Week 12):** Record is 4-6-1, Attendance is 7785 \u2192 Neither matches.\n12. **Row 11 (Week 13):** Record is 4-7-1, Attendance is 5861 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n13. **Row 12 (Week 14):** Record is 4-8-1, Attendance is 9928 \u2192 Attendance matches but record doesn't.\n\nFrom this examination, I notice that the attendance of 9928 occurs in Week 14, where the record is 4-8-1. However, there's a row (Week 9) where the record is exactly 4-4, but the attendance there was 14489, not 9928.\n\nTherefore, there is no single row where both the team's record is 4-4 and the attendance is 9928. The claim requires both conditions to be true simultaneously for the same game, which doesn't happen in this table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"on november 13, 1960 the game site be the cotton bowl and the attendance be over 21000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to find the row with the date November 13, 1960. Scanning through each week:\n\n- Week 10: Date is november 13, 1960. That's the one.\n\nNow, checking the relevant columns for this claim. The two parts of the claim are about the game site and attendance.\n\nFor the game site, in row 10 (since indexing starts at 0), column \"game site\" says cotton bowl. So that matches.\n\nNext, the attendance is listed as 21000. The claim states it should be over 21000. But here it's exactly 21000, not more than. Therefore, this part doesn't hold true because \"over\" implies a number higher than 21000.\n\nSo the game site is correct, but attendance isn't over 21000\u2014it's equal to that number. Hence, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
