    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"warren kym perform 16 dance\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's start by looking at the table and understanding its structure.\n\nThe table has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. Each row represents a different couple and their performance statistics.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It mentions \"warren kym\" as a couple and states that they performed 16 dances. So I need to check if this information matches what's in the table.\n\nLooking at the 'couple' column, I scan through each entry. The second row under 'couple' is \"warren & kym\". That seems like the couple in question. Now, looking at the same row, there's a column called 'number of dances'. For warren & kym, that value is 16.\n\nSo according to this, the number of dances they performed is indeed 16. The claim states exactly that, so it aligns with the data in the table.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other entries for \"warren kym\" or any typos that might cause confusion. Scanning through the rest of the 'couple' column, I don't see any other instances of this couple, which confirms that the second row is the correct one to reference.\n\nTherefore, both the number of dances and the identification of the couple in question are accurate as per the table. This means the claim is supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"warren kym\" performed 16 dances. Checking the table:\n\n- The couple \"warren & kym\" is listed in row 2 (row index 1, since indexing starts at 0).\n- In this row, the 'number of dances' column shows 16.\n\nThus, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. I need to carefully check each part of the claim against the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has several columns: \"rank by average\", \"place\", \"couple\", \"total points\", \"number of dances\", and \"average\". There are 12 rows in total, each representing a couple with their respective scores and statistics.\n\nThe claim is: \"rocco karina score 89 point in 5 dance , for an average of 17.8\"\n\nI need to break this down into its components:\n\n1. The couple's name is \"rocco karina\". Looking at the table, I see a row where the couple is listed as \"rocco  & karina\" (row index 10). So that matches.\n\n2. The total points scored by them are 89. In the table, under the \"total points\" column for this couple, it's indeed 89. That seems correct.\n\n3. They participated in 5 dances. Checking the \"number of dances\" column for their row, it shows 5. That matches as well.\n\n4. The average score is given as 17.8. The table has an \"average\" column where this couple's average is listed as 17.8. So that part also checks out.\n\nSince all parts of the claim align with the data in the table, each component is supported by the relevant cells. Therefore, the claim should be evaluated as TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"couple\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"total points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"cody & julianne's average score be 22.5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table to understand where the relevant information might be. The table has several columns: rank by average, place, couple, total points, number of dances, and average. The claim is about Cody & Julianne's average score, so I need to find their row in the table.\n\nLooking through the \"couple\" column:\n\n1. Brooke & Derek\n2. Warren & Kym\n3. Lance & Lacey\n4. Maurice & Cheryl\n5. Cody & Julianne\n6. Toni B & Alec\n7. Susan & Tony D\n8. Misty & Maksim\n9. Ted & Inna\n10. Kim K & Mark\n11. Rocco & Karina\n12. Cloris & Corky\n\nSo, Cody & Julianne are in row index 4 (since the first row is 0). Now, I need to check the \"average\" column for this row.\n\nIn row 4, under the \"average\" column, the value is 22.5. That matches exactly with the claim made. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Cody & Julianne's average score as per the table is indeed 22.5.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index for Cody & Julianne is 4.\n- The column name we're interested in is \"average\".\n\nSo, the relevant cell is at row_index 4 and column_name \"average\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"average\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is a bit ungrammatical but seems to ask if Warren & Kym have danced more than 20 times together. So, I need to find out how many dances they've done and check if it's greater than 20.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a couple with various statistics. The relevant columns here are \"couple\" and \"number of dances.\" I'll scan the rows to find Warren & Kym.\n\nIn the table, the second row (index 1) has the couple \"warren & kym.\" Their number of dances is listed as 16. \n\nSo, the claim states that they've danced more than 20 times together. However, according to the table, they have only danced 16 times. Since 16 is less than 20, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo support this, I need to identify the relevant cells. The \"number of dances\" column for Warren & Kym is in row index 1 under that column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Warren & Kym have danced only 16 times together, which is less than 20.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"number of dances\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
