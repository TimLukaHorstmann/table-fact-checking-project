    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here and a claim to verify. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the claim says: \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medal, total gold medal be 13\". Hmm, okay, that sounds like two conditions. I need to check if both are true based on the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- There's a 'rank' column, which tells us the position.\n- Then there are columns for gold, silver, bronze medals, and finally the total.\n\nSo, let's parse each part of the claim.\n\n1. \"rank 1 with a total of more than 21 medal\": This is saying that the country or entity ranked first has a total number of medals exceeding 21.\n2. \"total gold medal be 13\": The same rank 1 should have exactly 13 gold medals.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table row by row to find the relevant data.\n\nStarting with rank 1: Looking at row index 0 (since tables are zero-indexed), we see:\n\n- Rank: 1\n- Gold: 13\n- Silver: 8\n- Bronze: 1\n- Total: 22\n\nSo, for the first condition, the total is 22, which is indeed more than 21. That checks out.\n\nFor the second part, the gold medal count is exactly 13, which matches what's stated in the claim. \n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The claim only refers to rank 1, so other rows aren't relevant here. Each condition is satisfied by the data in row 0.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are true based on the table provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"gold\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"rank 3 have 6 total medal\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are rank, gold, silver, bronze, and total. Each row represents a different rank from 1 to 5.\n\nThe claim mentions \"rank 3,\" so I should focus on the row where the rank is 3. Looking at the table:\n\nRow indices start at 0, right? So rank 1 is at index 0, rank 2 at index 1, and rank 3 at index 2. Let me double-check that to make sure.\n\nYes, the third row (index 2) has rank 3. Now, in this row, the total number of medals should be checked against the claim of 6.\n\nLooking at the \"total\" column for rank 3, I see it's 16. Wait, that can't be right. The claim says 6, but according to the table, rank 3 has a total of 16 medals. That means the claim is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting or misread the numbers. Let me look again. Rank 3: gold is 1, silver is 3, bronze is 12. Adding those up gives 1 + 3 + 12 = 16. So yes, the total is indeed 16, not 6.\n\nTherefore, the claim that rank 3 has 6 total medals is FALSE. The relevant cells are the row for rank 3 (index 2) and specifically the \"total\" column in that row.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that rank 3 has a total of 6 medals, but according to the table, rank 3 has a total of 16 medals.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
