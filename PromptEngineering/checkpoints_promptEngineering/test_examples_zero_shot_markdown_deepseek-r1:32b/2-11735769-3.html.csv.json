    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"icarly be nominate for more award than the show win\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the table. It lists various awards, categories, works, and results (whether they were nominated or won). The work in all these entries is \"icarly,\" so we're focusing on that show.\n\nThe claim says that Icarly was nominated for more awards than it actually won. So, I need to count how many times Icarly was nominated versus the number of wins.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. **2009 Teen Choice Awards**: Nominated (result is \"nominated\").\n2. **2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards - Big Kid Award**: Nominated.\n3. **2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards - Lol Award**: Won.\n4. **2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards**: Won.\n5. **2011 Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil**: Nominated.\n6. **2012 Kids' Choice Awards**: Nominated.\n7. **2013 Daytime Emmy Awards**: This entry is about \"tuff puppy,\" which isn't Icarly, so we can ignore this row.\n\nNow, counting the nominations and wins for Icarly:\n\n- **Nominations**:\n  - Row 0: 2009\n  - Row 1: 2010 (Big Kid Award)\n  - Row 4: 2011 Brazil\n  - Row 5: 2012\n  Total nominations = 4\n\n- **Wins**:\n  - Row 2: 2010 Lol Award\n  - Row 3: 2011 UK's funniest person\n  Total wins = 2\n\nSo, Icarly was nominated for 4 awards and won 2. The claim states that the number of nominations is more than the number of wins. Since 4 > 2, this is true.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- For each nomination:\n  - Row 0: \"result\" is nominated.\n  - Row 1: \"result\" is nominated.\n  - Row 4: \"result\" is nominated.\n  - Row 5: \"result\" is nominated.\n\n- For each win:\n  - Row 2: \"result\" is won.\n  - Row 3: \"result\" is won.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all rows where \"work\" is Icarly and \"result\" is either nominated or won. Excluding row 6 as it's about a different work.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE with the listed relevant cells.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly.\" So, I need to check two things: first, whether there's another show besides iCarly that was nominated, and second, whether tuff is the only one.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award or nomination for a specific work. The \"work\" column shows that most entries are for \"icarly.\" However, in 2013, there's a row where the work is \"tuff puppy,\" and the result is \"nominated.\" That seems to indicate that tuff puppy was nominated.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other works besides iCarly and tuff puppy were nominated. Scanning through all the rows, every entry under \"work\" is either \"icarly\" or \"tuff puppy.\" There are no other shows listed. So, in the given table, only these two shows have nominations.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"tuff be the only other show nominate aside from icarly\" holds true because there's only one other nomination for tuff puppy besides those for iCarly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states that \"jerry traino win a total of 2 award, 1 for lol award (shared with ensemble) and 1 for nick uk's funniest person.\" \n\nFirst, I should look at the table to find any entries related to Jerry Traino. However, scanning through the table, I notice that none of the rows mention \"jerry traino\" in the 'work' column. The work is consistently listed as \"icarly.\" This suggests that maybe the claim is referring to someone else or perhaps there's a mistake.\n\nNext, let me check the awards mentioned in the claim: \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" and \"nick uk's funniest person.\" Looking at the table, I see two relevant entries. \n\nThe first entry is in row 2: Year 2010, award \"2010 australian kids' choice awards,\" category \"lol award (shared with ensemble),\" work \"icarly,\" result \"won.\" The second is in row 3: Year 2011, award \"2011 uk kids' choice awards,\" category \"nick uk's funniest person,\" work \"icarly,\" result \"won.\"\n\nSo both these awards were won by the work \"icarly\" and not specifically by Jerry Traino. Since the claim attributes these wins to Jerry Traino, but the table doesn't mention him, it appears that the information in the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because there's no evidence of Jerry Traino winning any awards as per the given table.

Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win only 1 in each year.\"\n\nFirst, I notice that the name mentioned is Jerry Traino. Looking at the table, the work listed is \"icarly\" across several entries. Since I don't see any mention of Jerry Traino directly in the table, maybe he's associated with \"icarly.\" So, I'll assume the claim refers to awards related to \"icarly,\" which might involve Jerry Traino.\n\nNow, let's check each part:\n\n1. **2010 Awards:**\n   - In 2010, there are two entries:\n     a. Teen Choice Awards with category \"choice tv actor: comedy\" \u2013 Nominated.\n     b. Australian Kids' Choice Awards with \"lol award (shared with ensemble)\" \u2013 Won.\n   - So, in 2010, icarly was nominated for one award and won another. That's two awards in total.\n\n2. **2011 Awards:**\n   - In 2011, there are also two entries:\n     a. UK Kids' Choice Awards with \"nick uk's funniest person\" \u2013 Won.\n     b. Meus Pr\u00e3\u00aamios Nick Brazil with \"funniest character\" \u2013 Nominated.\n   - So, in 2011, icarly won one award and was nominated for another.\n\nNow, evaluating the claim:\n- In 2010: icarly had two awards (nominated and won) as per the table. The claim says \"nominate for 2 awards\" which is correct since there are two entries.\n- The claim also mentions winning only 1 in each year. In 2010, they did win one award. So that's correct.\n\nIn 2011:\n- Two awards again (won and nominated). The claim states \"nominate for 2 awards\" which is accurate.\n- They won one award, as per the table. The claim says \"win only 1 in each year,\" which holds true here too.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the information from the table for both years, confirming two nominations and one win each year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"In 2010, Jerry Traino was nominated for the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Award in 2 different categories.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. It mentions two main points:\n1. The year 2010.\n2. Two nominations for the same award (Australian Kids' Choice Awards) in different categories.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for entries from 2010 related to Australian Kids' Choice Awards. \n\nScanning through the rows:\n- Row index 1: 2010, Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award, icarly, nominated.\n- Row index 2: 2010, same award, LOL Award (shared), icarly, won.\n\nSo in 2010, there are two entries for the same award but different categories. The claim mentions Jerry Traino being nominated, but looking at the table's \"work\" column, it lists \"icarly\" both times, not mentioning any individual like Jerry Traino. \n\nSince the table doesn't provide information about individuals like Jerry Traino but rather the work (\"icarly\"), we can't confirm his nomination from this data. Therefore, while there are two nominations for the same award in different categories, we don't have evidence that specifically links these to Jerry Traino.\n\nThus, the claim isn't fully supported by the table because it lacks information about individual nominees like Jerry Traino.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows two entries for 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards but doesn't mention Jerry Traino.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's trying to say that \"Tuff\" is the only show that was nominated. Maybe there was a typo and they meant \"nominated.\" So I think the intended claim is: \"Is 'tuff' the only show that was nominated?\"\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award nomination or win for a specific work. The works listed are all \"icarly\" except for one entry in 2013 where the work is \"tuff puppy.\" \n\nNow, let's check each relevant cell to see if any other shows besides \"Tuff Puppy\" were nominated. \n\nIn the year 2009, \"icarly\" was nominated in the choice TV actor: comedy category for the Teen Choice Awards.\n\nIn 2010, \"icarly\" had two entries: one nomination and a win in different categories at the Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nIn 2011, again, \"icarly\" got nominations and a win at the UK Kids' Choice Awards and another nomination at Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil.\n\nIn 2012, \"icarly\" was nominated for Favorite TV Sidekick in the Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nOnly in 2013 does \"tuff puppy\" appear as a work, and it was nominated for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program at the Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nSo, looking through all these entries, every year from 2009 to 2012, the work is \"icarly,\" which means that other shows (specifically \"Icarly\") were also nominated multiple times. Therefore, \"Tuff\" isn't the only show that was nominated.\n\nSo the claim that \"tuff be the only show nominate\" is FALSE because \"icarly\" was nominated in several categories across different years.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false as \"icarly\" was also nominated multiple times.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"work\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"work\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"jerry traino be nominate for 2 award in 2010 and 2 award in 2011 win both in each year.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse the claim correctly. It mentions Jerry Traino being nominated for two awards in 2010 and another two in 2011, winning both each year. I need to check if this matches the information in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has columns: year, award, category, work, result. Each row represents an award nomination or win for \"icarly.\" But wait, none of the rows mention Jerry Traino directly. All the entries are under \"work\" as \"icarly,\" which is a TV show. \n\nSo, I'm trying to find any mention of Jerry Traino in the table. Scanning through each row, I don't see his name anywhere. The awards listed are for \"icarly,\" but perhaps he was part of that show? But the table doesn't specify individual nominees; it just lists the work as icarly.\n\nNow, looking at the years 2010 and 2011:\n\nIn 2010, there are two entries:\n- Row index 1: Award is \"2010 australian kids' choice awards,\" category \"big kid award,\" result \"nominated.\"\n- Row index 2: Same award, category \"lol award (shared with ensemble),\" result \"won.\"\n\nIn 2011:\n- Row index 3: Award is \"2011 uk kids' choice awards,\" category \"nick uk's funniest person,\" result \"won.\"\n- Row index 4: Award is \"meus pr\u00e3\u00aamios nick brazil,\" category \"funniest character,\" result \"nominated.\"\n\nSo, in 2010, icarly was nominated twice and won one. In 2011, it was nominated twice as well but only won once.\n\nBut the claim is about Jerry Traino being nominated for two awards each year and winning both. The table doesn't mention him at all; it only mentions \"icarly\" as the work. Therefore, we don't have any information about individual nominees like Jerry Traino.\n\nSince there's no data in the table regarding Jerry Traino, I can't verify his nominations or wins. This makes the claim unsupported by the given data. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is not supported because Jerry Traino isn't mentioned in the table; it only lists awards for \"icarly.\"\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this table here with information about awards and nominations for a show called \"icarly.\" The claim is that \"icarly be nominate for 10 time as many award as the show win.\" Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.\n\nFirst, I think the claim is saying that icarly was nominated ten times more than the number of awards it actually won. So, if they won a certain number of awards, they were nominated ten times that number. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an award or nomination for \"icarly.\" The columns are year, award, category, work, and result. The relevant parts here are the \"result\" column, which shows whether it was a win or a nomination, and the count of each.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. 2009: Teen Choice Awards, category is Choice TV Actor: Comedy. Result is nominated.\n2. 2010: Australian Kids' Choice Awards, Big Kid Award, result is nominated.\n3. 2010: Same awards, Lol Award (shared), result is won.\n4. 2011: UK Kids' Choice Awards, Nick UK's Funniest Person, result is won.\n5. 2011: Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil, Funniest Character, nominated.\n6. 2012: Kids' Choice Awards, Favorite TV Sidekick, nominated.\n7. 2013: Daytime Emmy Awards, Outstanding Performer in Animated Program, Tuff Puppy, result is nominated.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that the last row mentions \"tuff puppy,\" which might be a different show or character? Or maybe it's related to icarly. The work column says \"icarly\" except for the last one, which says \"tuff puppy.\" Hmm, but the claim is about \"icarly,\" so perhaps I should consider only the rows where \"work\" is \"icarly.\"\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRows 0-6: Rows 0 has work as icarly. Row 1: same. Row 2: same. Row3: same. Row4: same. Row5: same. Row6: work is tuff puppy, which I think is different.\n\nSo excluding row6, let's count the nominations and wins.\n\nNominations:\n- 2009: nominated\n- 2010: nominated (Big Kid Award)\n- 2010: won (Lol Award)\nWait no, result for 2010 is 'won' in row2, so that's a win. So nominations are rows where result is 'nominated.'\n\nLet me list all the results:\n\nRow0: nominated\nRow1: nominated\nRow2: won\nRow3: won\nRow4: nominated\nRow5: nominated\nRow6: work is tuff puppy, result is nominated (but perhaps not part of icarly)\n\nSo for icarly, rows 0-5. Row6 may be separate.\n\nSo for icarly:\n\nNominations:\nRows0,1,4,5: that's four nominations.\nWins: Rows2 and3: two wins.\n\nWait, row2 is a win, so total wins are 2? Because in 2010 they won the Lol Award, and in 2011 they won UK's funniest person. So that's two wins.\n\nNominations: rows0,1,4,5. That's four times nominated.\n\nSo according to this, icarly has 4 nominations and 2 wins. The claim says it was nominated ten times as many awards as it won. So if they won N awards, they were nominated 10*N times.\n\nIn our case, wins are 2, so 10*2=20. But they were only nominated 4 times. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Maybe it's saying that the number of nominations is ten times the number of awards won. So, if N is the number of awards won, then nominations = 10*N.\n\nHere, N=2 wins, so 10*2=20. But in reality, they have only four nominations. That's way less than 20. So that would make the claim false.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is misphrased. Maybe it means \"icarly was nominated ten times for awards as many as the show won.\" Which might mean that the number of nominations equals ten times the number of wins.\n\nBut with N=2 wins and nominations=4, 10*2=20, which doesn't match. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"nominated for awards as many times as the show has won,\" but that would be different. Let me rephrase: \"icarly was nominated ten times as many award as the show win.\" Maybe meaning that the number of nominations is ten times the number of wins.\n\nIn this case:\n\nNominations (for icarly) =4\nWins=2\n\nIs 4 equal to 10*2? No, because 10*2=20. So 4\u226020, so claim is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should include all nominations and wins regardless of the show. Wait no, the claim is about \"icarly,\" so only rows where work is icarly count.\n\nBut wait, looking back at row6: it's for tuff puppy, which might be a character from icarly? Or another show? If it's part of icarly, then we include that nomination as well. Let me check:\n\nRow6: 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards, Outstanding Performer in Animated Program, work is tuff puppy, result is nominated.\n\nIf \"tuff puppy\" is a character from \"icarly,\" then perhaps this counts towards icarly's nominations. So let's include row6 as another nomination for icarly.\n\nSo total nominations:\n\nRows0,1,4,5,6: five nominations.\nWins: rows2 and3: two wins.\n\nSo now, Nominations=5, Wins=2.\n\nIs 5 equal to ten times the number of wins? 10*2=20. No, 5\u226020. So still false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm counting wrong. Let me recount:\n\nRows where work is icarly: rows0-5 (since row6's work is tuff puppy). So that would be:\n\nNominations: rows0,1,4,5: four nominations.\nWins: rows2 and3: two wins.\n\nSo Nominations=4, Wins=2. 4 vs 10*2=20. Still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that the number of times nominated is ten times more than the number of awards won, which could mean nominations = 10*wins + wins? That would be 11*wins. But that's a different interpretation.\n\nBut regardless, with Wins=2 and Nominations=4 or5, it doesn't reach 10 times.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"icarly was nominated ten times as many awards as the show has won.\" Analyzing the data:\n\n- **Wins**: icarly won two awards (2010 Lol Award and 2011 UK's funniest person).\n- **Nominations**: icarly received four nominations (excluding row6 if tuff puppy is a separate entity) or five if including tuff puppy.\n\nCalculating ten times the wins: 10 * 2 = 20. However, icarly was only nominated four to five times, which does not equal twenty. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** False",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"Jerry Traino win a total of 4 awards, 2 for lol award (shared with ensemble) and 2 for nick uk's funniest person.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It mentions Jerry Traino winning four awards in total. Two of these are for the \"lol award\" which he shared with an ensemble, and two more for \"nick uk's funniest person.\" \n\nLooking at the table, I see that it lists several awards from different years. Each row has details about the year, award, category, work, and result (whether it was a win or nomination). My first thought is to check each relevant cell in the table to see if Jerry Traino indeed won these awards as claimed.\n\nBut wait, looking at the table, I don't see any mention of \"Jerry Traino\" anywhere. The \"work\" column lists \"icarly\" multiple times and once \"tuff puppy.\" So, does that mean Jerry Traino is associated with \"icarly\"? Because in some cases, \"work\" refers to a show or character. Maybe he's the voice actor for a character on \"icarly.\"\n\nNow, checking each award:\n\n1. 2009 Teen Choice Awards: Category was choice TV actor: comedy for icarly. The result was nominated. So that's one nomination.\n\n2. 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards: Two entries here. First, the Big Kid Award where icarly was nominated. Second, the lol award (shared with ensemble) which icarly won. That's a win for the lol award.\n\n3. 2011 UK Kids' Choice Awards: Nick UK's funniest person for icarly and it was a win. So that's another award.\n\n4. 2011 Meus Pr\u00eamios Nick Brazil: Funniest character, nominated. Another nomination.\n\n5. 2012 Kids' Choice Awards: Favorite TV sidekick, nominated.\n\n6. 2013 Daytime Emmy Awards: Outstanding performer in an animated program for tuff puppy, nominated.\n\nNow, compiling the wins:\n\n- 2010: lol award (shared) - won\n- 2011: Nick UK's funniest person - won\n\nSo that's two awards won. The claim says he won four awards total. Wait, but in the table, only two awards are marked as \"won.\" So there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me go through each row again:\n\n- 2009: Nominated\n- 2010: First nomination for Big Kid Award, then a win for lol award.\n- 2011: Win for Nick UK's funniest person, and another nomination in Brazil.\n- 2012: Nominated\n- 2013: Nominated.\n\nSo total wins are two. The claim says four awards won. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because according to the table, Jerry Traino (assuming he's associated with icarly) only has two wins: lol award in 2010 and Nick UK's funniest person in 2011.\n\nMoreover, the claim mentions that two of these are for \"lol award\" and two for \"nick uk's funniest person.\" But according to the table, there's only one win each. There\u2019s no other instance where he won the same category again. \n\nTherefore, the claim is false because he didn't win four awards; he only won two.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Jerry Traino won a total of 4 awards, specifically 2 for the \"lol award\" and 2 for \"nick uk's funniest person.\" However, according to the table, there are only two wins: one for the lol award in 2010 and another for nick uk's funniest person in 2011. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"award\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"category\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break down the claim first.\n\nThe claim says: \"in 2008 Jerry Traino be nominated for the 2008 Australian Kids' Choice Award in 2 different categories.\"\n\nOkay, so we're looking for information about the year 2008, involving someone named Jerry Traino and two nominations in the Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nThe columns are: year, award, category, work, result.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any entry with the year 2008. Scanning through the 'year' column, I see entries for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. There's no row with the year 2008 in this table.\n\nSince there are no rows for 2008, there can't be any nominations listed for that year. Therefore, Jerry Traino couldn't have been nominated in 2008 based on this data.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the 'award' column, I see mentions of Australian Kids' Choice Awards only in 2010 (twice). There's no award mentioned for 2008.\n\nSo, since the table doesn't have any entries from 2008, especially related to the Australian Kids' Choice Awards, the claim isn't supported by the data provided. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe table does not contain any information about the year 2008 or Jerry Traino's nominations for that year.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Check Year:** Look for rows with the year 2008 in the 'year' column. None found.\n2. **Check Award Type:** Even if there were a 2008 row, look for \"Australian Kids' Choice Awards.\" The closest is 2010 entries.\n3. **Conclusion:** No relevant data supports the claim.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
