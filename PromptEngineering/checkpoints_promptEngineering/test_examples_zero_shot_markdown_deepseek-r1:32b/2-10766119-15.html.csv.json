    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"5000 crowd watch the match hold on glenferrie oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All rows have the same structure, so each row represents a different match played on August 4, 1928.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific pieces of information: the crowd size (5000) and the venue (glenferrie oval). I need to check if there's a row in the table where both these conditions are met.\n\nI'll start by scanning each row to find the one that has \"glenferrie oval\" as the venue. Looking through the 'venue' column:\n\n- The first row is at arden street oval.\n- Second row is brunswick street oval.\n- Third at punt road oval.\n- Fourth at corio oval.\n- Fifth row: glenferrie oval. That's a match!\n- Sixth row is junction oval.\n\nSo, the fifth row (index 4) has \"glenferrie oval\" as the venue.\n\nNow, I'll check what the crowd size was for that match. In the 'crowd' column of the same row, it says 5000. That's exactly what the claim states.\n\nWait a minute, but the table shows the crowd as an integer without commas or any other characters. The number is written as \"5000\", which aligns perfectly with the claim of 5000 people watching the match at glenferrie oval.\n\nI should also make sure there are no typos in the venue name. In the table, it's spelled \"glenferrie oval\", which matches the claim exactly. So, that part checks out too.\n\nIs there any possibility of confusion with another row? Let me double-check:\n\n- Row 0: north melbourne vs south melbourne at arden street oval - crowd is 6000.\n- Row 1: fitzroy vs footscray at brunswick street oval - 12,000.\n- Row 2: richmond vs melbourne at punt road oval - 26,000.\n- Row 3: geelong vs essendon at corio oval - 10,000.\n- Row 4: hawthorn vs collingwood at glenferrie oval - 5000.\n- Row 5: st kilda vs carlton at junction oval - 31,000.\n\nOnly row 4 has both the correct venue and crowd size. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data from row 4 of the table, where a crowd of 5000 attended the match at glenferrie oval.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"home team geelong have a away team score of 12.10 (82)\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table to understand its structure. The table has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. There are six rows of data corresponding to different matches on August 4, 1928.\n\nThe claim mentions \"home team geelong\" so I should look for the row where Geelong is listed as the home team. Scanning through the 'home team' column:\n\n- The first row: North Melbourne\n- Second: Fitzroy\n- Third: Richmond\n- Fourth: Geelong\n- Fifth: Hawthorn\n- Sixth: St Kilda\n\nSo, Geelong is in row index 3 (since indexing starts at 0). Now, checking the columns relevant to the claim. The claim states that Geelong has an away team score of 12.10 (82). \n\nLooking at row index 3:\n- Home team: Geelong\n- Away team: Essendon\n\nIn this row, the 'away team score' is listed as \"12.10  (82)\". So according to the table, when Geelong was the home team against Essendon, the away team's score was indeed 12.10 (82). \n\nBut wait, let me double-check that I'm interpreting this correctly. The 'away team' in row 3 is Essendon, and their score is 12.10. So yes, when Geelong hosted Essendon at Corio Oval on August 4, 1928, the away team (Essendon) scored 12.10 (82). \n\nTherefore, the claim correctly states that the away team score for Geelong's home game was 12.10 (82). So, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only including the relevant cells in my JSON response. The relevant columns are 'home team' and 'away team score', both from row index 3.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because when Geelong was the home team, the away team Essendon scored 12.10 (82).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n1. **Identify the Relevant Row:** Look for \"geelong\" in the 'home team' column. Found at row index 3.\n2. **Check Away Team Score:** In the same row, check the 'away team score'. It is 12.10 (82).\n3. **Verify Claim Accuracy:** The claim matches the data exactly.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The goal is to determine whether the claim \"north melbourne and south melbourne play on 4 august 1928 at arden street oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n1. **Teams Involved**: north melbourne (home team) and south melbourne (away team).\n2. **Date of the Match**: 4 August 1928.\n3. **Venue of the Match**: Arden Street Oval.\n\nNext, I need to verify each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- There are six rows, each representing a different match on the same date, 4 August 1928.\n- Each row lists details like home team, home score, away team, away score, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nI'll scan through each row to find the one that involves north melbourne as the home team. \n\n- **Row 0**: Home team is north melbourne. The away team here is south melbourne. That matches the teams in the claim.\n- Now, check the date for this row: It's indeed 4 August 1928, which aligns with the claim.\n- Next, verify the venue: Arden Street Oval, which exactly matches what the claim states.\n\nSince all components of the claim (teams, date, venue) are accurately represented in Row 0 of the table, there's no discrepancy.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"essendon lose to geelong at home before a crowd of 26000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into its components:\n1. Essendon lost the game.\n2. They were playing at home against Geelong.\n3. The crowd size was 26,000 people.\n\nNow, I'll check each of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. Each row represents a different game on August 4, 1928.\n\nI need to find the row where Essendon is involved. Scanning through the \"home team\" column, I don't see Essendon there. Let me check the \"away team\" column. There's an entry for Essendon in the fourth row: away team is Essendon, and the home team is Geelong.\n\nSo, in that game, Geelong is the home team, and Essendon is the away team. Now, let's look at the scores to determine who won. The home team score is 4.14 (38), and the away team score is 12.10 (82). Since 82 is higher than 38, Essendon won that game as the away team.\n\nNext, I need to check if Essendon was playing at home. From the table, since they're listed under \"away team,\" they were not at home. This contradicts the claim that Essendon lost at home. \n\nAdditionally, the crowd size in that particular game was 10,000, which is much lower than the claimed 26,000. However, I should verify if there's another row where the crowd is 26,000. Looking through the \"crowd\" column, I see that the third row has a crowd of 26,000, but that game was between Richmond (home) and Melbourne (away). So, Essendon wasn't involved in that match.\n\nPutting it all together: The claim says Essendon lost at home with a crowd of 26,000. But according to the table:\n- Essendon won their game as the away team against Geelong.\n- They were not at home; they were the away team.\n- The crowd for that game was 10,000, not 26,000.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are incorrect. So the answer should be FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells from the table:\n- The fourth row is where Essendon is involved as the away team against Geelong.\n- Checking their scores to determine who won: home team score (4.14) and away team score (12.10).\n- Also checking the crowd size in that same row.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the third row where the crowd was 26,000 to ensure Essendon wasn't involved there either.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Essendon did not lose at home; they won as the away team against Geelong with a crowd of 10,000, not 26,000.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the claim. It mentions three main pieces of information: the crowd size (10,000), the team involved (Essendon), and the venue (Glenferrie Oval). My task is to check each of these against the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by scanning for Essendon's game. Scanning through each row:\n\nRow 3: Geelong vs. Essendon at Corio Oval with a crowd of 10,000 on 4 August 1928.\nRow 4: Hawthorn vs. Collingwood at Glenferrie Oval with a crowd of 5,000.\n\nWait, so Essendon's game is in row 3, but the venue there is Corio Oval, not Glenferrie Oval. The claim mentions Glenferrie Oval, which is actually where Hawthorn played against Collingwood, as seen in row 4. In that case, the crowd was only 5,000.\n\nSo, Essendon's game at their own venue (Corio Oval) had a crowd of 10,000, but the claim refers to a different venue, Glenferrie Oval. Therefore, the crowd size mentioned in the claim doesn't match the actual attendance for Essendon's game; it was at Corio Oval with 10k people, not at Glenferrie where only 5k attended.\n\nHence, the claim is incorrect because Essendon didn't play at Glenferrie Oval on that date. Instead, Hawthorn and Collingwood played there with a smaller crowd.

I need to determine whether the claim \"north melbourne play at home against south melbourne , lose in corio oval\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully. It has three main parts:\n\n1. **Teams Involved**: North Melbourne is playing at home against South Melbourne.\n2. **Outcome**: North Melbourne loses the game.\n3. **Venue**: The game takes place at Corio Oval.\n\nNow, I'll look into the table to find any row that involves both North Melbourne and South Melbourne as opposing teams. Scanning through each row:\n\n- Row 0: Home team is North Melbourne vs Away team South Melbourne. This matches the first part of the claim.\n  \nNext, let's check the outcome. In this row, North Melbourne's score is 12.10 (82), and South Melbourne's score is 11.14 (80). Comparing these scores, it seems that North Melbourne actually won since 82 > 80. Therefore, the claim states they lost, which contradicts this information.\n\nAdditionally, the venue for this game is listed as Arden Street Oval, not Corio Oval as stated in the claim. So both the outcome and venue details don't align with the table data.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check other rows just to be thorough. Scanning through all six rows:\n\n- Row 1: Fitzroy vs Footscray\n- Row 2: Richmond vs Melbourne\n- Row 3: Geelong vs Essendon (Venue: Corio Oval)\n- Row 4: Hawthorn vs Collingwood\n- Row 5: St Kilda vs Carlton\n\nNone of these other rows involve both North Melbourne and South Melbourne. So the only relevant row is row 0.\n\nTherefore, the claim has two inaccuracies:\n1. The outcome is incorrect; North Melbourne won.\n2. The venue mentioned doesn't match (Corio Oval vs Arden Street Oval).\n\nGiven these discrepancies, the claim isn't fully supported by the table. Thus, it should be marked as FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the scores? Let me double-check. In Australian Rules Football, the score format is Goals.Behinds (Total Points). Each goal is 6 points, and each behind is 1 point. So:\n\n- North Melbourne: 12 goals *6 +10 behinds*1 =72+10=82\n- South Melbourne: 11 goals *6 +14 behinds*1=66+14=80\n\nYes, 82>80, so North Melbourne won. Hence, the claim is incorrect.\n\nAlso, the venue for their game was Arden Street Oval, not Corio Oval. So both parts of the claim are wrong in this context.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that North Melbourne played at home against South Melbourne, lost, and the game was held at Corio Oval.

I'll need to carefully analyze each part of the claim against the information provided in the table.\n\nFirst, let me read the claim again: \"at glenferrie oval , hawthorne score 9.9 (63) , beat carlton\". So, there are a few key points here that I need to verify.\n\n1. **Venue**: The claim states that the match took place at Glenferrie Oval.\n2. **Home Team and Score**: It mentions Hawthorn scored 9.9 (63).\n3. **Away Team**: Carlton is mentioned as the opposing team, and it's implied they were beaten by Hawthorn.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a different match with details about home team, their score, away team, away score, venue, crowd, and date. All matches listed are from August 4, 1928.\n\nI need to find the row where the venue is Glenferrie Oval.

Additionally, Collingwood scored higher (17.18 (120)), so they won, contradicting the claim that Hawthorn beat Carlton.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
