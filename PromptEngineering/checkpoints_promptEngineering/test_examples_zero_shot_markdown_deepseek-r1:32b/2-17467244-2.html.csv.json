    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"In the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final, Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Location and Event**: The event is the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup final. I need to look for entries related to this event in the table.\n\n2. **Player Mentioned**: Tisha Venturini is mentioned as playing in these matches, but I don't see any information about players in the table columns provided (match, date, location, lineup, result, competition). So, the table doesn't have details on specific players, only general info like match number, dates, locations, and results.\n\n3. **Number of Matches at Gavle**: The claim says Tisha played 4 matches there. Looking at the \"location\" column for entries related to Sweden 1995. \n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n- Rows 0-6 are about the Sweden 1995 World Cup.\n- Row 0 is just a header, so actual data starts from row 1.\n- Locations listed: Gavle appears in rows 1, 2, 4 (Gavle), and Helsingborg in row3. Then Vasteras in row5, Gavle again in row6.\n\nSo, for Sweden 1995:\n- Matches at Gavle are rows 1,2,4,6. That's four matches.\n  \nBut the table doesn't mention any players, just lineup info as \"start\" or specific times like \"80' (Cromwell)\". Since there's no information about Tisha Venturini in the table, I can't confirm she played these matches.\n\nTherefore, even though Gavle hosted four matches, without player data, we can't verify if Tisha was part of those games. Hence, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows that there were four matches held at Gavle during the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, but it doesn't provide any information about specific players like Tisha Venturini.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about Tisha Venturini's career matches ending in draws on specific dates: 1995-06-06, 1996-07-25, and 1999-07-10. My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the table. The columns are: match, date, location, lineup, result, competition. Each row represents a different match with corresponding details.\n\nThe claim states that three matches ended in draws on those specific dates. So, I'll check each of these dates in the table and look at the 'result' column to see if it was indeed a draw.\n\nStarting with 1995-06-06: Looking through the rows, row index 1 has the date 1995-06-06. The result here is 3-3, which is a draw. So that's one correct point for the claim.\n\nNext, checking 1996-07-25: Row index 8 shows this date. The result is 0-0, another draw. That's the second correct instance.\n\nNow, for 1999-07-10: This date is in row index 13. The result here is listed as 0-0 (pso 5-4). At first glance, this seems like a draw because both teams have zero goals. However, the \"pso\" likely stands for penalty shoot-out, which means it was decided after extra time and penalties. So technically, it's a draw in regulation but not overall. Depending on how draws are defined here, this might be considered a draw or not. If we consider the final result including penalties, then it's not a draw because one team won via penalties.\n\nAlternatively, if the definition of a draw is solely based on the match time and not the penalty shootout, then 0-0 would still count as a draw regardless of the shootout outcome. This could be a point of contention. However, in many competitions, especially FIFA events, a penalty shoot-out decides the winner after extra time, so it's often considered a win for the team that won the shootout rather than a draw.\n\nGiven that context, row 13 might not count as a draw because the final outcome was decided by penalties. Therefore, only two of the three dates listed in the claim had matches that ended in draws according to the table.\n\nSince the claim states there are three such matches but only two are supported by the data provided, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"in the highest scoring game 5 goal be score , which be on 1995-06-10\". \n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked here. It seems like they're saying that the highest-scoring match had 5 goals, and it occurred on June 10, 1995. So I need to check two things: was there a game with 5 goals scored, and if so, did it take place on that date?\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a different match with details like date, location, lineup, result, etc. The \"result\" column shows the score of each game.\n\nI'll go through each row to find the one(s) where the total goals scored (sum of both teams' goals) is the highest and see if any have exactly 5 goals or more.\n\nLet's start from the top:\n\nRow 1: June 6, 1995 - Score was 3-3. Total goals = 6.\nRow 2: June 8, 1995 - 2-0. Total goals = 2.\nRow 3: June 10, 1995 - 4-1. Total goals = 5.\nRow 4: June 13, 1995 - 4-0. Total goals = 4.\nRow 5: June 15, 1995 - 0-1. Total goals = 1.\nRow 6: June 17, 1995 - 2-0. Total goals = 2.\n\nThen in the Atlanta 1996 section:\nRow 7: July 21, 1996 - 3-0. Total goals = 3.\nRow 8: July 23, 1996 - 2-1. Total goals = 3.\nRow 9: July 25, 1996 - 0-0. Total goals = 0.\nRow 10: July 28, 1996 - 2-1 aet (but I think the 'aet' is just indicating after extra time; still same total).\nRow 11: August 1, 1996 - 2-1. Total goals =3.\n\nIn the USA 1999 section:\nRow 12: June 27, 1999 - 3-0. Total goals=3.\nRow13: July 10, 1999 - 0-0 (but mentions pso 5-4, which is a penalty shootout after extra time; but in terms of actual game goals before penalties, it's 0-0). So total is still 0.\n\nSo looking at all the totals:\nRow 1:6, Row3:5, others have lower or same. \n\nThe highest scoring game is row 1 with 6 goals (3-3). But the claim mentions that the highest was 5 goals on June 10. However, according to the table, the highest is actually 6 goals on June 6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: Row1 date is 1995-06-06 with a 3-3 result (total 6), and row3 is June 10 with 4-1 (total 5). So the highest was indeed 6 goals. Therefore, the claim says that the highest scoring game had 5 goals on June 10, which isn't correct because there's a higher total on an earlier date.\n\nSo the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells are row3's result and date (columns 'result' and 'date'), as well as row1's result and date to compare.\n</think>\n\nThe highest-scoring match was on June 6, 1995, with a total of 6 goals, not 5 on June 10. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about Tisha Venturini playing 13 matches across three different tournaments. My goal is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: match, date, location, lineup, result, and competition. Each row represents a specific match from various tournaments like the FIFA Women's World Cup and the Olympic tournament.\n\nThe claim states that Tisha Venturini played 13 matches in three different tournaments. I need to verify two things: whether she participated in 13 matches and if those matches were across three distinct tournaments.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match. However, there are only 12 rows of data (excluding the headers). Each competition listed is either the \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup\", \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament\", or \"usa 1999 fifa women's world cup\". That's three different tournaments.\n\nNow, checking how many matches are listed. The first set of matches (rows 1-6) is from the 1995 Sweden World Cup, which has 6 matches. Then, rows 7-11 are from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, totaling 5 matches. Finally, rows 12-13 are from the 1999 USA World Cup, adding 2 more matches. In total, that's 6 + 5 + 2 = 13 matches.\n\nSince the claim mentions 13 matches across three tournaments and the table lists exactly 13 matches spread over three tournaments (two FIFA World Cups and one Olympic tournament), it seems to align perfectly with the data provided.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of Tisha Venturini in the lineup column. Looking through the lineup entries, I see mentions like \"start\" or specific substitutions (e.g., 80' (Cromwell)), but no explicit name of Tisha Venturini is listed. However, since the claim doesn't provide details on her performance or presence beyond participation count, and given that each match entry implies player participation without explicitly listing names, it's reasonable to assume that the count refers to all players who participated in these matches.\n\nTherefore, based on the number of matches per tournament matching the claim, I conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

So that counts as one gold medal match.\n\nNext, checking all other rows to see if there are any more gold medal matches. The rest of the matches either have competitions like group stage, semifinal, third place match, or finals (like in the USA 1999 World Cup), but none of them mention a \"gold medal match\" except for row 11.\n\nSo, only one out of all the listed matches is a gold medal match.

The claim is a string: \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament usa 1999 fifa women's world cup\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse what this claim is saying. It seems like it's listing three different events: the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament, and the USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that each row represents a match with details like date, location, lineup, result, etc. The first section under \"match\" includes entries for the Sweden 1995 tournament, then Atlanta 1996, and finally USA 1999.\n\nI'll go through each event in the claim:\n\n1. **Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final**: Scanning the table, I see rows where \"match\" is listed as \"sweden 1995 fifa women's world cup final\". That starts at row index 0 and goes up to row index 6, but row 0 seems to be a header or repetition. The actual matches start from row 1 onwards.\n\n2. **Atlanta 1996 Olympic Women's Football Tournament**: Similarly, the table has entries under \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament\" starting around row index 7 and going through row index 11.\n\n3. **USA 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup**: This is listed in rows starting at index 12 up to 13.\n\nSo, each of these events mentioned in the claim does have corresponding entries in the table.

I'm trying to determine if the claim \"1996-08-01 athens, ga start 2-1 gold medal match\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Date**: 1996-08-01\n2. **Location**: Athens, GA\n3. **Lineup**: Start (which probably means the starting lineup)\n4. **Result**: 2-1\n5. **Competition**: Gold medal match\n\nNow, I'll look through each row of the table to see if any match these details.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- The first two sections are about Sweden's participation in the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. None of those rows seem relevant since they're from a different year and competition.\n  \n- Moving on, there's a section labeled \"atlanta 1996 olympic women's football tournament.\" This is in 1996, so it's closer to the claim.\n\nLooking at row indices:\n\n- **Row 7**: Date is 1996-07-21, location Orlando. Doesn't match.\n- **Row 8**: Date 1996-07-23, Orlando again. No.\n- **Row 9**: Date 1996-07-25, Miami. Still not matching the claim's date or location.\n- **Row 10**: Date 1996-07-28, Athens, GA. The location matches! Let me check the other details. The result is 2-1 aet (which means after extra time), and it's a semifinal match. The claim mentions \"gold medal match,\" but this is a semifinal, so that doesn't align.\n  \nWait, there's another row:\n\n- **Row 11**: Date 1996-08-01, location Athens, GA. This matches the date and location in the claim. Let me check other details:\n  - The result is 2-1.\n  - Competition: Gold medal match.\n\nThat fits perfectly! So row 11 has all the necessary information matching the claim.\n\nSo the relevant cells are from row index 11, specifically the columns for date, location, lineup (which says 'start'), result, and competition.\n\nEach of these confirms a part of the claim:\n- Date matches.\n- Location matches.\n- Lineup is 'start'.\n- Result is 2-1.\n- Competition is gold medal match.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by row 11 in the table. So the answer should be TRUE with the relevant cells listed accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"lineup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"competition\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
