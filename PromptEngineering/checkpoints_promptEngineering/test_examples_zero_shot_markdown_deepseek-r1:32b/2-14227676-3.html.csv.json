The claim mentions \"noiz,\" so I'll check which row corresponds to them.\n\nLooking through the rows, I see that noiz is listed in the last row (row index 7). In this row, under the \"days held\" column, it says \"2127 +\". This indicates that noiz held the title for over 2127 days. \n\nNow, to verify if this is the longest time compared to others, I'll check all other entries in the \"days held\" column:\n\n- filoso: unknown\n- osamu namiguchi: 7 days\n- katsuhiko nakajima: 297 days\n- tatsuhito takaiwa: 8 days\n- vacated: -\n- the\u2605zest: 261 days\n\nAll other entries either have fewer days or are marked as unknown/vacated.

It's excluding \"vacate,\" which I think refers to the row where the wrestler is listed as \"vacated.\" So, for all other rows except that one, each wrestler should have a reign count of at least 1.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several wrestlers: filoso, osamu namiguchi, katsuhiko nakajima, tatsuhito takaiwa, vacated (which I assume is not a wrestler but just indicates the title was vacated), the\u2605zest, and noiz.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nThe claim says that noiz held their title for the shortest duration, which was only 7 days. To verify this, I need to look into the \"days held\" column in the table and check each wrestler's tenure.\n\nLooking at the table, I see several rows:\n\n1. filoso: days held is unknown.\n2. osamu namiguchi: 7 days.\n3. katsuhiko nakajima: 297 days.\n4. tatsuhito takaiwa: 8 days.\n5. vacated: no data.\n6. the\u2605zest: 261 days.\n7. noiz: 2127+ days.\n\nSo, first, I need to find who has the shortest days held. The possible candidates are filoso (unknown), osamu namiguchi (7), tatsuhito takaiwa (8). Since filoso's days are unknown, we can't include them in comparisons. So between 7 and 8 days, the shortest is 7 days.\n\nNow, checking who has this: it's osamu namiguchi, not noiz. Noiz has 2127+ days, which is way longer than others except for vacated (which isn't applicable here).\n\nTherefore, the claim that noiz held the title for the shortest time at 7 days is incorrect because osamu namiguchi was the one who held it for 7 days. Additionally, noiz actually held it much longer.\n\nSo, I should mark this as FALSE and identify the relevant cells which are \"days held\" for both osamu namiguchi (row index 1) and noiz (row index 6).

The claim mentions \"all wrestlers,\" including vacated, so I need to check each row in the table.\n\nThe relevant column here is \"reign\" because the claim is about the number of times a wrestler has held the title.

Therefore, none of the actual wrestlers have held the title more than once.\n\nThe claim says every wrestler, including vacate, has at least 3 reigns. But from the table, all active wrestlers (filoso, osamu namiguchi, etc.) have only 1 reign each. The vacated entry isn't a wrestler and doesn't affect the count. So, the claim is definitely false because none meet the requirement of 3 or more reigns.\n\nSo, I'll mark this as FALSE.
