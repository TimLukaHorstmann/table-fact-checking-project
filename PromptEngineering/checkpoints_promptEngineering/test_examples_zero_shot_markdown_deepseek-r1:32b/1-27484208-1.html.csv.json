    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"it may come as a surprise, but Dartmouth College rank higher than the University of T\u00fcbingen\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It suggests that Dartmouth College has a better (higher) world rank compared to the University of T\u00fcbingen in 2013 according to some ranking system. The table provides data from three different ranking sources: WUR, ARWU, and QS for the year 2013.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\n- Dartmouth College is listed first (row index 0).\n- University of T\u00fcbingen is in row index 4.\n\nThe columns relevant to world rankings are:\n1. \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n2. \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n3. \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n\nI'll check each ranking for both universities and see if Dartmouth is ranked higher in any of them.\n\nStarting with WUR (World University Rankings) for 2013:\n- Dartmouth College: 126th\n- University of T\u00fcbingen: 201 - 225th\n\nHere, 126th is better than 201-225th. So in WUR, Dartmouth is higher.\n\nNext, ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) for 2013:\n- Dartmouth College: 151 - 200th\n- University of T\u00fcbingen: 151 - 200th\n\nBoth are in the same range here. So they are equal in ARWU.\n\nLastly, QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) for 2013:\n- Dartmouth College: 113th\n- University of T\u00fcbingen: 144th\n\nIn QS, 113th is better than 144th. So Dartmouth is higher here as well.\n\nSo in two out of three rankings (WUR and QS), Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen. In ARWU, they are tied. Therefore, the claim that Dartmouth ranks higher than T\u00fcbingen is supported by at least some of the data, making the overall statement TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about Durham University is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"overall, durham university have the best rank, i.e., 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\"\n\nBreaking this down, the key points are:\n- Durham University's rank is claimed to be 80th.\n- This ranking is under the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" column.\n\nI'll start by locating Durham University in the table. Looking at the \"members\" column, I see that Durham University is listed as the second entry (row index 1).\n\nNext, I need to check the relevant column for the ranking. The claim refers to the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" category. In the table, the corresponding column is labeled \"world rank by the - wur , 2013.\"\n\nLooking at that cell for Durham University, it shows \"80th.\" This matches exactly with what the claim states.\n\nNow, to ensure there's no mistake, I'll cross-verify this with other universities in the same category. For example:\n- Dartmouth College is ranked 126th.\n- Queens University and University of Otago are both ranked between 226th and 250th.\n- The University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked between 201st and 225th.\n- The University of Western Australia is ranked 168th.\n\nComparing all these, Durham University's rank of 80th is indeed the highest (best) among all listed universities in that specific ranking category. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim accurately reflects the data in the table. Durham University is ranked 80th in the \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\" category, which is better than the other entries listed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 1,\n       \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n     }\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"Queen university of Canada have not done as well as dartmouth college in all 3 category.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It says that Queen University hasn't performed as well as Dartmouth College in all three categories. From the table, the categories are world rank by WUR (2013), world rank by ARWU (2013), and world rank by QS (2013). So I need to compare each of these rankings between Queen University and Dartmouth.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Dartmouth College is in row 0.\n- Queens University is in row 2.\n\nLet's extract their rankings for each category.\n\nFor Dartmouth:\n- WUR: 126th\n- ARWU: 151 - 200th\n- QS: 113th\n\nFor Queen University:\n- WUR: 226 - 250th\n- ARWU: 201 - 300th\n- QS: 189th\n\nNow, comparing each category:\n\n1. WUR: Dartmouth is 126th vs Queen's 226-250th. So Dartmouth is better.\n2. ARWU: Dartmouth is 151-200th vs Queen's 201-300th. Again, Dartmouth is better.\n3. QS: Dartmouth is 113th vs Queen's 189th. Dartmouth is better here too.\n\nSo in all three categories, Dartmouth has a higher (better) rank than Queen University. The claim states that Queen hasn't done as well as Dartmouth in all three categories. Since this is true for each category, the overall claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list the relevant cells from the table that were used to make this determination. For each university and each category:\n\n- Dartmouth's WUR: row 0, column \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"\n- Dartmouth's ARWU: row 0, column \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"\n- Dartmouth's QS: row 0, column \"world rank by qs , 2013\"\n\nAnd similarly for Queen University:\n\n- Queen's WUR: row 2, same column as above\n- Queen's ARWU: row 2, same column\n- Queen's QS: row 2, same column\n\nSo the relevant cells are all these six cells.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "university of western australia do better , overall than durham university despite it 's late date of establishment",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"university of western australia do better, overall than durham university despite it's late date of establishment.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim.\n\n1. **Performance Comparison**: University of Western Australia (UWA) is claimed to perform better overall than Durham University.\n2. **Establishment Date Context**: Despite UWA being established later than Durham.\n\nLooking at the table, both universities have their ranks listed across three ranking systems: WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013.\n\nLet me compare each rank:\n\n- **World Rank by WUR (2013)**:\n  - UWA is ranked 168th.\n  - Durham is ranked 80th. So in this category, Durham is better.\n\n- **World Rank by ARWU (2013)**:\n  - UWA is ranked 91st.\n  - Durham falls into the 201-300th range. Here, UWA is significantly better than Durham.\n\n- **World Rank by QS (2013)**:\n  - UWA is at 134th place.\n  - Durham is at 90th. Again, Durham outperforms here.\n\nNow, considering \"overall\" performance: it's a bit subjective whether to average the ranks or consider how many times one institution is better than the other across different rankings.\n\nLooking at individual rankings:\n- UWA is better in ARWU (91st vs 201-300th)\n- Durham is better in WUR (80th vs 168th) and QS (90th vs 134th)\n\nSo, depending on the weight given to each ranking, one could argue that UWA does slightly better in ARWU but worse in the other two. However, it's not clear if \"overall\" implies a sum or an average.\n\nBut let me think again: maybe the claim is about which university is considered 'better' overall, considering all three rankings collectively. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each ranking is equally weighted, and we can count how many times UWA outperforms Durham. In this case:\n- ARWU: UWA better\n- WUR: Durham better\n- QS: Durham better\n\nSo, only one out of three cases where UWA does better. That might not support the claim that UWA is overall better.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach: for each university, sum their ranks across all three ranking systems and see which has a lower total (since lower rank number is better).\n\nLet's compute:\n\n- For Durham:\n  WUR: 80\n  ARWU: let's take the midpoint of 201-300, say 250.5\n  QS:90\n  Total: 80 + 250.5 + 90 = 420.5\n\n- For UWA:\n  WUR:168\n  ARWU:91\n  QS:134\n  Total: 168+91+134= 393\n\nComparing totals, 393 vs 420.5. Lower total means better overall performance. So UWA's total is lower than Durham's, suggesting it does perform better overall.\n\nBut wait, this method assumes equal weightage and that all ranking systems are directly comparable, which may not be accurate as each ranking uses different criteria.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to being 'better' in more rankings or if any single ranking where UWA is significantly better. But given that ARWU shows a big gap between UWA (91) and Durham (201-300), while in other rankings, the gaps are smaller.\n\nSo, considering that in one of three major rankings, UWA is much higher than Durham, perhaps it's enough to say overall they do better. But I'm not entirely sure if this approach is correct because two out of three rankings show Durham as better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"overall\" refers to the sum or average position across all rankings. If we take that into account:\n\nDurham's average rank:\n(80 + 250.5 +90)/3 = (420.5)/3 \u2248140.17\n\nUWA's average rank:\n(168+91+134)/3= 393/3=131.\n\nSo UWA has a lower average, thus better overall performance. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that University of Western Australia (UWA) performs better overall than Durham University despite being established later. By examining each ranking:\n\n- **WUR 2013**: Durham (80th) > UWA (168th)\n- **ARWU 2013**: UWA (91st) > Durham (201-300th)\n- **QS 2013**: Durham (90th) > UWA (134th)\n\nWhile UWA is better in one ranking, Durham is better in two. However, considering the average rank across all three rankings:\n\n- Durham's average \u2248140.17\n- UWA's average = 131\n\nA lower average indicates better overall performance. Thus, UWA does better overall.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe claim states: \"give how it have have a great headstart, university of t\u00fcbingen, germany have not do as well as the other university, overall.\"\n\nHmm, okay. So the claim is suggesting that despite having a great headstart (which I assume refers to being established much earlier), the University of T\u00fcbingen hasn't performed as well as the others in terms of world rankings.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns for this comparison would be the \"world rank by the - wur 2013\", \"world rank by arwu 2013\", and \"world rank by qs 2013\". The claim is about overall performance across these rankings.\n\nFirst, let's check the establishment year of University of T\u00fcbingen. It was established in 1477, which is indeed much earlier than most others except maybe none here. So it does have a significant headstart compared to other universities listed like Dartmouth (1769), Durham (1832), etc.\n\nNow, looking at the rankings:\n\n- wur (world university ranking) for T\u00fcbingen is 201 - 225th\n- arwu for T\u00fcbingen is 151 - 200th\n- qs for T\u00fcbingen is 144th\n\nLet's compare these to other universities:\n\nDartmouth:\n- wur: 126th\n- arwu: 151 - 200th\n- qs: 113th\n\nDurham:\n- wur: 80th\n- arwu: 201 - 300th\n- qs:90th\n\nQueens University:\n- wur: 226-250th\n- arwu:201-300th\n- qs:189th\n\nUniversity of Otago:\n- wur:226-250th\n- arwu:201 -300th\n- qs:155th\n\nUWA:\n- wur:168th\n- arwu:91st\n- qs:134th\n\nComparing T\u00fcbingen's ranks to others:\n\nIn wur, T\u00fcbingen is 201-225th. Dartmouth is higher at 126th, Durham at 80th, UWA at 168th. So in wur, T\u00fcbingen isn't as high.\n\nIn arwu, T\u00fcbingen is 151-200th, which is better than Queens and Otago (201-300th), but worse than Dartmouth (same range) and much worse than UWA at 91st. So here, it's not the best.\n\nIn qs, T\u00fcbingen is 144th. Others are lower except Durham (90th) and UWA (134th). Wait, so in qs, T\u00fcbingen is better than Queens (189), Otago (155), Dartmouth (113), but worse than Durham (90) and UWA (134).\n\nSo overall, comparing across all three rankings:\n\n- In wur: Lower rank than Dartmouth, Durham, UWA\n- In arwu: Better than Queens, Otago; same as Dartmouth; worse than UWA\n- In qs: Higher than Queens, Otago; lower than Dartmouth, Durham, UWA\n\nSo overall, across all three, T\u00fcbingen doesn't seem to be doing better than the others. For example, in arwu, it's better than some but worse than others. Overall, considering all rankings, perhaps it hasn't done as well compared to universities with less headstart.\n\nTherefore, the claim that despite having a great headstart (being older), T\u00fcbingen hasn't performed as well overall seems supported by the data.\n</think>\n\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen's world ranks are not better than several other universities in all three ranking systems. For example, Dartmouth has higher wur and qs rankings, while UWA leads in arwu. Thus, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided. It has columns for members, country, year established, and three different world ranks from 2013: WUR, ARWU, and QS. Each row corresponds to a university with their respective data.\n\nThe claim compares Dartmouth College and the University of T\u00fcbingen in terms of ranking. So I need to find the rankings for both institutions across all the ranking systems mentioned.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Dartmouth College is listed first (row index 0). Their ranks are:\n  - WUR: 126th\n  - ARWU: 151-200th\n  - QS: 113th\n\n- University of T\u00fcbingen is in the fifth row (row index 4). Their ranks are:\n  - WUR: 201-225th\n  - ARWU: 151-200th\n  - QS: 144th\n\nNow, comparing each ranking:\n\n1. **WUR Rank**:\n   Dartmouth is at 126th, while T\u00fcbingen is between 201-225th. So Dartmouth is higher here.\n\n2. **ARWU Rank**:\n   Both are in the same range: 151-200th. Therefore, they're tied or similar in this ranking.\n\n3. **QS Rank**:\n   Dartmouth is at 113th, and T\u00fcbingen is at 144th. Again, Dartmouth is higher here.\n\nThe claim states that Dartmouth has never ranked higher than T\u00fcbingen. But according to the WUR and QS rankings, Dartmouth actually ranks higher in both cases. So the claim is incorrect because there are instances where Dartmouth's rank is better (i.e., lower numerical value) than T\u00fcbingen's.\n\nI should note which cells were relevant for this comparison.

Let's identify their rows first. \n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Durham University is in row 1.\n- University of Western Australia is in row 5.\n\nNow, I'll check each ranking system for both universities.\n\nStarting with WUR (World University Rankings by WUR) in 2013:\n- Durham: 80th\n- UWA: 168th\n\nHmm, so Durham is ranked higher here than UWA. That's the opposite of what the claim states.\n\nNext, ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities):\n- Durham: 201 - 300th\n- UWA: 91st\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait, actually, for ARWU in the table:\n- Durham is listed as \"201 - 300th\"\n- UWA is listed as \"91st\"\n\nOh, so UWA's rank is better than Durham here because 91st is higher (better) than 201-300.\n\nBut wait, in the first ranking, WUR, UWA was lower. So already, that contradicts the claim of \"do better in all ranking.\"\n\nLet me just double-check:\n\nIn the table:\n- For WUR: Durham is 80th, UWA is 168th. So Durham is higher.\n- ARWU: Durham is 201-300, UWA is 91st. So UWA is better here.\n- QS: Durham is 90th, UWA is 134th. So again, Durham is higher.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the QS ranks:\n\nQS rankings:\n- Durham: 90th\n- UWA: 134th\n\nSo in QS, Durham is better than UWA because 90 is better than 134.\n\nWait, but for ARWU, UWA is 91st while Durham is 201-300. So UWA is better there.\n\nBut the claim says \"do better in all ranking.\" That means UWA has to be higher (better) in all three rankings than Durham.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. WUR: Durham - 80th vs UWA - 168th \u2192 Durham better\n2. ARWU: Durham - 201-300 vs UWA - 91st \u2192 UWA better\n3. QS: Durham - 90th vs UWA - 134th \u2192 Durham better\n\nSo in two rankings, WUR and QS, Durham is better than UWA. Only in ARWU does UWA perform better.\n\nTherefore, the claim that UWA \"do better in all ranking\" is not true because they didn't do better in all three; they did worse in two of them.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the establishment year: Durham was established in 1832, while UWA was established in 1911. So UWA is indeed newer (later) than Durham.\n\nBut since UWA doesn't have a better rank in all systems, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that University of Western Australia (UWA) has better rankings across all three ranking systems compared to Durham University, despite being established later. However, upon examining each ranking:\n\n- **WUR 2013**: Durham is ranked higher than UWA (80th vs. 168th).\n- **ARWU 2013**: UWA is ranked higher than Durham (91st vs. 201-300th).\n- **QS 2013**: Durham is ranked higher than UWA (90th vs. 134th).\n\nSince UWA does not have a better rank in all systems, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the  wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the  wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim about Durham University is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, the claim states: \"durham university have the second-best rank, i.e., 80th, in the world rank by - wur 2013 category.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying the relevant information from the table. The columns present are:\n\n- members\n- country\n- year established\n- world rank by the - wur , 2013\n- world rank by arwu , 2013\n- world rank by qs , 2013\n\nThe claim is specifically about the \"world rank by wur 2013\" category. So, I'll focus on that column.\n\nNext, looking at each row:\n\n1. Dartmouth College: 126th in WUR.\n2. Durham University: 80th in WUR.\n3. Queens University: 226-250th in WUR.\n4. University of Otago: 226-250th in WUR.\n5. University of T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th in WUR.\n6. University of Western Australia: 168th in WUR.\n\nNow, I need to see where Durham's rank stands. The claim says it's the second-best. Let me list all the ranks:\n\n- 80th (Durham)\n- 126th\n- 168th\n- 201-225th\n- 226-250th\n\nLooking at these, the highest rank is the best position because lower numbers mean better rankings. So the order from best to worst is:\n\n1. 80th (Durham)\n2. 126th (Dartmouth)\n3. 168th (Western Australia)\n4. 201-225th (T\u00fcbingen)\n5. 226-250th (Queens, Otago)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no: in university rankings, lower numbers are better. So the best rank is the smallest number.\n\nSo, from the table:\n\nDurham is at 80th, Dartmouth at 126th, Western Australia at 168th, T\u00fcbingen at 201-225th, and Queens/Otago at 226-250th.\n\nTherefore, the ranks in order are:\n\n1. Durham: 80th\n2. Dartmouth: 126th\n3. Western Australia: 168th\n4. T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n5. Queens/Otago: 226-250th\n\nWait, but the claim says Durham has the second-best rank. But according to this, Durham is actually the best with 80th.\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake. Let me list all the universities and their WUR ranks:\n\n- Dartmouth: 126\n- Durham: 80\n- Queens: 226-250\n- Otago: 226-250\n- T\u00fcbingen: 201-225\n- Western Australia: 168\n\nSo the ranks in order from best to worst (i.e., lowest number first):\n\n1. Durham: 80\n2. Dartmouth: 126\n3. Western Australia: 168\n4. T\u00fcbingen: 201-225\n5. Queens/Otago: 226-250\n\nSo, the best rank is Durham at 80th, followed by Dartmouth at 126th.\n\nThe claim says Durham has the second-best rank (80th). But according to this, Durham actually has the best rank, not the second. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it's stating that 80th is the second-best, when in fact it's the highest (best) rank in the table.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term \"second-best.\" Let me clarify: if there are six universities listed, and Durham has the best rank at 80th, then the next would be Dartmouth at 126th as second. So, if someone says Durham is second, that's incorrect because it's actually first.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Durham University has the second-best rank (80th) in WUR 2013 is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Durham University has the second-best rank of 80th in the WUR 2013 category. However, according to the table, Durham University actually holds the highest rank at 80th, making it the best among the listed universities. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"Queen university of Canada have do better than dartmouth college in all 3 category\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure and the data provided. The table has columns for members, country, year established, and three world ranks from different ranking organizations: WUR 2013, ARWU 2013, and QS 2013.\n\nThe claim is about comparing Queen University of Canada with Dartmouth College across all three categories. So I need to look at each of the three ranking columns for both universities.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Dartmouth College (row index 0) has ranks: WUR 126th, ARWU 151-200th, QS 113th.\n- Queen University (row index 2) has ranks: WUR 226-250th, ARWU 201-300th, QS 189th.\n\nNow, let's compare each category:\n\n1. **WUR Rank**: Dartmouth is 126th, Queen is 226-250th. So Dartmouth is better here.\n2. **ARWU Rank**: Dartmouth is 151-200th, Queen is 201-300th. Again, Dartmouth is better.\n3. **QS Rank**: Dartmouth is 113th, Queen is 189th. Dartmouth is better here too.\n\nSince Queen University doesn't perform better in any of the three categories compared to Dartmouth College, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI also need to identify the relevant cells from the table that were used for this comparison. The relevant rows are 0 (Dartmouth) and 2 (Queen), with each of the three ranking columns.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because Queen University does not have a better rank than Dartmouth in any category.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "university of t\u00fcbingen , germany have rank the worst in every single ranking",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the University of T\u00fcbingen is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says that \"University of t\u00fcbingen, germany have rank the worst in every single ranking.\" \n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The columns are: members, country, year established, and then three different world rankings from 2013: WUR, ARWU, QS. Each of these has a specific rank for each university.\n\nI need to check if University of T\u00fcbingen is ranked the worst in all three rankings listed. Let's find the row for University of T\u00fcbingen. Looking at the table:\n\n- The university is in row index 4 (since counting starts from 0, so dartmouth is 0, durham 1, queens 2, otago 3, t\u00fcbingen 4).\n- Now, let's check each ranking for this university.\n\nFor WUR: It shows \"201 - 225th\". That means they are ranked between 201 and 225.\nARWU: They have \"151 - 200th\".\nQS: Their rank is \"144th\".\n\nNow, to see if they are the worst in every ranking. Let's compare each of their ranks with all other universities in the same columns.\n\nLooking at WUR:\n- Dartmouth: 126th\n- Durham: 80th\n- Queens: 226-250th\n- Otago: 226-250th\n- T\u00fcbingen: 201-225th\n- UWA: 168th\n\nSo in WUR, the worst rank is Queens and Otago at 226-250. So T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst here; they are better than Queens and Otago.\n\nARWU:\n- Dartmouth: 151-200\n- Durham: 201-300\n- Queens: 201-300\n- Otago: 201-300\n- T\u00fcbingen: 151-200\n- UWA: 91st\n\nIn ARWU, the worst are Durham, Queens, and Otago at 201-300. So again, T\u00fcbingen isn't the worst.\n\nQS:\n- Dartmouth: 113th\n- Durham: 90th\n- Queens: 189th\n- Otago: 155th\n- T\u00fcbingen: 144th\n- UWA: 134th\n\nIn QS, the worst is Queens at 189. So T\u00fcbingen is better than Queens but worse than others like Dartmouth, Durham, and UWA.\n\nSo in none of the rankings is T\u00fcbingen the absolute worst. They are above some universities in each ranking. Therefore, the claim that they have the worst rank in every single ranking is false.\n</think>\n\nThe University of T\u00fcbingen does not hold the worst rank in all three rankings provided. In each ranking, there are universities with lower (worse) ranks than T\u00fcbingen.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by the - wur , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by arwu , 2013\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"world rank by qs , 2013\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
