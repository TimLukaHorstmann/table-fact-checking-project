    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"on july 14 1979 at vfl park, the away team geelong score 11.12 (78)\".\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row of the table to find a match for July 14, 1979 and VFL Park. Scanning the 'date' column, I see that the first five rows are from \"14 july 1979\", while the last one is on the 15th.\n\nNext, in those five rows, I need to find where the venue is \"vfl park\". The fifth row under the 'venue' column says \"vfl park\". Now, checking this row: home team is hawthorn with a score of 11.13 (79), and away team is geelong with 11.12 (78). This matches exactly what the claim states about Geelong's score.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data in that specific row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"richmond 's play against the away team geelong to a crowd of 20777 at the western oval on july 14 1979.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down each part of the claim and check it against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six rows. Each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the claim mentions Richmond playing against Geelong as the away team. So I need to find if there's a row where Richmond is the home team and Geelong is the away team.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. The first row: Home team is Melbourne vs South Melbourne. Not relevant.\n2. Second row: Footscray vs St Kilda. Not relevant.\n3. Third row: Collingwood vs North Melbourne. No.\n4. Fourth row: Carlton vs Essendon. No.\n5. Fifth row: Hawthorn vs Geelong. Wait, here the home team is Hawthorn and away is Geelong. The crowd is 20777 at VFL Park on July 14, 1979.\n\nNow, the claim says it's Richmond playing against Geelong at Western Oval with a crowd of 20777 on the same date. But according to the table, it's Hawthorn vs Geelong at VFL Park, not Western Oval. The crowd for that game is indeed 20777.\n\nSo, checking each part:\n\n- Home team: Claim says Richmond; Table shows Hawthorn.\n- Away team: Both say Geelong. That matches.\n- Venue: Claim says Western Oval; Table shows VFL Park. Doesn't match.\n- Crowd: Both mention 20777. That's correct.\n- Date: Both are July 14, 1979.\n\nBut since the home team and venue don't match the claim, it's incorrect. The claim incorrectly attributes this game to Richmond at Western Oval, but according to the table, it was Hawthorn at VFL Park. So the overall statement is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Richmond played against Geelong with a crowd of 20777 at Western Oval on July 14, 1979. Checking the relevant row (index 5), the home team is Hawthorn, not Richmond, and the venue is VFL Park, not Western Oval.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
