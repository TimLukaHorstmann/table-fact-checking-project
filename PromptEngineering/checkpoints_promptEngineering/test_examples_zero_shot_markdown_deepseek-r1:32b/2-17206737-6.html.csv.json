    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the montreal canadiens be the visitor on december 27, 29, and 30\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table structure. The relevant columns here are 'date' and 'visitor'. Each row represents a game with details like date, visitors, home team, etc.\n\nThe claim specifies three dates: December 27, 29, and 30. For each of these dates, I need to check if \"montreal canadiens\" is listed as the visitor in those rows.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **December 27**: The row for this date shows 'visitor' as \"pittsburgh penguins\". So, Montreal Canadiens are not visitors here; they're the home team.\n2. **December 29**: In this row, the visitor is \"florida panthers\", so again, Montreal isn't visiting.\n3. **December 30**: Here, the visitor is \"tampa bay lightning\". Once more, Montreal isn't listed as visitors.\n\nSince on all three specified dates, Montreal Canadiens are not the visitors but rather the home team, the claim doesn't hold true. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells checked are the 'visitor' column for each of the mentioned dates.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because on December 27, 29, and 30, Montreal Canadiens were the home team, not visitors.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"the montreal canadiens be the home team at least 5 times\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's asking whether the Montreal Canadiens were the home team in at least five games listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a game with details like date, visitor, score, home team, etc. The column named \"home\" indicates which team was the home team for that particular game.\n\nI'll go through each row and check if the \"home\" column is \"montreal canadiens\". Let's count how many times this occurs.\n\nRow 0: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count = 1.\nRow 1: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count = 2.\nRow 2: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count = 3.\nRow 3: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count =4.\nRow 4: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count=5.\nRow 5: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count=6.\nRow 6: Visitor is Montreal Canadiens; home is Carolina Hurricanes. So no change.\nRow 7: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count=7.\nRow 8: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count=8.\nRow 9: Home is Montreal Canadiens. Count=9.\nRow 10: Visitor is Montreal Canadiens; home is Pittsburgh Penguins. No count.\nRow 11: Visitor is Montreal Canadiens; home is Florida Panthers. No count.\nRow 12: Visitor is Montreal Canadiens; home is Tampa Bay Lightning. No count.\n\nSo, counting all the rows where \"home\" is Montreal Canadiens:\n\nRows 0-5 are home games (6 times). Then rows 7-9 also have them as home (3 more), making a total of 9 times.\n\nSince the claim says \"at least 5 times\", and we've found they were home in 9 instances, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list all the rows where the \"home\" column shows Montreal Canadiens. Each of these contributes to meeting or exceeding the claim's threshold. So each row from 0-5 (indexes 0 to 5) and 7-9 (indexes 7 to 9). \n\nWait, but in the table provided, row indices go from 0 to 12. Let me recount:\n\nRows where home is Montreal Canadiens:\nRow 0: yes\nRow 1: yes\nRow 2: yes\nRow 3: yes\nRow 4: yes\nRow 5: yes\nRow 7: yes\nRow 8: yes\nRow 9: yes\n\nThat's a total of 9 rows.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here with a bunch of hockey game data. The claim is that \"21273 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. The claim says that there was an attendance of 21,273 people at 9 different games. So, I'm looking for how many times the number 21273 appears in the 'attendance' column of the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has columns like date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, and points. The relevant column here is 'attendance.' Each row represents a game, so each row's attendance value tells me how many people were there for that particular game.\n\nNow, I'll go through each row one by one and check the 'attendance' number. Let's list them out:\n\n1. December 2: 21273\n2. December 4: 21273\n3. December 6: 21273\n4. December 9: 21273\n5. December 11: 21273\n6. December 13: 21273\n7. December 16: 16434 (different)\n8. December 18: 21273\n9. December 20: 21273\n10. December 21: 21273\n11. December 27: 17132 (different)\n12. December 29: 20741 (different)\n13. December 30: 20454 (different)\n\nWait, so let's count how many times 21273 appears. From row 0 to row 5, that's six games with 21273 attendance. Then rows 8,9, and 10 also have 21273\u2014so that adds three more, making it a total of nine games where the attendance was exactly 21,273.\n\nSo yes, there are 9 games where the attendance was 21,273. That matches the claim perfectly. Each occurrence is in the 'attendance' column across different rows. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"less than 21273 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game.\" \n\nFirst, I should understand what each part means. The key points here are:\n1. Attendance less than 21273.\n2. This happened in only 4 games.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column named \"attendance\" which shows how many people attended each game. My task is to count how many times the attendance was below 21273.\n\nLet me go through each row and check the attendance:\n\n- December 2: 21273 (not less)\n- December 4: 21273 (not less)\n- December 6: 21273 (not less)\n- December 9: 21273 (not less)\n- December 11: 21273 (not less)\n- December 13: 21273 (not less)\n- December 16: 16434 (this is less than 21273) \u2192 count 1\n- December 18: 21273 (not less)\n- December 20: 21273 (not less)\n- December 21: 21273 (not less)\n- December 27: 17132 (less) \u2192 count 2\n- December 29: 20741 (less) \u2192 count 3\n- December 30: 20454 (less) \u2192 count 4\n\nWait, that's four instances where attendance was below 21273.

The claim says \"only 4 of the game,\" which matches exactly what I found. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells for each of these instances:\n\n- December 16 (row 6): column attendance\n- December 27 (row 10): attendance\n- December 29 (row 11): attendance\n- December 30 (row 12): attendance\n\nWait a second, I might have miscounted the row indexes.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"over 40 points be score for at least 3 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that in at least three games, the team scored more than 40 points. Looking at the table, each row represents a game, and there's a column called \"points.\" So I should check the \"points\" column for each row to see if it exceeds 40.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n1. December 2: Points = 32 (not over 40)\n2. December 4: Points = 34 (no)\n3. December 6: 35\n4. December 9: 37\n5. December 11: 37\n6. December 13: 37\n7. December 16: 37\n8. December 18: 39 (still below)\n9. December 20: 41 (this is over 40, so that's one game)\n10. December 21: 42 (another one over 40)\n11. December 27: 44\n12. December 29: 46\n13. December 30: 48\n\nNow, counting how many times the points are over 40:\n\n- December 20: 41 \u2192 Yes (row index 8)\n- December 21: 42 \u2192 Yes (row index 9)\n- December 27: 44 \u2192 Yes (row index 10)\n- December 29: 46 \u2192 Yes (row index 11)\n- December 30: 48 \u2192 Yes (row index 12)\n\nWait, actually, starting from row indices:\n\nThe table rows are numbered from 0 to 12. Let me recount each point value:\n\nRow 0: 32 \u2192 No\nRow 1: 34 \u2192 No\nRow 2: 35 \u2192 No\nRow 3: 37 \u2192 No\nRow 4: 37 \u2192 No\nRow 5: 37 \u2192 No\nRow 6: 37 \u2192 No\nRow 7: 39 \u2192 No\nRow 8: 41 \u2192 Yes (First over 40)\nRow 9: 42 \u2192 Second\nRow 10: 44 \u2192 Third\nRow 11: 46 \u2192 Fourth\nRow 12: 48 \u2192 Fifth\n\nSo, there are five games where the points exceed 40. The claim requires at least three such games, which is definitely met.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\nEach of these rows (8 to 12) has a \"points\" value over 40.

Let me start by understanding what each part of the table represents and how it relates to the claim.\n\nFirst, looking at the table columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, points. The key columns for this claim are 'visitor' and 'home'. The claim is about whether Philadelphia Flyers were the home team at least five times in the given data.\n\nI'll go through each row to see how many times \"philadelphia flyers\" appear under the 'home' column. Let's look at each row one by one:\n\n1. December 2: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n2. December 4: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n3. December 6: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n4. December 9: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n5. December 11: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n6. December 13: Home is Montreal Canadiens.\n7. December 16: Home is Carolina Hurricanes.\n8.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"16434 crowd be in attendance for 9 of the game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says that the attendance was 16,434 for 9 games. So, I'm looking for how many times the 'attendance' column has the value 16434 and if that count equals 9.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. The relevant column here is \"attendance\". Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n- Row 0: Attendance is 21273\n- Row 1: 21273\n- Row 2: 21273\n- Row 3: 21273\n- Row 4: 21273\n- Row 5: 21273\n- Row 6: Attendance is 16434 (this is the first occurrence)\n- Row 7: 21273\n- Row 8: 21273\n- Row 9: 21273\n- Row 10: 17132\n- Row 11: 20741\n- Row 12: 20454\n\nWait, looking again at row indices. Let me recount:\n\nThe table has rows from December 2 to December 30. Let's list all the attendance figures with their respective row indices.\n\nRow 0: Dec 2 - Attendance 21273\nRow 1: Dec 4 - 21273\nRow 2: Dec 6 - 21273\nRow 3: Dec 9 - 21273\nRow 4: Dec 11 - 21273\nRow 5: Dec 13 - 21273\nRow 6: Dec 16 - 16434 (this is the first time)\nRow 7: Dec 18 - 21273\nRow 8: Dec 20 - 21273\nRow 9: Dec 21 - 21273\nRow 10: Dec 27 - 17132\nRow 11: Dec 29 - 20741\nRow 12: Dec 30 - 20454\n\nSo, in the entire table, attendance of 16434 occurs only once, on row 6 (December 16). Therefore, the claim that there were 16,434 attendees for 9 games is incorrect. The correct count is just one game.\n\nHence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"less than 17132 crowd be in attendance for only 4 of the game.\" \n\nFirst, let me understand what this means. It's saying that there are exactly four games where the attendance was less than 17,132 people.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant column is \"attendance.\" I'll go through each row and check the attendance numbers.\n\nLet me list out all the attendances:\n\n1. December 2: 21,273\n2. December 4: 21,273\n3. December 6: 21,273\n4. December 9: 21,273\n5. December 11: 21,273\n6. December 13: 21,273\n7. December 16: 16,434\n8. December 18: 21,273\n9. December 20: 21,273\n10. December 21: 21,273\n11. December 27: 17,132\n12. December 29: 20,741\n13. December 30: 20,454\n\nNow, I need to count how many of these are less than 17,132.\n\nLooking at each value:\n\n- All from Dec 2 to Dec 6: above 17k.\n- Dec 9: same as others, still above.\n- Dec 16: 16,434 which is below 17,132. So that's one game.\n- Dec 18 and onwards until Dec 20: all above again.\n- Dec 27: exactly 17,132. Wait, the claim says \"less than,\" so this doesn't count because it's equal to 17k, not less.\n- The rest are all above.\n\nSo only December 16 has an attendance below 17,132. That's just one game, but the claim states that there were four such games. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, I'll note which cells I checked: all rows in the 'attendance' column. Since we're looking for any occurrence where attendance <17132, each row's attendance needs to be considered.\n</think>\n\nThe claim says there are 4 games with less than 17,132 attendance, but only one game meets that condition.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"over 40 points be score for at least 5 game\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's saying that in more than 5 games, the team scored over 40 points. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit unclear. The phrase \"over 40 point be score for at least 5 game\" might mean that there are at least 5 games where the team scored over 40 points. So I need to check if there are five instances in the table where the points are above 40.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played by the Montreal Canadiens. The relevant column here is \"points.\" Each row has a value under this column which shows how many points the team had after that particular game. \n\nI'll go through each row and note down the points:\n\n1. December 2: 32 points\n2. December 4: 34 points\n3. December 6: 35 points\n4. December 9: 37 points\n5. December 11: 37 points\n6. December 13: 37 points\n7. December 16: 37 points\n8. December 18: 39 points\n9. December 20: 41 points\n10. December 21: 42 points\n11. December 27: 44 points\n12. December 29: 46 points\n13. December 30: 48 points\n\nNow, I need to find how many of these are over 40. Let's see:\n\n- Row 9 (December 20): 41 \u2192 over 40\n- Row 10 (December 21): 42 \u2192 over 40\n- Row 11 (December 27): 44 \u2192 over 40\n- Row 12 (December 29): 46 \u2192 over 40\n- Row 13 (December 30): 48 \u2192 over 40\n\nSo that's five games where the points are above 40. Therefore, the claim is true.\n\nI should also note which rows and columns were relevant for this check. The \"points\" column in each of these rows from December 20 to December 30 have values over 40, contributing to at least five instances. So, I'll list all these row indices along with the \"points\" column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is true because there are at least five games where the team scored over 40 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
