    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if the claim \"it be 54.2 in arizona, new mexico, and utah during 1989\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are reservation, location, and then years from 1969 to 2000 in increments of about ten years each. So, for each reservation, there's a corresponding location and values for those specific years.\n\nThe claim mentions \"arizona, new mexico, and utah\" as the location, which I think refers to the 'location' column in the table. Looking at the rows, the first row has the Navajo Indian Reservation located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. So that's a match for the locations mentioned.\n\nNext, the claim specifies the year 1989. In the table headers, I see columns labeled '1969', '1979', '1989', '2000'. The 1989 column is present, so that's good.\n\nNow, the value mentioned in the claim is 54.2. Looking at the Navajo Indian Reservation row under the 1989 column, I see the value is indeed 54.2. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nSo putting it all together: The reservation in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah (Navajo) has a value of 54.2 in 1989 according to the table. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nFor the relevant cells, I need to identify which parts of the table support this conclusion. The first row (row_index 0) for the Navajo reservation has both the location and the specific year value. So the relevant columns are 'location' and '1989'.\n\nI should make sure that there's no other row with the same location but a different value, but looking through the table, the only row matching Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah is the first one.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in 1989, the value for the Navajo reservation (located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah) is 54.2. The table confirms this with the exact figures.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1989\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"it be 46.5 in arizona , new mexico , and utah in 2000\". So I need to break this down.\n\nFirst, looking at the table headers, we have columns for each year from 1969 to 2000. The locations are listed under the \"location\" column, and the reservation names are in the first column.\n\nThe claim mentions Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah together. So I should look for a row where the location includes all three of these states. Scanning through the table:\n\n- The first row is Navajo Indian Reservation with location Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\n- The other rows don't have multiple states except Standing Rock which mentions South Dakota and North Dakota.\n\nSo the relevant reservation here is the Navajo one. Now, for the year 2000, looking at the \"2000\" column of that row, it shows 46.5. \n\nThe claim says exactly that: 46.5 in those states (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah) for the year 2000. So it matches.\n\nSo the answer should be TRUE because the data in the table supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2000\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. The claim is: \"it be higher than 54.2 in 1979 in arizona, mexico, and utah.\" \n\nWait a minute, I notice that the claim mentions \"arizona, mexico, and utah.\" Looking at the table, under the 'location' column for the first row, it's listed as \"arizona, new mexico, and utah.\" So there might be a typo in the claim where it says \"mexico\" instead of \"new mexico.\" I'll proceed with that assumption.\n\nNext, I need to parse the claim into its components. The key elements here are:\n- Year: 1979\n- Locations: Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah\n- Value threshold: Higher than 54.2\n\nSo the claim is asserting that in the year 1979, for any reservation located in Arizona, New Mexico, or Utah, the value is higher than 54.2.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table to find the relevant data points. The reservations and their locations are as follows:\n\n1. Navajo Indian Reservation: Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah\n2. Cheyenne River Indian Reservation: South Dakota\n3. Standing Rock Indian Reservation: South Dakota and North Dakota\n4. Crow Indian Reservation: Montana\n5. Wind River Indian Reservation: Wyoming\n6. Pine Ridge Indian Reservation: South Dakota\n7. Fort Peck Indian Reservation: Montana\n8. San Carlos Indian Reservation: Arizona\n\nSo, the reservations located in Arizona, New Mexico, or Utah are:\n- Navajo Indian Reservation (row 0)\n- San Carlos Indian Reservation (row 7)\n\nFor each of these two reservations, I need to check their value in the 1979 column.\n\nLooking at row 0: The 1979 value is 47.3.\nRow 7: The 1979 value is 45.9.\n\nWait a second, both values (47.3 and 45.9) are less than 54.2. That means the claim that \"it be higher than 54.2 in 1979\" for those locations isn't supported by the data. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n- For Navajo Indian Reservation (row 0), the 1979 column.\n- For San Carlos Indian Reservation (row 7), the 1979 column.\n\nThese are the only two rows where the location includes Arizona, New Mexico, or Utah. \n\nSo, compiling this information, the relevant cells are row indices 0 and 7, both under the '1979' column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"1979\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1979\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim is: \"it be 46.5 in arizona, new mexico, and south dakota in 2000.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts. It mentions three locations: Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota. And it says that each of these places had a value of 46.5 in the year 2000.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each row represents an Indian reservation with its corresponding location and values for four different years: 1969, 1979, 1989, and 2000.\n\nI'll start by identifying which reservations are located in Arizona. From the table:\n\n- Navajo Indian Reservation is located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\n- San Carlos Indian Reservation is also in Arizona.\n\nNext, New Mexico: only the Navajo reservation includes New Mexico.\n\nFor South Dakota, checking the locations:\n\n- Cheyenne River Indian Reservation\n- Standing Rock Indian Reservation (shared with North Dakota)\n- Pine Ridge Indian Reservation\n\nNow, I need to find if any of these reservations have a value of 46.5 in the year 2000 column.\n\nLooking at each relevant reservation:\n\n1. Navajo: The 2000 value is 46.5. That's correct for Arizona and New Mexico.\n2. San Carlos: Their 2000 value is 52.6, which doesn't match the claim.\n3. Cheyenne River: Their 2000 value is 42.3. Doesn't match.\n4. Pine Ridge: The 2000 value is 52.8. No match there either.\n\nWait a minute, the claim says \"Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota\" all have 46.5 in 2000. But looking at South Dakota's reservations:\n\n- Cheyenne River: 42.3\n- Standing Rock: 41.2\n- Pine Ridge: 52.8\n\nNone of these are 46.5. So the claim is incorrect because it states that all three locations (Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota) have 46.5 in 2000, but only Arizona via Navajo has 46.5, while the others don't.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. But wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, looking again:\n\n- The claim says \"in arizona, new mexico, and south dakota.\" So does each of these states have a value of 46.5? Or is it that in those locations (maybe referring to the reservation's location) there's a value?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read again: \"it be 46.5 in arizona, new mexico, and south dakota in 2000.\" So perhaps it's saying that each of these states has a value of 46.5? But the table is per reservation, not per state.\n\nSo for Arizona, looking at Navajo and San Carlos reservations:\n\n- Navajo (AZ part) had 46.5\n- San Carlos had 52.6\n\nSo only Navajo's AZ portion matches 46.5. For New Mexico, it's part of Navajo as well, which is correct.\n\nBut for South Dakota, looking at the reservations there:\n\n- Cheyenne River: 42.3 (not 46.5)\n- Pine Ridge: 52.8\n- Standing Rock: 41.2\n\nSo none of these have 46.5 in 2000. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because South Dakota doesn't have a value of 46.5 in any reservation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe \"Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah\" are together for Navajo, but that's not part of the claim. The claim specifically mentions Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota, which aren't all covered by a single reservation.\n\nSo yes, the claim is false because while Navajo has 46.5 in AZ and NM, none of the reservations in SD have that value.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"it be 46.5 in Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota in 2000.\" Checking each location:\n\n- **Arizona**: The Navajo Indian Reservation (row index 0) has a value of 46.5 in the year 2000.\n- **New Mexico**: Also part of the Navajo reservation, which correctly shows 46.5.\n- **South Dakota**: Looking at all reservations in South Dakota:\n  - Cheyenne River (row index 1): 42.3\n  - Standing Rock (row index 2): 41.2\n  - Pine Ridge (row index 5): 52.8\n\nNone of these have a value of 46.5 in the year 2000. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2000\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"2000\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2000\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
