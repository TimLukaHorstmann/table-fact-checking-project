The first part is about having 221 points in 1988 under the 250cc class. The second part states that in 1989, the same player had only 98 points in the same class.\n\nNow, I'll look at the table provided to verify these claims.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For the year 1988:\n  - Class: 250cc\n  - Team: ducados - yamaha\n  - Points: 221\n  - Wins: 3\n\nThis matches the first part of the claim. The player (or team) indeed had 221 points in 1988 under the 250cc class.\n\nNext, for 1989:\n- Class: 250cc\n- Team: ducados - yamaha\n- Points: 98\n- Wins: 0\n\nThis also aligns with the second part of the claim.

I need to verify that in both 1990 and 1991, the team \"duados - yamaha\" was part of the 500cc class and that their points were exactly 121 each year.\n\nLooking at the table structure: it has columns for year, class, team, points, and wins. Each row represents a different year from 1984 to 1993. \n\nLet me scan through the years mentioned in the claim\u20141990 and 1991. \n\nStarting with 1990: I find the row where year is 1990. The class is 500cc, the team is \"duados - yamaha,\" points are 121, and wins are 0.\n\nNext, checking 1991: The corresponding row shows year 1991, class 500cc, team \"duados - yamaha,\" points also 121, and again 0 wins.\n\nSo both years have the same team in the same class with exactly the same number of points. \n\nTherefore, the claim is accurate based on the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

In 1985, the 250cc class had 8 points.\n2. In 1986, the cc class (I think it's a typo and should be 500cc) had only 4 points.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 1985: The row is index 1 (since indexing starts at 0). The year is 1985, class is 250cc. Points are 8. So that part checks out.\n- For 1986: The row is index 2. Year is 1986, class is 500cc (noted as \"500cc\" in the table).

The claim states: \"the year with the most points for the 250cc class be 1988 with a total of 221 point.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table to identify which rows are relevant to the 250cc class. The 'class' column is important here because it specifies whether each entry is for 250cc or 500cc. Scanning through the rows:\n\n- Row 0: 1984, 250cc\n- Row 1: 1985, 250cc\n- Row 3: 1987, 250cc\n- Row 4: 1988, 250cc\n- Row 5: 1989, 250cc\n\nRows 2, 6-10 are for the 500cc class, so I can ignore those since they don't pertain to the claim.\n\nNext, I'll focus on these relevant rows and look at the 'points' column. The goal is to find which year in the 250cc class has the highest points:\n\n- Row 0: Points = 0\n- Row 1: Points = 8\n- Row 3: Points = 46\n- Row 4: Points = 221\n- Row 5: Points = 98\n\nLooking at these values, it's clear that 221 is the highest point total in the 250cc class. The claim attributes this to the year 1988, which corresponds correctly to row index 4 (since counting starts from 0). \n\nI should also verify if there are any other years with higher points than 221 in the 250cc category. Checking each point value again: 0, 8, 46, 98\u2014all are less than 221. Therefore, 1988 is indeed the year with the most points for the 250cc class.\n\nAdditionally, I notice that the claim mentions \"a total of 221 point.\" There's a minor grammatical error here; it should be \"points\" instead of \"point,\" but since we're evaluating factual correctness and not grammatical accuracy, this doesn't affect our determination.\n\nIn summary, all conditions in the claim are correctly supported by the data in the table.

The table has columns: year, class, team, points, and wins. Each row corresponds to a different year from 1984 to 1993.\n\nStarting with the first part of the claim: \"the player have 221 point in 1988 for the 250cc class.\" I need to check if there's an entry for 1988 in the table. Scanning through, yes, row index 4 corresponds to 1988. The class is 250cc, and the points are listed as 221. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, the second part of the claim: \"but only have 78 point in 1989 for the 250cc class.\" I'll look for 1989 in the table. That's row index 5. The class is indeed 250cc, but the points listed are 98, not 78 as claimed. So this part doesn't match.\n\nSince one part of the claim is accurate (221 points in 1988) and the other isn't (it's 98 points in 1989 instead of 78), the entire claim can't be true.

The claim states: \"the year with the most win in the 250cc class with team ducados - yamaha be 1988 with 2 win.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim. It's saying that in the 250cc class, for the team Ducados-Yamaha, the year 1988 had the most wins, which were two wins.\n\nI need to check the table for entries where the class is 250cc and the team is Ducados - Yamaha. Then look at their wins for each of those years.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\n- Row 3: 1987, 250cc, Ducados-Yamaha, points=46, wins=0.\n- Row 4: 1988, 250cc, Ducados-Yamaha, points=221, wins=3.\n- Row 5: 1989, 250cc, Ducados-Yamaha, points=98, wins=0.\n\nWait a second, in 1988, the team has 3 wins. But the claim says there were 2 wins in 1988. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nAlso, looking at other years for Ducados-Yamaha:\n\n- 1984: class is 250cc but team is Yamaha, not Ducados-Yamaha.\n- 1985: same as above, team is JJ Cobas.\n- 1986: 500cc class with Cagiva.\n\nSo the relevant rows are 3,4,5. \n\nIn these rows, the wins for Ducados-Yamaha in 250cc are:\n\n- 1987: 0\n- 1988: 3\n- 1989: 0\n\nThe maximum wins here is 3 in 1988.

Let me take a closer look.\n\nThe claim says: \"team ducados - yamaha have the same number of points in 1990 and 1991 for the 500cc class with 61.\"\n\nFirst, I need to parse each part of this claim carefully. The team in question is Ducados-Yamaha, and the years mentioned are 1990 and 1991. They're talking about the 500cc class, and both years should have 61 points.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan for rows where the team is \"ducatos - yamaha\" and the class is 500cc in the years 1990 and 1991. \n\nStarting with 1990: Row index 7 shows year 1990, team Ducados-Yamaha, 500cc class, points 121. Wait, that's not 61. Then in 1991, row index 8, same team and class, but also 121 points. Hmm, so both years have the same points, but it's 121, not 61.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The claim says \"with 61.\" Looking at row index 9: year 1992, team Ducados-Yamaha, 500cc class, points 61. But that's for 1992, not 1990 or 1991.\n\nSo putting it all together, in 1990 and 1991, Ducados-Yamaha scored 121 points each year. The claim incorrectly states that both years had 61 points, which is wrong because the actual points are higher. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the table.\n\nI should list the relevant cells to back this up: for 1990 and 1991, I'll check the 'points' column in those specific rows.\n</think>\n\nThe team Ducados-Yamaha had 121 points in both 1990 and 1991, not 61.

Let's see what class it belongs to.\n- Row 7 has the year 1991 and the class is listed as \"500cc\", not \"250cc\".\n- Therefore, there's no entry for 1991 in the 250cc class with points.\n\nNext, the second part: \"only 4 points for the 1986cc class.\"\n\nLooking at the year 1986:\n- Row index 2 has the year 1986 and class \"500cc\", not \"86cc\".\n- There's no entry in the table for a \"1986cc\" class. The classes mentioned are either 250cc or 500cc.\n\nSo, both parts of the claim refer to non-existent entries in the table:\n1. There is no 1991 250cc entry.\n2. There's no 1986cc class; instead, it's 500cc for 1986 with 4 points.\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the claim. Let me re-examine: \"the 1991 250cc\" and \"1986cc\". Oh, perhaps the user made a typo. Maybe they meant 1991 500cc and 1986 500cc? But the claim specifically says \"250cc\" for 1991.\n\nLooking again: in 1991, it's indeed 500cc with points as 121. So no 8 points there either. For 1986, it's 500cc with 4 points. But the claim refers to \"1986cc\" which doesn't exist in the table.\n\nSo both statements are incorrect because:\n- The 1991 entry is for 500cc, not 250cc.\n- There's no such class as \"86cc\", but the points for 1986 (which is a year, not a class) in 500cc are indeed 4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing. The claim says \"the 1991 250cc\" which isn't present. It also mentions \"1986cc\", but the table's classes are 250cc and 500cc, with years like 1984 to 1993.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- The first part of the claim is false because there's no 1991 250cc class entry.\n- The second part refers to \"1986cc\", which doesn't exist; however, if it was a typo for 1986 (year) and 500cc, then points are 4, which is correct. But since the claim specifically says \"1986cc\" class, that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are false because:\n1. There is no 250cc entry for 1991.\n2. The term \"1986cc\" isn't a valid class in the table; the closest is the year 1986 with 4 points under 500cc.\n\nSo, the claim is FALSE because both parts are not supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the year with the most point for the 250cc class be 1985 with a total of 221 point.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be checked. The claim has two main parts:\n\n1. It refers to the 250cc class.\n2. In that class, the year with the most points is 1985, and those points amount to 221.\n\nSo, I'll need to look at each row in the table where the \"class\" column is \"250cc\" because that's the category we're interested in. Then, among those rows, find out which year had the highest number of points.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first row (index 0) is for 1984, class 250cc, team Yamaha, with 0 points.\n- Second row (index 1): 1985, 250cc, jj cobas, 8 points.\n- Third row (index 2): 1986, but it's a 500cc class, so we can ignore this.\n- Fourth row (index 3): 1987, 250cc, ducados - yamaha, 46 points.\n- Fifth row (index 4): 1988, 250cc, same team, 221 points. This looks like a high number.\n- Sixth row (index 5): 1989, 250cc, same as above with 98 points.\n- Rows after that are all 500cc classes except for the last two years, which are also 500cc.\n\nSo focusing on the rows where class is 250cc:\n\n- 1984: 0 points\n- 1985: 8 points\n- 1987: 46 points\n- 1988: 221 points\n- 1989: 98 points\n\nNow, looking at the points:\n\nThe highest points in 250cc is clearly 221 in 1988, not 1985. The claim says 1985 has 221 points, but according to row index 4 (1988), it's actually that year which has 221 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because:\n\n- The year with the most points in 250cc isn't 1985; it's 1988.\n- Also, 1985 only had 8 points, as seen in row index 1.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are those where the class is 250cc and we're checking their points. That includes rows 0,1,3,4,5. For each of these rows, I need to look at \"year\" and \"points\".\n\nWait, but for this specific claim, perhaps only certain rows are relevant. The claim mentions 1985 having 221 points in 250cc. So, the cells that directly relate are:\n\n- Row index 1 (1985), which has 8 points.\n- Row index 4 (1988), which has 221 points.\n\nThese are the two rows that show why the claim is false because 1985 doesn't have 221, but 1988 does. So, these are the relevant cells to check.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that in 1985, the 250cc class had 221 points. According to the table, in 1985 (row index 1), they only have 8 points. The highest points for 250cc is actually in 1988 with 221 points.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:** Look at rows where \"class\" is 250cc. These are rows 0 (1984), 1 (1985), 3 (1987), 4 (1988), and 5 (1989).\n\n2. **Check Points for Each Year:**\n   - 1984: 0 points\n   - 1985: 8 points\n   - 1987: 46 points\n   - 1988: 221 points (highest)\n   - 1989: 98 points\n\n3. **Evaluate the Claim:** The claim says 1985 has 221 points, but row index 1 shows only 8. Row index 4 shows 221 in 1988.\n\n**Answer:** FALSE  \n**Relevant Cells:** Rows where class is 250cc and checking \"year\" and \"points\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
