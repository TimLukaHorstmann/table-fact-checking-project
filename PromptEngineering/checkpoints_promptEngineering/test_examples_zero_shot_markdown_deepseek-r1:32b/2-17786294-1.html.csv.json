    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"there be 2 scoreless legs - the second round of rc lens vs rc strasbourg , and the first round of fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais\".\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim into two parts:\n\n1. The second round between RC Lens (d1) and RC Strasbourg (d1) is a scoreless leg.\n2. The first round between FC Nantes (d1) and Olympique Lyonnais (d2) is also a scoreless leg.\n\nNow, I'll check each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor the first part:\n- Find RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg in the second round. Checking row 0: team1 is rc lens, team2 is rc strasbourg. The second round column shows \"0 - 0\". So this leg was scoreless, which matches the claim.\n\nFor the second part:\n- Find FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais in the first round. Looking at row 4: team1 is fc nantes, team2 is olympique lyonnais (d2). The first round column shows \"0 - 0\". So this leg was also scoreless as per the claim.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"as monaco score the most goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france.\"\n\nFirst, looking at the table, each row represents a match between two teams with their scores and some rounds. I see columns like team 1, score, team 2, 1st round, and 2nd round.\n\nThe claim is about AS Monaco scoring the most goals in the round of 16. So, I need to find out which matches are from the round of 16 and then check how many goals each team scored in those matches.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nRow 0: rc lens vs rc strasbourg - score is 1-0\nRow 1: fc rouen vs stade lavallois - score 2-4\nRow 2: as monaco vs as nancy - score 6-1\nRow 3: girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse - score 2-3\nRow 4: fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais - score 4-4\nRow 5: as cannes vs fc sochaux - score 4-1\nRow 6: sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp - score 2-1\nRow 7: fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc - score 5-1\n\nWait, the column names are \"score\" and then \"1st round\", \"2nd round\". So each match has two rounds? Or is it that the overall score includes both rounds?\n\nI think in Coupe de France, matches can go through multiple rounds if there's a draw. The initial match (1st round) might be followed by a second if they tie.\n\nLooking at row 2: as monaco vs as nancy has an overall score of 6-1. Let me check the rounds:\n\n1st round: 2-0\n2nd round: 4-1\n\nSo, in the first round, AS Monaco scored 2 goals and in the second, they scored 4, totaling 6.\n\nNow, I need to see if this is the highest number of goals scored by any team in their respective matches. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: rc lens scored 1, rc strasbourg scored 0\nRow 1: fc rouen scored 2, stade lavallois scored 4\nRow 2: as monaco 6, as nancy 1\nRow 3: girondins de bordeaux 2, fc mulhouse 3\nRow 4: fc nantes 4, olympique lyonnais 4\nRow 5: as cannes 4, fc sochaux 1\nRow 6: sporting toulon var 2, en avant guingamp 1\nRow 7: fc metz 5, besan\u00e7on rc 1\n\nSo looking at the \"score\" column:\n\n- AS Monaco has 6 goals.\n- FC Metz has 5.\n- Others have lower.\n\nTherefore, AS Monaco did score the most in their match. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nRelevant cells are the row where as monaco is team1 (row index 2), and the columns 'score' which shows their total, and also checking both rounds to confirm the total goals.\n\nWait, but do I need to check all the other rows to ensure no other team scored more? Because if any other team has a higher score in their match, then AS Monaco wouldn't have the most. \n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 4: fc nantes and olympique lyonnais both scored 4 each.\n- Row 5: as cannes scored 4.\n- Others are lower.\n\nSo yes, AS Monaco's 6 is higher than others except maybe in their own match, but they have the highest overall. So the relevant cells would be where AS Monaco's score is shown and perhaps other teams' scores to confirm no one else has more.\n\nBut for the initial check, focusing on AS Monaco's row and confirming that their total is 6, which seems higher than others.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that AS Monaco scored the most goals in the round of 16. From the table, AS Monaco's match shows a score of 6-1, which is higher than all other teams' scores in their respective matches.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "in the first leg , only 1 goal be score by an away team : fc mulhouse score 1 against girondin de bordeaux",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"In the first leg, only 1 goal was scored by an away team: fc mulhouse scored 1 against girondin de bordeaux.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It looks like each row is a match between two teams, with their scores and the results of two rounds (maybe legs). The columns are \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\". So, it's possible that this is about a tournament where matches have two legs, each contributing to the overall score.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions the first leg. In the context of football tournaments, a leg usually refers to one part of a match, especially in knockout stages where teams play twice (home and away). The \"1st round\" column probably shows the results of the first leg, while the \"2nd round\" is the second leg.\n\nSo, focusing on the \"1st round\" column, I need to find out how many goals were scored by away teams. But wait, in a two-leg match, each team plays at home once and away once. However, for this claim, it's about the first leg, which would mean one team is playing at home and the other away. \n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\n1. RC Lens vs RC Strasbourg: The 1st round score is 1-0. Team 1 (RC Lens) scored 1, so as an away team, maybe? Wait, no\u2014teams are listed in \"team 1\" and \"team 2\", but their status as home or away isn't explicitly stated. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the table might be structured such that \"team 1\" is playing at home against \"team 2\". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first leg is the away team's performance. Wait, no\u2014the claim says that in the first leg, only one goal was scored by an away team.\n\nSo, perhaps each row represents a two-leg tie. The \"1st round\" would be the first match, and the \"2nd round\" the second. So, for each pair of teams, they play twice: once as home and once as away.\n\nBut without knowing which is home or away in the first leg, it's tricky. However, perhaps I can infer that \"team 1\" is at home in the first leg because it's listed first. That might be a common convention. So, if \"team 1\" is home in the first leg, then \"team 2\" would be away.\n\nSo, for each row:\n\n- The 1st round score is team1_score - team2_score.\n- Team 2 is away in the first leg.\n\nTherefore, any goals scored by team2 in the 1st round are goals by the away team.\n\nLooking at the \"1st round\" column:\n\nRow 0: RC Lens (team1) vs RC Strasbourg (team2). Score: 1-0. So, team1 scored 1, team2 scored 0.\nAway team goals in first leg: 0.\n\nRow 1: FC Rouen (d1) vs Stade Lavallois (d1). 1st round score: 1-0. Team2 is away, so they scored 0.\n\nRow 2: AS Monaco vs AS Nancy. Score: 2-0. Team2 scored 0.\n\nRow3: Girondins de Bordeaux (team1) vs FC Mulhouse (d2). 1st round score: 0-1. So team2 (FC Mulhouse, away) scored 1 goal.\n\nRow4: FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais. Score: 0-0. Team2 scored 0.\n\nRow5: AS Cannes vs FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard. Score:3-0. Team2 is away, so they scored 0.\n\nRow6: Sporting Toulon Var vs En Avant Guingamp. Score:2-0. Team2 (Guingamp) away, scored 0.\n\nRow7: FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on RC. Score:4-0. Team2 scored 0.\n\nSo, looking through all the rows in the \"1st round\" column:\n\nOnly Row3 has team2 scoring a goal (1). So that's one away team goal in the first leg.\n\nThe claim says only 1 goal was scored by an away team in the first leg: FC Mulhouse scored 1 against Girondin de Bordeaux.\n\nSo according to my analysis, this is correct. Only Row3 has an away team scoring a goal in the first leg.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one away team scored in the first leg, specifically FC Mulhouse scoring 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux. By examining each row's \"1st round\" score:\n\n- In Row3, FC Mulhouse (team2) scored 1 goal as the away team.\n\nNo other rows show away teams (team2) scoring goals in the first leg. Thus, the claim is supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine if the claim about FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand the claim: It says that FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais tied on aggregate with a score of 4-4, so they had to decide the match using the away goal rule. I need to check if this is supported by the table data.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match between two teams, their scores in each round (1st and 2nd), and the overall result. The relevant columns here are \"team 1\", \"team 2\", \"score\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\".\n\nI'll scan through each row to find where FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais are playing against each other.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\n- Row 0: rc lens vs rc strasbourg \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 1: fc rouen vs stade lavallois \u2013 nope.\n- Row 2: as monaco vs as nancy \u2013 not our teams.\n- Row 3: girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse \u2013 no.\n- Row 4: fc nantes (d1) vs olympique lyonnais (d2). This is the match we're interested in.\n\nLooking at row 4, let's check the details:\n\n- The overall score is \"4 - 4\". That matches the claim. So aggregate is tied at 4-4.\n  \nNext, the claim mentions that they had to decide by the away goal rule. To determine if this applies, I need to look at each round.\n\nIn the 1st round: It's \"0 - 0\", so no goals scored in either team's home game.\nIn the 2nd round: The score is also \"4 - 4\". Wait, that doesn't make sense. Usually, the second round would be a different match or possibly an aggregate of both rounds.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Let me re-examine it:\n\nThe columns are:\n- team 1\n- score (probably overall)\n- team 2\n- 1st round\n- 2nd round\n\nSo for row 4: The overall score is 4-4. The first round was 0-0, and the second round was 4-4.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 0-0 in the first round and then 4-4 in the second would make the total aggregate 4-4? Or perhaps each cell under \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" shows the scores for those specific rounds. So team 1 scored 0 in the 1st round, and 4 in the 2nd; team 2 scored 0 in the 1st and 4 in the 2nd. That would make the total aggregate 4-4.\n\nBut how does this relate to the away goal rule? The away goal rule is applied when teams are tied on aggregate after both legs (both rounds). It's used to determine the winner without going into extra time or penalties, by comparing goals scored away from home.\n\nIn this case, team 1 is FC Nantes (d1), and team 2 is Olympique Lyonnais (d2). In the first round, each team played at home. The scores were 0-0 in both legs? Wait, that can't be right because if they both scored 0 in their respective home games, then there would be no away goals either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the rounds are structured. Let me think again: Each round might refer to each team's home game. So, for example, FC Nantes played Olympique Lyonnais at their home (1st round) and vice versa in the 2nd round.\n\nLooking back at row 4:\n\n- Team 1: FC Nantes (d1)\n- Team 2: Olympique Lyonnais (d2)\n- Score: 4 - 4\n- 1st round: 0 - 0\n- 2nd round: 4 - 4\n\nWait, that still doesn't add up. If in the first leg (FC Nantes vs OL at home), it was 0-0, and then in the second leg (OL vs FC Nantes at their home), it was 4-4? That seems odd because each team's score would be added from both legs.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the table. Maybe each cell under \"1st round\" shows the result of that specific match when they played in the first round, and similarly for the second round.\n\nSo, in row 4:\n\n- In the 1st round, FC Nantes (d1) played at home against Olympique Lyonnais (d2), resulting in a 0-0 draw.\n- Then, in the 2nd round, they played again, and that match resulted in a 4-4 score.\n\nWait, but how? That seems like an unusually high score for a second leg. Alternatively, perhaps each column represents the aggregate after each round. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"score\" column is the aggregate of both rounds, while the \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" columns show the results of each individual match.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- The overall aggregate score is 4-4.\n- In the first leg (played at FC Nantes' home), it was 0-0.\n- In the second leg (played at Olympique Lyonnais' home), it was 4-4.\n\nWait, but that would mean each team scored 4 goals in their away game. That seems unlikely because a single match scoring 4-4 is possible, but having both legs as 0-0 and then 4-4 would make the aggregate 4-4.\n\nIn this case, since it's a tie on aggregate (4-4), they would need to use the away goals rule. The team with more away goals would win.\n\nLooking at the two legs:\n\n- First leg: FC Nantes (home) vs OL (away): 0-0\n- Second leg: OL (home) vs FC Nantes (away): 4-4\n\nIn this case, FC Nantes scored 4 goals in their away game. Olympique Lyonnais also scored 4 goals in their home game but only 0 in the away.\n\nWait, so FC Nantes scored 4 away goals, while OL scored 0 away goals (since they didn't score in the first leg which was their away match). Therefore, FC Nantes would have more away goals and win on that basis.\n\nBut does this align with how the table is structured?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each round's result is as follows:\n\n- 1st round: team 1 (FC Nantes) at home vs team 2 (OL): score was 0-0\n- 2nd round: team 2 (OL) at home vs team 1 (FC Nantes): score was 4-4\n\nSo the aggregate is 4-4, but OL's away goals would be 4, and FC Nantes' away goals would be 4 as well because in the second leg, they were the away team scoring 4.\n\nWait, no: in the first leg (FC Nantes home), OL was the away team and scored 0. In the second leg (OL home), FC Nantes was the away team and scored 4. So FC Nantes have 4 away goals, and OL have 0 away goals (since they didn't score in their away game).\n\nTherefore, FC Nantes would win via away goals because they have more.\n\nBut does that align with how the table is presented? The overall aggregate is 4-4, but in terms of each team's home and away games:\n\nFC Nantes: scored 0 at home (first leg) and 4 away (second leg)\nOL: scored 0 away (first leg) and 4 at home (second leg)\n\nTherefore, FC Nantes have 4 away goals, OL have 0 away goals. So FC Nantes would win on away goals.\n\nBut the claim is that they had to decide via away goal rule. So yes, because the aggregate was tied at 4-4 after both legs, they applied the away goals rule.\n\nTherefore, based on the table data, the claim holds true: it was a tie on aggregate (4-4), and the winner was decided by the away goals, with FC Nantes winning because they scored more away goals than OL.\n\nBut wait, in the table, team 1 is FC Nantes (d1) and team 2 is Olympique Lyonnais (d2). The \"score\" column shows 4-4. Then, in the first round, it's 0-0, second round 4-4.\n\nWait, perhaps each number represents team 1's score vs team 2's score for that round.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst round: FC Nantes (home) vs OL (away): 0-0\nSecond round: OL (home) vs FC Nantes (away): 4-4\n\nThus, the aggregate is 4-4. Now, applying away goals:\n\nFC Nantes scored 4 in their away game.\nOL scored 0 in their away game.\n\nTherefore, FC Nantes have more away goals and win.\n\nSo yes, the situation described in the claim matches with the data provided in the table.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because having two legs both ending 0-0 and then 4-4 seems unusual. It's possible but perhaps less common.\n\nIn any case, based on the given data, the conclusion is that the match was tied at 4-4 on aggregate, and FC Nantes won via the away goals rule by scoring more in their away game.\n</think>\n\nThe task involves analyzing a football match between FC Nantes (d1) and Olympique Lyonnais (d2). The table provided shows the following details:\n\n- **Score**: 4 - 4\n- **1st Round**: 0 - 0\n- **2nd Round**: 4 - 4\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Aggregate Score**: The total score after both rounds is 4-4, indicating a tie.\n2. **First Leg (1st Round)**: FC Nantes played at home against OL, resulting in a 0-0 draw.\n3. **Second Leg (2nd Round)**: OL hosted FC Nantes, and the match ended 4-4.\n\n### Away Goals Rule:\nSince the aggregate score is tied at 4-4, the away goals rule is applied to determine the winner.\n\n- **Away Goals for FC Nantes**: They scored 4 goals in their away game (second round).\n- **Away Goals for OL**: They scored 0 goals in their away game (first round).\n\n### Conclusion:\nFC Nantes won on account of scoring more away goals (4) compared to Olympique Lyonnais, who scored none in their away match.\n\n**Answer:** FC Nantes defeated Olympique Lyonnais with a score of 4-4 on aggregate and won via the away goals rule.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"as monaco score the few goal in the round of 16 in the 1983 - 84 coupe de france\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that AS Monaco scored the fewest goals in the round of 16 during the 1983-84 Coupe de France. So, my task is to check if this statement holds true according to the data in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure: Each row represents a match between two teams, with their scores and the results of the first and second rounds. The columns are \"team 1,\" \"score,\" \"team 2,\" \"1st round,\" and \"2nd round.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying which row corresponds to AS Monaco. Scanning through the table, I see that in the third row, team 1 is \"as monaco (d1)\" and they played against \"as nancy (d1).\" The score for this match is 6 - 1. So, AS Monaco scored 6 goals in total across both rounds.\n\nNext, I need to look at the scores of all other teams in their respective matches during the round of 16 to determine if AS Monaco indeed had the fewest goals scored. Let's go through each row:\n\n1. rc lens vs rc strasbourg: score is 1-0. So, team 1 scored 1 goal.\n2. fc rouen vs stade lavallois: score is 2-4. Team 1 scored 2 goals.\n3. as monaco vs as nancy: score is 6-1. Team 1 (AS Monaco) scored 6 goals.\n4. girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse: score is 2-3. Team 1 scored 2 goals.\n5. fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais: score is 4-4. Both teams scored 4 each.\n6. as cannes vs fc sochaux - montb\u00e9liard: score is 4-1. Team 1 (AS Cannes) scored 4 goals.\n7. sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp: score is 2-1. Team 1 scored 2 goals.\n8. fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc: score is 5-1. Team 1 (FC Metz) scored 5 goals.\n\nNow, compiling the goals scored by each team in their respective matches:\n- RC Lens: 1\n- FC Rouen: 2\n- AS Monaco: 6\n- Girondins de Bordeaux: 2\n- FC Nantes: 4\n- AS Cannes: 4\n- Sporting Toulon Var: 2\n- FC Metz: 5\n\nFrom this, it's clear that the number of goals scored by each team varies. However, looking at these numbers, AS Monaco actually has the highest score with 6 goals in their match against Nancy. On the other hand, RC Lens and others have lower scores.\n\nThe claim states that AS Monaco scored the fewest goals. But according to the table, they scored more than all other teams except for Nancy (which is team 2). So, this contradicts the claim because AS Monaco didn't score the fewest; in fact, they scored the most among team 1s.\n\nTherefore, based on the data provided, the claim is false.

The claim states: \"the highest scoring leg, and highest aggregate score for a match, total 8 goal, with fc nantes vs olympique lyonnaise.\" \n\nFirst, let's parse what the claim is saying. It mentions two things: the highest scoring leg and the highest aggregate score, both involving FC Nantes versus Olympique Lyonnais, totaling 8 goals.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to check for these conditions.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"highest scoring leg.\" Each match has a 1st round and a 2nd round.

The claim says it's 8 goals in total for this match.\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n1. rc lens vs rc strasbourg: Aggregate is (1-0) + (0-0) = 1 goal total.\n2. fc rouen vs stade lavallois: (1-0) + (1-3) \u2192 total 4 goals.\n3. as monaco vs as nancy: (2-0) + (4-1) \u2192 aggregate is 7 goals, which seems high but not 8.\n4. girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse: (0-1) + (2-2) \u2192 total 5 goals.\n5. fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais: (0-0) in the first round and (4-4) in the second, so aggregate is 8 goals. Wait, that's a tie with both legs adding up to 8.\n6. as cannes vs fc sochaux: (3-0) + (1-1) \u2192 total 5 goals.\n7. sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp: (2-0) + (0-1) \u2192 3 goals.\n8. fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc: (4-0) + (1-1) \u2192 6 goals.\n\nSo, the aggregate score for FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais is indeed 8 goals, which seems to be the highest in the table. Now, checking if that's the case for both legs and aggregate.\n\nWait, but looking at as monaco vs as nancy, their aggregate was 6-1, totaling 7 goals. So FC Nantes have 0+4=4 and Olympique Lyonnais have 0+4=4, so total 8 goals combined in the aggregate.\n\nBut I also need to check if any other match has a higher or equal number of goals in either leg or aggregate. For example, as monaco had a 6-1 score, which is a high single-leg score but not necessarily higher than others.\n\nLooking at the legs: The highest-scoring leg (single round) would be as monaco's first round where they scored 2-0 and then 4-1 in the second. Wait, no\u2014the claim says \"highest scoring leg,\" so each leg is a single match. So in the first round of as monaco vs as nancy, it was 2-0 (team1 scored 2). The highest in a single leg might be fc metz's first round with 4-0.\n\nWait, but team1's score in that first leg was 4-0 for fc metz. So that's a high-scoring leg as well. But the claim says it's FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais. However, their legs were 0-0 and 4-4, so each leg had either 0 or 8 goals total? Wait no, in the first leg, they scored 0-0 (total 0) and then 4-4 (total 8). So the second leg of that match was a high-scoring one with 8 goals.\n\nBut I need to check all matches' legs. For example:\n\n- FC Metz vs Besan\u00e7on: First round 4-0, which is 4 goals total in one leg.\n- AS Monaco's second leg was 4-1, totaling 5 goals in that single leg.\n- FC Nantes' second leg was 4-4, so 8 goals in a single leg.\n\nSo the highest-scoring single leg is 8 goals (FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais in the 2nd round). Additionally, their aggregate is also 8 goals (0+4 + 0+4 = 8 total goals).\n\nLooking back at the claim: It mentions both the highest scoring leg and the highest aggregate. Since FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais have both an 8-goal single leg (the second round) and an 8-goal aggregate, this seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, I should check if any other match has a higher aggregate or leg. For example:\n\n- AS Monaco vs AS Nancy: Aggregate is 6-1, which is 7 goals total.\n- FC Metz's first leg was 4-0 (4 goals) but aggregate is 5-1 (6 goals).\n\nSo yes, the claim seems correct as FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais have both an 8-goal single leg and an 8-goal aggregate.\n\nNow, checking which cells are relevant:\n\nThe row for FC Nantes is row index 4. The columns we need are \"score\" and \"aggregate.\" Wait, no, the table shows each round's scores. So to get the total aggregate, I have to sum both legs for that match.\n\nBut in the claim, it mentions both the highest scoring leg (a single round) and the aggregate score across both rounds. Therefore, the relevant cells are:\n\n- For FC Nantes vs Olympique Lyonnais: Their \"score\" column which shows 4-4 aggregate? Wait no\u2014the \"score\" is 4-4 in total but looking at each round:\n\nWait, actually, the table's \"score\" column is the overall result. But to get the legs, I have to look into the \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" columns.\n\nSo for row index 4:\n\n- Column \"team 1\": FC Nantes (d)\n- Column \"score\": 4-4\n- Columns \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\": Both legs are in there. So to get the aggregate, we sum both legs' scores for each team.\n\nBut perhaps the relevant cells for this row are:\n\n- The \"team 1\" is FC Nantes.\n- Their first leg score: 0-0\n- Second leg: 4-4\n\nThus, the total goals in aggregate: (0+4) for FC Nantes and (0+4) for Olympique Lyonnais.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" columns for that row to calculate the single legs and the aggregate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, and the relevant information is found in row 4's first and second rounds.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to verify if FC Nantes vs. Olympique Lyonnais had both the highest-scoring leg (single round) and the highest aggregate score across both rounds. The analysis showed that their second leg was a high-scoring match with 8 goals, and their aggregate was also 8 goals, which is the highest in the table.\n\nThe relevant information can be found in row index 4 of the table, specifically in the \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" columns where both legs are detailed.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine if the claim about FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"fc nantes and fc mulhouse tie on aggregate with a score of 4 - 4, require the match to be decided by the away goal rule.\" \n\nSo, there are two main points here:\n1. Both teams tied at 4-4 on aggregate.\n2. The match required deciding by the away goal rule because of this tie.\n\nNext, I'll look into the table to find information about these two teams. Scanning through the rows, I see that FC Nantes is in row 5, and Girondins de Bordeaux versus FC Mulhouse is in row 4. Wait, no, actually, looking again: \n\n- Row 4 shows FC Nantes (d1) with a score of 4-4 against Olympique Lyonnais (d2). \n- Row 3 has Girondins de Bordeaux (d1) vs FC Mulhouse (d2), and their aggregate is 2-3.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me check again. The claim mentions both teams: FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse. So I need to find a row where these two teams are playing against each other. Looking at the table:\n\nRow 4: Girondins de Bordeaux (d1) vs FC Mulhouse (d2). Their scores in first round were 0-1, and second round 2-2. So total is 2-3.\n\nRow 5: FC Nantes (d1) vs Olympique Lyonnais (d2), with a score of 4-4 on aggregate.\n\nHmm, so in the table, FC Nantes played against Olympique Lyonnais and tied at 4-4. Meanwhile, Girondins de Bordeaux played against FC Mulhouse, resulting in a 3-2 loss for Bordeaux.\n\nWait, that means FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse are not playing each other in this table; they're on different rows. So the claim is talking about them tying, but according to the table, FC Nantes tied with Olympique Lyonnais at 4-4, while FC Mulhouse lost to Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse did not play each other in this context. The aggregate score of 4-4 refers to a different match between FC Nantes and Olympique Lyonnais. \n\nAdditionally, for the away goal rule, it's only applicable if teams are tied on aggregate and have equal goals scored away. But since FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse didn't play each other here, this situation doesn't apply.\n\nSo, based on the table, the claim is FALSE because FC Nantes tied with another team, not FC Mulhouse, and FC Mulhouse lost their match.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that FC Nantes and FC Mulhouse tied 4-4. In reality, FC Nantes tied with Olympique Lyonnais, while FC Mulhouse defeated Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the given claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"there be 2 scoreless legs - the second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais, and the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this claim carefully. It mentions two matches where both rounds were scoreless, meaning no goals were scored in those specific rounds. So I need to check each part of the claim against the table.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"the second round of rc lens vs olympique lyonnais.\" Looking at the table, I see that rc lens is playing against rc strasbourg in row 0. The second round for them has a score of 0-0. However, the claim mentions olympique lyonnais, which isn't paired with rc lens but rather with fc nantes in another row (row 4). So there's an issue here because rc lens is not playing against olympique lyonnais; instead, fc nantes is.\n\nNow checking the second part: \"the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg.\" In row 4, fc nantes is indeed facing olympique lyonnais, but rc strasbourg is in row 0. So fc nantes vs rc strasbourg isn't a match listed; instead, fc nantes is against olympique lyonnais.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check the table:\n\n- Row 0: rc lens (d1) vs rc strasbourg (d1)\n- Row 4: fc nantes (d1) vs olympique lyonnais (d2)\n\nSo the claim is mixing up teams. It says rc lens vs olympique lyonnais, but in reality, rc lens played against rc strasbourg, and fc nantes played against olympique lyonnais.\n\nLooking at the second round for each:\n\n- For row 0: Second round is 0-0 (scoreless)\n- For row 4: First round is 0-0 (scoreless), but the claim refers to the first round of fc nantes vs rc strasbourg, which doesn't exist in the table. Instead, fc nantes' first round against olympique lyonnais was 0-0.\n\nSo the claim incorrectly associates rc lens with olympique lyonnais and fc nantes with rc strasbourg. Therefore, the two scoreless legs mentioned aren't accurate based on the table.\n\nHence, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to matches not present in the table, so it's false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"2nd round\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break down the claim and analyze each part.\n\nThe claim says: \"In the first leg, only 2 were scored by an away team: FC Mulhouse score 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify what each part of the claim is referring to.\n\n1. **Understanding the Table Structure**:\n   - The table has columns: \"team 1\", \"score\", \"team 2\", \"1st round\", and \"2nd round\".\n   - Each row represents a match between two teams (team 1 vs team 2) with their scores in both rounds.\n\n2. **Clarifying Terms**:\n   - \"First leg\" likely refers to the \"1st round\" column.\n   - \"Scored by an away team\" implies that the team is not playing at home. In match tables, usually, \"team 1\" might be considered the home team and \"team 2\" the away team.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Claim**:\n   - The claim states that in the first leg (1st round), only two goals were scored by away teams.\n   - Specifically, FC Mulhouse scored one goal against Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\n4. **Analyzing Relevant Rows**:\n   Let's look for matches involving FC Mulhouse and Girondins de Bordeaux.\n\n   Scanning the table, I find:\n   - Row 3: Girondins de Bordeaux (d1) vs FC Mulhouse (d2)\n     - Score in 1st round: 0 - 1\n\n5. **Determining Away Goals**:\n   - In this row, team 2 is FC Mulhouse (away team). Their score in the first leg is 1.\n   - So, FC Mulhouse scored 1 goal as the away team.\n\n6. **Checking Other Rows for Away Team Scores**:\n   To confirm if only two goals were scored by away teams overall, I need to check all \"1st round\" scores and see how many were scored by away teams (team 2).\n\n   Let's go through each row:\n\n   - Row 0: rc lens vs rc strasbourg. 1-0 in 1st leg. Since team 1 is rc lens, their score is 1 (home), team 2 has 0. So no away goals here.\n   - Row 1: fc rouen vs stade lavallois. 1-0 in 1st leg. Team 1 scored 1 (home), team 2 has 0. No away goals.\n   - Row 2: as monaco vs as nancy. 2-0 in 1st leg. Team 1 scored both, so no away goals.\n   - Row 3: girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse. 0-1 in 1st leg. Here, team 2 (fc mulhouse) scored 1 goal.\n   - Row 4: fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais. 0-0 in 1st leg. No goals from either team.\n   - Row 5: as cannes vs fc sochaux. 3-0 in 1st leg. Team 1 scored all, no away goals.\n   - Row 6: sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp. 2-0 in 1st leg. Team 1 scored both, team 2 has 0.\n   - Row 7: fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc. 4-0 in 1st leg. Team 1 scored all.\n\n   Summing up the away goals from \"1st round\" across all rows:\n   Only in row 3 did an away team score, which was 1 goal. So total away goals in first leg is 1, not 2 as claimed.\n\n7. **Evaluating the Claim**:\n   The claim says only two were scored by away teams, but from the analysis, only one goal was scored by an away team in the first leg (FC Mulhouse's 1 goal). Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n\n8. **Identifying Relevant Cells**:\n   To verify the claim, I need to check each row's \"1st round\" score for any goals by team 2 (away teams).\n\n   The relevant cells are all the \"1st round\" entries in every row because the claim makes a general statement about away goals across all matches. However, since the specific example given is FC Mulhouse vs Girondins de Bordeaux, that particular cell is also important.\n\n   So, the relevant cells include:\n   - Row 3's \"1st round\"\n   - All other rows' \"1st round\" to check for any away goals.\n\nBut looking back, perhaps the initial analysis was too broad. The claim specifically mentions only two goals scored by away teams, but based on the table, there is only one goal. So I need to correct my relevant cells to include all necessary checks.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in the first leg, only two goals were scored by away teams, with FC Mulhouse scoring 1 against Girondins de Bordeaux. However, upon examining each row's \"1st round\" scores, it's clear that only one goal was scored by an away team (FC Mulhouse). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"1st round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"the highest scoring leg, and highest aggregate score for a match, total 8 goals, with fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts. It mentions two things: \n\n1. The highest scoring leg (which I assume refers to either the first or second round in this context).\n2. The highest aggregate score for a match.\n3. Both of these are supposedly 8 goals in total between fc nantes and besan\u00e7on rc.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a match with two rounds: 1st round and 2nd round. Each cell under \"score\" shows the overall result of the match, while the \"1st round\" and \"2nd round\" columns show the results of each leg.\n\nI need to check for each match:\n\n- What's the total aggregate score (sum of both legs).\n- The highest scoring leg in either round.\n- Whether fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc had an 8 goal total.\n\nLet's go through each row step by step.\n\n1. **rc lens vs rc strasbourg**: \n   - Aggregate: 1-0\n   - Legs: 1st (1-0), 2nd (0-0)\n   - Max leg goals: 1 in the first round.\n   \n2. **fc rouen vs stade lavallois**:\n   - Aggregate: 2-4\n   - Legs: 1st (1-0), 2nd (1-3)\n   - Max leg goals: 4 in second round.\n\n3. **as monaco vs as nancy**:\n   - Aggregate: 6-1\n   - Legs: 1st (2-0), 2nd (4-1)\n   - Max leg goals: 5 in second round (but wait, no, it's 4-1 which is 5 total? Or per team? Wait, the claim refers to \"highest scoring leg\" which could be the highest number of goals in a single leg. So for this match, first leg was 2-0 (total 2), second leg was 4-1 (total 5). So the max per leg is 5.\n\n4. **girondins de bordeaux vs fc mulhouse**:\n   - Aggregate: 2-3\n   - Legs: 1st (0-1), 2nd (2-2)\n   - Max leg goals: 4 in second round.\n\n5. **fc nantes vs olympique lyonnais**:\n   - Aggregate: 4-4\n   - Legs: 1st (0-0), 2nd (4-4)\n   - Max leg goals: 8 in the second round.\n\n6. **as cannes vs fc sochaux-montb\u00e9liard**:\n   - Aggregate: 4-1\n   - Legs: 1st (3-0), 2nd (1-1)\n   - Max leg goals: 3 in first round.\n\n7. **sporting toulon var vs en avant guingamp**:\n   - Aggregate: 2-1\n   - Legs: 1st (2-0), 2nd (0-1)\n   - Max leg goals: 2 in first round.\n\n8. **fc metz vs besan\u00e7on rc**:\n   - Aggregate:5-1\n   - Legs: 1st (4-0), 2nd (1-1)\n   - Max leg goals: 4 in first round.\n\nNow, let's analyze the claim:\n\nThe claim says that the highest scoring leg and the highest aggregate score are both 8 goals. It also mentions that this was between fc nantes and besan\u00e7on rc.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The match between fc nantes (d1) vs olympique lyonnais (d2) had an aggregate of 4-4, which is a total of 8 goals.\n   - Legs: first round was 0-0 (0 goals), second round was 4-4 (8 goals). So the highest leg in this match was 8 goals.\n\nBut looking at other matches:\n\n- as monaco vs as nancy had an aggregate of 6-1, which is a total of 7 goals. The second leg was 4-1, totaling 5 goals in that leg.\n- The match between fc metz and besan\u00e7on rc: aggregate was 5-1 (total 6), legs were 4-0 and 1-1.\n\nWait, but the claim mentions \"fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc\". In the table, I see fc nantes played against olympique lyonnais, not besan\u00e7on rc. Besan\u00e7on rc is in a separate row where they played against fc metz.\n\nSo, according to the table:\n\n- The match with fc nantes had an aggregate of 4-4 (8 goals total), but it was against olympique lyonnais, not besan\u00e7on rc.\n- The highest leg scoring was 8 goals in that second round between fc nantes and olympique lyonnais.\n\nTherefore, the claim incorrectly attributes this to a match with besan\u00e7on rc. \n\nAdditionally, checking for other matches:\n\n- The as monaco vs as nancy had an aggregate of 6-1 (7 total), which is less than 8.\n- Other legs: the highest leg was indeed 8 goals in fc nantes's second round against olympique lyonnais.\n\nSo, the claim is incorrect because it refers to fc nantes vs besan\u00e7on rc, but according to the table, the match with the highest aggregate and leg score (8 goals) was between fc nantes and olympique lyonnais. \n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_4\", \"1st round\"},\n     {\"row_4\", \"2nd round\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
