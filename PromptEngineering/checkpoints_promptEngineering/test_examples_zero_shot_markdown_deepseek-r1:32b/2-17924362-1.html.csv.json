    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"In 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than two wins in a row.\" \n\nFirst, let's understand what \"more than two wins in a row\" means. It implies that there was a streak of at least three consecutive wins. So, if I can find three or more consecutive weeks where the result is 'W', then the claim is FALSE because they did have a streak longer than two.\n\nLooking at the table, each week's result is listed under the \"result\" column. Let me go through each row to check for such streaks.\n\nStarting from week 1:\n- Week 1: W\n- Week 2: W\nSo that's two wins in a row.\n\nWeek 3: L (loss)\nSo the streak breaks after two wins, which is within the limit of the claim.\n\nNext, looking further down:\n\nAfter week 5:\n- Week 5: W\n- Week 6: L\nNo consecutive wins here.\n\nThen week 9:\n- Week 9: W\nWeek 10: L\nSo again, only one win before a loss.\n\nLooking at weeks 11 and 12:\n- Week 11: W (with an overtime)\n- Week 12: L\nNo streak there either.\n\nChecking week 13:\n- Week 13: W\nWeek 14: L\nAgain, only one win.\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I missing any other potential streaks? Let me review all the weeks again.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. W\n2. W (streak of two)\n3. L (breaks streak)\nThen single wins here and there, but no three in a row. \n\nSo based on this, the Denver Broncos did not have more than two consecutive wins at any point during these weeks. The longest winning streak is two weeks.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because they never had more than two wins in a row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at the San Diego Stadium\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand what each part of the claim means and how it relates to the data in the table. The claim has two main components: \n\n1. **Lowest Attendance**: We need to find the game with the smallest attendance number.\n2. **San Diego Stadium**: We need to check if that lowest attendance occurred at this specific stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a week of games played by the Denver Broncos in 1975. The columns include details like date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. \n\nTo verify the claim, I'll focus on two columns: \"game site\" and \"attendance.\" My approach will be:\n\n- **Identify All Attendance Numbers**: Extract all the attendance figures from each row to determine which is the lowest.\n- **Check Corresponding Game Site for Lowest Attendance**: Once we know the row with the smallest attendance, check what the game site was.\n\nLet's start by listing out the attendance numbers and their corresponding game sites:\n\n1. Week 1: 51,858 at Mile High Stadium\n2. Week 2: 52,621 at Mile High Stadium\n3. Week 3: 79,864 at Rich Stadium (Away)\n4. Week 4: 49,169 at Three Rivers Stadium (Away)\n5. Week 5: 52,590 at Mile High Stadium\n6. Week 6: 70,043 at Arrowhead Stadium (Away)\n7. Week 7: 52,505 at Mile High Stadium\n8. Week 8: 49,919 at Mile High Stadium\n9. Week 9: 26,048 at San Diego Stadium (Away)\n10. Week 10: 28,686 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium (Away)\n11. Week 11: 44,982 at Mile High Stadium\n12. Week 12: 51,075 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum (Away)\n13. Week 13: 36,860 at Mile High Stadium\n14. Week 14: 43,064 at Miami Orange Bowl (Away)\n\nNow, let's identify the lowest attendance. Scanning through the numbers:\n\n- The smallest number is **26,048** in Week 9.\n- The next smallest is **28,686** in Week 10.\n\nSo, the lowest attendance was 26,048 at San Diego Stadium during Week 9. \n\nHowever, I should also check if there are any other games with lower attendance than this. Looking through all weeks, 26,048 is indeed the smallest number listed. Therefore, the game at San Diego Stadium in Week 9 had the lowest attendance.\n\nWait a minute\u2014hold on. The claim says \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at the San Diego Stadium.\" From our analysis, that's correct because Week 9 has the smallest attendance number, and it was played at San Diego Stadium. \n\nBut wait another thought\u2014is there any other game with lower attendance? Let me double-check all numbers:\n\nWeek 3: 79,864 (Away)\nWeek 4: 49,169 (Away)\nWeek 6: 70,043 (Away)\nWeek 7: 52,505\nWeek 8: 49,919\nWeek 9: 26,048\nWeek 10: 28,686 (Away)\nWeek 11: 44,982\nWeek 12: 51,075 (Away)\nWeek 13: 36,860\nWeek 14: 43,064 (Away)\n\nYes, Week 9 is the smallest. Therefore, the claim seems to be TRUE because the lowest attendance was indeed at San Diego Stadium.\n\nBut wait again\u2014looking back at the table, I realize that all games except for some away games were played at Mile High Stadium. The two instances where they played away in San Diego and Atlanta had attendances of 26,048 and 28,686 respectively. Since 26k is lower than 28k, the claim holds.\n\nSo, after careful consideration and double-checking, I conclude that the claim is TRUE because the game at San Diego Stadium in Week 9 had the lowest attendance of 26,048.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"result\": {\n        \"status\": \"TRUE\",\n        \"attendance\": [\n            {\n                \"week\": 9,\n                \"game_site\": \"San Diego Stadium\",\n                \"value\": 26048\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 21\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the table shows data from weeks 1 through 14 of what I assume is the 1975 season for the Denver Broncos since all games are listed with their results and scores. The claim mentions 1975 specifically, so that aligns with the data presented here.\n\nThe key elements in the claim are:\n- Year: 1975 (which matches the table)\n- Team: Denver Broncos\n- Type of game outcome: Losses\n- Maximum points scored in those losses: 21\n\nI need to check all the games where the Broncos lost and find out how many points they scored in each. Then, determine if 21 is the highest among those.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Week 3: Result L (loss), Score 14\n- Week 4: Result L, Score 9\n- Week 6: Result L, Score 13\n- Week 7: Result L, Score 17\n- Week 8: Result L, Score 16\n- Week 10: Result L, Score 21\n- Week 12: Result L, Score 10\n- Week 14: Result L, Score 13\n\nSo the points scored in losses are: 14,9,13,17,16,21,10,13. The highest among these is 21.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if all entries are indeed for 1975. The dates go from September to December, which makes sense for a football season in the US, typically starting in late August or early September and ending in January. However, without an explicit year in the table, we have to assume based on context that this is 1975 since the claim refers to that year.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that each loss's score is correctly noted. For example, week 10 shows a loss with a score of 21-35 against Atlanta Falcons. So Denver scored 21 points in that game, which was a loss. Is there any other game where they lost but scored more than 21? From the list above, no, because the next highest is 17 and others are lower.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true as the maximum points Denver Broncos scored in a losing game during this season (presumably 1975) was indeed 21.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells include all instances where the Broncos lost, particularly focusing on their scores.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table seems to show the results of each game for a team, likely the Denver Broncos since all games are either at Mile High Stadium or away locations.\n\nLooking at the 'week' column, there are 14 weeks listed. I'll go through each week's details to find if there was a game in Miami Orange Bowl and whether it ended with a loss.\n\nStarting from week 1, most of the early games are at Mile High Stadium except for some away games like Rich Stadium or Arrowhead Stadium. As I move towards the later weeks, specifically around the end of November and December, I notice that the last few weeks include games against teams like the San Diego Chargers, Oakland Raiders, Philadelphia Eagles, and Miami Dolphins.\n\nIn week 14 (December 20), there's a game against the Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl. The result is listed as 'L 13-14', which means a loss. So this seems to fit the claim.\n\nNow, checking the record column, after week 14, the team had a record of 6-8, meaning they lost more games than they won, ending the season on a losing note in that bowl game.\n\nSo, all parts of the claim are supported by the table: it's 1975 (though the year isn't explicitly mentioned, given the context, it's about their performance), Denver Broncos finished with a loss at Miami Orange Bowl.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco go in overtime only 1 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It states that during the 1975 season, the Denver Broncos played in overtime exactly once.\n\nLooking at the table, I see it's structured with weeks from week 1 to week 14, each detailing a game with opponent, result, location, record, and attendance. The key columns for this claim are \"result\" because it shows whether the game went into overtime or not.\n\nI'll go through each row (game) one by one:\n\n- Week 1: Result is \"w 37 - 33\". No mention of OT, so regular time win.\n- Week 2: \"w 23 - 13\". Again, no OT indicated.\n- Week 3: \"l 14 - 38\". Loss in regulation.\n- Week 4: \"l 9 - 20\". Another loss without OT.\n- Week 5: \"w 16 - 15\". Close game but no OT mentioned.\n- Week 6: \"l 13 - 26\". No OT, straight loss.\n- Week 7: \"l 17 - 42\". Loss in regulation.\n- Week 8: \"l 16 - 17\". Very close, but no indication of OT.\n- Week 9: \"w 27 - 17\". Regular time win.\n- Week 10: \"l 21 - 35\". Straight loss.\n- Week 11: Here's something interesting. The result is \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\". This indicates that the game went into overtime, and Denver won in OT.\n- Week 12: \"l 10 - 17\". No OT mentioned.\n- Week 13: \"w 25 - 10\". Regular time win.\n- Week 14: \"l 13 - 14\". Loss in regulation.\n\nSo, looking through all the weeks, only week 11's game shows an overtime result. That means there was exactly one game that went into overtime during the season as per this table. \n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because Denver Broncos had only one overtime game in 1975 according to the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe table indicates that in week 11, the Denver Broncos played an overtime game (result: \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\").

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. Each row represents a game played during the 1975 season for the Denver Broncos. \n\nThe claim is about consecutive wins, so my focus will be on the \"result\" column to see if there are any instances where they won two games in a row. Additionally, I'll check the \"record\" column to understand their win-loss progression throughout the season.\n\nStarting from week 1:\n- Week 1: Win (37-33) \u2192 Record becomes 1-0.\n- Week 2: Another win (23-13) \u2192 Now they have back-to-back wins, moving to 2-0. This is their first instance of consecutive wins.\n\nContinuing through the weeks:\n- Week 3: Loss (14-38) \u2192 So after two wins, they lost.\n- Week 4: Another loss (9-20).\n- Week 5: Win (16-15) \u2192 They have one win again.\n- Week 6: Loss (13-26).\n- Week 7: Loss (17-42).\n- Week 8: Loss (16-17).\n- Week 9: Win (27-17). That's another single win.\n- Week 10: Loss (21-35).\n- Week 11: Win in overtime (13-10 OT) \u2192 One win, but followed by a loss in week 12.\n- Week 12: Loss (10-17).\n- Week 13: Win (25-10). Again, only one consecutive win before losing again.\n- Week 14: Loss (13-14).\n\nLooking at the results, I see that in weeks 1 and 2, they had two consecutive wins. This means there was a streak of two wins in a row during the season. Since the claim states they never had more than one win in a row, this directly contradicts it because they did have two straight wins.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe Denver Broncos had consecutive wins in weeks 1 and 2, which means they did have at least two wins in a row during the 1975 season. \n\n**Answer:** FALSE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 was at the Mile High Stadium\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that among all Denver Broncos games in 1975, the one with the lowest attendance took place at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game played during weeks 1 to 14 of what appears to be the 1975 season because the opponent and stadium names are consistent with that era. The columns include week number, date, opponent, result, game site, record, and attendance. \n\nThe claim is about two things: lowest attendance and the location being Mile High Stadium.\n\nSo, I'll need to check all games played at Mile High Stadium and see if any of them have the lowest attendance in the season.\n\nLet me list out the attendance numbers for each game:\n\n1. Week 1: 51,858 (Mile High)\n2. Week 2: 52,621 (Mile High)\n3. Week 3: 79,864 (Rich Stadium) - Opponent is Buffalo Bills\n4. Week 4: 49,169 (Three Rivers Stadium) - Opponent Pittsburgh Steelers\n5. Week 5: 52,590 (Mile High)\n6. Week 6: 70,043 (Arrowhead Stadium) - Opponent Kansas City Chiefs\n7. Week 7: 52,505 (Mile High)\n8. Week 8: 49,919 (Mile High)\n9. Week 9: 26,048 (San Diego Stadium)\n10. Week 10: 28,686 (Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium) - Opponent Atlanta Falcons\n11. Week 11: 44,982 (Mile High)\n12. Week 12: 51,075 (Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum) - Opponent Oakland Raiders\n13. Week 13: 36,860 (Mile High)\n14. Week 14: 43,064 (Miami Orange Bowl)\n\nWait a second, I notice that some of these games are not at Mile High Stadium. So the claim is specifically about whether the lowest attendance occurred at Mile High Stadium.\n\nLooking at all the attendances:\n\n- The lowest attendance overall seems to be Week 9 with 26,048 in San Diego. That's way lower than any other week.\n\nBut wait, let me check all games again. So, the attendances are as follows (sorted from lowest to highest):\n\n1. Week 9: 26,048\n2. Week 10: 28,686\n3. Week 7: 52,505\n4. Week 8: 49,919\n5. Week 13: 36,860 (Wait, that's actually lower than Week 10 but higher than Week 9)\nWait no, week 9 is the lowest with 26k.\n\nSo, in this case, the claim says the lowest attendance was at Mile High Stadium. But looking at the data, the game with 26,048 attendees was at San Diego Stadium (Week 9), not at Mile High. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because the lowest attendance occurred elsewhere, not at Mile High.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. The claim says \"the lowest attendance for a Denver Broncos game in 1975 be at the mile high stadium.\" So it's asserting that among all their games, the one with the least people was at Mile High. But according to the table, the lowest attendance is actually when they were playing away in San Diego.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because the game with the lowest attendance wasn't at Mile High Stadium but in San Diego.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_12\", \"column_name\": \"game site\"} // Note: This is illustrative; the actual row indices are as per the table.\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nWait, I need to correct that. The relevant cells would be all games at Mile High Stadium and the one with the lowest attendance.\n\nRelevant rows:\n\n- Week 1: Attendance 51,858\n- Week 2: 52,621\n- Week 5: 52,590\n- Week 7: 52,505\n- Week 8: 49,919\n- Week 11: 44,982\n- Week 13: 36,860\n\nAnd the game at San Diego Stadium with 26,048 is lower than all of these.\n\nSo in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // Week 9: 26,048 at San Diego\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // Week 1\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut to better capture the key points:\n\nThe lowest attendance is in row 8 (Week 9) at San Diego Stadium. The claim is about whether this occurred at Mile High, which it didn't.\n\nSo perhaps listing that specific row and also the attendances from Mile High games for comparison.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // The lowest attendance\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"game site\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut according to the initial JSON structure provided in the user's example, it should just include the relevant cells that support the conclusion. Since the lowest attendance was at San Diego Stadium (row 8), and the other games' attendances were higher, but the claim is about Mile High being the location of the lowest, we can list all attendances to show comparison.\n\nHowever, perhaps a better way is just to note the specific game that had the lowest attendance and its location. So:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps include all games at Mile High and the lowest one elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, since in the example given by the user, they included two cells for two different keys, maybe just the key cells needed. So:\n\nThe claim is false because the game with the lowest attendance (26,048) was at San Diego Stadium, not Mile High. Therefore, the relevant cells are that week's attendance and its location.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the example included two cells from different rows. So perhaps it's better to list all attendances and their locations.\n\nBut since the user provided an example with two cells for two different rows, maybe I should include all relevant attendances and game sites for comparison.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just the specific row where the lowest attendance occurred.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut according to the initial example, it's two cells from different rows. So in this case:\n\nThe claim is that the lowest attendance was at Mile High, but the actual lowest was at San Diego Stadium.\n\nSo perhaps listing the lowest attendance and its location as well as an example of a game at Mile High with higher attendance.\n\nFor example:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // 26,048\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}, // San Diego Stadium\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // Mile High, 51,858\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}   // Mile High\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the user's example only had two cells. Perhaps for simplicity, just include the key ones:\n\nThe lowest attendance was at San Diego Stadium, so list that cell and its game site.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nBut the user's example had two cells from different rows (e.g., key and value). So to align with that:\n\nMaybe list attendance at Mile High and San Diego.\n\nFor example:\n\n{\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // Mile High\n{\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"} // San Diego\n\nBut perhaps including both the attendance and location for clarity.\n\nI think the best way is to include the specific row where the lowest attendance occurred (26k at San Diego) and a Mile High game's attendance as an example of higher attendance there. But since it's about the claim being false, showing that Mile High didn't have the lowest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps just list all attendances for all games, but in JSON it would be lengthy.\n\nBut according to the initial structure, probably just include the key cells needed to show the conclusion.\n</think>\n\nThe task was to determine if the game with the lowest attendance occurred at Mile High Stadium. After reviewing the data, it's clear that the lowest attendance was actually at San Diego Stadium. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}, // 26,048 attendance at San Diego\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"game site\"}   // Location: San Diego Stadium\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In 1975, the most points the Denver Broncos scored in a loss was 15.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table provided.

Then, I'll determine if 15 was their highest score in any of those losing games.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Week 3: Result is L 14-38. They scored 14.\n- Week 4: L 9-20.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"in 1975, the denver bronco go in overtime only 2 time\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the claim mentions that Denver Broncos went into overtime twice in 1975. I should check if there are any games in the table where the result column indicates an overtime game and count how many times it happened.\n\nLooking at the 'result' column for each row:\n\n- Week 1: Result is \"w 37 - 33\" \u2013 no overtime.\n- Week 2: \"w 23 - 13\" \u2013 standard win, no OT.\n- Week 3: \"l 14 - 38\" \u2013 loss, not OT.\n- Week 4: \"l 9 - 20\" \u2013 another loss, no OT.\n- Week 5: \"w 16 - 15\" \u2013 close game but result is a win without mentioning OT.\n- Week 6: \"l 13 - 26\" \u2013 loss, not OT.\n- Week 7: \"l 17 - 42\" \u2013 loss, no OT.\n- Week 8: \"l 16 - 17\" \u2013 very close, but result is a loss without OT indication.\n- Week 9: \"w 27 - 17\" \u2013 straight win, not OT.\n- Week 10: \"l 21 - 35\" \u2013 loss, no OT.\n- Week 11: Here it says \"w 13 - 10 (ot)\" \u2013 this indicates an overtime game. So that's one occurrence.\n- Week 12: \"l 10 - 17\" \u2013 loss, not OT.\n- Week 13: \"w 25 - 10\" \u2013 regular win.\n- Week 14: \"l 13 - 14\" \u2013 close but no OT mentioned.\n\nFrom this, only week 11 shows an overtime game. So the claim says two times, but in reality, there's only one instance of a game going into overtime according to the table. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells: I need to look at each row's 'result' column to check for OT. The only row where OT is mentioned is week 11, so that's the relevant cell.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there were two overtime games in 1975, but the table shows only one such game.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"in 1975, the denver bronco finish the season with a win at the miami orange bowl.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down what needs to be verified. The key points are:\n\n1. Year: 1975\n2. Team: Denver Broncos (though in the table it might just say Broncos or use an abbreviation)\n3. Season Finish: They finished with a win.\n4. Location of the final game: Miami Orange Bowl.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents a week of games during the season. The last week is week 14 on December 20, which seems to be the final game of the season since there are no weeks beyond that.\n\nIn the table for week 14:\n- Opponent: Miami Dolphins\n- Result: L 13 - 14\n- Game Site: Miami Orange Bowl\n\nSo, the Broncos played against the Miami Dolphins at the Miami Orange Bowl and lost with a score of 13-14. This was their final game of the season because it's week 14, which is typically the end of the NFL regular season.\n\nSince the result shows a loss (L) for the Broncos in their last game, they didn't finish the season with a win at Miami Orange Bowl. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells:\n\n- The row index for week 14 is 13 (since rows start from 0). The columns we're looking at are \"result\" and \"game site.\" \n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- Row 13, Column \"result\"\n- Row 13, Column \"game site\"\n\nThese show that their final game was a loss at Miami Orange Bowl.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Denver Broncos finished the 1975 season with a win at the Miami Orange Bowl.
