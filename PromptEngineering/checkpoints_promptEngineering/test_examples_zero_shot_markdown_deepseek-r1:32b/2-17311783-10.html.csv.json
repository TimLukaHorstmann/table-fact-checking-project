    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim about Washington's game record and attendance is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"Washington have a record of 41 - 36 and play at the Verizon Center with 20173 people in attendance.\"\n\nI need to verify two things from the table:\n1. The team's record when they played against Washington.\n2. The location (Verizon Center) and the attendance figure (20,173).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game. I'll scan through each row to find where \"washington\" is listed under the \"team\" column.\n\nUpon checking, row 75 has the opponent as Dallas with a record of 39-36. Row 76 lists Charlotte as the opponent with a 40-36 record. Then in row 77, the opponent is Washington. The team's record after this game is listed as 41-36. So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I'll look at the \"location attendance\" column for that same row (row 77). It shows \"verizon center 20173.\" This matches the claim regarding both the venue and the number of attendees.\n\nSince both pieces of information in the claim are accurately reflected in the table, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"charlotte improve to 40 - 36 with a win of 97 - 92 in ot\".\n\nFirst, I'll look for Charlotte's game in the table. Scanning through the 'team' column, I see that row 1 has 'Charlotte' as the team.\n\nNext, let's check the score. The claim mentions a win of 97-92 in overtime (OT). Looking at the 'score' column for row 1, it says \"w 97 - 92 (ot)\". So that matches\u2014 Charlotte won with that score in OT.\n\nNow, I need to verify if this game indeed improved their record to 40-36. The 'record' column after this game is listed as 40 - 36. Since the result was a win, it makes sense that the record would improve from the previous one. Checking row 1's 'record', it shows 40 - 36, which aligns with the claim.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies in these points. The team is Charlotte, they won with that score, and their record improved as stated.\n</think>\n\nThe claim correctly identifies Charlotte's game against Miami Heat on April 3, where they won 97-92 in OT, improving their record to 40-36.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"verizon center 20173 for the location and attendance when the record be 49 - 36%.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the claim:\n\n1. **Location**: Verizon Center with an attendance of 20173.\n2. **Record**: 49-36.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like date, team, score, stats, location and attendance, and record.\n\nI'll go through each relevant column:\n\n- **Location Attendance Column**: This combines both the venue name and attendance number. I need to check if any row has \"verizon center 20173\" in this field.\n  \n  Scanning down:\n  - Row 2 (index starting at 0) shows \"verizon center 20173\". So, that's a match for location and attendance.\n\n- **Record Column**: The claim mentions the record being 49-36. Checking each row's record:\n  \n  Row 2 has a record of 41-36. No other rows show a higher win count like 49.\n\nSo, while \"verizon center 20173\" is present in row 2, the record there is 41-36, not 49-36 as claimed. Therefore, the claim's condition about the record isn't met in that row. Since there's no other instance where both location/attendance and the specific record are found together, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim that needs to be verified as TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim: \"when michael beade be the highest scorer, the score be w 97 - 92 (ot)\". It seems there's a typo in the name; it should probably be \"michael beasley\". So, the corrected claim would be that when Michael Beasley is the highest scorer, the game's score was W 97-92 (OT).\n\nNext, I'll look through each row of the table to find instances where Michael Beasley has the highest points. \n\nLooking at Row 0: High points are Dwyane Wade with 23. Not Michael Beasley.\n\nRow 1: High points are Dwyane Wade with 27. Again, not Beasley.\n\nRow 2: High points are Dwyane Wade with 33. Still not Beasley.\n\nRow 3: High points are Dwyane Wade with 32. No Beasley here either.\n\nRow 4: Here, Michael Beasley is listed in the high rebounds column with 13, but the high scorer is still Dwyane Wade with 31. So Beasley isn't the highest scorer yet.\n\nRow 5: High points are Dwyane Wade again with 55. Not Beasley.\n\nRow 6: Now, looking at Row 6 (index 6), the high points column shows Michael Beasley with 23. This is the first time he's the top scorer in a game.\n\nIn this same row, the score is listed as L 79-81 (OT). That means it was a loss, not a win. The claim says the score should be W 97-92 (OT), which is different from what's in the table.\n\nSo, even though Michael Beasley is the highest scorer here, the outcome and scores don't match the claim. Therefore, the claim isn't supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
