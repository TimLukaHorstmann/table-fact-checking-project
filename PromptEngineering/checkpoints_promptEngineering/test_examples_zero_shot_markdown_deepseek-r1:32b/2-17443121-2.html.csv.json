    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim about the most viewed episode in Season 1 of \"Gary Unmarried\" is correct. The claim says it's titled \"gary and allison brook.\" Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the table provided, each row represents an episode with details like air date, timeslot, 18-49 rating, and viewers. I need to focus on the \"viewers\" column because that's what determines which episode was the most viewed.\n\nI'll go through each episode one by one and note down their viewership numbers:\n\n1. Pilot: 6.84 million\n2. Gary gets boundaries: 6.97 million\n3. Gary marries off his ex: 7.43 million\n4. Gary gets his stuff back: 7.71 million\n5. Gary breaks up his ex-wife and girlfriend: 7.85 million\n6. Gary meets the gang: 6.44 million\n7. Gary and Allison's restaurant: 6.71 million\n8. Gary and Allison Brooks: 8.14 million\n9. Gary gives thanks: 7.72 million\n10. Gary goes first: 8.03 million\n11. Gary toughens up Tom: 7.55 million\n12. Gary dates Louise's teacher: 7.07 million\n13. Gary moves back in: 7.07 million\n14. Gary and Dennis' sister: 6.86 million\n15. Gary's ex-brother-in-law: 7.26 million\n16. Gary uses his veto: 7.71 million\n17. Gary hooks up Allison: 7.57 million\n18. Gary and the trophy: 7.3 million\n19. Gary and his half brother: 6.66 million\n20. Gary fixes Allison's garbage disposal: 5.55 million\n\nLooking at these numbers, the highest viewership is 8.14 million for the episode titled \"Gary and allison brooks.\" The next highest is 8.03 million for \"Gary goes first.\"\n\nThe claim specifies \"gary and allison brook\" as the most viewed episode. Comparing this to the table, the correct title seems to be \"gary and allison brooks.\" There might be a typo in the claim with the spelling of \"brooks,\" but it's close enough that I can assume they're referring to the same episode.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the episode with the highest viewership is indeed \"gary and allison brooks.\"\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"TRUE\", \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}]}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about the TV show \"Gary Unmarried\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim clearly. It states: \"In season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the least viewed episode of the season was the finale, which aired on May 20, 2009.\" So, two main points here:\n1. The finale is the least viewed episode.\n2. This finale aired on May 20, 2009.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to verify both these points.\n\nStarting with point 2: When does the finale air? Scanning through the \"air date\" column, I see that one of the episodes is listed as airing on May 6, 2009. Another episode airs on May 20, 2009. Wait, but which one is the finale?\n\nIn TV shows, typically, the last episode of a season is considered the finale. Looking at the table, I see that there are 18 episodes listed. The last two entries are:\n- Episode 17: \"gary and his half brother\" aired on May 6, 2009.\n- Episode 18: \"gary fixes allison's garbage disposal\" aired on May 20, 2009.\n\nSo, episode 18 is the last one in the table. Therefore, it would be considered the finale of season 1.\n\nNext, point 1: Is this finale the least viewed? The claim says yes. Let's check the \"viewers\" column for each episode to find the minimum.\n\nLooking at all the \"viewers\" numbers:\n- Episode 0: 6.84\n- Episode 1: 6.97\n- Episode 2: 7.43\n- Episode 3: 7.71\n- Episode 4: 7.85\n- Episode 5: 6.44\n- Episode 6: 6.71\n- Episode 7: 8.14\n- Episode 8: 7.72\n- Episode 9: 8.03\n- Episode 10: 7.55\n- Episode 11: 7.07\n- Episode 12: 7.07\n- Episode 13: 6.86\n- Episode 14: 7.26\n- Episode 15: 7.71\n- Episode 16: 7.57\n- Episode 17: 7.3\n- Episode 18: 5.55\n\nThe lowest number is 5.55 for episode 18, which is the finale on May 20, 2009. So yes, it's the least viewed.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are met: the finale aired on May 20, 2009, and it was indeed the least viewed episode of season 1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim about the table is TRUE or FALSE. The claim states: \"4 episode title of gary unmarried feature the name of both gary and allison in season 1.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It mentions that there are four episodes in Season 1 where both Gary and Allison's names appear in the episode titles.\n\nLooking at the table provided, it lists various episodes with their respective details. The key column here is \"episode,\" which contains the title of each episode.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to examine the episode titles:\n\n1. **Row 0**: \"pilot\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n2. **Row 1**: \"gary gets boundaries\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n3. **Row 2**: \"gary marries off his ex\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n4. **Row 3**: \"gary gets his stuff back\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n5. **Row 4**: \"gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n6. **Row 5**: \"gary meets the gang\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n7. **Row 6**: \"gary and allison 's restaurant\" \u2013 Mentions both Gary and Allison.\n8. **Row 7**: \"gary and allison brooks\" \u2013 Mentions both Gary and Allison.\n9. **Row 8**: \"gary gives thanks\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n10. **Row 9**: \"gary goes first\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n11. **Row 10**: \"gary toughens up tom\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n12. **Row 11**: \"gary dates louise  's teacher\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n13. **Row 12**: \"gary moves back in\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n14. **Row 13**: \"gary and dennis' sister\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n15. **Row 14**: \"gary  's ex  - brother  - in  - law\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n16. **Row 15**: \"gary uses his veto\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n17. **Row 16**: \"gary hooks up allison\" \u2013 Mentions both Gary and Allison.\n18. **Row 17**: \"gary and the trophy\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n19. **Row 18**: \"gary and his half brother\" \u2013 Only mentions Gary.\n20. **Row 19**: \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\" \u2013 Mentions both Gary and Allison.\n\nFrom this examination, I identified four episodes where both Gary and Allison are mentioned in the title:\n\n- Row 6: \"gary and allison 's restaurant\"\n- Row 7: \"gary and allison brooks\"\n- Row 16: \"gary hooks up allison\" \u2013 Wait, this one only mentions Allison once. Let me check again.\n- Row 19: \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\"\n\nWait a second, looking back at row 16: \"gary hooks up allison.\" The title includes both names, so that's correct. However, I initially thought maybe it was a mistake because the phrase is different, but it still features both names.\n\nSo, rows 6,7,16, and 19 each have episode titles featuring both Gary and Allison. That makes four episodes in total, which matches the claim exactly.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that there are four episodes in Season 1 where both Gary and Allison's names appear in the title is TRUE. The relevant cells are found in rows 6,7,16, and 19 under the \"episode\" column.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

All episodes\n2. Air on Wednesday\n3. At 8:30 PM\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column named \"timeslot\" which lists the day and time for each episode. \n\nI need to verify if every single episode in the table has its timeslot as \"wednesday 8:30 pm.\" Let me go through each row:\n\n1.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"there be only 2 new episode of gary unmarried in december 2009\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the claim is saying. It mentions December 2009 and says there are only two new episodes of \"gary unmarried.\" Wait, but looking at the table, all the episodes seem to be from September 2008 up until May 2009. So, December 2009 isn't even represented here because the latest date in the table is May 20, 2009.\n\nLet me check each row's \"air date\" column to see if any fall into December 2009. Scanning through:\n\n- The earliest dates are September and October 2008.\n- Then November 2008, followed by December 10 and 17, 2008. \n- January 14 and 21, 2009.\n- February 11 and 18, 2009.\n- March 11 and 18, 2009.\n- April 8, 2009.\n- May 6 and 20, 2009.\n\nI don't see any episodes with an air date in December 2009. The last episode in December is on the 17th of 2008, not 2009. So there are zero episodes aired in December 2009 according to this table.\n\nThe claim says there are only two new episodes in that month, but since none exist in the data provided, the claim must be FALSE. Also, \"gary unmarried\" might be a mishearing; perhaps it's referring to \"Gary Unmarried,\" which seems to be the show based on the episode titles. But regardless of the name, the key point is the absence of episodes in December 2009.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are all the \"air date\" entries, but since none fall into December 2009, it's clear that the claim isn't supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"air date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"gary and allison brook be the episode with the least amount of viewer\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: episode name, air date, timeslot, 18-49 ratings, and viewers. Each row represents a different episode with its corresponding data.\n\nThe claim is about an episode named \"gary and allison brook\" having the least number of viewers. So I need to check two things: does this episode exist in the table, and if it does, what's its viewer count? Then, compare that viewer count to all other episodes to see if it's indeed the lowest.\n\nLooking through the list of episodes:\n\n1. pilot\n2. gary gets boundaries\n3. gary marries off his ex\n4. gary gets his stuff back\n5. gary breaks up his ex-wife and girlfriend\n6. gary meets the gang\n7. gary and allison 's restaurant\n8. gary and allison brooks\n9. gary gives thanks\n10. gary goes first\n11. gary toughens up tom\n12. gary dates louise 's teacher\n13. gary moves back in\n14. gary and dennis' sister\n15. gary's ex-brother-in-law\n16. gary uses his veto\n17. gary hooks up allison\n18. gary and the trophy\n19. gary and his half brother\n20. gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal\n\nI see that episode 8 is titled \"gary and allison brooks\" (with an 's') but the claim mentions \"gary and allison brook\" without the 's'. There might be a typo here. Assuming it's referring to the same episode, I'll proceed with that.\n\nNow, looking at the viewers column for this episode. The viewer count is 8.14. Wait, that seems high compared to some other episodes. Let me cross-verify by scanning through all the viewer numbers:\n\n- Episode 0: 6.84\n- Episode 1: 6.97\n- Episode 2: 7.43\n- Episode 3: 7.71\n- Episode 4: 7.85\n- Episode 5: 6.44\n- Episode 6: 6.71\n- Episode 7 (the one in question): 8.14\n- Episode 8: 7.72\n- Episode 9: 8.03\n- Episode 10: 7.55\n- Episode 11: 7.07\n- Episode 12: 7.07\n- Episode 13: 6.86\n- Episode 14: 7.26\n- Episode 15: 7.71\n- Episode 16: 7.57\n- Episode 17: 7.3\n- Episode 18: 6.66\n- Episode 19: 5.55\n\nWait, looking at episode 19, the viewer count is 5.55, which is significantly lower than 8.14. So \"gary and allison brooks\" isn't even close to being the least viewed episode.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the episode mentioned doesn't have the least viewers; in fact, it's one of the higher ones. The lowest viewer count is actually for the last episode, \"gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal,\" with 5.55 viewers.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 19, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says, \"the final episode have the second least view and air may 6.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what the \"final episode\" is from the table. Looking at the list of episodes, they are ordered sequentially with their respective air dates. The last row in the table is titled \"gary fixes allison's garbage disposal,\" which has an air date of May 20, 2009. Wait a minute, that can't be right because the claim mentions May 6 as the air date for the final episode. Hmm, maybe I should double-check.\n\nWait, looking again at the table, the last two episodes are \"gary and his half brother\" on May 6, 2009, and then another episode on May 20, 2009. So actually, the very last row is the one from May 20, not May 6. Therefore, the final episode in the table is \"gary fixes allison's garbage disposal\" with an air date of May 20, not May 6. But the claim says it aired on May 6, so that part doesn't match.\n\nNext, I need to check if this final episode has the second least view. Looking at the 'viewers' column: the numbers go from around 5.55 upwards. The lowest viewers are in the last row with 5.55 million. Is there another episode with a lower number? Let me scan through all the viewer counts:\n\n- Pilot: 6.84\n- Gary gets boundaries: 6.97\n- Gary marries off his ex: 7.43\n- Gets stuff back: 7.71\n- Breaks up ex-wife and girlfriend: 7.85\n- Meets the gang: 6.44\n- Restaurant episode: 6.71\n- Brooks episode: 8.14\n- Gives thanks: 7.72\n- Goes first: 8.03\n- Toughens up Tom: 7.55\n- Dates Louise's teacher: 7.07\n- Moves back in: 7.07\n- Sister episode: 6.86\n- Ex-brother-in-law: 7.26\n- Uses his veto: 7.71\n- Hooks up Allison: 7.57\n- The trophy: 7.3\n- Half brother: 6.66\n- Fixes garbage disposal: 5.55\n\nSo the lowest viewers are indeed in the last row with 5.55, which is the final episode. Now, is this the second least? Let's see if there's another episode with a lower number than any others except this one.\n\nLooking through the list again, the next lowest after 5.55 is 6.44 (episode \"Meets the gang\"), followed by 6.66 (\"Half brother\"). So actually, 5.55 is the absolute least, not the second least. Therefore, the claim that it's the second least is incorrect.\n\nMoreover, the air date part of the claim states May 6, but as I saw earlier, the final episode aired on May 20. The episode that aired on May 6 (\"gary and his half brother\") has 6.66 million viewers, which is higher than 5.55. Therefore, both parts of the claim are incorrect: it's not the second least, nor did it air on May 6.\n\nSo putting it all together, the claim is FALSE. The relevant cells I checked were the last row for both 'air date' and 'viewers', as well as other rows to compare viewers.\n</think>\n\nThe final episode aired on May 20 with the lowest viewers, not second least nor on May 6.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"air date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"viewers\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"gary unmarried come on friday at 8:00 pm\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into its components:\n\n1. **Gary Unmarried**: This part suggests an episode title related to Gary getting unmarried. Looking through the table, I don't see any episodes titled \"gary unmarried\" or something similar. All episode titles either involve relationships, meetings, or other activities but none about being unmarried.\n\n2. **Come on Friday at 8:00 pm**: The claim mentions a specific day and time. Checking the 'timeslot' column in the table shows that all episodes aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm. There's no mention of any episode airing on Fridays or at 8:00 pm.\n\nSince neither part of the claim is supported by the data in the table, both aspects are false. Therefore, the entire claim should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions an event about Gary getting unmarried and a specific air date and time which aren't present in the table. All episodes aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this problem where I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the title of every episode in season 1 mention both gary and allison.\" \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what the claim is asserting. It's saying that each episode title from Season 1 includes both characters Gary and Allison. So, my task is to check each episode title in the table to see if this holds true.\n\nLooking at the table, it has multiple rows with different episode titles. I need to go through each one by one.\n\nStarting from the first row (row index 0), the episode title is \"pilot.\" This doesn't mention Gary or Allison, so right away, that could be a problem. Wait, but maybe the claim refers only to the episodes after the pilot? Hmm, no, I think the claim includes every episode in season 1, which would include the pilot.\n\nMoving on to row index 1: \"gary gets boundaries.\" This mentions Gary but not Allison. That already contradicts the claim because it's an episode title that doesn't mention both.\n\nBut let me keep going through all the episodes to be thorough. Row index 2 is \"gary marries off his ex\" \u2013 again, only Gary mentioned. Row 3: \"gary gets his stuff back\" \u2013 same pattern. Row 4: \"gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend\" \u2013 still no Allison.\n\nRow 5: \"gary meets the gang.\" No mention of Allison here either. Row 6: \"gary and allison 's restaurant\" \u2013 this one mentions both Gary and Allison. That's good, but since earlier episodes don't include Allison, it doesn't meet the claim that every episode title does so.\n\nContinuing, row index 7: \"gary and allison brooks\" \u2013 mentions both. Row 8: \"gary gives thanks\" \u2013 no Allison. So already we've found multiple episodes where either one or neither of the names are mentioned.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I should count how many times each name appears. But more importantly, the claim is that every episode title must mention both Gary and Allison. From what I can see, several titles don't meet this condition.\n\nFor example, row 9: \"gary goes first\" \u2013 only Gary. Row 10: \"gary toughens up tom\" \u2013 no Allison. Rows 11 to 14 also seem to have episodes without mentioning Allison or only mentioning one of them.\n\nRows 15 and 16 do mention both, but the presence in some episodes isn't enough because the claim requires every episode title to include both names. Since there are episodes that don't meet this criteria, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI think I've checked all the rows, and several don't have both names mentioned in their titles. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"episode\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"episode\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
