    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), bremen have a higher enrollment than culver community\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's being asked. The claim compares the enrollments of two schools: Bremen and Culver Community within the Northern State Conference under IHSAA. I need to check their respective enrollments from the table and see which one is higher.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different school with various details like location, mascot, enrollment, etc. The columns are \"school (ihsaa id)\", \"location\", \"mascot\", \"enrollment\", \"ihsaa class\", \"county\", \"year joined\".\n\nI'll go through the rows one by one to find Bremen and Culver Community.\n\nStarting with Bremen: I see the first row has school name 'bremen', so that's the first school in question. The enrollment is listed as 505 students.\n\nNext, looking for Culver Community: Scanning down, the second row has 'culver community' as the school. Their enrollment is 306 students.\n\nNow, comparing the two enrollments: Bremen has 505 and Culver has 306. Since 505 is greater than 306, Bremen indeed has a higher enrollment than Culver Community.\n\nSo, the claim is TRUE because Bremen's enrollment (505) is higher than Culver Community's (306).\n\nI also need to note the relevant cells from the table. For Bremen, it's row index 0 under 'enrollment'. For Culver Community, it's row index 1 under the same column.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Bremen has a higher enrollment than Culver Community in the Northern State Conference (IHSAA). Checking the enrollments from the table:\n\n- **Bremen**: Enrolled 505 students.\n- **Culver Community**: Enrolled 306 students.\n\nSince 505 is greater than 306, Bremen has a higher enrollment. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"in the northern state conference (ihsaa), bremen join 12 year after culver community\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that Bremen joined the conference 12 years after Culver Community. So, I need to check when each school joined and calculate the difference between those years.\n\nLooking at the table, I see two relevant rows: one for Bremen and another for Culver Community. Both have a column called \"year joined.\" \n\nFor Bremen, the year joined is 1989. For Culver Community, it's 1977. Now, subtracting these years: 1989 minus 1977 equals 12 years. That matches exactly what the claim states.\n\nI should also make sure that both schools are part of the same conference mentioned in the claim, which is the northern state conference under IHSAA. The table doesn't specify conferences directly, but since the claim mentions \"ihsaa,\" and the schools have an IHSAA class listed, it's reasonable to assume they're within the same conference structure.\n\nSo, the years joined support the claim that Bremen joined 12 years after Culver Community. Therefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are the year joined for both Bremen and Culver Community, which show a 12-year difference as claimed.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year joined\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim says: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Bremen be in a different IHSAA class than Culver Community.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The main points are:\n1. Both schools belong to the Northern State Conference within IHSAA.\n2. Bremen and Culver Community have different classifications (IHSAA classes) according to this conference.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see that it lists several schools with their respective details, including \"ihsaa class\". The claim specifically mentions two schools: Bremen and Culver Community.\n\nLet me locate these two schools in the table. \n\n- Bremen is the first row (row index 0). Its \"ihsaa class\" is listed as 'aa'.\n- Culver Community is the second row (row index 1). Their \"ihsaa class\" is 'a'.\n\nNow, I need to compare their classes. Bremen is in class 'aa' and Culver is in class 'a'. Are these different? Yes, they are not the same. So according to this, the claim seems correct.\n\nBut wait, does the table specify that all these schools are part of the Northern State Conference? The table doesn't mention conferences at all\u2014it only provides data about each school's enrollment, county, year joined, and class. Since both Bremen and Culver Community are in the same table, I assume they're part of the same conference as per the claim.\n\nSo, based on the information given:\n- Both schools are likely in the Northern State Conference.\n- Their IHSAA classes are different ('aa' vs 'a').\n\nTherefore, the claim should be TRUE because Bremen and Culver Community are indeed in different classes within the IHSAA as indicated by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"ihsaa class\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim is: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Laville have a lower enrollment than Jimtown.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what each part of the claim means. It's talking about two schools, Laville and Jimtown, both in the Northern State Conference under IHSAA. The claim is comparing their enrollments, specifically stating that Laville has a lower number of enrolled students than Jimtown.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I see several columns: school name with IHSAA ID, location, mascot, enrollment, IHSAA class, county, and year joined. The relevant information for this claim would be the 'enrollment' numbers for both Laville and Jimtown.\n\nI need to locate the rows for these two schools in the table. Scanning through the 'school (ihsaa id)' column:\n\n- Laville is listed at row index 5. Let me check their enrollment: it's 413.\n- Jimtown is listed at row index 3. Their enrollment is 642.\n\nComparing these numbers, Laville has an enrollment of 413, and Jimtown has 642. So yes, 413 is indeed lower than 642. That supports the claim that Laville's enrollment is lower than Jimtown's.\n\nAdditionally, I should confirm if both schools are part of the Northern State Conference (IHSAA). However, looking at the table, there isn't a column that explicitly mentions conference affiliation. The columns provided don't include any information about conferences, so I can only base my answer on the given data. Since the claim mentions them being in that conference and we have their enrollments, I assume they are part of it as per the context.\n\nSo based solely on the enrollment figures from the table, Laville has a lower number of students than Jimtown.

The task is to determine whether the claim about a table in markdown format is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read the claim carefully: \"In the northern state conference (IHSAA), Walkerton be in the same IHSAA class than Culver Community.\" It seems there's a typo here\u2014\"be\" should probably be \"is\"\u2014so I'll interpret it as asking if Walkerton and Culver Community are in the same IHSAA class.\n\nNext, I need to look at the table provided.

Its IHSAA class is \"aaa\". Then, searching for Culver Community, which is in row 1 with the IHSAA class of \"a\".\n\nComparing the two classes: Walkerton (Glenn) has \"aaa\" and Culver Community has \"a\". Since these are different, the claim that they are in the same class is false.\n\nNow, identifying the relevant cells.
