    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"jessica shepley receive a winner's share of 14000 when she win the beaver meadow golf course tournament.\"\n\nFirst, I should break down the components of this claim and see where each piece fits in the table.\n\nLet's look at the table. It has several columns: year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share. The rows go from 2013 to 2004.\n\nThe claim mentions Jessica Shepley. I'll scan the \"champion\" column to find her name. Looking through each row:\n\n- 2013: pk kongkraphan\n- 2012: jenny gleason\n- 2011: jessica shepley\n- ...and so on.\n\nSo Jessica Shepley is listed as the champion in the 2011 row. That's one piece verified.\n\nNext, the claim states that she received a winner's share of $14,000. I'll check the \"winner's share\" column for the same row where Jessica Shepley is the champion. In 2011, under \"winner's share,\" it says 14000. That matches exactly with what the claim says.\n\nThe tournament location is also mentioned in the claim: Beaver Meadow Golf Course. I'll check the \"tournament location\" column for that same row (2011). It indeed says Beaver Meadow Golf Course, so that's another point of confirmation.\n\nPutting it all together: Jessica Shepley was the champion at Beaver Meadow Golf Course in 2011 and received a winner's share of $14,000. All parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n\nI should also ensure there are no discrepancies or other entries that might conflict with this information. Looking through the rest of the table, I don't see any other entries for Jessica Shepley, so it seems she only won once in 2011 at that location with that specific share amount.\n\nTherefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"tournament location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the claim \"In 2012, the champion was from the United States\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. It has several columns: year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner's share. The rows represent different years from 2004 to 2013.\n\nThe claim specifies the year 2012, so I'll focus on that row. Scanning through each column in the 2012 row:\n\n- **Year**: Confirms it's 2012.\n- **Champion**: The name is Jenny Gleason.\n- **Country**: Listed as United States.\n\nNow, I need to verify if the champion for 2012 was indeed from the United States. According to the table, the country column for 2012 shows \"united states\". This directly supports the claim.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other relevant cells:\n- The **champion** cell in 2012 is Jenny Gleason, and her country of origin is specified as the United States. There's no conflicting information elsewhere in the table regarding this specific year and champion.\n\nSince all the data points align with the claim, I can confidently conclude that the statement is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that starting from the year after 2012 (so 2013 onwards), the winner's share in the tournaments listed should never be less than $15,000. To verify this, I'll have to examine the years following 2012 and check the corresponding \"winner's share\" values.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a year from 2004 to 2013. The relevant columns here are \"year\" and \"winner 's share\". My focus is on the rows where the year is greater than 2012, which in this case is only the year 2013.\n\nIn the table, for the year 2013:\n- The \"year\" column shows 2013.\n- The \"winner 's share\" is listed as $15,000.\n\nSince 2013 is the only year after 2012 in this dataset, I need to check if its winner's share meets or exceeds $15,000. According to the table, it exactly matches at $15,000.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I'll double-check all years beyond 2012 in case there are more entries, but looking through the table, only 2013 follows 2012. There's no data for 2014 or later, so based on the given information, from 2013 onwards (the only relevant year here), the winner's share is exactly $15,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true for the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner 's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

This is a match for the claim.\n- Other years don't have Jenny Shin as champion.\n\nSo, focusing on the 2010 row where Jenny Shin is the champion. The relevant columns are 'champion', 'score', and 'winner's share'.\n\nThe claim says she shared $14,000. Looking at the 'winner's share' column for that year: it shows $15,400. \n\nWait, but in 2011, Jessica Shepley won with a winner's share of $14,000. That seems like the claim is mixing up two different champions. So Jenny Shin actually got $15,400, not $14,000.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"champion\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems to say that for all tournaments occurring after the year 2012, the winner's share is not less than $15,400. In other words, every tournament in years beyond 2012 has a winner's share of at least $15,400.\n\nLooking at the table provided, I'll focus on the columns \"year,\" \"purse,\" and \"winner's share.\" The claim specifically mentions years after 2012, so I should examine rows from 2013 onwards. Let me go through each row year by year starting from 2013.\n\nStarting with the first row: 2013. The winner's share is $15,000. Wait, that's less than $15,400. So this already seems to contradict the claim because it's a year after 2012 with a winner's share below the specified amount.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll check all subsequent years as well.\n\nNext is 2012: The winner's share here is $15,000. But since the claim is about years after 2012, this year isn't relevant. Then 2011 has a share of $14,000, which is even less, but again, it's before 2013.\n\nContinuing down to 2010: The winner's share is $15,400 exactly. So that's equal and thus meets the condition. But wait, the claim says \"after 2012,\" so this row from 2010 doesn't apply either because it's before 2013.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have made a mistake here. The years in the table go from 2004 to 2013. So after 2012 would be 2013 and beyond. Looking back at 2013: winner's share is $15,000, which is less than $15,400.\n\nSo the claim states that there are zero purses after 2012 with a winner's share under $15,400. But in 2013, it's exactly $15,000, which is below that threshold. Therefore, the claim is false because there exists at least one year (2013) where the winner's share was less than $15,400.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting \"purse after 2012.\" Perhaps it refers to the purse amount, not the year. Let me read the claim again: \"there be zero purse after 2012 that have a winner's share of less than 15400.\" Hmm, perhaps it's about purses that are after 2012 in terms of their value? That seems unlikely because the purse is a number, not a time. So I think my initial interpretation was correct: the claim refers to tournaments held after 2012.\n\nTherefore, since there is at least one tournament (in 2013) where the winner's share is less than $15,400, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that all purses after 2012 have a winner's share of at least 15,400. However, in 2013, the winner's share was $15,000, which is less than 15,400. Thus, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"winner's share\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
