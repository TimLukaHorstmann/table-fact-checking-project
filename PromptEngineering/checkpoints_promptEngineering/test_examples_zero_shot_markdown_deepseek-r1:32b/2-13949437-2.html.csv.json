    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step and check each part against the data in the table.\n\nThe claim states: \"As the building increases in height, they also increase in the number of floors with one exception, the Union Bank of California Tower became the tallest in 1969 at 268 feet but it was 10 stories shorter than the previously tallest building.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse this into two main parts:\n\n1. The general trend: As buildings get taller, their number of floors increases.\n2. An exception: The Union Bank of California Tower was the tallest in 1969 at 268 feet but had 10 fewer floors than the previous tallest.\n\nLet's tackle each part separately.\n\n**Part 1: General Trend**\n\nI need to check if, as height increases, the number of floors also increases. Looking at the table, I'll list out each building with its height and floors:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building: 185 ft / 12 floors\n- Yeon Building: 194 ft / 15 floors\n- American Bank Building: 207 ft / 15 floors (same as previous)\n- Public Service Building: 220 ft / 16 floors\n- Hilton Portland Hotel: 241 ft / 22 floors\n- Harrison West Condo Tower: 256 ft / 25 floors\n- Union Bank of California Tower: 268 ft / 15 floors\n- Standard Insurance Center: 367 ft / 27 floors\n- Wells Fargo Center: 546 ft / 41 floors\n\nLooking at the trend from first to last:\n\nHeights generally increase, and so do floors, except for Union Bank of California Tower which jumps in height but drops significantly in floors. So this seems like the exception.\n\n**Part 2: The Exception**\n\nThe claim says that the Union Bank Tower was 268 feet tall in 1969 (which is correct from the table) and that it had 10 fewer floors than the previous tallest building. \n\nLooking at the table, before Union Bank came along (from 1965-1969), the tallest was Harrison West Condo Tower at 256 ft with 25 floors. The next one is Union Bank at 268 ft but only 15 floors.\n\nSo the previous tallest had 25 floors, and Union Bank has 15. That's a difference of 10 floors (25 - 15 = 10). So that part checks out.\n\n**Verification Steps:**\n\n- Check Union Bank's height: Yes, it's 268 ft.\n- Determine when it became the tallest: From 1969-1970. The previous was Harrison West from 1965-1969.\n- Floors of Union Bank: 15\n- Floors of previous tallest (Harrison West): 25\n- Difference in floors: 10\n\nAll these points are confirmed by the table.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are accurate. The general trend holds except for Union Bank, which fits as the exception.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because as buildings increase in height, their number of floors generally increases except for the Union Bank of California Tower, which was shorter in floors than its predecessor despite being taller.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"4 of the tallest building in portland between 1907 to present have be bank building\" is true or false based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's stating that four out of the tallest buildings in Portland from 1907 onwards are bank buildings. So, I'll check each building listed and see if they are indeed bank buildings and count how many there are among the tallest.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. **Wells Fargo Building**: This is explicitly a bank building. It was the tallest from 1907 to 1911.\n2. **Yeon Building**: The name doesn't indicate it's a bank, so I don't think this counts.\n3. **American Bank Building**: The name clearly states \"Bank,\" so that's another one.\n4. **Public Service Building**: Doesn't seem to be a bank building; the name suggests public services.\n5. **Hilton Portland Hotel**: A hotel, not a bank.\n6. **Harrison West Condominium Tower**: Residential, so not a bank.\n7. **Union Bank of California Tower**: This is a bank building. It was the tallest from 1969 to 1970.\n8. **Standard Insurance Center**: An insurance center, not a bank.\n9. **Wells Fargo Center**: Another Wells Fargo building, so that's another bank.\n\nWait, but I need to clarify: how many of these are considered \"tallest\" at some point between 1907 and now? Let me go through each one:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building (row 0): tallest from 1907-1911. Bank.\n- Yeon (row1): not a bank, so doesn't count.\n- American Bank (row2): bank, was tallest 1913-1927. So that's another.\n- Public Service (row3): not a bank. Tallest 1927-1962 but irrelevant for the claim.\n- Hilton (row4): hotel. Not relevant.\n- Harrison West (row5): condo, not a bank.\n- Union Bank (row6): bank, tallest 1969-1970. Third bank.\n- Standard Insurance (row7): not a bank.\n- Wells Fargo Center (row8): bank, currently the tallest. That's four.\n\nSo counting:\n\n1. Wells Fargo Building\n2. American Bank Building\n3. Union Bank of California Tower\n4. Wells Fargo Center\n\nThat makes four bank buildings that were each the tallest during their respective periods within 1907 to present. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"3 of the tallest building have be on 6th avenue and 3 of them have be on 5th avenue.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is asserting. It seems like it's saying that among the tallest buildings listed in the table, three are located on 6th Avenue and another three are on 5th Avenue. So, my task is to check how many of the tallest buildings are on each avenue.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that each building has information about its street address. The relevant columns here are \"name\" and \"street address.\" The claim mentions \"the tallest buildings,\" so I should consider all the buildings in the table since they're listed with their heights.\n\nLet me go through each row and note the avenue:\n\n1. Wells Fargo Building - 309 SW 6th Avenue \u2192 6th\n2. Yeon Building - 522 SW 5th Avenue \u2192 5th\n3. American Bank Building - 621 SW Morrison Street \u2192 Not on 5th or 6th\n4. Public Service Building - 920 SW Sixth Avenue \u2192 6th (Sixth is another way of writing 6th)\n5. Hilton Portland Hotel - 921 SW sixth avenue \u2192 6th\n6. Harrison West Condominium Tower - 200 SW Harrison \u2192 Not on 5th or 6th\n7. Union Bank of California Tower - 707 SW Washington Street \u2192 Not on 5th or 6th\n8. Standard Insurance Center - 900 SW fifth avenue \u2192 5th (fifth is another way of writing 5th)\n9. Wells Fargo Center - 1300 SW 5th Avenue \u2192 5th\n\nWait, let's correct that. For row indexes starting at 0:\n\nRow 0: 6th\nRow 1: 5th\nRow 2: Morrison St (not relevant)\nRow 3: Sixth Ave \u2192 6th\nRow 4: sixth avenue \u2192 6th\nRow 5: Harrison St (not relevant)\nRow 6: Washington St (not relevant)\nRow 7: fifth avenue \u2192 5th\nRow 8: 5th Avenue \u2192 5th\n\nSo, let's count how many are on 6th and 5th:\n\nOn 6th Avenue:\n- Wells Fargo Building (0)\n- Public Service Building (3)\n- Hilton Portland Hotel (4)\n\nThat's three buildings.\n\nOn 5th Avenue:\n- Yeon Building (1)\n- Standard Insurance Center (7)\n- Wells Fargo Center (8)\n\nWait, that's only two buildings on 5th. Wait no:\n\nWait row indexes:\n\nRow 0: 6th\nRow 1: 5th \u2192 count 1\nRow 3: 6th\nRow 4: 6th\nRow 7: fifth avenue \u2192 count 2\nRow 8: 5th Avenue \u2192 count 3\n\nAh, I see. So on 5th Avenue, there are three buildings:\n\nYeon (row 1), Standard Insurance Center (row7), Wells Fargo Center (row8). So that's three.\n\nOn 6th Avenue, it's Wells Fargo Building (row0), Public Service (row3), Hilton Portland (row4) \u2192 three as well.\n\nSo the claim is correct: 3 on 6th and 3 on 5th. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, I need to list all relevant cells that were checked for this conclusion. The relevant cells are those in the \"street address\" column because they determine which avenue each building is on.\n\nSo, for each row where the street address was examined:\n\nRow 0: column \"street address\"\nRow1: same\nRow2: same (but not counted as it's Morrison)\nRow3: same\nRow4: same\nRow5: same (not relevant)\nRow6: same (not relevant)\nRow7: same\nRow8: same\n\nSo, the cells are rows 0-8 in \"street address,\" but only some contributed to the count. However, since all were checked, I think each row's street address was considered.\n\nBut for the JSON, I need to include all cells that were relevant. So each row from 0 to 8, column \"street address.\"\n\nWait, no: The claim is about the tallest buildings, which are all in the table. So we consider all of them.\n\nTherefore, all rows' street addresses are relevant because they determine whether they're on 5th or 6th. Hence, each row's \"street address\" cell is part of the relevant_cells list.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"street address\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"street address\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"Before the current tallest building, the Wells Fargo Center, the building that held the title the longest was the Public Service Building which was the tallest for 35 years.\"\n\nFirst, I'll identify the key points in the claim:\n\n1. The current tallest is Wells Fargo Center.\n2. Before it, the Public Service Building was the tallest.\n3. The Public Service Building held the title the longest, specifically for 35 years.\n\nI need to verify each of these points against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll start by checking which buildings are listed and their periods as the tallest.\n\nWells Fargo Center is in the last row. Its \"years as tallest\" are from 1972 to present. So that's correct\u2014it's currently the tallest.\n\nNext, before Wells Fargo Center, what was the previous building? The table shows that before 1972, the Public Service Building held the title from 1927 to 1962. That's a period of 35 years (1927-1962). So according to the claim, this is correct.\n\nBut wait, I should check all the periods to ensure that between 1962 and 1972, there are other buildings that might have been taller than Public Service. The table shows:\n\n- Hilton Portland Hotel: 1963-1965\n- Harrison West Condo Tower: 1965-1969\n- Union Bank of California Tower: 1969-1970\n- Standard Insurance Center: 1970-1972\n\nSo after Public Service (1927-1962), Hilton Portland took over in 1963, then Harrison West, etc., until Wells Fargo Center started in 1972.\n\nNow, I need to check if the Public Service Building was indeed the tallest for 35 years. From 1927 to 1962 is exactly 35 years (including both start and end years). So that's correct.\n\nBut wait another point: the claim says \"the building that held the title the longest.\" I need to check if any other building had a longer period than 35 years. Let's look at all the periods:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building: 1907-1911 (4 years)\n- Yeon Building: 1911-1913 (2 years)\n- American Bank Building: 1913-1927 (14 years)\n- Public Service: 1927-1962 (35 years)\n- Hilton Portland: 1963-1965 (2 years)\n- Harrison West: 1965-1969 (4 years)\n- Union Bank Tower: 1969-1970 (1 year)\n- Standard Insurance Center: 1970-1972 (2 years)\n\nSo the longest period is indeed Public Service with 35 years. Therefore, the claim's second point is correct.\n\nHowever, I should also ensure that there are no other buildings in the table that held the title for longer than 35 years before Wells Fargo Center. From the data, none do. So the claim is accurate on this front as well.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to find out which building was the tallest for the least amount of time and check if it's the Union Bank of California Tower.\n\nLooking at the table, each row lists a building with its years as the tallest. The \"years as tallest\" column shows the duration each building held that title. \n\nI'll go through each building:\n\n1. Wells Fargo Building: 1907-1911 \u2192 4 years\n2. Yeon Building: 1911-1913 \u2192 2 years\n3. American Bank Building: 1913-1927 \u2192 14 years\n4. Public Service Building: 1927-1962 \u2192 35 years\n5. Hilton Portland Hotel: 1963-1965 \u2192 2 years\n6. Harrison West Condominium Tower: 1965-1969 \u2192 4 years\n7.

It became the tallest in 1970 at 268 feet but was 10 stories shorter than the previous tallest building.\n\nLet me look at the table data step by step.\n\nThe buildings are listed in order, each with their years as the tallest, height (feet/m), and number of floors.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- Wells Fargo Building: 12 floors, 185 feet\n- Yeon Building: 15 floors, 194 feet\n- American Bank Building: 15 floors, 207 feet\n- Public Service Building: 16 floors, 220 feet\n- Hilton Portland Hotel: 22 floors, 241 feet\n- Harrison West Condo Tower: 25 floors, 256 feet\n- Union Bank of California Tower: 15 floors, 268 feet (became tallest in 1969-1970)\n- Standard Insurance Center: 27 floors, 367 feet\n- Wells Fargo Center: 41 floors, 546 feet\n\nLooking at the general trend before Union Bank:\n\n- Each subsequent building is taller than the previous. However, looking at the number of floors:\n  - From Wells Fargo (12) to Yeon (15): increase.\n  - Yeon (15) to American Bank (15): same.\n  - American Bank (15) to Public Service (16): slight increase.\n  - Public Service (16) to Hilton (22): significant increase.\n  - Hilton (22) to Harrison West (25): increase.\n  \nSo, up until the Union Bank Tower, there's a general trend of increasing floors with height.\n\nNow, the claim says that when the Union Bank became tallest in 1970 at 268 feet, it was 10 stories shorter than the previous tallest. Let's check:\n\nThe building before Union Bank is the Harrison West Condo Tower, which was the tallest from 1965-1969 with a height of 256 feet and 25 floors.\n\nUnion Bank became tallest in 1969-1970 (as per the table), at 268 feet. The previous tallest was Harrison West, which had 25 floors.\n\nThe claim says Union Bank is 10 stories shorter than the previously tallest. Let's calculate:\n\nHarrison West: 25 floors\nUnion Bank: 15 floors\n\nDifference: 25 - 15 = 10 floors. So yes, Union Bank has 10 fewer floors than the previous tallest.\n\nTherefore, this serves as the exception where despite being taller (268 vs. 256 feet), it had fewer floors than the previous tallest building by exactly 10 stories.\n\nSo, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because the Union Bank of California Tower was indeed the exception\u2014it became the tallest in 1970 at 268 feet but had only 15 floors, which is 10 fewer than the previous tallest building (Harrison West Condo Tower with 25 floors).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Exception**: The claim identifies Union Bank of California Tower as an exception where height increased without a corresponding increase in floors.\n2. **Check Years**: According to the table, Union Bank became tallest in 1969-1970.\n3. **Previous Tallest**: The previous tallest was Harrison West Condo Tower (25 floors).\n4. **Union Bank's Floors**: 15 floors.\n5. **Calculate Difference**: 25 - 15 = 10 floors, confirming the exception.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"height feet / m\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"floors\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"floors\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The claim states: \"3 of the tallest building in portland between 1907 to present have been bank building.\" \n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and identify all buildings that are bank-related. Scanning through the 'name' column:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building\n- American Bank Building\n\nThese two are clearly banks. The others don't have 'bank' in their names. So there are only 2 bank buildings listed.\n\nNext, considering the timeline from 1907 to present. The table shows each building's years as the tallest. However, since the claim is about being \"tallest\" overall between those years, I need to see how many of these tallest titles were held by bank buildings.\n\nLooking at the 'years as tallest' column:\n\n- Wells Fargo Building: 1907 - 1911\n- American Bank Building: 1913 - 1927\n\nThese are two periods where a bank building was the tallest. The other entries don't mention banks, so they don't count towards the claim.\n\nThe claim says \"3 of the tallest,\" but we only have two instances where a bank building held that title. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there aren't three such buildings in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"before the current tallest building, the well fargo center, the building that held the title the longest was the public service building which was tallest for 45 years.\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into parts:\n\n1. The current tallest building is the Wells Fargo Center.\n2. Before this, the Public Service Building was the tallest for the longest time.\n3. It held the title for 45 years.\n\nI'll check each part against the table data.\n\nLooking at the \"years as tallest\" column:\n\n- Wells Fargo Center: 1972 - present\n- Public Service Building: 1927 - 1962\n\nSo, before Wells Fargo Center (which started in 1972), the previous record holder was the Public Service Building from 1927 to 1962. That's a duration of 35 years (1962 - 1927 = 35). \n\nWait, but the claim says 45 years. Let me calculate again: 1962 minus 1927 is indeed 35 years, not 45. Therefore, the duration stated in the claim is incorrect.\n\nAdditionally, checking if any other building held the title longer than Public Service Building before Wells Fargo:\n\nLooking at the \"years as tallest\":\n\n- Yeon: 1911-1913 (2)\n- American Bank: 1913-1927 (14)\n- Public Service: 1927-1962 (35)\n- Hilton: 1963-1965 (2)\n- Harrison West: 1965-1969 (4)\n- Union Bank: 1969-1970 (1)\n- Standard Insurance: 1970-1972 (2)\n\nSo, Public Service Building held the title for the longest time before Wells Fargo, but only for 35 years, not 45. Therefore, the claim is false because of the incorrect duration.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that the Public Service Building was tallest for 45 years when it was actually 35.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim states: \"the building which hold the title of tallest for the longest period of time be the union bank of california tower\". So, my goal is to check whether Union Bank of California Tower held the title of being the tallest for the longest duration.\n\nFirst, I should look at each building and see how long they were the tallest. The \"years as tallest\" column will show the periods each building was the tallest. For each row, I can calculate the number of years by subtracting the start year from the end year.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Wells Fargo Building: 1907 - 1911 \u2192 that's 4 years.\n2. Yeon Building: 1911 - 1913 \u2192 2 years.\n3. American Bank Building: 1913 - 1927 \u2192 from 1913 to 1927 is 14 years.\n4. Public Service Building: 1927 - 1962 \u2192 that's a long period, from 1927 to 1962 is 35 years.\n5. Hilton Portland Hotel: 1963 - 1965 \u2192 only 2 years.\n6. Harrison West Condominium Tower: 1965 - 1969 \u2192 that's 4 years.\n7. Union Bank of California Tower: 1969 - 1970 \u2192 just 1 year.\n8. Standard Insurance Center: 1970 - 1972 \u2192 2 years.\n9. Wells Fargo Center: 1972 - present \u2192 since it's ongoing, I can't calculate the exact years yet.\n\nLooking at these durations, Public Service Building held the title for 35 years, which is the longest period. Union Bank of California Tower only held it for 1 year, so it's definitely not the one with the longest period.\n\nSo, the claim is false because the building with the longest period as the tallest was actually the Public Service Building, not Union Bank of California Tower.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE. The Public Service Building held the title the longest (35 years), while Union Bank only did so for 1 year.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"4 of the tallest building have be on 6th avenue and 3 of them have be on 5th avenue.\" Hmm, wait, there are some typos here\u2014probably meant \"been\" instead of \"be,\" but I'll proceed with understanding it as \"have been.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down what the claim is saying. It mentions two parts: 4 tallest buildings being on 6th Avenue and 3 on 5th Avenue.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a building with details like name, address, years as tallest, height, floors, etc. I need to identify which buildings are considered \"tallest\" based on their heights or perhaps their status as the tallest over time.\n\nWait, the claim refers to \"the tallest building,\" but in the table, each building has a period when it was the tallest. So maybe \"the tallest\" here refers to being the tallest at some point, not necessarily currently.\n\nSo I should list all buildings and see how many are on 6th Avenue versus 5th Avenue among those that were once the tallest.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Wells Fargo Building: Address is SW 6th Avenue.\n2. Yeon Building: SW 5th Avenue.\n3. American Bank Building: SW Morrison Street\u2014neither 5th nor 6th.\n4. Public Service Building: SW Sixth Avenue.\n5. Hilton Portland Hotel: SW Sixth Avenue.\n6. Harrison West Condo Tower: SW Harrison\u2014different street.\n7. Union Bank of California Tower: SW Washington Street.\n8. Standard Insurance Center: SW Fifth Avenue.\n9. Wells Fargo Center: SW 5th Avenue.\n\nWait, but not all of these were the tallest at some point. Let me check each building's \"years as tallest\" column to see if they were considered the tallest during their time.\n\nLooking at the \"years as tallest\":\n\n- Wells Fargo Building (row 0): 1907\u20131911.\n- Yeon Building (row 1): 1911\u20131913.\n- American Bank Building (row 2): 1913\u20131927.\n- Public Service Building (row 3): 1927\u20131962. That's a long time.\n- Hilton Portland Hotel (row 4): 1963\u20131965.\n- Harrison West Condo Tower (row 5): 1965\u20131969.\n- Union Bank of California Tower (row 6): 1969\u20131970.\n- Standard Insurance Center (row 7): 1970\u20131972.\n- Wells Fargo Center (row 8): 1972\u2013present.\n\nSo each building in the table was the tallest for a period, except perhaps I'm not sure if all of them were actually the tallest. Wait, no\u2014each has its own years as tallest, so they all were the tallest at some point, right? Because their periods don't overlap with others. So each entry is a successive tallest building.\n\nSo total of 9 buildings listed, but wait, let me count:\n\nWait, rows 0 to 8\u2014that's 9 entries. But I'm not sure if that's all or just a selection. Anyway, moving on.\n\nNow, the claim says 4 on 6th Ave and 3 on 5th Ave. Let's count how many of these buildings were on each avenue among those that were tallest.\n\nLooking at addresses:\n\nRow 0: Wells Fargo Building \u2013 SW 6th Avenue \u2192 yes.\nRow 1: Yeon \u2013 SW 5th Avenue \u2192 yes.\nRow 2: American Bank \u2013 Morrison Street \u2192 no.\nRow 3: Public Service \u2013 Sixth Avenue (same as 6th) \u2192 yes.\nRow 4: Hilton Portland \u2013 Sixth Avenue \u2192 yes.\nRow 5: Harrison West \u2013 different street.\nRow 6: Union Bank \u2013 Washington Street.\nRow 7: Standard Insurance Center \u2013 SW Fifth Avenue \u2192 yes.\nRow 8: Wells Fargo Center \u2013 SW 5th Avenue \u2192 yes.\n\nSo now, counting:\n\nOn 6th Ave: rows 0,3,4 \u2192 that's three buildings. Wait, no\u2014row 0 is Wells Fargo on 6th, row3 Public Service on Sixth, row4 Hilton Portland on Sixth. So that's three, not four.\n\nWait, does the claim say \"4 of the tallest building have be on 6th avenue\"? But according to this count, only three are on 6th Avenue: rows 0,3,4.\n\nOn 5th Avenue: rows1 (Yeon), row7 (Standard Insurance Center), row8 (Wells Fargo Center) \u2192 that's three buildings. So the claim says 3 on 5th, which matches, but it claims 4 on 6th, which is incorrect because we only have 3.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is wrong\u2014only three on 6th, not four. Therefore, the entire claim is FALSE.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any:\n\nLooking again at each row's address:\n\nRow0: 6th Ave \u2192 count for 6th.\nRow1:5th Ave \u2192 5th.\nRow2:Morrison\u2192 no.\nRow3:6th\u2192 yes (counted).\nRow4:6th\u2192 yes.\nRow5:Harrison\u2192 no.\nRow6:Washington\u2192 no.\nRow7:5th\u2192 yes.\nRow8:5th\u2192 yes.\n\nSo total for 6th Ave: rows0,3,4 \u2192 three buildings. For 5th Ave: rows1,7,8 \u2192 three buildings.\n\nTherefore, the claim states four on 6th and three on 5th, but it's actually three on each. So the claim is incorrect because it says four on 6th when there are only three.\n</think>\n\nThe claim incorrectly states that four of the tallest buildings are on 6th Avenue (only three) and correctly states three on 5th Avenue. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n**Answer:** The claim is FALSE.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify Tallest Buildings**: Each building listed in the table was the tallest during its specified years.\n2. **Count Addresses by Avenue**:\n   - 6th Avenue: Wells Fargo Building (row0), Public Service Building (row3), Hilton Portland Hotel (row4) \u2192 Total 3 buildings.\n   - 5th Avenue: Yeon Building (row1), Standard Insurance Center (row7), Wells Fargo Center (row8) \u2192 Total 3 buildings.\n3. **Compare with Claim**:\n   - Claim states 4 on 6th Avenue, but only 3 are present.\n   - Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"is_claim_true\": false,\n    \"explanation\": \"The claim incorrectly states that four of the tallest buildings were located on 6th Avenue. In reality, there were three such buildings: Wells Fargo Building, Public Service Building, and Hilton Portland Hotel.
