    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"tevita vaikona score 100 point on 25 tries\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll look for Tevita Vaikona in the table. Scanning through the player names, I find him listed as a wing with row index 1.\n\nNow, the claim mentions two key pieces of information: points and tries. The claim says he scored 100 points on 25 tries.\n\nLooking at Tevita's row, under the 'tries' column, it shows 25. So that part matches.\n\nNext, I check the 'points' column for Tevita. According to the table, he has 100 points. That also matches what the claim says.\n\nSince both the number of tries and the points are accurate as per the table, the claim is fully supported.\n\nSo, the answer should be TRUE, and the relevant cells are the 'tries' and 'points' columns for Tevita Vaikona's row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The claim is: \"tevita vaikona be the only player to score at least 100 points when making more than 23 tries.\" I need to verify if this statement is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two main conditions:\n1. The player must have scored **at least 100 points**.\n2. This same player must have made **more than 23 tries**.\n\nAdditionally, the claim states that Tevita Vaikona is the **only** player meeting both these criteria.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- I'll scan through each row to find players who meet both conditions.\n\nLet's examine each player:\n\n1. **Tevita Vaikona**: Position - Wing; Tries - 25 (which is more than 23); Points - 100 (at least 100). So, he meets both criteria.\n\nNext, I'll check the rest of the players to see if any others meet these conditions:\n\n- **Robbie Paul**: Tries - 23. The claim specifies \"more than 23,\" so 23 doesn't qualify.\n- **Leon Pryce**: Tries - 16 (less than 24).\n- **Nathan Mcavoy**: Tries - 4 (much less).\n- **Michael Withers**: Tries - 31. Points are 124, which is above 100. Wait a minute! Michael Withers has more than 23 tries (31) and points of 124. That means he also meets both conditions.\n- **Henry Paul**: Tries - 9 (not enough).\n- **Paul Deacon**: Tries -6, Points -86 (both below thresholds).\n- **Joe Vavana**: Tries -2, Points -8.\n- **James Lowes**: Tries -13, Points -53.\n- **Paul Anderson**: Tries -8, Points -32.\n- **Daniel Gartner**: Tries -14, Points -56.\n- **Mike Foshaw**: Tries -6, Points -24.\n- **Lee Gilmour**: Tries -8, Points -32.\n- **Shane Rigon**: Tries -12, Points -48.\n- **Alex Wilkinson**: Tries -0, Points -0.\n- **Lee Radford**: Tries -2, Points -8.\n- **Jamie Peacock**: Tries -8, Points -32.\n- **Scott Naylor**: Tries -14, Points -56.\n- **Brian McDermott**: Tries -3, Points -12.\n- **Graham Mackay**: Tries -12, Points -50. He has 1 point but only 12 tries (less than 24).\n- **Paul Sykes**: Tries -0, Points -0.\n- **Rob Parker**: Tries -0, Points -0.\n- **Stuart Spruce**: Tries -6, Points -24.\n- **Stuart Fielden**: Tries -3, Points -12.\n\nWait, but I found Michael Withers with 31 tries and 124 points. So he also meets both conditions. Therefore, Tevita Vaikona is not the only player who meets these criteria. This means the claim is FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are:\n- For Tevita Vaikona: Points (100) and Tries (25)\n- For Michael Withers: Points (124) and Tries (31)\n\nThese are the key data points that disprove the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"tries\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"tries\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
