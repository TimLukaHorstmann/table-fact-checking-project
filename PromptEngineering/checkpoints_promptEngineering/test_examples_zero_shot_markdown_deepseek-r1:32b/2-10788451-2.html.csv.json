    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"hawthorn be the away team with the lowest score in the 1965 vfl season.\"\n\nFirst, I'll look at each part of the claim.\n\n1. **Away Team Identification**: The claim states that Hawthorn is the away team. Looking at the table, under the 'away team' column, I see that Hawthorn appears once as an away team in row 1 (index starting from 0). So, yes, they are listed as the away team in one match.\n\n2. **Score Analysis**: The claim mentions \"the lowest score.\" I need to check all the away teams' scores in the table and compare them to see if Hawthorn's is indeed the lowest.\n\n   - Let me list out all the away teams with their scores:\n     - Row 0: North Melbourne scored 10.12 (72)\n     - Row 1: Hawthorn scored 6.8 (44)\n     - Row 2: Richmond scored 9.10 (64)\n     - Row 3: Geelong scored 9.11 (65)\n     - Row 4: St Kilda scored 12.12 (84)\n     - Row 5: Fitzroy scored 9.4 (58)\n\n   Now, comparing these scores numerically:\n   - Hawthorn has the lowest score at 44.\n   - The next is North Melbourne with 72, then Richmond with 64, and so on.\n\n3. **Season Context**: The claim refers to the entire 1965 VFL season, but our table only shows data from April 24, 1965. There might be more games beyond this date that aren't included here. However, without additional data, we can only evaluate based on this table.\n\n   Since Hawthorn's score in this specific game is the lowest among all away teams listed, and assuming no other data contradicts this (which we don't have), it seems valid within the context of the provided information.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based solely on the given table, Hawthorn as an away team has the lowest score compared to others in that round. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The table lists several games from April 24, 1965. Each row has details about the home team, their score, the away team, their score, venue, crowd size, and date.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Essendon's performance as a home team. So I should look at the \"home team\" column to find where Essendon is listed.\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 0: Melbourne vs North Melbourne\nRow 1: Essendon vs Hawthorn (here, Essendon is the home team)\nRow 2: Collingwood vs Richmond\nRow 3: Carlton vs Geelong\nRow 4: South Melbourne vs St Kilda\nRow 5: Footscray vs Fitzroy\n\nSo Essendon's game is in row 1. Their score is \"20.18 (138)\". The format seems to be goals.points, with the total score in parentheses.\n\nNow, I need to check all other home teams' scores to see if any have a higher score than Essendon's 138 points.\n\nLet me list out each home team and their respective scores:\n\n- Melbourne: 11.14 (80)\n- Essendon: 20.18 (138)\n- Collingwood: 11.13 (79)\n- Carlton: 8.11 (59)\n- South Melbourne: 7.9 (51)\n- Footscray: 8.6 (54)\n\nComparing these, Essendon's 138 points is the highest among all home teams in this table.\n\nSince the claim states that Essendon has the highest score as a home team in the season and based on the data provided, this is true.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Essendon's score of 138 points is higher than all other home team scores listed in the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"home team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"mcg venue have a smaller crowd than victoria park\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table and see which rows correspond to each of these venues. The table has six rows, each representing a different match on 24 April 1965.\n\nLooking at the venue column:\n\n- The first row has \"mcg\" as the venue.\n- The third row mentions \"victoria park\".\n\nSo I need to find the crowd numbers for both of these venues.\n\nFor mcg (row index 0), under the 'crowd' column, the number is 21744. \n\nFor victoria park (row index 2), the crowd is listed as 31370.\n\nNow, comparing these two: 21744 (mcg) vs 31370 (victoria park). The claim says that mcg has a smaller crowd than victoria park. Since 21744 is indeed less than 31370, the claim holds true.\n\nI should make sure there are no other rows with these venues to avoid confusion, but in this table, each venue appears only once. So it's clear that mcg has a smaller crowd number compared to victoria park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the McG venue had a smaller crowd than Victoria Park. Checking the relevant cells:\n\n- mcg (row 0) has a crowd of 21744\n- victoria park (row 2) has a crowd of 31370\n\nSince 21744 < 31370, the claim is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"prince park venue have the largest crowd in the 1965 vfl season\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.\n\nFirst, the table shows several matches from April 24, 1965. Each row represents a game with details like home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd size, and date. The claim is about Prince Park having the largest crowd in that season, so I need to check if the crowd at Prince Park is indeed the highest among all listed venues on this date.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six matches. Let me go through each one and note down the venue and crowd numbers:\n\n1. Melbourne vs North Melbourne at mcg: 21744\n2. Essendon vs Hawthorn at windy hill: 20500\n3. Collingwood vs Richmond at victoria park: 31370\n4. Carlton vs Geelong at princes park: 34945\n5. South Melbourne vs St Kilda at lake oval: 23979\n6. Footscray vs Fitzroy at western oval: 16998\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the venues for row 0 and row 3. Let me double-check:\n\nRow 0: Venue is mcg with crowd 21744.\n\nRow 3: Venue is princes park (I think it's \"princes park\" without an 'e') and the crowd is 34945.\n\nAh, I see that in row 3, the venue is spelled as \"princes park\", which might be a typo for \"Prince Park\". But regardless of spelling, looking at the numbers:\n\n- mcg: 21744\n- windy hill: 20500\n- victoria park: 31370\n- princes park: 34945\n- lake oval: 23979\n- western oval: 16998\n\nSo, the highest crowd is at \"princes park\" with 34945. Now, the claim mentions \"Prince Park\", which might be a variation of \"princes park\". Assuming that it's referring to the same place, then yes, Prince Park had the largest crowd on that day.\n\nBut wait, does the table cover the entire season? The dates are all April 24, 1965. So this is just one day's games, not the entire season. Therefore, we can't be certain if \"princes park\" was the venue with the largest crowd for the whole 1965 VFL season based solely on this data. However, the claim might be referring only to the listed matches in the table. If that's the case, then yes, princes park had the highest attendance.\n\nBut another thought: Maybe I misread the claim. It says \"prince park venue have the largest crowd in the 1965 vfl season\". So it's about the entire season, not just a single day. The table only shows one day of games, so we don't have data for the entire season. Therefore, based on this limited data, we can't confirm if prince park had the largest crowd throughout the season.\n\nWait, but perhaps all the matches in the 1965 VFL season are listed here? That seems unlikely because there are only six matches here, and a football season would have many more games. Therefore, without knowing other matches' attendance, we can't conclude whether prince park was the highest for the whole season.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is that on this specific day, Prince Park had the largest crowd. If that's the case, then yes, 34945 is the highest in the table. But since the claim mentions the entire season, we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The claim says \"in the 1965 vfl season\". Since the data provided only includes games from April 24, 1965, but not all games of the season, we can't verify if Prince Park was the highest throughout the entire season.\n\nHowever, perhaps the user is assuming that these are all the matches in the season. If so, then Prince Park's 34945 would be the largest. But realistically, a VFL season has more than six games, so this table can't represent the whole season.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data, we can only confirm that on April 24, 1965, Prince Park had the highest attendance among these matches. Without more data, the claim about the entire season is unverifiable from this table alone.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should focus strictly on the data provided and ignore what's outside of it. So, if we're only considering the games listed in the table, then yes, Prince Park (assuming it's princes park) has the highest crowd. But the claim is about the entire season, which isn't fully represented here.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Since the claim is about the 1965 VFL season and the table only shows a single day's games, we can't confirm whether Prince Park was the venue with the largest crowd for the whole season. Therefore, based on the given data, the claim isn't supported because we don't have all season data.\n\nWait no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The claim says \"have\" which might be a typo for \"had\". But regardless, without knowing other games' attendances, we can't confirm it's the largest in the entire season.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and meant to say that Prince Park had the highest crowd on this day. In that case, yes, 34945 is the highest. But since the claim refers to the whole season, I think we should consider it as not fully supported because we don't have all season data.\n\nBut wait again: The table's date is April 24, 1965, and all games are on that day. So maybe this is a single round of matches, but not the entire season. Therefore, without knowing other rounds' attendances, we can't confirm if Prince Park was the top for the whole season.\n\nThus, based solely on this table, the claim isn't fully supported because it's about the entire season and we only have data from one day.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine whether \"Prince Park\" had the largest crowd in the 1965 VFL season based on the provided data. The data shows attendances for a single day (April 24, 1965) across six venues. \n\n- The highest attendance on this day was at \"princes park\" with 34,945 attendees.\n- However, since the claim refers to the entire 1965 VFL season and the table only includes one day's games, we cannot confirm if \"Prince Park\" had the largest crowd throughout the season.\n\nTherefore, based on the given data:\n\n**Answer:** The data does not support the claim that Prince Park had the largest crowd in the entire 1965 VFL season because it only provides information for a single day. However, on April 24, 1965, \"princes park\" did have the highest attendance among the listed venues.\n\n```plaintext\nOn April 24, 1965, 'princes park' had the largest crowd with 34,945 attendees among the listed matches. However, without data for the entire season, we cannot confirm it was the top venue for the whole year.\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"Prince park venue have the least crowd to show up in the 1965 VFL season\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll carefully read through the instructions and understand what's required. The task is to verify the claim using the given data, which includes information about several games played on April 24, 1965. Each row of the table represents a game with details such as home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd numbers, and date.\n\nThe claim specifically mentions \"Prince park venue\" having the least crowd. From my knowledge, I recall that sometimes venues might have similar names or slight variations in spelling. In this case, I notice there's an entry for \"princes park.\" This is likely a typo or variation of the intended venue name, so I should consider \"princes park\" as relevant here.\n\nNext, I need to identify the crowd numbers for each venue on that date. Looking at the table:\n\n1. **McG (Melbourne vs North Melbourne)**: Crowd of 21,744.\n2. **Windy Hill (Essendon vs Hawthorn)**: Crowd of 20,500.\n3. **Victoria Park (Collingwood vs Richmond)**: Crowd of 31,370.\n4. **Princes Park (Carlton vs Geelong)**: Crowd of 34,945.\n5. **Lake Oval (South Melbourne vs St Kilda)**: Crowd of 23,979.\n6. **Western Oval (Footscray vs Fitzroy)**: Crowd of 16,998.\n\nI need to find which venue had the least crowd. Scanning through the numbers:\n\n- The smallest number is 16,998 at Western Oval.\n- The next smallest is 20,500 at Windy Hill.\n- Then comes 21,744 at McG, followed by 23,979 at Lake Oval.\n\nLooking for \"princes park,\" its crowd was 34,945, which is actually one of the higher numbers. Therefore, it's clear that \"Prince park venue\" did not have the least crowd; in fact, it had a significantly larger audience than several other venues listed.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other venues had lower crowds than princes park. From the data:\n\n- Western Oval (16,998) is the lowest.\n- Windy Hill (20,500) is next.\n- McG (21,744) and Lake Oval (23,979) follow.\n\nSo, the claim that princes park had the least crowd is false because there are venues with smaller crowds than it. \n\nAdditionally, I should ensure that all data points are considered correctly to avoid any oversight. Each row corresponds to a specific game on the same date, so we're comparing like-for-like in terms of the date but across different venues.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the crowd numbers provided, princes park (which is \"princes park\" in the table) did not have the least attendance; it was actually one of the higher ones. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a game with details about home and away teams, their scores, venue, crowd, and date.\n\nI need to identify where Geelong is playing as an away team and what their score was. Then, find North Melbourne's score when they were the away team.\n\nLooking through the rows:\n\nRow 0: Home team is Melbourne, away team is North Melbourne. Their scores are home 80 vs away 72.\nSo, North Melbourne as away scored 72.\n\nNow for Geelong as an away team: looking at Row 3. Home team is Carlton, away team is Geelong. Their scores are Carlton (home) 59 vs Geelong (away) 65.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"geelong get a lower score than north melbourne as an away team.\" So, Geelong's away score is 65, and North Melbourne's away score was 72 in Row 0. Wait, that would mean Geelong scored higher than North Melbourne as away teams.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nRow 3: Carlton vs Geelong. Home team is Carlton with a score of 8.11 (59), and away team Geelong has 9.11 (65). So, Geelong's score is higher than Carlton's home score, but we're comparing Geelong as away against North Melbourne as away.\n\nIn Row 0: Home team Melbourne vs Away North Melbourne. Scores are 80 for Melbourne and 72 for North Melbourne.\n\nSo, North Melbourne as away scored 72, while Geelong as away in their match (Row 3) scored 65.\n\nWait, no, that's the opposite. Wait, wait\u2014wait, let me double-check:\n\nNo, wait: In Row 0, North Melbourne is away and scored 72. In Row 3, Geelong is away and scored 65. So, 65 (Geelong) is lower than 72 (North Melbourne). Therefore, the claim that \"geelong get a lower score than north melbourne as an away team\" would be TRUE.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because in Row 3, Geelong's score is higher than Carlton's home score, but compared to North Melbourne's away score, it's lower. So yes, the claim is correct.\n\nBut wait another moment: Let me make sure which teams are considered as away. In Row 0, North Melbourne is the away team with a score of 72. Geelong is in Row 3 as away with 65. Therefore, 65 < 72, so Geelong's score is lower than North Melbourne's when both were away.\n\nSo the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells:\n\n- For North Melbourne as away: Row 0, column 'away team score' and maybe the team name to confirm they're the away team.\n- For Geelong as away: Row 3, same columns.\n\nWait, but perhaps just their scores are sufficient. The claim is about their scores when being away teams, so I need to check which rows have each as the away team.\n\nSo relevant cells would be:\n\nRow 0: 'away team score' (72) for North Melbourne.\nRow 3: 'away team score' (65) for Geelong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is TRUE, and the relevant cells are these two scores.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by comparing the away scores of both teams. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It claims that Hawthorn was the away team with the highest points recorded in the matches listed here. Wait, actually, looking at the table, each row represents a different match on April 24, 1965. So, I need to check each away team's score and see if Hawthorn has the highest.\n\nLet me look through each row:\n\nRow 0: Away team is North Melbourne with a score of 10.12 (72 points). \n\nRow 1: Away team is Hawthorn with 6.8 (44 points).\n\nRow 2: Away team is Richmond with 9.10 (64 points).\n\nRow 3: Away team is Geelong with 9.11 (65 points).\n\nRow 4: Away team is St Kilda with 12.12 (84 points).\n\nRow 5: Away team is Fitzroy with 9.4 (58 points).\n\nNow, I need to compare the away teams' scores. The claim says Hawthorn has the highest point record as an away team. But looking at the numbers:\n\n- North Melbourne: 72\n- Hawthorn: 44\n- Richmond: 64\n- Geelong: 65\n- St Kilda: 84\n- Fitzroy: 58\n\nClearly, St Kilda has the highest with 84 points as an away team. So, Hawthorn is way lower than that.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"hawthorn be the away team with the highest point ever record.\" Based on this table, it's not correct because St Kilda scored higher. \n\nI should also make sure I'm interpreting the scores correctly. The format is goals.behinds (total points). Each goal is 6 points, and each behind is 1 point. So for example, Hawthorn's score of 6.8 is (6*6) + 8 = 36 + 8 = 44 points.\n\nYes, that seems right. So St Kilda with 12 goals and 12 behinds would be (12*6)+12=72+12=84 points. That's the highest among all away teams in this table.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Hawthorn isn't the one with the highest; it's St Kilda.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE since St Kilda as an away team scored higher than Hawthorn in the given matches.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a specific claim about it. My task is to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information given.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. It lists several matches with details like home team, their scores, away teams, away scores, venue, crowd numbers, and dates. The claim in question is: \"essendon have the highest score as a home team in the 1977 season.\"\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break down what this claim is saying. It's stating that Essendon had the highest score when they were the home team during the 1977 season.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice that each row represents a different match. The relevant columns here are \"home team,\" \"home team score,\" and \"date.\" \n\nI should check if any of these matches are from 1977 because the claim specifies the 1977 season. Scanning through the dates in the table, I see entries like \"24 april 1965\" repeated across all rows. That means every match listed here took place in 1965, not 1977. \n\nWait a minute, that's important. The claim is about 1977, but all the data provided is from 1965. Therefore, there's no information in this table about any matches in 1977. Since the table doesn't contain any data related to 1977, we can't verify the claim based on what's here.\n\nEven if I look at the home team scores for Essendon in 1965, which is 20.18 (138), that might be high compared to other teams in that table, but it doesn't relate to 1977. Without any data from 1977, we can't say anything about Essendon's performance that year.\n\nSo, putting this together, the claim is making a statement about the 1977 season, but our table only has data from 1965. Therefore, there's no way to confirm or deny the claim based on the information provided. It might be true or false, but we can't determine that here.\n\nIn terms of relevant cells, I should identify which parts of the table are checked. The rows with Essendon and their score (row index 1) are examined, as well as all the dates to confirm they're from 1965 instead of 1977. So, each row's \"date\" column is relevant because it shows none are from 1977.\n\nTherefore, since there's no data for 1977 in the table, the claim can't be supported by this information. The answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided.\n\nThe claim says: \"mcg venue have 2cd most attendence in the 1965 season\". So, I need to check if the MCG venue had the second-highest attendance among all the venues listed for that day in April 1965.\n\nLooking at the table, there are six matches on 24 April 1965. Each row has details about home team, away team, venue, crowd (which I assume is the attendance), and other info.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the venues and their corresponding crowd numbers:\n\n1. MCG: 21,744\n2. Windy Hill: 20,500\n3. Victoria Park: 31,370\n4. Princes Park: 34,945\n5. Lake Oval: 23,979\n6. Western Oval: 16,998\n\nNow, I need to sort these venues by attendance in descending order to determine their ranking.\n\nStarting from the highest:\n- Princes Park has the highest with 34,945.\n- Next is Victoria Park at 31,370.\n- Then MCG with 21,744.\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPrinces Park: 34,945\n\nVictoria Park: 31,370\n\nMCG: 21,744\n\nWindy Hill: 20,500\n\nLake Oval: 23,979\n\nWait a minute, Lake Oval has 23,979 which is higher than MCG's 21,744. So the order should be:\n\n1. Princes Park (34,945)\n2. Victoria Park (31,370)\n3. Lake Oval (23,979)\n4. MCG (21,744)\n5. Windy Hill (20,500)\n6. Western Oval (16,998)\n\nSo the second-highest attendance is Victoria Park with 31,370. The third is Lake Oval at 23,979, and MCG is fourth.\n\nTherefore, the claim that MCG has the second-most attendance isn't correct because it's actually in the fourth position.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the season refers to all games played during the entire 1965 season, but the table only shows one day's worth of data. Hmm, but since we only have this data point for April 24, perhaps the claim is based on that single day.\n\nBut regardless, within these six venues on that day, MCG isn't second; it's fourth. So the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe MCG had an attendance of 21,744, which was not the second-highest among all listed venues for that date. The second-highest was Victoria Park with 31,370.\n\n**Answer:**\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given a table in markdown format and a claim about the data in that table. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand what needs to be done. The claim is: \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team.\" So, I need to compare the scores of Geelong and North Melbourne when they were away teams.\n\nLooking at the table structure, it has several columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, and date. All matches listed have the same date, April 24, 1965, so that part is consistent across all entries.\n\nI'll go through each row to find where Geelong and North Melbourne were playing as away teams.\n\nStarting with the first row: Home team is Melbourne against North Melbourne as the away team. The scores are 80 (Melbourne) vs. 72 (North Melbourne). So, in this case, North Melbourne's score as an away team is 72.\n\nNext, looking for Geelong as an away team. Scanning through the rows, I find that Geelong is listed as the away team in the fourth row where Carlton is the home team. The scores here are 59 (Carlton) vs. 65 (Geelong). So, Geelong's score as an away team is 65.\n\nNow, comparing the two scores: Geelong scored 65 as an away team, while North Melbourne scored 72 in their match. Wait, that would mean Geelong didn't get a higher score than North Melbourne; instead, they have a lower score. So, does this make the claim FALSE?\n\nWait a minute\u2014am I interpreting this correctly? The claim says \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team.\" But from the table, in their respective matches, Geelong scored 65 and North Melbourne scored 72 when they were both away teams. That means Geelong's score is actually lower than North Melbourne's.\n\nWait again\u2014am I looking at the right columns? The claim specifies that both are away teams, so I should check each of their away scores against the home team scores in their respective matches. So, for North Melbourne, they were the away team and scored 72 against Melbourne. For Geelong, they were the away team and scored 65 against Carlton.\n\nSo, 65 is less than 72, meaning Geelong's score as an away team was lower than North Melbourne's in their respective games on that day. Therefore, the claim that \"geelong get a higher score than north melbourne as an away team\" would be FALSE.\n\nWait another thought\u2014am I misreading the teams? Let me double-check: In the first row, North Melbourne is the away team with a score of 72. In the fourth row, Geelong is the away team with a score of 65. So yes, 65 < 72, so the claim is not supported.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE, and the relevant cells are from both rows where each team was an away team.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"away team score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
