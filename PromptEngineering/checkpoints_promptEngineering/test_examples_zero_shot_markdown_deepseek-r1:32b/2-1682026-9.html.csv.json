Their sales are 108.28 billion and profits are 17.05 billion.\n\nGeneral Electric is rank 2, so row index 1. Their sales are 152.36 billion and profits are 16.59 billion.\n\nComparing the sales: Citigroup has 108.28 vs GE's 152.36. So yes, Citigroup's sales are less than GE's.\n\nNow for profits: Citigroup made 17.05 billion, while GE made 16.59 billion. So Citigroup does have higher profits than GE.\n\nBoth parts of the claim check out.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that half of the companies listed are based in the USA. To verify this, I should count how many companies have their country as 'usa' and then see if that number is exactly half of the total number of companies.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 companies listed because the ranks go from 1 to 10. So half of 10 would be 5. Now I need to count how many companies are based in the USA.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Citigroup - country is usa.\n2. General Electric - country is usa.\n3. American International Group - country is usa.\n4. Bank of America - country is usa.\n5. HSBC - country is uk.\n6. ExxonMobil - country is usa.\n7. Royal Dutch Shell - country is netherlands.\n8. BP - country is uk.\n9. ING Group - country is netherlands.\n10. Toyota - country is japan.\n\nCounting the ones based in the USA: Citigroup (1), General Electric (2), American International Group (3), Bank of America (4), ExxonMobil (6). That's 5 companies.\n\nSo, 5 out of 10 are based in the USA. Since half of 10 is 5, this means exactly half of the companies are based in the USA. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nNow, for the relevant cells, I need to list each row where the country was checked. That would be rows 0 through 9 (since rows start at 0).

To verify this, I should look at each company and note their country of origin.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 10 companies listed.
