It states that Keiko Tamai lost two times after she won her first match. So, I'm looking for instances where Keiko Tamai has losses (res = loss) that occur after a win in her records.\n\nLooking at the table, I notice there's no entry with \"keiko tamai\" as an opponent. The opponents listed include names like shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, etc., but I don't see Keiko Tamai anywhere. This makes me think that either Keiko Tamai isn't present in the table or maybe there's a typo in her name.\n\nSince the claim is about Keiko Tamai's losses after her first win, and she doesn't appear as an opponent in any of these matches, it seems like the information needed to verify this claim isn't available. Without data on her wins and subsequent losses, I can't confirm whether she lost two times after a win.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided table, there's no evidence supporting the claim. Hence, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim cannot be verified because Keiko Tamai is not listed in the table as an opponent. Therefore, it's impossible to determine if she lost twice after her first win.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

Let me start by understanding what the claim is saying.\n\nFirst, the name mentioned is Keiko Tamia. Looking at the opponent column in the table, I need to check if there's any mention of Keiko Tamia as an opponent. If she isn't listed, then perhaps the claim doesn't pertain to this data because it might be a different person or a typo.\n\nI'll go through each row and look at the \"opponent\" column:\n\n1. Row 0: shayna baszler\n2. Row 1: marloes coenen\n3. Row 2: michiko takeda\n4. Row 3: jan finney\n5. Row 4: mamiko mamiko\n6. Row 5: hitomi akano\n7. Row 6: kamei natsuko\n8. Row 7: megumi fujii\n9.

Row 27: etsuko kato\n\nI don't see \"keiko tamia\" in the opponent column at all. That's a bit confusing because if Keiko Tamia isn't an opponent listed, then how can we assess her losses? Maybe it's a typo or perhaps she's referred to differently here.\n\nWait, let me double-check for any possible misspellings. \"Keiko Tamia\" could be mistaken as \"keiko tamia\" in lowercase, but looking again, I still don't see that name anywhere. The closest names are \"kamei natsuko,\" \"natsuko kikukawa,\" and others, but none match Keiko Tamia.\n\nSince there's no entry for Keiko Tamia as an opponent, the claim about her losing only once after the 2nd round can't be verified from this table. There might be a mistake in the name provided or perhaps the data doesn't include her matches.

Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll look for entries where the method of victory or loss is 'tko'. Scanning through the table:\n\n- Looking at each row, check if the 'method' column has 'tko'.\n  \nI go through each row one by one:\n\nRow 0: Method is 'submission (neck crank)' \u2013 not tko.\nRow 1: 'rear naked choke' \u2013 submission, not tko.\nRow 2: Decision \u2013 no tko.\nRow 3: Armbar \u2013 submission.\nRow 4: Armbar \u2013 submission.\nRow 5: Armbar \u2013 submission.

Let me recount:\n\nWait, the rows are numbered from 0 to 25.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 13: method is 'tko', result is win. So this is a tko win.\n  \nThen further down:\n  \nRow 24: method is 'decision' \u2013 not tko.\n  \nRow 25: submission, so no.\n\nWait, row index 9 has method as 'submission (armbar)', but row 13: 'tko', result is win. So that's a tko win.\n\nIs there another tko in the table? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all rows again:\n\nRow 0: submission\nRow 1: submission\nRow 2: decision\nRow 3: submission\nRow 4: submission\nRow 5: submission\nRow 6: submission\nRow 7: submission\nRow 8: tko \u2013 wait, no. Let's see row 9:\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me list all the methods:\n\nLooking at each row's method column:\n\n0: submission (neck crank)\n1: submission (rear naked choke)\n2: decision\n3: submission (armbar)\n4: submission (armbar)\n5: submission (armbar)\n6: submission (armbar)\n7: submission (armbar)\n8: tko \u2013 wait, no. Let me check row 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I misnumbered the rows. Let's recount from the top:\n\nThe table starts with res, record, opponent, method, round, time.\n\nSo row indices are as follows:\n\nRow 0: loss vs shayna baszler, submission\nRow 1: loss vs marloes coenen, submission\nRow 2: loss vs michiko takeda, decision\nRow 3: win vs jan finney, submission (armbar)\nRow 4: win vs unknown, submission (armbar)\nRow 5: loss vs unknown, submission (armbar)\nRow 6: win vs unknown, submission (armbar)\nRow 7: loss vs unknown, submission (armbar)\nRow 8: tko?

Let's look again:\n\nLooking at each method:\n\n- Row 0: submission\n- Row 1: submission\n- Row 2: decision\n- Row 3: submission\n- Row 4: submission\n- Row 5: submission\n- Row 6: submission\n- Row 7: submission\n- Row 8: tko? No, row 8 method is submission (armbar) as per the data.\n\nWait, looking back at the table provided:\n\nThe rows are:\n\n0: submission\n1: submission\n2: decision\n3: submission (armbar)\n4: submission (armbar)\n5: submission (armbar)\n6: submission (armbar)\n7: submission (armbar)\n8: tko? Let me check row 9.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in counting the rows. The table has 26 rows starting from index 0.\n\nLet me list all methods:\n\nRow 0: submission\n1: submission\n2: decision\n3: armbar (submission)\n4: armbar (submission)\n5: armbar (submission) - loss\n6: armbar (submission) - win\n7: armbar (submission) - loss\n8: tko? No, row 9 is where the method is 'tko'. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the table data:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nRow indices:\n\n0: submission (neck crank)\n1: submission (rear naked choke)\n2: decision\n3: submission (armbar) - win\n4: submission (armbar) - win\n5: submission (armbar) - loss\n6: submission (armbar) - win\n7: submission (armbar) - loss\n8: tko? Let me see:\n\nLooking at row 9 in the table data, which is index 9:\n\n\"method\": \"tko\", result: \"win\"\n\nYes, that's a tko win.\n\nIs there another tko in the method column?\n\nContinuing down:\n\nRow 10: submission (armbar)\nRow 11: decision\n...\nLooking further:\n\nRow 24: decision\nRow 25: submission (armbar)\n\nSo only row 9 has method as 'tko', which is a win.\n\nNow, the claim says \"win 1 time by tko and lose 1 time by tko\".\n\nFrom the table, there's one tko win. But are there any tko losses?\n\nLooking through all methods again:\n\nNo other rows have method as 'tko'. Only row 9 is a tko win.\n\nTherefore, the claim that Keiko Tamia lost once by tko isn't supported because there's no entry where she lost via tko. She only has one tko win and zero tko losses.\n\nThus, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should check if there's an entry in the table that mentions someone named Keiko Tamia. Looking through the 'opponent' column, I see opponents like shayna baszler, marloes coenen, michiko takeda, etc., but I don't see \"keiko tamia\" listed anywhere. That already makes me think there might not be any relevant data for this claim.\n\nThe claim mentions two things: a win and a loss by TKO. So even if Keiko Tamia were in the table, we'd need to find exactly two matches where she either won or lost via TKO. Let's see how many times 'tko' appears as a method in the table.\n\nLooking through each row:\n- The first few entries have methods like submission (neck crank), rear naked choke, etc.\n- I spot \"tko\" in one place: at row 12, which is a loss against Hitomi Akano via armbar. Wait, no, that's not a tko. Let me check again.\nWait, looking back, actually, I think the 'tko' method occurs twice. One instance is a win by TKO in row 13 against Lee Hee-jin, and another as a loss by TKO? No, wait, no\u2014let me recount.\n\nActually, reviewing each row:\n- The first occurrence of \"tko\" is at row 10: it's a loss (res) with method 'tko' against Natsuko Kikukawa.\n- Then in row 13, another 'tko' as a win. So that's two instances where the method was TKO.\n\nBut the claim is about Keiko Tamia having both a win and a loss by TKO. However, since there are no entries for Keiko Tamia in the table, these TKOs don't involve her. The table doesn't mention Keiko Tamia at all, so any claims about her would be unsupported.\n\nTherefore, the claim is FALSE because Keiko Tamia isn't present in the table, and thus we can't verify any wins or losses by her via TKO.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to \"keiko tamia\" having both a win and a loss via TKO.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out if the claim \"keiko tamai lose only 1 time after win her first match\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim is about Keiko Tamai's fight results. It says she lost only once after winning her first match. So, I need to check her record starting from the first win and see how many losses she has afterward.\n\nLooking at the table, it seems to be a list of matches in chronological order, with each row representing a different opponent. The columns include result (win or loss), record before the match, opponent's name, method of victory/defeat, round, and time.\n\nI notice that Keiko Tamai isn't listed as an opponent in any of these rows; instead, her opponents are names like Shayna Baszler, Marloes Coenen, etc. Wait a second\u2014that might be confusing because the table's \"opponent\" column is who she fought against, so all these entries are from Keiko Tamai's perspective.\n\nNow, let me go through each row to see when her first win was and then count how many losses occurred after that.\n\nStarting from the top:\n- The first result is a loss (14-14), opponent Shayna Baszler.\n- Next is another loss (14-13) against Marloes Coenen.\n- Then another loss (14-12) against Michiko Takeda.\n- The fourth row is a win (14-11) against Jan Finney. This would be her first win.\n\nAfter this first win, I need to check all subsequent rows for losses. Let's go through each one:\n\n5th row: Win vs. Mamiko Mamiko (13-11)\n6th row: Loss vs. Hitomi Akano (12-11)\n7th row: Win vs. Kamei Natsuko (12-10)\n8th row: Loss vs. Megumi Fujii (11-10)\n9th row: Loss vs. Natsuko Kikukawa (11-9) via TKO\n10th row: Loss vs. Roxanne Modafferi (11-8)\n11th row: Win vs. Hikaru Shinohara (11-7)\n12th row: Loss vs. Megumi Fujii (10-7)\n13th row: Win vs. Lee Hee-jin (10-6) via TKO\n14th row: Loss vs. Hitomi Akano (9-6)\n15th row: Win vs. Yumiko Sugimoto (9-5)\n16th row: Win vs. Kumiko Maekawa (8-5)\n17th row: Win vs. Ha Na Kim (7-5)\n18th row: Win vs. Etsuko Kato (1-0)\n\nWait, that's a lot of losses after the first win. Let me count them properly.\n\nAfter the first win at row 4, let's look through each subsequent row:\n\nRow 6: Loss\nRow 8: Loss\nRow 9: Loss\nRow 10: Loss\nRow 12: Loss\nSo that's five losses after her first win. But wait, did I count correctly?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake because the record in each row is cumulative. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from row 4 (first win), then:\n\nRow 5: Win, so no loss.\nRow 6: Loss\nRow7: Win\nRow8: Loss\nRow9: Loss\nRow10: Loss\nRow11: Win\nRow12: Loss\nSo that's five losses after the first win.\n\nBut wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me list all the rows from row 4 onwards:\n\nRow 4: Win\nRow5: Win\nRow6: Loss \u2192 1 loss\nRow7: Win\nRow8: Loss \u2192 2 losses\nRow9: Loss \u2192 3 losses\nRow10: Loss \u2192 4 losses\nRow11: Win\nRow12: Loss \u2192 5 losses\nRow13: Win\nRow14: Loss \u2192 6 losses\nRow15: Win\nRow16: Win\nRow17: Win\nRow18: Win\n\nSo, actually, after the first win (row4), there are multiple losses. The claim says she lost only once after her first win, but according to this, she has at least five losses.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe \"after win her first match\" refers to any subsequent matches where she wins again and then how many times she loses after that point. But no, the wording is \"lose only 1 time after win her first match\", which suggests all losses after the first win should be just one.\n\nBut in reality, there are multiple losses after the first win. So the claim is false.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells for this conclusion:\n\n- The first win is at row4 (result: Win). So cell row4, column 'Result'.\n- Then, all subsequent rows where result is Loss would be relevant.

So this is a match ending with a unanimous decision, but it's a loss.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 4: method is submission (armbar), not relevant.\nRow 5: submission (armbar) \u2192 no.\nRow 6: submission (armbar) \u2192 no.\nRow 7: submission (armbar) \u2192 no.\nRow 8: tko \u2192 no.\nRow 9: decision (unanimous). Record is 11-7. This is a win.\n\nRow 10: method is submission (armbar), so no.\nRow 11: submission (armbar) \u2192 no.\nRow 12: tko \u2192 no.\nRow 13: decision (unanimous). Record here is 9-5, a win.\nRow 14: decision (unanimous) again. Record 8-5, win.\n\nWait, let me double-check each row with 'method' as \"decision (unanimous):\n\nRows where method is decision (unanimous):\n- Row 2: loss, record 14-12\n- Row 9: win, record 11-7\n- Row 13: win, record 9-5\n- Row 14: win, record 8-5\n- Row 16: decision (unanimous), record 6-5? Wait no, row 16 is 'win' with method submission. Let me check again.\n\nWait the table has multiple rows:\n\nLooking back, rows where 'method' is \"decision (unanimous)\" are:\nRow 2: loss\nRow 9: win\nRow 13: win\nRow 14: win\nRow 16: no, row 16's method is submission.\nWait let me check each row:\n\nLooking at the table, starting from index 0:\n\n- Row 0: submission (neck crank)\n- Row 1: submission (rear naked choke)\n- Row 2: decision (unanimous) \u2192 loss\n- Row 3: submission (armbar)\n- Row 4: submission (armbar)\n- Row 5: submission (armbar)\n- Row 6: submission (armbar)\n- Row 7: tko\n- Row 8: submission (choke)\nWait, actually, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me list all rows with 'method' as \"decision (unanimous)\":\n\nLooking through each row:\n\nRow index 2: method is decision (unanimous). Record is 14-12.\n\nRow index 9: method is decision (unanimous). Record is 11-7.\n\nRow index 13: method is decision (unanimous). Record is 9-5.\n\nRow index 14: method is submission (armbar), no.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go row by row:\n\n0: submission\n1: submission\n2: decision unanimous \u2192 yes\n3: submission\n4: submission\n5: submission\n6: submission\n7: tko\n8: submission\n9: decision \u2192 yes\n10: submission\n11: submission\n12: submission\n13: decision \u2192 yes\n14: submission\nWait, row 13's method is \"submission (armbar)\", not a decision. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait no, looking back at the table:\n\nLooking at row indices with 'method' as \"decision (unanimous)\":\n\nRow 2: method is \"decision (unanimous)\" \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 9: \"decision (unanimous)\"? Wait let me check:\n\nFrom the initial table provided, each row's method:\n\n- Row 0: submission\n- Row1: submission\n- Row2: decision\n- Row3: submission\n- Row4: submission\n- Row5: submission\n- Row6: submission\n- Row7: tko\n- Row8: submission\n- Row9: method is \"submission (armbar)\"? Wait, in the initial table, row 9's method is \"submission (armbar)\", but wait no\u2014looking back:\n\nWait the table was provided with each row's details. Let me recount.\n\nThe table as given has rows from index 0 to 34. But let me list all rows where 'method' is \"decision (unanimous)\":\n\nLooking through the table:\n\nRow 2: method is \"decision (unanimous)\" \u2192 yes.\n\nThen, looking further down, row 9's method is \"submission (armbar)\", no.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine each row's 'method':\n\n- Row 0: submission\n- Row1: submission\n- Row2: decision (unanimous)\n- Row3: submission\n- Row4: submission\n- Row5: submission\n- Row6: submission\n- Row7: tko\n- Row8: submission\n- Row9: method is \"submission (armbar)\"? Or did I mix up rows?\n\nWait no, in the initial table provided by the user, row 9's details are:\n\n\"loss record 1-2\", but that seems incorrect. Wait perhaps it's better to go through each row step by step.\n\nLooking at the table, starting from index 0:\n\nRow 0: method submission (neck crank)\nRow 1: submission rear naked choke\nRow 2: decision unanimous \u2192 yes\nRow3: submission armbar\nRow4: submission armbar\nRow5: submission armbar\nRow6: submission armbar\nRow7: tko\nRow8: submission choke\nRow9: method is \"submission (armbar)\"? Wait no, row9's details are:\n\n\"win record 1-0. method submission armbar.\"\n\nWait I'm getting confused. Let me list all rows with their method and result.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to note that in the table provided, the only matches ending with a unanimous decision are in row 2 (loss) and possibly others? Or maybe there are more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim refers to a specific fighter named Keiko Tamia, but since she isn't listed in the table, we can't find any relevant cells. Therefore, the claim cannot be supported by the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe claim mentions \"keiko tamia,\" who is not present in the table. Additionally, there's no match with a record of 10-6 ending in a unanimous decision.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
