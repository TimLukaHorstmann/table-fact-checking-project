    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the user has provided a table in markdown format and a specific claim they want to verify as TRUE or FALSE. The task is to check each part of the claim against the table and determine if both conditions are met.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"the fighter win the match against paul weremecki with the method tko (head kick and punches) and win the match against gary padilla with the method decision (split)\". So there are two parts to this claim that need verification. \n\nI'll start by looking for any matches where the opponent is Paul Weremecki. Scanning through the table, I see a row where the opponent is \"paul weremecki\". Let me check that row's details.\n\nIn that row, under the 'res' column, it says 'win', so the fighter did win against Paul. The method of victory was listed as \"tko (head kick and punches)\", which exactly matches what the claim states. So the first part is correct.\n\nNext, I'll look for the match against Gary Padilla. Scanning through again, there's a row where the opponent is \"gary padilla\". Checking the 'res' column here also shows 'win', so that's good. The method of victory in this case was \"decision (split)\", which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nSince both parts of the claim are accurately reflected in the table, each condition is satisfied. Therefore, the claim should be marked as TRUE. \n\nNow, I'll identify the relevant cells for each part to include in the JSON response. For Paul Weremecki's match, it's row 25, specifically the 'res' and 'method' columns. Similarly, Gary Padilla's match is in row 26 under the same columns.\n\nPutting it all together, I can confidently say the answer is TRUE with the relevant cells highlighted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 25, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"res\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"both fight with opponent shamil abdurahimov and houston alexander be loss with method tko (punches) for both.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim. It says that in two fights against opponents named Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander, the result was a loss, and the method of loss was TKO by punches for both.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row to find these opponents.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Evgeny Erokhin - not relevant.\nRow 1: Seung Bae Whi - nope.\nRow 2: Denis Komkin - no.\nRow 3: Jan B\u0142achowicz - no.\nRow 4: Ryan Jimmo - no.\nRow 5: Roy Boughton - no.\nRow 6: Jan B\u0142achowicz again? Wait, row 6 has opponent Jan B\u0142achowicz. Wait, but the name is different here; it's written with a different diacritic perhaps. But in any case, not Shamil or Houston.\nWait, maybe I should look for exact names.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 8: Opponent is Renato Sobral - no.\nRow 9: Luiz Can\u00e9 - no.\nRow 10: Kazuhiro Nakamura - no.\nRow 11: Lyoto Machida - no.\nRow 12: Ricardo Arona - no.\nRow 13: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira - no.\nRow 14: Glover Teixeira - no, but wait, row 14 has opponent Glover Teixeira. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed Shamil and Houston earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the opponents:\n\n- Row 8: Renato Sobral\n- Row 9: Luiz Can\u00e9\n- Row 10: Kazuhiro Nakamura\n- Row 11: Lyoto Machida\n- Row 12: Ricardo Arona\n- Row 13: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira\n- Row 14: Glover Teixeira - wait, no. Let's see.\n\nWait, actually, I think Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander are in the table but perhaps further down or up.\n\nWait, let me look again from the start:\n\nRow 0: Evgeny Erokhin\n1: Seung Bae Whi\n2: Denis Komkin\n3: Jan B\u0142achowicz\n4: Ryan Jimmo\n5: Roy Boughton\n6: Jan B\u0142achowicz\n7: Renato Sobral\n8: Luiz Can\u00e9\n9: Kazuhiro Nakamura\n10: Lyoto Machida\n11: Ricardo Arona\n12: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira\n13: Glover Teixeira\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the correct rows. Let me count the rows properly.\n\nLooking again, row indices start at 0:\n\nRow 0: Evgeny Erokhin - loss with method TKO (punches). Wait, no, in row 8 it's submission. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check each opponent:\n\nShamil Abdurahimov is in which row? Let me scan through the opponents column.\n\nLooking at each opponent name:\n\nRow 0: Evgeny Erokhin\n1: Seung Bae Whi\n2: Denis Komkin\n3: Jan B\u0142achowicz\n4: Ryan Jimmo\n5: Roy Boughton\n6: Jan B\u0142achowicz (row 6)\n7: Renato Sobral\n8: Luiz Can\u00e9\n9: Kazuhiro Nakamura\n10: Lyoto Machida\n11: Ricardo Arona\n12: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira\n13: Glover Teixeira\nWait, perhaps I'm not finding them because they're further down. Let me check the entire table.\n\nContinuing:\n\nRow 8: Opponent Renato Sobral - no.\nRow 9: Luiz Can\u00e9 - no.\nRow 10: Kazuhiro Nakamura? No, wait row 10 is Kazuhiro Nakamura? Or maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check each row's opponent.\n\nWait, let me list all opponents and their corresponding rows:\n\nRow 8: Opponent Renato Sobral\nRow 9: Luiz Can\u00e9\nRow 10: Kazuhiro Nakamura\nRow 11: Lyoto Machida\nRow 12: Ricardo Arona\nRow 13: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira\nRow 14: Glover Teixeira - wait, no. Let me check each row's 'opponent' column.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for the exact names:\n\nLooking for \"Shamil Abdurahimov\":\n\nSearching through all rows, I find that in row 8 (index starting at 0), opponent is Renato Sobral. Hmm, no. Wait, maybe it's in another part of the table.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the losses with method TKO (punches):\n\nLooking for where 'result' is 'loss' and 'method' is 'TKO (punches)'.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Result loss, method TKO (punches). Opponent Evgeny Erokhin. So yes, that's one match with a loss via TKO (punches).\n\nNext, looking for another fight where the result is loss and method is TKO (punches):\n\nRow 1: Win\nRow 2: Win\nRow 3: Loss, submission. Not same method.\nRow 4: Loss, submission. No.\nRow 5: Win.\nRow 6: Loss, KO. Different.\nRow 7: Loss, submission. Different.\nRow 8: Loss, submission. Different.\nRow 9: Loss, submission. Different.\nRow 10: Loss, KO. Different.\nRow 11: Win\nRow 12: Win\nRow 13: Loss, TKO (punches). Opponent Glover Teixeira.\n\nWait, so row 13 has opponent Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira? No, row 13's opponent is Glover Teixeira. Wait, no:\n\nLooking back at the table structure, each row has 'opponent', 'result', 'method'.\n\nSo row 13: Opponent Glover Teixeira, result loss, method TKO (punches). So that's another fight with loss via TKO (punches).\n\nWait, so rows 0 and 13 have losses via TKO (punches), but their opponents are Evgeny Erokhin and Glover Teixeira.\n\nBut the user mentioned Shamil Abdurahimov and Houston Alexander. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check if there's any row with opponent named Shamil or Houston.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: Evgeny Erokhin\n1: Seung Bae Whi\n2: Denis Komkin\n3: Jan B\u0142achowicz\n4: Ryan Jimmo\n5: Roy Boughton\n6: Jan B\u0142achowicz\n7: Renato Sobral\n8: Luiz Can\u00e9\n9: Kazuhiro Nakamura\n10: Lyoto Machida\n11: Ricardo Arona\n12: Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira\n13: Glover Teixeira\nWait, perhaps Shamil is in row 7? No, opponent there is Renato Sobral.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the user provided a different table structure where rows include these names.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial table had more rows beyond what's shown here. But given the current data, it seems that there are two losses via TKO (punches): row 0 and row 13.\n\nSo the answer would be that both fights resulted in a loss by TKO (punches), but against different opponents: Evgeny Erokhin and Glover Teixeira.\n</think>\n\nThere are two instances of a loss with the method \"TKO (punches)\" in the given data. The first instance is against **Evgeny Erokhin** and the second instance is against **Glover Teixeira**.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{2}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim states two things: \n\n1. There's a loss against Glover Teixeira with the method being KO (punches).\n2. There's a win against Jan Nortje with the method being TKO (punches).\n\nFirst, I'll go through each part of the claim step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"the fight against opponent Glover Teixeira be a loss by method KO (punches).\" \n\nI'll scan the table looking for the row where the opponent is Glover Teixeira. Scanning through the rows, I find that in row 24 (indexing from 0), the opponent is listed as \"glover teixeira.\" Let me check the details here: the result is a loss, and the method is KO (punches). So this part of the claim seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \"the fight against Jan Nortje be a win with method TKO (punches).\" \n\nLooking through the table again for Jan Nortje as an opponent. I find Jan Nortje in row 18. Checking that row: result is a loss, method is submission via arm-triangle choke. Hmm, that doesn't match the claim. Wait, maybe I missed another entry.\n\nWait, let me check all rows to make sure. Another possible place might be row 25 where the opponent is \"jan nortje.\" Let me see: result is a win, method is KO (punches). Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, looking back, in row 18, it's a loss against Jan Nortje via submission. But I also see another entry for Jan Nortje in row 25? No, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me recount the rows properly to avoid confusion. The table has multiple entries. Let me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: opponent is not relevant.\n...\nRow 18: Opponent is \"jan nortje\" (lowercase in the table). Result is loss, method submission (arm-triangle choke).\nWait, that's one entry.\n\nLooking again for any other rows with Jan Nortje. I see another row at index 25 where opponent is \"jan nortje,\" but wait no, let me check:\n\nActually, looking back, in the table provided, the opponents are listed as follows:\n\n- Row 18: opponent is \"luiz can\u00e9\"\nWait, maybe I need to double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each row systematically.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"glover teixeira\" \u2014 yes, that's the first part of the claim. Result is loss, method KO (punches). So that checks out.\n\nNow for Jan Nortje: looking through each opponent name:\n\nLooking at row 18: opponent is \"luiz can\u00e9\" \u2014 nope.\nRow 19: opponent is \"kazuhiro nakamura\" \u2014 nope.\nRow 20: opponent is \"renato sobral\" \u2014 nope.\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount from the top:\n\nRows are as follows (starting at 0):\n\n0: ricardo arona\n1: ant\u00f4nio rog\u00e9rio nogueira\n2: glover teixeira\n3: paul weremecki\n4: gary padilla\n\nWait, no, looking back at the table structure provided in the user message:\n\nActually, the table is structured with each fight as a row. So I need to go through each row's \"opponent\" column.\n\nLet me list all opponents from the table for clarity:\n\nRow 0: opponent is \"glover teixeira\"\nRow 1: paul weremecki\nRow 2: gary padilla\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me parse the table correctly.\n\nLooking back at the user-provided table, each row seems to represent a fight with columns: result (win/loss), opponent, method, etc. So I need to list all opponents and their corresponding results and methods.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 0: Opponent is \"glover teixeira\" \u2014 no, wait in the table provided by the user, it's listed as a series of rows with different opponents. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because the table isn't formatted clearly here. Let me try to parse the table correctly.\n\nLooking at the table structure:\n\nThe columns are: result (win/loss), opponent, method, event, date, location.\n\nSo each row represents one fight.\n\nLet's list all the opponents and their results:\n\nRow 0:\nResult: loss\nOpponent: glover teixeira\nMethod: ko (punches)\n\nWait no, looking at the table provided in the user message, it's actually a single line per fight. So I need to parse each line correctly.\n\nLooking again, perhaps the rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0:\nResult: loss\nOpponent: glover teixeira\nMethod: ko (punches)\nEvent: wec 24\nDate: [some date]\nLocation: lemoore, california\n\nWait no, in the table provided by the user, each row is a fight. So I need to check which rows have \"glover teixeira\" and \"jan nortje\".\n\nLooking for \"glover teixeira\": found at row index 23 (assuming starting from 0). Let me count:\n\nRows:\n\n0: opponent glover teixeira? Wait, looking at the data provided in the user message, it's a list of fights. Each fight is represented as a row with several fields.\n\nActually, let me look for \"glover teixeira\" and \"jan nortje\".\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- The first few rows (from top):\n\nOpponent: glover teixeira \u2014 found in the 23rd entry? Wait no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse each fight.\n\nWait, given that it's difficult to count without proper formatting, let me instead search for \"glover teixeira\" and \"jan nortje\".\n\nIn the user's table:\n\nLooking through all lines, opponent glover teixeira is in row 23 (counting from 0), result: loss, method: ko (punches). So that matches the first part of the claim.\n\nNow looking for Jan Nortje. I see two entries with Jan Nortje as opponent:\n\nWait, no, perhaps only one. Let me check each line:\n\n- Row ...: Opponent is \"jan nortje\" \u2014 found in row 25 (if counting from 0). Result: win, method: ko (punches).\n\nBut wait, looking at the table provided by the user, I see a fight against Jan Nortje where result was loss and another where it's win? Or is that not the case.\n\nWait no, perhaps in the table, there's only one entry for each opponent. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the data:\n\n- At row 25: Opponent \"jan nortje\", result: loss, method: submission (arm-triangle choke). Wait, but according to the claim, it should be a win with TKO.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me re-examine the user's table data more carefully.\n\nLooking at the fights:\n\nOpponents listed include \"glover teixeira\" and \"jan nortje\". From the table provided by the user:\n\n- Fight against glover teixeira: result loss, method ko (punches). So that part of the claim is correct.\n\nNow for Jan Nortje: looking for any fights with him. I see in row 25: opponent \"jan nortje\", result: win, method: ko (punches). Wait no, perhaps it's a different fight.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the table. Let me list all opponents:\n\nRow 0: Opponent: ricardo arona \u2014 no\nRow 1: ant\u00f4nio rog\u00e9rio nogueira \u2014 no\nRow 2: glover teixeira \u2014 yes (loss)\n...\nLooking further down:\nRow 18: luiz can\u00e9 \u2014 no\nRow 19: kazuhiro nakamura \u2014 no\nRow 20: renato sobral \u2014 no\nRow 21: kazuyuki Fujita \u2014 no\nRow 22: mamed Khalidov \u2014 no\nRow 23: daniel Sarafian \u2014 no\nRow 24: shamil Abdurashidov \u2014 no\nRow 25: jan nortje \u2014 yes (result: loss, method: submission)\nRow 26: katsunori Kikuno \u2014 no\n\nWait, that's only one fight against Jan Nortje, and it was a loss via submission. So according to the table, there's no win against Jan Nortje with TKO.\n\nBut according to the user's claim, they have both a loss against glover teixeira (which is correct) and a win against jan nortje with tk o.\n\nSo in reality, in the table provided by the user, the fight against jan nortje was a loss. So the claim that it's a win with TKO would be incorrect based on this table.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing another entry for Jan Nortje where it's a win.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- Row 25: opponent \"jan nortje\", result: loss\nAny other row with \"jan nortje\"?\n\nNo, only one fight against him in the table. So according to this, the claim is partially correct (the loss to glover teixeira) but incorrect about the win against Jan Nortje.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because the user's table might have an error or I'm misreading it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended that both fights are wins. So let me summarize:\n\nClaim 1: Loss to glover teixeira via KO (punches) \u2014 correct per table.\nClaim 2: Win against Jan Nortje via TKO \u2014 but according to the table, it's a loss.\n\nSo the claim is partially accurate but has an error regarding the outcome against Jan Nortje.\n</think>\n\nThe user's claims about their fighting record are partially correct based on the provided data. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Loss to Glover Teixeira via KO (Punches):** This is accurate as per the table, which shows a loss with that method.\n\n2. **Win against Jan Nortje via TKO:** This is incorrect. The table indicates a loss against Jan Nortje via submission, not a win or TKO.\n\nIn summary, while the first claim is correct, the second claim does not match the data provided.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. The claim says: \"the fight against opponent glover teixeira be a loss by method ko (punches), but the fight against jan nortje be a win with method tko (punches)\".\n\nFirst, I need to look for two specific opponents in the table: glover teixeira and jan nortje. Let's start with glover teixeira. Scanning through the opponent column, I find that there's an entry where the opponent is \"glover teixeira\". Looking at the corresponding row, the result is a loss, and the method is listed as ko (punches). So that part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to check the fight against jan nortje. Searching for jan nortje in the opponent column, I find his name appears in two rows. The first occurrence shows a win with method tko (punches), and another entry where it's also a win but with a different method. Wait, let me make sure: looking closely, there are two entries for jan nortje? Or is one of them a typo?\n\nWait no, actually, on closer inspection, I see that in the table, \"jan nortje\" appears once as an opponent where the result is a win with method tko (punches). There's another entry where the opponent is \"jan can\u00e9\", but that's different. So for jan nortje specifically, it's a single row where the fight was a win by tko (punches).\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported: the loss against glover teixeira via ko (punches) and the win against jan nortje via tko (punches). So the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"method\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"method\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given claim about the fighter's matches is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nThe claim states: \"the fighter lose the match against paul weremecki with the method tko (head kick and punches) and lose the match against gary padilla with the method decision (split).\"\n\nFirst, I'll break down the claim into two parts:\n\n1. The fighter lost to Paul Weremecki via TKO by head kick and punches.\n2. The fighter also lost to Gary Padilla via a split decision.\n\nI need to verify each part against the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll search for rows where \"opponent\" is either \"paul weremecki\" or \"gary padilla.\"\n\nStarting with Paul Weremecki:\n\n- Scanning through the table, I find a row where the opponent is \"paul weremecki.\" Let's check that row:\n  - The result in \"row_index\": 31\n  - The method is listed as \"tko (head kick and punches)\"\n  - However, under the \"result\" column (though not explicitly named in the table), I can infer from the context of other rows. Wait, actually, looking back at the table structure, each row includes columns like \"You are tasked with...\", but perhaps the actual data is more structured.\n\nWait, upon closer inspection, the table provided doesn't have a separate \"result\" column as such; instead, it seems that each row represents a match, and the method of loss or win is under the \"method\" column. Let me clarify this by looking at the headers:\n\nThe columns are: \"You are tasked with...\", but perhaps in the actual data rows, they include \"opponent\", \"result\", and \"method.\" Alternatively, it's possible that each row has entries like \"opponent\", \"method\", etc.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the table structure. The user provided a table that lists various matches, including opponent names, methods, and results. Each row seems to have multiple columns: for example, under \"Revenue\" and \"Employees,\" but perhaps in this context, it's more about match details.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because the initial instruction mentions a table with headers like \"You are tasked with...\" which might not be accurate. Let me reorient.\n\nLooking at the actual data rows:\n\nEach row seems to have several entries separated by commas, such as \"paul weremecki\", \"tko (head kick and punches)\", etc. So perhaps each row represents a match, with columns like Opponent, Method, Result.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, the table is presented in a code block with headers like \"Revenue\" and \"Employees,\" but that seems to be a mistake because the data rows don't align with those headers. Maybe the user provided an example of how the JSON should look, not the actual table structure.\n\nI think I might have misinterpreted the initial setup. Let me clarify:\n\nThe user presented a table with multiple columns, such as \"Opponent,\" \"Method,\" and \"Result.\" Each row represents a match outcome. The task is to check whether the fighter lost against Paul Weremecki via TKO (head kick and punches) and lost against Gary Padilla via split decision.\n\nSo, let's go through each claim:\n\n1. Against Paul Weremecki: Did the fighter lose with that method?\n   - Looking for opponent \"paul weremecki.\" Let's find that row.\n   - Found at row index 32 (assuming starting from 0), where the result is \"win\" and the method is \"tko (head kick and punches).\" Wait, no\u2014because if it's a win, then the claim that the fighter lost would be false. But in the table provided, each row has multiple entries, so perhaps I need to correctly identify which column corresponds to the result.\n\nWait, looking at the data rows:\n\nEach line seems to have details like \"opponent\", \"method\", and other info. Let's parse the relevant parts.\n\nLooking for opponent Paul Weremecki:\n\nIn the table provided by the user, under the 'opponent' column, I find \"paul weremecki\" in row 31 (assuming rows are zero-indexed). The result is a win, as indicated by \"win\" in that row. Therefore, the claim says the fighter lost to Paul Weremecki, which contradicts the table.\n\nSimilarly, for Gary Padilla:\n\nLooking for opponent \"gary padilla.\" Found in row 32 (if rows are zero-indexed). The result is a win with method \"decision (split).\" So again, the claim states that the fighter lost to Gary Padilla via split decision, but according to the table, it's a win.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the table provided, each row has entries like \"paul weremecki\", \"tko (head kick and punches)\", etc. Let me count from the top.\n\nRow 0: \"glover teixeira\" - loss\nRow 1: \"ricardo arona\" - win\n...\nRow 32: \"gary padilla\" - result is a win, method is decision (split)\nRow 33: ... but perhaps my counting is off. Alternatively, each match is represented with columns such as opponent and result.\n\nWait, perhaps the table has multiple columns per row. For example:\n\nEach data row might have:\n\n- Opponent\n- Method\n- Result\n\nBut without clear headers, it's a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the last few rows:\n\nLooking at the bottom of the table:\n\nRow 32: \"gary padilla\" - method is \"decision (split)\", result is \"win\"\n\nRow 31: \"paul weremecki\" - method is \"tko (head kick and punches)\", result is \"win\"\n\nTherefore, both matches are wins for the fighter, which contradicts the claim that he lost to both opponents.\n\nHence, the initial assessment is incorrect. The user's claim states that the fighter lost against both, but according to the table, it's a win in both cases. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim that the fighter lost to Paul Wermecki and Gary Padilla with the specified methods is false according to the provided data.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Rows:**\n   - Locate rows where the opponents are \"Paul Wermecki\" and \"Gary Padilla.\"\n\n2. **Check Results for Each Opponent:**\n   - For \"Paul Wermecki,\" the result is a win via TKO (head kick and punches).\n   - For \"Gary Padilla,\" the result is also a win via split decision.\n\n3. **Compare with Claim:**\n   - The claim states losses against both opponents, which contradicts the data showing wins.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both matches resulted in victories for the fighter, making the original claim incorrect.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe claim that the fighter lost to Paul Wermecki and Gary Padilla is false based on the provided data. The fighter won both matches with the specified methods.",

Let's go row by row.\n\nLooking at row 8: The opponent is Shamil Abdurahimov. The result is a loss, not a win. So this part of the claim is incorrect because it mentions both fights as wins.\n\nNext, checking for Houston Alexander. Scanning through all rows, I don't see any entry where the opponent is Houston Alexander. It's possible there's a typo or the fight isn't listed in the table provided.\n\nSince one of the fights (Shamil Abdurahimov) resulted in a loss and the other opponent isn't even present in the data, the claim isn't fully supported by the table.

The claim says: \"the fight with opponent gary padilla be in saitama  , japan while the fight with opponent paul weremecki be in mississauga  , ontario  , canada\".\n\nFirst, I'll break down what I need to check. The claim mentions two opponents and their respective locations.\n\nStarting with Gary Padilla: I need to find a row where the opponent is Gary Padilla and see what location that fight was held at. Looking through the table, I scan each row's opponent column for \"gary padilla\". I spot it in the last row. The relevant cells here are 'opponent' as Gary Padilla and 'location' which says san diego  , california  , united states. So according to the table, this fight was in San Diego, not Saitama, Japan.\n\nNext, checking Paul Weremecki: I look for his name in the opponent column. Found him a few rows up. The location for that row is mississauga  , ontario  , canada. That matches what the claim says about Paul Weremecki's fight location.\n\nSo putting it together: Gary Padilla's fight was in San Diego, not Saitama. Since one part of the claim is incorrect (Gary's location), the entire statement isn't fully supported by the table data. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nI need to note the relevant cells that were checked. For Gary Padilla, that's row 24 (assuming rows start at 0) under 'opponent' and 'location'.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim says: \"the fighter have match in country inside of the united state include saitama , japan , birmingham , england , and brisbane , australia\". \n\nWait a minute, first off, the claim mentions that the fighter had matches in countries inside the United States, including Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia). That doesn't quite make sense because those places are not within the United States. So I think maybe there's a misunderstanding or a typo here.\n\nLet me parse this again. The claim says: \"the fighter have match in country inside of the united state include saitama , japan , birmingham , england , and brisbane , australia\". It seems like it's listing countries (or cities) inside the United States, but the listed locations are all outside the US.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is trying to say that the fighter has matches in multiple countries, including those within the United States. So maybe the intended meaning is that the fighter has matches not just in the US but also in other countries like Japan, England, and Australia. But as written, it says \"inside of the united state\" which would include cities inside the US.\n\nBut looking at the locations mentioned: Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia) are all outside the US. So if the claim is saying that within the US, the fighter has matches in those places, that's incorrect because those aren't in the US.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim means that the fighter has had matches in the United States as well as other countries like Japan, England, and Australia. But the wording is a bit confusing.\n\nLet me check the table to see where the fights took place.\n\nLooking through the 'Location' column:\n\n- Saitama (Japan) appears in rows 21, 23.\n- Birmingham (England) appears in row 19.\n- Brisbane isn't listed; looking through all rows, I don't see Brisbane mentioned. Wait, let me check each row carefully.\n\nWait, the 'Location' column shows various places:\n\nRow 0: yokohama, japan\nRow 1: yokohama, japan\nRow 2: anaheim, california (US)\nRow 3: birmingham, england (UK)\nRow 4: las vegas, nevada (US)\nRow 5: saitama, japan\nRow 6: las vegas, nevada (US)\nRow 7: lemoore, california (US)\nRow 8: portland, oregon (US)\nRow 9: san diego, california (US)\n\nSo, the locations include places in the US like anaheim, las vegas, lemoore, portland, san diego. Then other countries: japan (saitama), england (birmingham). I don't see Brisbane, australia in any of the rows.\n\nWait, looking again at all rows:\n\nRow 24: gary padilla's fight is in san diego, which is US.\nSo, the locations are a mix of US cities and other countries. The claim says that the fighter has matches in the United States including saitama (Japan), birmingham (England), and brisbane (Australia). But Saitama and Birmingham aren't in the US; they're in different countries.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check each row again for any mention of Brisbane, Australia.\n\nLooking through all rows:\n\nRow 0: yokohama, japan\nRow 1: yokohama, japan\nRow 2: anaheim, california (US)\nRow 3: birmingham, england (UK)\nRow 4: las vegas, nevada (US)\nRow 5: saitama, japan\nRow 6: las vegas, nevada (US)\nRow 7: lemoore, california (US)\nRow 8: portland, oregon (US)\nRow 9: san diego, california (US)\n\nNo Brisbane mentioned. So the claim is saying that within the US, there are matches in Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and Brisbane (Australia). That's not correct because those places aren't in the US.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is incorrect in its wording. It should say that the fighter has had matches in countries including Japan, England, Australia, as well as the United States. But the way it's phrased makes it seem like these are within the US, which they're not.\n\nSo, according to the table, the fighter did have fights in Saitama (Japan), Birmingham (England), and also in various US cities. However, Brisbane isn't listed anywhere. Therefore, the claim is incorrect because it includes a location (Brisbane) that's not present in the table and incorrectly states that these other locations are within the US.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim lists several locations as being inside the United States, which is inaccurate since Saitama is in Japan, Birmingham in England, and Brisbane in Australia. Additionally, Brisbane doesn't appear in the table. Thus, the claim isn't fully supported.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Location\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Location\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
