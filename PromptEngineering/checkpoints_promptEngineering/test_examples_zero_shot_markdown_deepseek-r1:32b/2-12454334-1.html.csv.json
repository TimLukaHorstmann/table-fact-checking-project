It seems like there's a bit of awkward phrasing here. The claim is stating that the lowest (least) frequency in the list is 89.3 FM. So I need to check if 89.3 FM is indeed the smallest value in the 'frequency' column.\n\nLooking at the table, let me extract all the frequencies:\n\n1. wmhi - 94.7 fm\n2. wmhn - 89.3 fm\n3. wmhq - 90.1 fm\n4. wmhr - 102.9 fm\n5. wmhu - 91.1 fm\n\nNow, I'll list them numerically to make it easier:\n\n- 89.3, 90.1, 91.1, 94.7, 102.9\n\nFrom this list, the smallest frequency is clearly 89.3 FM. The claim states that this is the least frequency in the list, which matches exactly.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all the entries in the 'frequency' column since I need to compare each to find the minimum. Each row contributes a data point necessary for determining the lowest value.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE because 89.3 FM is indeed the least frequency listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"frequency\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
