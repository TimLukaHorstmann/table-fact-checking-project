    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"2 of the 6 games against the brewer were postponed due to snow\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It mentions that out of 6 games against the brewers, 2 were postponed because of snow. So I need to check how many games against the Brewers were actually played and if any were indeed postponed due to snow.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game on a specific date with details like opponent, score, etc. The opponents in question are the Brewers. Let's scan through the rows where the opponent is \"brewers\".\n\nStarting from April 4: \n- April 4 vs Brewers, score 6-2, not postponed.\n- April 5 vs Brewers, score 5-2, not postponed.\n- April 6 vs Brewers, score 4-2, not postponed.\n\nWait, that's three games. Then looking further down:\n\nApril 11: \n- Opponent is Brewers, and the status is \"postponed (snow) rescheduled for july 28\". So this one was postponed due to snow.\nSimilarly, April 12 vs Brewers is also marked as \"postponed (snow)...\" So that's another one.\n\nWait, but when I look at the count of Brewer games: let me check all rows where opponent is Brewers. Let's go through each row:\n\nRow index 2: April 4 - Brewers, not postponed.\nRow index 3: April 5 - Brewers, not postponed.\nRow index 4: April 6 - Brewers, not postponed.\nRow index 10: April 11 - Brewers, postponed due to snow.\nRow index 11: April 12 - Brewers, also postponed due to snow.\nRow index 12: April 13 - Brewers, score 5-4 (10), so played.\n\nWait, that's only five games. Wait, no:\n\nLooking at the table again, after row 4 (April 6 vs Brewers), the next Brewer game is on April 11, then April 12, and then April 13. So total of four games against Brewers? Let me count:\n\n- April 4\n- April 5\n- April 6\n- April 11\n- April 12\n- April 13\n\nWait that's six games in total against the Brewers. Because rows 2,3,4,10,11,12 are all Brewers games.\n\nNow, out of these six, how many were postponed? Looking at the status:\n\nRows 10 and 11 (April 11 and April 12) have \"postponed (snow)\". The others show scores or results. So two games were indeed postponed due to snow.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table shows six games against the Brewers. Among these, two games on April 11 and April 12 are marked as postponed due to snow. \n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify all Brewer games:** Check each row where the opponent is \"brewers.\" There are six such rows (April 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, and 13).\n\n2. **Check for postponements due to snow:** Look at the status of each game:\n   - April 11: Postponed due to snow.\n   - April 12: Postponed due to snow.\n\n3. **Count postponed games:** Two games were postponed because of snow, which matches the claim.\n\n**Answer:** TRUE\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

No, opponent is mariners later on. Wait, no, looking back at the table:\n\nWait, let's clarify each row correctly.\n\nLooking at the provided table, each row has a date and an opponent. Let's list all rows with their attendance:\n\nRow 0: April 1 - Opponent: mariners?

No, looking back at the table:\n\nWait no, actually, the first opponent listed is April 1 against the mariners? Wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait in the table it's April 13 attendance is 13,117.\nWait no, looking at the table:\n\nApril 25: mariners - 31,215\n\nApril 26: mariners - 31,420\n\nApril 27: mariners - 32,160\n\nApril 29: royals - 12,533\n\nApril 30: royals - 13,000?\n\nWait no, perhaps I need to list all attendances accurately.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Let me think differently.\n\nThe claim is that the highest attendance against the mariners was on April 6 with 29,106. But in reality, if we look at the table, there are higher attendances:\n\nLooking back, for example, April 25: 31,215; April 26: 31,420; April 27: 32,160.\n\nSo these are all higher than April 6's 29,106.\n\nTherefore, the highest attendance against mariners was on April 27 with 32,160.\n\nBut in the initial problem statement, it says \"You are tasked to find out the date when the team had their highest attendance against the mariners.\" So perhaps I need to look through all games against mariners and see which had the highest attendance.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nApril 1: Opponent is not specified here; actually, in the initial problem, the user provided a table with multiple dates, opponents, and attendances. But perhaps I need to parse that correctly.\n\nWait, upon closer inspection, perhaps the table starts from April 1 to April 30, listing each game's date, opponent, and attendance.\n\nSo let me list all games against mariners:\n\nLooking through the table provided by the user:\n\n- April 25: mariners - 31,215\n- April 26: mariners - 31,420\n- April 27: mariners - 32,160\n\nSo these are three games against mariners with attendances as above.\n\nThus, the highest attendance was on April 27 with 32,160.\n\nTherefore, the initial claim that April 6 had the highest attendance is incorrect; it's actually April 27.\n</think>\n\nThe date of the highest attendance against the mariners was **April 27**.",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"4 of the game end in a shut out\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, I should understand what a shut-out means in baseball. A shut-out occurs when one team wins without allowing the opposing team to score any runs. So, looking at the 'score' column, if either team has 0, that game could be a shut-out.\n\nI'll go through each row of the table and check the 'score' column for any games where one team scored zero. \n\nStarting with April 1: The score is 6-5 (10). Neither team scored zero, so not a shut-out.\nApril 2: Score is 6-1. Again, neither has zero.\nApril 4: 6-2. No zeros here either.\nApril 5: 5-2. Still no zeros.\nApril 6: 4-2. Nope.\nApril 8: The game was postponed, so no score to consider.\nApril 9: Score is 5-0. Here, the opponent (White Sox) scored zero, so this is a shut-out. I'll note row index 6.\nApril 10: Score is 4-0. Again, White Sox didn't score. That's another shut-out at row index 7.\nApril 11 and 12 are both postponed, so no scores to check.\nApril 13: 3-2. No zeros.\nApril 14: 3-2. Still no zeros.\nApril 15: 7-5. Nope.\nApril 16: 4-3. No shut-out here.\nApril 17: 5-4. Neither team scored zero.\nApril 18: 6-5. No zeros.\nApril 19: 6-0. Here, the opponent (Rangers) didn't score. That's a third shut-out at row index 17.\nApril 20: The date seems skipped in the table, so moving on.\nApril 21 and 22: 5-4 (13), then 7-6. No zeros.\nApril 23: 5-4 (10). Still no shut-out.\nApril 25: 13-8. Neither has zero.\nApril 26: 4-3. No zeros here.\nApril 27: 2-1. Again, neither team scored zero.\nApril 29: 6-5 (10). No zeros.\nApril 30: 1-0. Here, the opponent (Royals) didn't score. That's a fourth shut-out at row index 28.\n\nSo, I found four games that ended in a shut-out: April 9, April 10, April 19, and April 30.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the highest scoring game be play agains the mariner on april 25\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim. The key points are:\n1. It was a high-scoring game.\n2. It was against the Mariners.\n3. The date was April 25.\n\nI'll start by looking through the \"opponent\" column to find all games against the Mariners. Scanning through each row, I see that on April 25, the opponent is indeed the Mariners (row index 23). Let me check other rows to make sure there are no other games against the Mariners with higher scores.\n\nLooking at the score column for the Mariners' game on April 25: it's 13-8. That seems like a high score compared to others in the table. For example, the game on April 26 against the Mariners was 4-3 and April 27 was 2-1. Other games against different opponents have scores like 6-5 or 5-4, which are lower than 13-8.\n\nI should also check if any other games in the table have higher scores than 13-8. Scanning through all rows, I don't see any game with a score higher than 13-8 except for this one against the Mariners on April 25. The total runs scored were 13 and 8, which are both quite high compared to other games.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because the highest-scoring game listed in the table was indeed against the Mariners on April 25 with a score of 13-8.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the highest scoring game was played against the Mariners on April 25. Checking the table, on April 25, the opponent is the Mariners and the score is 13-8, which is higher than any other game in the table.\n\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify relevant rows**: Look for games against the Mariners.\n   - The only game against the Mariners with a high score is on April 25 (row index 23).\n\n2. **Check scores**: Compare the score of this game to others.\n   - The score 13-8 is higher than all other games listed.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The claim is accurate as it correctly identifies the highest-scoring game against the Mariners on April 25.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n    ]\n}\n```",

I need to verify if this is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look through each row where the opponent is \"white sox\" because that's the focus of the claim. The relevant rows are April 1, April 2, and April 9. \n\nFor April 1: The attendance was 40299. That's definitely more than 1000.\nApril 2 had an attendance of 31310, which is also way above 1000.\nLooking at April 9, the attendance was listed as 746. That's under 1000.\n\nNow, to check if this was indeed the least attended game overall, I'll scan through all the other games in the table. Most of the attendances are in the thousands, like April 5 with 31226 and others around that range. The lowest I see is 746 on April 9 against the White Sox. \n\nWait a minute, but there's another game against the White Sox on April 10 with an attendance of 14180, which is still higher than 746. So, the April 9 game does have the lowest attendance in the table.\n\nTherefore, the claim that \"less than 1000 crowd attend the game against the white sox make it the least attended game\" is TRUE because the attendance on April 9 was 746, which is indeed less than 1000 and the lowest compared to all other games listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It's stating that out of 6 games played against the Brewers, two were postponed because of cold weather.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll go through each row and check for games against the Brewers and whether they were postponed.\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nRow 2 (april 4) - Opponent is brewers, score is 6-2. Not postponed.\nRow 3 (april 5) - brewers, score 5-2. Not postponed.\nRow 4 (april 6) - brewers, score 4-2. Not postponed.\n\nWait, but looking at april 8, opponent is white sox, and it's a postponed game due to cold weather. So that's one postposed game against the white sox. But for the Brewers:\n\nLooking through all rows where opponent is 'brewers' (rows 4-6, then row 13 onwards? Let me check each row.\n\nWait, april 8: opponent is white sox. So, looking again at april 4 to april 6: three games against brewers, none were postponed because the score column shows actual scores, not 'postponed'.\n\nThen, april 7 isn't in the table; next is april 9 (white sox), april 10 (white sox), then april 11 and 12 are both against brewers. Let me check:\n\napril 11: opponent brewers, score is 'postponed (snow) rescheduled for july 28'\napril 12: same as april 11.\n\nSo that's two games against Brewers that were postponed, but the reason given is snow, not cold weather. The claim says \"due to cold weather,\" so this might be a discrepancy.\n\nWait, in row index 6 (april 4), opponent is brewers and score is 6-2; no postponement.\n\nThen april 11 and 12: both games against Brewers were postponed but due to snow, not cold weather. So the claim says two were postponed because of cold weather, but according to the table, these were because of snow.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't accurate based on the reasons provided in the table.

So, I should check these rows to see if they match both conditions and have the highest attendance.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- April 18 against Rangers has an attendance of 30,452.

I need to go through each row and check if either team has a score of 0.\n\nLet me start going through each row one by one:\n\n1. April 1: Score is 6-5 (10). Neither team scored zero, so not a shut-out.\n2. April 2: Score is 6-1. Again, no zeros here.\n3. April 4: 6-2. No zeros.\n4. April 5: 5-2. Still no zeros.\n5. April 6: 4-2. Not a shut-out.\n6. April 8: The game was postponed and rescheduled. So, it's not a completed game, hence no shut-out here.\n7. April 9: Score is 5-0. Here, the opponent (White Sox) scored zero runs. This counts as a shut-out because our team won with 5 runs.\n8. April 10: 4-0. Again, the opponent has zero runs. Another shut-out.\n9. April 11 and 12: Both games were postponed due to snow, so no scores to consider here.\n10. April 13: Score is 3-2. No zeros.\n11. April 25: 13-8. Neither team has zero runs.\n12. April 26: 4-3. No zeros.\n13. April 27: 2-1. Still no shut-out.\n14. April 29: 6-5 (10). No zeros here.\n15. April 30: 1-0. Opponent has zero runs, so this is a shut-out.\n\nWait, let's recount the rows where there was a shut-out:\n\n- April 9: Yes\n- April 10: Yes\n- April 30: Yes\n\nThat's only three instances where one team scored zero. The claim says six games ended in a shut-out, but according to this analysis, I've found only three such games.\n\nI need to double-check if there are any other rows that might have been missed or if the scores were misunderstood. For example, April 25: 13-8 doesn't involve zero. April 26 and 27 also don't have zeros. Looking again at all the scores:\n\nAnother possible point of confusion could be games with extra innings, like April 1 and others. But in those cases, both teams still scored runs, so they don't count as shut-outs.\n\nSo, based on this, only three games ended in a shut-out, not six. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"less than 500 crowd attend the game against the white sox, make it the least attended game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim. It says that there was a game against the White Sox where attendance was less than 500, and this was the least attended game overall.\n\nI'll start by looking through each row in the table to find all games against the White Sox. \n\nLooking at the 'opponent' column:\n- April 1: white sox\n- April 2: white sox\n- April 9: white sox\n- April 10: white sox\n\nNow, I need to check the attendance for each of these games.\n\nFor April 1, the attendance is 40299.\nApril 2: 31310.\nApril 9: 746.\nApril 10: 14180.\n\nSo among these, the smallest attendance against the White Sox is on April 9 with 746 attendees. That's less than 500? Wait, no, 746 is more than 500. So actually, none of the games against the White Sox had attendance below 500.\n\nWait a second, that might not be correct. Let me double-check. April 9 has an attendance of 746, which is indeed above 500. There are no other games against the White Sox with lower attendance in this table.\n\nNow, to see if any game had less than 500 attendees overall. Looking through all rows:\n\nApril 8 and some others have \"postponed\" but their attendance isn't applicable as the games were rescheduled. The only game where attendance might be low is April 9 with 746.\n\nBut wait, looking back, are there any other games that could have lower attendance? Let's check all 'attendance' cells:\n\n- April 1: 40299\n- April 2: 31310\n- April 8: postponed (N/A)\n- April 9: 746\n- April 10: 14180\n- ... other rows have higher attendances.\n\nSo the lowest attendance is 746 on April 9 against the White Sox. Since 746 is greater than 500, there's no game with less than 500 attendees. Therefore, the claim that a game against the White Sox had less than 500 attendees and was the least attended is FALSE because even the lowest attendance (746) is above 500.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other games. Scanning through all rows:\n\nApril 21: no, opponent isn't White Sox.\nApril 29 and April 30 are against Royals with attendances 12533 and 13004 respectively.\n\nNo, so the only game with attendance less than 10,000 is April 9's 746. So the claim that a White Sox game had less than 500 is false because it was 746. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the highest scoring game was played against the Mariners on April 26\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the relevant columns: 'date', 'opponent', and 'score'. The claim mentions April 26, so I should find the row where the date is April 26.\n\nLooking through the table:\n- April 25: Opponent is Mariners, score is 13-8.\n- April 26: Opponent is Mariners, score is 4-3.\nWait, but that's not correct. Let me check again.\n\nOh no, I made a mistake. April 25 is against the Mariners with a score of 13-8, and April 26 is also against the Mariners with 4-3? That doesn't seem right because 13-8 would be higher than 4-3. Maybe I need to double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the dates. Let me go row by row:\n\nLooking through each date:\n- April 1: White Sox, 6-5 (10)\n- April 2: White Sox, 6-1\n- April 4: Brewers, 6-2\n- April 5: Brewers, 5-2\n- April 6: Brewers, 4-2\n- April 8: Postponed\n- April 9: White Sox, 5-0\n- April 10: White Sox, 4-0\n- April 11: Postponed\n- April 12: Postponed\n- April 13: Brewers, 3-2\n- April 14: Royals, 3-2\n- April 15: Royals, 7-5\n- April 16: Not listed in the table.\n- April 17: Not listed.\n- April 18: Not listed.\n- April 19: Not listed.\n- April 20: Not listed.\n- April 21: Not listed.\n- April 22: Angels, 7-6\n- April 23: Angels, 5-4 (10)\n- April 25: Mariners, 13-8\n- April 26: Mariners, 4-3\n- April 27: Mariners, 2-1\n- April 29: Royals, 6-5 (10)\n- April 30: Royals, 1-0\n\nWait a second, I might have missed some rows. Let me recount the rows provided. The table starts from row index 0 to row index 31 (assuming each date is a separate row). But looking at the dates, April 25 is row 24, April 26 is row 25, and so on.\n\nWait no, perhaps I miscounted the rows. Let me list all the rows with their indexes:\n\nRow 0: April 1\nRow 1: April 2\nRow 2: April 4\nRow 3: April 5\nRow 4: April 6\nRow 5: April 8 (postponed)\nRow 6: April 9\nRow 7: April 10\nRow 8: April 11 (postponed)\nRow 9: April 12 (postponed)\nRow 10: April 13\nRow 11: April 14\nRow 12: April 15\nRow 13: April 16? No, wait the next date is April 17? Wait no, looking at the table provided:\n\nThe table skips some dates. Let's see the exact order as given in the problem:\n\nLooking back, the rows are listed from April 1 to April 30, but with some days skipped due to postponements or not played.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through each row one by one and note down the score against the Mariners.\n\nGoing through each row:\n\nRow 24: April 25, opponent Mariners, score 13-8\nRow 25: April 26, opponent Mariners, score 4-3\nRow 26: April 27, opponent Mariners, score 2-1\n\nSo the games against the Mariners are on April 25 (13-8), April 26 (4-3), and April 27 (2-1).\n\nNow, I need to find the highest-scoring game. The claim says it was on April 26. But looking at the scores:\n\nApril 25: 13-8 totals to 21 points.\nApril 26: 4-3 totals to 7 points.\nApril 27: 2-1 totals to 3 points.\n\nSo clearly, the highest-scoring game against the Mariners was on April 25 with a score of 13-8. Therefore, the claim that it was on April 26 is incorrect.\n\nWait but in my initial analysis, I might have misread the rows. Let me confirm again:\n\nLooking at row indexes and their dates:\n\nRow index 0: April 1\nRow 1: April 2\nRow 2: April 4\nRow 3: April 5\nRow 4: April 6\nRow 5: April 8 (postponed)\nRow 6: April 9\nRow 7: April 10\nRow 8: April 11 (postponed)\nRow 9: April 12 (postponed)\nRow 10: April 13\nRow 11: April 14\nRow 12: April 15\nRow 13: April 16? No, because the next available date after April 15 is April 17, but looking back at the table provided, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me list all rows as per their row index:\n\n- Row 0: April 1\n- Row 1: April 2\n- Row 2: April 4\n- Row 3: April 5\n- Row 4: April 6\n- Row 5: April 8 (postponed)\n- Row 6: April 9\n- Row 7: April 10\n- Row 8: April 11 (postponed)\n- Row 9: April 12 (postponed)\n- Row 10: April 13\n- Row 11: April 14\n- Row 12: April 15\n- Row 13: April 16? No, because the table shows that after April 15 comes April 17? Wait no, in the problem description, the dates continue without skipping.\n\nWait perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is to find which game against the Mariners has the highest score. It's on April 25 (row index 24) with a score of 13-8. So the claim that it was on April 26 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, the highest-scoring game against the Mariners was on April 25, not April 26.\n</think>\n\nThe highest-scoring game against the Mariners occurred on April 25 with a score of 13-8. Therefore, the claim that it happened on April 26 is incorrect.\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{April }25}$",
