    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"each and every competitor compete in different weight class\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table shows. It's a markdown table with columns: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, final. Each row represents an athlete and their performance in various rounds of a competition.\n\nThe claim is about whether every competitor (athlete) is in a different weight class. So I need to check the 'event' column for each athlete because that's where the weight class should be specified.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov - finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov - flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov - bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev - lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov - welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nEach athlete is in a distinct weight category: finweight, flyweight, bantamweight, lightweight, and welterweight, each with their own specific weight limits.\n\nSince all the athletes are listed under different weight classes, the claim that \"each and every competitor compete in different weight class\" is true. There's no overlap in the weight classes; each has a unique event category.\n\nThe relevant cells to verify this are all the 'event' entries for each athlete.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out whether the claim \"not 1 Kazakhstani advance to the quarterfinal or past that\" is true or false based on the provided table. Let me start by understanding what each part of the claim means.\n\nFirst, the claim says that no Kazakhstani athletes advanced beyond the round of 32 into the quarterfinals or further stages. So, I need to check for each athlete in the table if they reached at least the quarterfinals or went past it.\n\nLooking at the table structure: It has columns like event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and final. The rows list different athletes with their respective performances.\n\nI should go through each athlete's progress step by step:\n\n1. **Nariman Shakirov**: He is in the -54 kg finweight category.\n   - Round of 32: Won against Mateus Soares (TLS) with a score of 19-5.\n   - Round of 16: Lost to Ajaaiman Al-Ojaiman (Kuw) with a score of 4-6. Since he lost in the round of 16, he didn't reach the quarterfinals.\n\n2. **Zhalgas Bekkassymov**: Competing in -58 kg flyweight.\n   - Round of 32: Had a bye, meaning he automatically advanced to the next round without fighting.\n   - Round of 16: Lost to Pen-Ek Karaket (Tha) with a score of 3-4. So, he didn't make it past the round of 16.\n\n3. **Darkhan Kassymkulov**: In the -63 kg bantamweight category.\n   - Round of 32: Beat Surendra Bhandari (Kuw) with a score of 8-7.\n   - Round of 16: Lost to Jawad Lakzaee (Afghanistan) with a score of 5-10. Therefore, he didn't reach the quarterfinals.\n\n4. **Aibar Dyussebayev**: Competing in -74 kg lightweight.\n   - Round of 32: Had a bye, so advanced directly to the round of 16.\n   - Round of 16: Lost to Dmitriy Kim (Uzbekistan) with a score of 3-4. Hence, he didn't proceed beyond that.\n\n5. **Sultan Kassymov**: In the -80 kg welterweight category.\n   - Round of 32: Also had a bye.\n   - Round of 16: Lost to Alisher Gulov (Tajikistan) with a score of 2-6, meaning he didn't advance further.\n\nNow, looking at each athlete's progress:\n\n- **Nariman Shakirov**: Did not advance past round of 16.\n- **Zhalgas Bekkassymov**: Did not advance past round of 16.\n- **Darkhan Kassymkulov**: Did not advance past round of 16.\n- **Aibar Dyussebayev**: Did not advance past round of 16.\n- **Sultan Kassymov**: Did not advance past round of 16.\n\nNone of the athletes reached the quarterfinals or beyond. Therefore, the claim that \"not 1 Kazakhstani advanced to the quarterfinal or past that\" is true because all of them stopped at the round of 16 or earlier stages.\n\nTo support this conclusion, I should identify the relevant cells in each row that show their progress up to the quarterfinals. Each athlete's 'quarterfinals' column shows \"did not advance,\" which directly supports the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"quarterfinals\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether the claim \"the lightest competitor weighs 54 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and final. Each row represents a different athlete with their respective details.\n\nThe claim is about the lightest competitor's weight, which would relate to the \"event\" column since events in wrestling typically have specific weight categories. Let me check each event listed:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: Finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov: Flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov: Bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev: Lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov: Welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nLooking at these, the weight categories are listed as \"finweight (-54 kg)\", which is the smallest number here. So, the lightest competitor would be in the -54 kg category.\n\nThe claim says \"the lightest competitor weigh 54 kilogram.\" Wait a minute, the table shows \"-54 kg\" for Nariman Shakirov's event. The negative sign might indicate that it's the upper limit of his weight category. So, he is at most 54 kg. Therefore, if someone claims the lightest is exactly 54 kg, that might not be accurate because in reality, -54 kg means up to 54 kg, but the actual weight could be less.\n\nBut maybe the claim is considering the categories as exact weights. If that's the case, then the lightest category is indeed 54 kg. However, I'm a bit confused because typically in sports, these are upper limits, not exact weights. So, if someone says the lightest competitor weighs exactly 54 kg, it might be misleading since they could weigh less than that.\n\nBut perhaps the claim is referring to the weight category, which is labeled as -54 kg. In that case, the lowest category is 54 kg. So, maybe the claim is TRUE based on the categories provided.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The events are listed with their respective weight limits: finweight (-54 kg), flyweight (-58 kg), and so on. So Nariman Shakirov's event is for competitors up to 54 kg. Therefore, he might be around that weight or lighter. But the claim says \"weigh 54 kilogram,\" implying exactly 54 kg.\n\nI'm a bit unsure because in sports like wrestling, the categories are weight classes where athletes must weigh at or below a certain limit. So, while Nariman's category is up to 54 kg, he might not necessarily weigh exactly 54 kg; he could be lighter.\n\nBut if the claim is about the lightest competitor's category being 54 kg, then it's TRUE. However, since the wording says \"weigh,\" it might be more precise to say that his weight is up to 54 kg rather than exactly 54.\n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. I think in this context, the table provides the event categories, and the lightest category is -54 kg, which would mean the competitors in that category are lighter than or equal to 54 kg. So, the lightest competitor's maximum weight is 54 kg. Therefore, if someone claims the lightest competitor weighs 54 kg, it could be misleading because they might weigh less. But since the table doesn't provide exact weights, just categories, perhaps the claim is based on the category.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the claim is about the category, not the exact weight. So considering that, the answer would be TRUE because the lightest category is 54 kg.\n</think>\n\nThe claim refers to the event category of -54 kg, indicating the lightest competitors are in this class. \n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh 80 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that the heaviest athlete in the competition weighs 80 kilograms. So, my goal is to check if any of the athletes listed in the table have a weight category of -80 kg and determine if they are indeed the heaviest.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a column called \"event\" which mentions different weight categories for each athlete. The weights mentioned include finweight (-54 kg), flyweight (-58 kg), bantamweight (-63 kg), lightweight (-74 kg), and welterweight (-80 kg). \n\nThe term \"-80 kg\" likely refers to the upper limit of that weight category, meaning athletes in this category weigh up to 80 kilograms. So, the heaviest category here is welterweight at -80 kg.\n\nNow, looking at each athlete's event:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov: flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov: bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev: lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov: welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nSultan Kassymov is the only one in the -80 kg category, which suggests he's the heaviest competitor at 80 kilograms. \n\nI should also check if there are any other weight categories beyond -80 kg that might indicate a heavier athlete, but looking through all rows, the highest category listed is welterweight (-80 kg). Therefore, Sultan Kassymov in the welterweight category is indeed the heaviest.\n\nTo support this claim, I'll identify the relevant cells. The event column for each row gives the weight category, so each athlete's event is important to determine their weight class. Additionally, looking at the specific details about Sultan Kassymov in row 4 confirms his participation in the -80 kg category.\n\nSo, the claim that the heaviest competitor weighs 80 kilograms is TRUE because Sultan Kassymov is in the welterweight (-80 kg) division, which is the highest listed category. All other athletes are in lower weight categories.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"athlete\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitor be 65.8 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the table structure. The table has six columns: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and final. However, I'm more interested in the \"event\" column because it mentions the weight categories of each competitor. The other columns seem to detail their progress through various rounds but don't provide information about their weights.\n\nLooking at each row:\n1. Nariman Shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov is in flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov is in bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev is in lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov is in welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nEach of these events corresponds to specific weight limits, which are the upper bounds for each category. So, the weights listed are the maximums that each competitor would weigh at or below.\n\nTo find the mean weight of all competitors, I need the exact weights of each athlete. However, the table only provides the upper limit of their weight categories, not their actual weights. For example, Nariman is in -54 kg, which means he weighs up to 54 kg, but could be less. Without knowing each competitor's precise weight, it's impossible to calculate an accurate mean.\n\nAdditionally, there are five competitors listed. If we were to take the upper limits as their weights (which isn't correct because they might weigh less), their weights would be 54, 58, 63, 74, and 80 kg. Calculating the mean of these numbers:\n\n(54 + 58 + 63 + 74 + 80) / 5 = (329) / 5 \u2248 65.8 kg\n\nHmm, that's interesting because it matches the claim exactly. But wait, this approach assumes each competitor weighs exactly at their category's upper limit, which isn't necessarily true. Athletes often weigh just below these limits to compete in a specific category. Therefore, using the upper limits might overestimate some competitors' weights.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that their actual weights are less than or equal to those upper limits, the mean could be lower than 65.8 kg. For example, suppose each competitor is at least 1 kg below the limit:\n\nNariman: 53\nZhalgas: 57\nDarkhan: 62\nAibar: 73\nSultan: 79\n\nMean = (53 + 57 + 62 + 73 + 79) / 5 = 324 /5 = 64.8 kg, which is less than 65.8.\n\nBut without specific weights, we can't determine the exact mean. The table doesn't provide individual athlete's weights; it only provides their weight categories.\n\nTherefore, while using the upper limits gives a mean of approximately 65.8 kg, this isn't necessarily accurate because athletes typically weigh less than the category limit. Since the table lacks actual weight data for each competitor, we cannot definitively verify the claim. The information required to compute the mean is not available in the provided table.\n\nSo, the claim's truth cannot be confirmed with the given data. Therefore, it should be marked as FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

It has columns: athlete, event, round of 32, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, final.\n\nI need to check each row to see if any competitors advanced beyond the quarterfinals. The claim is about how many from Kazakhstan made it that far. \n\nLooking at each athlete:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: His event is finweight (-54 kg). He lost in the round of 32 with a loss of 4-6. So, he didn't advance beyond the round of 32.\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov: Flyweight (-58 kg). He had a bye in the round of 32 but then lost in the round of 16 with a score of 3-4. So, no further advancement.\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov: Bantamweight (-63 kg). Won his first match but lost in the round of 16. Again, didn't make it to the quarterfinals.\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev: Lightweight (-74 kg). Also had a bye in round of 32 but lost in the next round with a score of 3-4.\n5. Sultan Kassymov: Welterweight (-80 kg).

All have \"did not advance\" under quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. \n\nSo according to this table, no one from Kazakhstan made it to the quarterfinals or beyond. But the claim says only one did. Since none actually advanced, the claim is FALSE.\n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any entries. Let me double-check each row:\n\n- Nariman: Lost in R32.\n- Zhalgas: Bye then lost in R16.\n- Darkhan: Won R32, lost R16.\n- Aibar: Bye, lost R16.\n- Sultan: Bye, lost R16.\n\nAll did not advance beyond R16.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The table lists several athletes with their respective events and progression through different rounds. Each row represents an athlete, and under each round column, it shows whether they won (w pts) or lost (l pts) against another competitor.\n\nThe claim is that each competitor competes in only the same weight class. I think this means that for any given event (which includes a specific weight category), all competitors should be in that same weight class and not switch or compete in different classes during the competition.\n\nLooking at the table, each athlete has an \"event\" which specifies their weight class. For example, Nariman Shakirov is in finweight (-54 kg). Now, I need to check if any of these athletes are listed under multiple events or different weight categories.\n\nScanning through each row:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: Finweight (-54 kg) only.\n2.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the lightest competitor weighs more than 54 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. \n\nFirst, let me understand the table structure. The table lists several athletes with their respective weight categories and match results. Each row represents an athlete, and the columns include 'athlete', 'event', and various rounds of matches.\n\nThe claim is about the lightest competitor's weight. So, I need to find out which weight category corresponds to the lightest athlete. Looking at the 'event' column:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov: finweight (-54 kg)\n2.

The claim states that this competitor weighs more than 54 kg. \n\nWait, there's a confusion here. In weight categories, the number usually indicates the upper limit.

So, if the lightest competitor is in -54 kg category, their actual weight should be less than or equal to 54 kg.\n\nTherefore, the claim that they weigh more than 54 kg would be FALSE because the maximum allowed is 54 kg, so they can't exceed it.\n</think>\n\nThe lightest competitor is in the finweight (-54 kg) category, meaning their weight does not exceed 54 kg.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine whether the claim \"the heaviest competitor weigh less than 80 kilogram\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: it says that all competitors have a weight of less than 80 kg. So, I need to check each athlete's weight category and ensure none of them are 80 kg or more.\n\nLooking at the table, there are five athletes with their respective weight categories:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov - finweight (-54 kg)\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov - flyweight (-58 kg)\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov - bantamweight (-63 kg)\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev - lightweight (-74 kg)\n5. Sultan Kassymov - welterweight (-80 kg)\n\nThe claim is about the heaviest competitor, which would be the one in the highest weight category. Here, Sultan Kassymov is in the welterweight category of -80 kg. The dash before the number typically indicates the maximum weight for that category. So, a welterweight at -80 kg means the upper limit is 80 kg.\n\nThe claim states that the heaviest competitor weighs less than 80 kg. However, the -80 kg category includes athletes up to 80 kg. That means Sultan could weigh exactly 80 kg or just below it. The exact weight isn't specified in the table, but since the category is capped at 80 kg, the heaviest competitor's weight might be equal to or less than 80 kg.\n\nBut wait, the claim says \"less than\" 80 kg, not \"at most\". If an athlete weighs exactly 80 kg, that would make the claim FALSE because 80 is not less than 80. However, in weight categories, often the maximum is exclusive. For example, a -80 kg category might mean up to but not including 80 kg. In that case, all competitors are under 80 kg.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about this because sometimes categories can be inclusive or exclusive. But given that the claim uses \"less than\" and the table's data, we should consider whether any athlete is at or above 80 kg. Since Sultan's category is -80 kg, it depends on how the category is defined.\n\nIf the category is up to 80 kg (exclusive), then all are under 80. If inclusive, someone could be exactly 80. But without exact weights, we can't be certain. However, based on standard weight classifications in sports, categories like welterweight (-80 kg) usually mean up to but not including 80 kg.\n\nTherefore, considering that, the heaviest competitor would be under 80 kg, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists the weight categories for each athlete. The highest category is -80 kg (welterweight), which typically means competitors weigh less than 80 kg. Therefore, all athletes weigh less than 80 kg.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"the mean weight of all competitor be less than 60 kilogram\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The table has columns like 'athlete', 'event', and various rounds with their results. However, the column that's relevant here is the 'event' column because it mentions the weight categories for each athlete.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Nariman Shakirov is in the finweight (-54 kg) category.\n2. Zhalgas Bekkassymov is in flyweight (-58 kg).\n3. Darkhan Kassymkulov is in bantamweight (-63 kg).\n4. Aibar Dyussebayev is in lightweight (-74 kg).\n5. Sultan Kassymov is in welterweight (-80 kg).\n\nEach athlete's weight category is listed after the hyphen, so I can extract those numbers: 54, 58, 63, 74, and 80 kilograms.\n\nNow, to find the mean weight, I need to average these values. Let me add them up:\n\n54 + 58 = 112\n112 + 63 = 175\n175 + 74 = 249\n249 + 80 = 329\n\nTotal sum is 329 kg. There are 5 athletes, so the mean is 329 / 5.\n\nCalculating that: 329 \u00f7 5 equals 65.8 kilograms.\n\nThe claim states that the mean should be less than 60 kg. But 65.8 is greater than 60, so the claim is false.\n\nI'll also note the relevant cells for each athlete's weight category to support my answer.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"event\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"event\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
