    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"telmo and paulo play on the same team as no 6 and no 9\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the table represents. It seems like each row corresponds to a different scenario or situation in a game or competition, possibly something like Big Brother where people are evicted over days. The columns labeled 'no1' through 'no9' might represent different teams or categories, and the last column is the final status.\n\nThe claim mentions \"telmo\" and \"paulo,\" so I need to find their positions in the table. Let's look for these names across the relevant cells.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- In row 13 (index starts from 0), under 'no6', it says 'carla paulo'. So, Paulo is listed here.\n- Under 'no9' in the same row, we see 'telmo'.\n  \nWait, that's interesting. So in row 13, both telmo and paulo are mentioned under 'no9' and 'no6' respectively.\n\nNow, I need to check if they are on the same team. The claim says they play on the same team as no6 and no9. Since Paulo is listed under no6 and Telmo under no9 in row 13, does that mean they're on the same team? It seems so because they are both part of the same team configuration in this row.\n\nI should also check other rows to see if there's any conflicting information, but from a quick glance, row 13 is the only one where both telmo and paulo appear together under these columns. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the claim holds true because both are part of no6 and no9 in the same row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"no6\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"no9\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim is: \"susana z\u00e9 maria and susana telmo play on the same team as the 4th and 5th player respectively.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. It seems like it's saying that Susana Z\u00e9 Maria is the 4th player and Susana Telmo is the 5th player on the same team.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different scenario or perhaps a different round in the game. The columns are labeled no1 to final. However, the exact meaning of these columns isn't clear from the data provided. I think \"no1\" might refer to a position or role, like first player, second player, etc.\n\nThe claim mentions two specific names: Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo. So, I need to find rows where these names appear in positions 4 and 5, respectively.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 0: no4 is \"susana z\u00e9 maria\" (assuming the fourth column is no4). The fifth column would be no5, which here is \"telmo\". So Susana Z\u00e9 Maria is in position 4, and Telmo is in position 5. Wait, but the claim says both are Susanas. This doesn't fit because one is Telmo.\n\n- Row 1: no4 is \"susana z\u00e9 maria\" again, and no5 is \"telmo\". Same as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check all rows for occurrences of these names in positions 4 and 5.\n\nLooking further down:\n\nRow 12: The no3 column has \"susana z\u00e9 maria\" and no4 has \"telmo\". But again, it's not matching both being Susanas.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the columns. Let me check the table structure more carefully. The columns are named as follows: no1, no2, ..., no10, final. So each row lists 10 players (no1 to no10), and then the final team.\n\nSo, in each row, the first 10 cells represent the 1st to 10th players on a team. The claim is about two specific players being 4th and 5th respectively.\n\nLooking for any row where both Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo appear in positions 4 and 5.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each row again more carefully.\n\nLooking at Row 0:\n- no4: \"susana z\u00e9 maria\"\n- no5: \"telmo\"\n\nSo Susana Z\u00e9 Maria is 4th, Telmo is 5th. But the claim says both are Susanas. So this doesn't fit.\n\nRow 1:\n- same as row 0? No, let me check. Wait, Row 1 might be another scenario. Let's see:\n\nWait, actually, looking at rows from 0 to 12, I don't see any other occurrence where both positions 4 and 5 are Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the claim is about two different teams, but no, it says \"on the same team.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some row, position 4 is Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and position 5 is Susana Telmo.\n\nLooking again:\n\nRow 0: no4 = susana z\u00e9 maria, no5 = telmo. So Susana Z\u00e9 Maria is 4th, but the 5th is Telmo, not another Susana.\n\nIs there any row where both positions are Susanas? Let's check all rows.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Rows 0 to 12: I don't see any other occurrence of \"susana telmo\" except in some final columns. Wait, in the last few rows (rows 13 to 15), there are different team compositions.\n\nWait, let's check Row 14:\n\nRow 14:\n- no4: \"s\u00f3nia\"\n- no5: \"paulo\"\n\nNope, not relevant.\n\nRow 13:\n- The first few columns have multiple names, but it's unclear if they're in positions 4 and 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table structure. Maybe each row represents a different team composition with all players listed from no1 to no10, followed by final.\n\nSo, for example, Row 12: all housemates... It might be a special case where everyone is in the house.\n\nBut regardless, I need to find any row where both positions 4 and 5 are Susana Z\u00e9 Maria and Susana Telmo. From what I can see, no such row exists. In Row 0 and 1, position 4 is susana z\u00e9 maria, but position 5 is telmo, not another susana.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't supported by any of the data in the table. So the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim \"richardo v be the no9 team that have no6 play paulo\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It seems like it's talking about a specific row where 'ricardo v' is in column 'no9', and in that same row, column 'no6' has 'paulo'. \n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents different team compositions on various days. The columns go from no1 to final, with some columns indicating evictions or nominations.\n\nSo, I need to scan through each row and check two conditions:\n1. Does 'ricardo v' appear in the 'no9' column?\n2. In that same row, does 'paulo' appear in the 'no6' column?\n\nLet me go through the rows one by one:\n\nRow 0: no9 is \"telmo maria jo\u00e3o\". Doesn't include ricardo v.\nRow 1: no9 is \"riquita\". Not relevant.\n...\nContinuing until Row 4: no9 is \"c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria\". No ricardo v here.\n\nWait, maybe I should look further down. Rows towards the bottom seem to have more names in the 'no9' column.\n\nLooking at Row 12: It's a bit confusing because it has multiple names separated by spaces. Let me check each row carefully.\n\nRow 14: no9 is \"telmo\". No.\nRow 15: no9 is \"c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria\" again. Still no ricardo v.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rows. The table has a lot of rows, so maybe I need to check each one thoroughly.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Rows 20-23 seem to have 'riquita' in the first column and various names in other columns. But none of them mention 'ricardo v' in 'no9'.\n\nWait, perhaps 'ricardo v' is in another row. Let me check Row 16: no9 is \"telmo\". No.\nRow 17: same as Row 15.\nRow 18: same as above.\n\nI think I've checked all rows, and none of them have 'ricardo v' in the 'no9' column with 'paulo' in 'no6'. Therefore, the claim is not supported by any row in the table. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"marco richardo vtelmo be the no8 team that have no9 player telmo\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It seems like there might be some typos here. The names mentioned are \"marco\", \"richardo\", \"vtelmo\", and it's talking about a \"no8 team\" with a \"no9 player telmo\".\n\nLooking at the table, I see columns named no1 to no9, and then final. Each row represents different teams or configurations over time.\n\nI think the claim is referring to whether there's a row where the no8 column has \"marco richardo vtelmo\" and the no9 column has \"telmo\". Alternatively, maybe it's about team composition changes where telmo moves from no8 to no9. \n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Rows 0 to 12: These seem to be showing eviction days with various names, but I don't see any mention of marco, richardo, vtelmo in the no8 or no9 columns here.\n\nLooking at rows 13 and 14:\n- Row 13 has \"all housemates\" in no1. The no8 column is \"m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria\", and no9 is \"c\u00e9lia susana z\u00e9 maria\". I don't see telmo mentioned here.\n\nRow 15 onwards are labeled as riquita, which seems like a different context. Their no8 and no9 columns have names like ricardo v, ricardo a, etc., but not telmo.\n\nWait, maybe the claim is about a transition where telmo was in no8 and then moved to no9. Let me check if any rows show telmo in no8 and another row where he's in no9.\n\nLooking through the table again:\n\n- In row 13, under no8: \"m\u00e1rio z\u00e9 maria\", which doesn't include telmo.\n- Row 14: no8 is same as row13. No telmo there either.\n- Rows 15-17 have no9 as c\u00e9lia, susana, z\u00e9 maria respectively, but no telmo in those.\n\nI don't see any rows where the no8 team includes \"marco richardo vtelmo\" or where telmo is specifically moved from no8 to no9. The claim might be mixing up names or there's a typo like 'vtelmo' instead of 'v telmo'. Without clear evidence in the table, I think the claim isn't supported.\n</think>\n\nThe claim doesn't find support in the provided data as there's no row showing marco richardo vtelmo in no8 and telmo in no9.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```",
