    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says, \"the only defensive tackle be corey peter, with a pick number of 19.\" \n\nFirst, let me parse this carefully. The two main points are: Corey Peters is the only defensive tackle and his pick number is 19.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row to see if any other players besides Corey Peters have the position \"defensive tackle.\"\n\n- Row 0: Sean Weatherspoon, linebacker\n- Row 1: Corey Peters, defensive tackle (pick 19)\n- Row 2: Mike Johnson, guard\n- Row 3: Joe Hawley, guard\n- Row 4: Dominique Franks, cornerback\n- Row 5: Kerry Meier, wide receiver\n- Row 6: Shann Schillinger, safety\n\nSo, only Corey Peters is listed as a defensive tackle. That part checks out.\n\nNext, I need to confirm his pick number. The claim says it's 19. Looking at row 1, the \"pick\" column shows 19 for Corey Peters. So that matches too.\n\nAre there any other rows with pick number 19? Let me check:\n\n- Row 0: pick 19\n- Row 1: pick 19\n\nWait a minute, Sean Weatherspoon in row 0 also has a pick of 19, but he's a linebacker. So the claim is that Corey Peters is the only defensive tackle with pick 19. That's correct because even though another player was picked 19th overall, Corey Peters is the only one as a defensive tackle.\n\nTherefore, both conditions are satisfied. The answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Corey Peters is the only defensive tackle and was picked number 19. Checking the table:\n\n- Corey Peters (Row 1) has position \"defensive tackle\" and pick 19.\n- No other rows have \"defensive tackle\" as their position.\n\nThus, both conditions are met.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"position\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
