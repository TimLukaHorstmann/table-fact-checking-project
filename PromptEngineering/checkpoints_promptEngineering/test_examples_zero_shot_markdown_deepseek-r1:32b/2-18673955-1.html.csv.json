The claim is: \"there be no game that be play on october 30  , 1977 that be list greater than week 7.\"\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim carefully. It seems like it's trying to say that there is no game played on October 30, 1977, listed in a week number higher than 7. So, in other words, any game on that date should be in week 7 or earlier.\n\nLooking at the table structure, each row represents a week with details like the date, opponent, result, and attendance. The relevant columns here are \"week\" and \"date.\"\n\nI'll start by identifying all rows where the date is October 30, 1977. Scanning through the \"date\" column:\n\n- Week 1: September 19\n- Week 2: September 25\n- Week 3: October 2\n- Week 4: October 9\n- Week 5: October 16\n- Week 6: October 23\n- Week 7: October 30\n- Week 8 onwards are November and December.\n\nSo, the only row with the date October 30, 1977 is week 7. Now, I need to check if there's a game on that date listed in a week greater than 7. Since week 7 is exactly the week number for that date, and all subsequent weeks (8 to 14) have later dates, there are no games on October 30, 1977 beyond week 7.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because there's only one game on that date, in week 7, and none listed beyond it. \n\nRelevant cells for verification would be the \"week\" and \"date\" columns of the row where the date is October 30, which is row index 6 (assuming indexing starts at 0).\n</think>\n\nThe claim checks if there's a game on October 30, 1977 beyond week 7. The table shows only one game on that date in week 7.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
