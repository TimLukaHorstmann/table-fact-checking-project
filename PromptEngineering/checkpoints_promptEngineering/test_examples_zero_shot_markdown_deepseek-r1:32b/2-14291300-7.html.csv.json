    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim says: \"the toronto maple leaf be the only opponent with 63 point.\" First, I should parse this claim carefully.\n\nThe claim has two parts:\n1. Toronto Maple Leafs are an opponent.\n2. They have 63 points and are the only ones with that score.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like the opponent, score, record, and points. So, I need to check which rows have \"toronto maple leafs\" as the opponent and see what their points are.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n- Row 6 (index 5): Opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs, points are 63.\n- Any other rows? Let's check all opponents:\nRow 0: Detroit Red Wings\nRow 1: California Golden Seals\nRow 2: Minnesota North Stars\nRow 3: Pittsburgh Penguins\nRow 4: New York Rangers\nRow 5: Toronto Maple Leafs - points 63\nRow 6: New York Rangers again\nRow 7: Boston Bruins\nRow 8: Toronto Maple Leafs again, but their points here are 66.\nWait, no. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\nRows with opponent \"toronto maple leafs\" are rows 5 and 8 (index 5 and 8). But in row 5, the points are 63, and in row 8, it's 66.\n\nSo Toronto Maple Leafs appear twice as opponents. Now, checking if they have 63 points only once. The claim says \"the only opponent with 63 points.\" So I need to check if any other opponent besides Toronto has 63 points.\n\nLooking at the 'points' column:\nRow 0: 59\nRow1:60\nRow2:60\nRow3:61\nRow4:61\nRow5:63 (Toronto)\nRow6:65\nRow7:65\nRow8:66 (Toronto again, different points)\nRow9:66\nRow10:67\nRow11:67\nRow12:69\n\nSo only row 5 has 63 points, and the opponent there is Toronto Maple Leafs. No other team has exactly 63 points. Therefore, the claim that \"Toronto Maple Leafs are the only opponent with 63 points\" is TRUE.\n\nWait, but in the table, Toronto appears twice as opponents, once at row 5 (points 63) and again at row8 (points 66). So the second time, they have different points. So no other team has 63 except for that specific instance with Toronto.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because only in one game does Toronto Maple Leafs appear as opponents with exactly 63 points, and no other opponent has 63 points.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"during march 13, the toronto maple leaf be the opponent with 63 point.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into parts:\n1. Date: March 13.\n2. Opponent: Toronto Maple Leafs.\n3. Points: 63.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table to find where the 'march' column is 13. Looking at the table:\n\n- Row indexes are from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows). Let me check each row's 'march' value.\n- Row 5 has march 13, opponent Toronto Maple Leafs, and points 63.\n\nSo, on March 13, the opponent was indeed the Toronto Maple Leafs, and they had 63 points. \n\nI should note the relevant cells:\n- The 'opponent' column in row 5 confirms it's the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n- The 'points' column in the same row shows 63.\n\nTherefore, all parts of the claim are supported by the table data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because on March 13, the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs with 63 points as per the table.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the toronto maple leaf be the opponent list with 63 , 66 , and 69 point\" is true or false based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It mentions Toronto Maple Leafs as opponents in three specific games where the points were 63, 66, and 69. So, I'm looking for rows in the table where \"opponent\" is \"toronto maple leafs\" and check if their corresponding \"points\" are indeed 63, 66, and 69.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several entries with \"toronto maple leafs\" as the opponent. Let me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 5: Game 68 (March 13). Opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs. The points here are 63. That's one of the points mentioned in the claim, so that checks out.\n\n2. Next, I look for other games against Toronto Maple Leafs. There's row 69 (Game 70) where opponent is Boston Bruins, not Toronto. Then row 71: Game 71, opponent is Toronto Maple Leafs again. Points here are 66. That's another point mentioned in the claim.\n\n3. Row 72: Opponent is Montreal Canadiens. Not relevant. Row 73: Minnesota North Stars. Not relevant. Row 74: Chicago Blackhawks. Not relevant. Row 75: Pittsburgh Penguins. Not relevant. \n\nWait, I think I might have missed a row. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, after Game 68 (Toronto), the next time Toronto is listed as opponent is in Game 71 (March 21). Points there are 66. So that's two points: 63 and 66.\n\nIs there another game against Toronto with 69 points? Let me check all rows again. The table has games up to Game 75, but I don't see any other opponent being Toronto Maple Leafs beyond Game 68 and Game 71.\n\nSo in the table, Toronto Maple Leafs are opponents twice: once at 63 points (Game 68) and once at 66 points (Game 71). There's no game where they're opponents with 69 points. Therefore, the claim mentions three points (63, 66, 69), but only two of them are present in the table.\n\nHence, the claim isn't fully supported because there's no opponent entry for Toronto Maple Leafs at 69 points. So, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 69, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here with a bunch of games and some stats about them. The claim is \"the chicago black hawk be the only opponent with 63 point.\" Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, the claim mentions two things: Chicago Black Hawks as an opponent and having exactly 63 points. I need to check if that's true based on the table.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a game with details like game number, date (march), opponent, score, record, and points. So, the relevant columns here are \"opponent\" and \"points.\"\n\nI'll go through each row one by one to see who the opponents were and their corresponding points.\n\nRow 0: Opponent is Detroit Red Wings, points are 59.\nRow 1: California Golden Seals with 60 points.\nRow 2: Minnesota North Stars have 60 as well.\nRow 3: Pittsburgh Penguins at 61 points.\nRow 4: New York Rangers with 61.\nRow 5: Toronto Maple Leafs have 63 points here. Wait, that's the first mention of 63 points, but it's for Toronto, not Chicago.\n\nContinuing on:\nRow 6: New York Rangers again at 65 points.\nRow 7: Boston Bruins with 65.\nRow 8: Toronto Maple Leafs have 66.\nRow 9: Montreal Canadiens also at 66.\nRow 10: Minnesota North Stars with 67.\nRow 11: Chicago Black Hawks appear here, and their points are 67. So that's not matching the 63 claim.\n\nWait a second, earlier in row 5, Toronto Maple Leafs had 63 points. That means the 63-point mark isn't unique to Chicago; Toronto also has it. Plus, looking at all rows, no opponent named Chicago Black Hawks have exactly 63 points\u2014they have 67 instead.\n\nSo, putting this together: The claim says Chicago is the only one with 63 points, but in reality, Toronto had 63 and Chicago didn't. Therefore, the claim isn't accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Chicago Black Hawks are the only opponent with 63 points. Upon reviewing the table, Toronto Maple Leafs have 63 points (Row 5), which means Chicago is not the only one. Thus, the claim is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
