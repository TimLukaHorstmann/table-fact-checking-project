    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim \"2 of the artist get a double digit percent vote\" is true or false based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim means. A \"double digit percent vote\" would be 10% or more because that's when the percentage has two digits (like 10%, 11%, etc.).\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents an artist and their corresponding televote/sms percentage. I need to check how many artists have a percentage of 10% or higher.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\nRow 1: Stefan Ilchev - 2.95% \u2192 Less than 10%, so no.\nRow 2: Moto - 0.37% \u2192 No.\nRow 3: Poli Genova - 11.74% \u2192 Yes, this is double digits.\nRow 4: Danny Milev - 2.39% \u2192 No.\nRow 5: Ivelina - 2.53% \u2192 No.\nRow 6: Grafa - 3.91% \u2192 No.\nRow 7: Sahara - 3.20% \u2192 No.\nRow 8: Mariana Popova - 8.45% \u2192 This is still single digit because 8.45 is less than 10.\nWait, no, wait. Actually, 8.45% is more than 8 but less than 10, so it's single-digit percentage. So she doesn't qualify.\n\nRow 9: Jura Tone feat Lady B - 2.03% \u2192 No.\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev - 1.16% \u2192 No.\nRow 11: Krassimir Avramov - 55.52% \u2192 Definitely double digits, so yes.\nRow 12: Nora - 5.75% \u2192 No.\n\nWait a second, I thought Row 8 had 8.45%, which is single-digit because it's less than 10%. So only Rows 3 and 11 have percentages above or equal to 10%.\n\nSo that's two artists: Poli Genova (11.74%) and Krassimir Avramov (55.52%). Therefore, the claim is true because exactly two artists received double-digit percentages.\n\nI should note their row indices in the table. Let me check:\n\nRow 3 is index 2 (since indexing starts at 0), but wait, looking back, the table has rows numbered from 1 to 12, so in zero-based indexing, Row 3 would be index 2? Wait no, in the JSON example provided, the first row is index 0. Let me recount:\n\nThe table as given has 12 entries. Each entry is a row with draw numbers from 1 to 12.\n\nRow indices (starting at 0):\n\nRow 1: Stefan Ilchev \u2192 index 0\nRow 2: Moto \u2192 index 1\nRow 3: Poli Genova \u2192 index 2\nRow 4: Danny Milev \u2192 index 3\nRow 5: Ivelina \u2192 index 4\nRow 6: Grafa \u2192 index 5\nRow 7: Sahara \u2192 index 6\nRow 8: Mariana Popova \u2192 index 7\nRow 9: Jura Tone feat Lady B \u2192 index 8\nRow 10: Stefan Dobrev \u2192 index 9\nRow 11: Krassimir Avramov \u2192 index 10\nRow 12: Nora \u2192 index 11\n\nWait, so Poli Genova is in draw 3, which would be row index 2. Krassimir Avramov is draw 11, row index 10.\n\nSo the relevant cells are:\n\n- Row 2 (Poli Genova) under \"televote / sms\" column\n- Row 10 (Krassimir Avramov) under \"televote / sms\" column\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because two artists have double-digit percentages. So I should include these cells in the relevant_cells array.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I thought Mariana Popova had 8.45%, which is single-digit, so she doesn't count. Therefore, only Poli Genova and Krassimir Avramov meet the condition.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that two artists received a double-digit percentage of votes. Checking each artist's televote/sms percentage:\n\n- **Poli Genova** has 11.74% (double digit).\n- **Krassimir Avramov** has 55.52% (double digit).\n\nThese are the only two artists with percentages equal to or above 10%. Thus, the claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"first place get 55.52 percent of the vote, and last place get 0.37 percent of the vote.\" So, I need to check two things\u2014what percentage each got for first and last places.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, and place. The relevant columns here are \"televote / sms\" which shows the percentages, and \"place\" which indicates their ranking.\n\nI need to find out who is in first place and who is last (12th place). Let's scan through the \"place\" column.\n\nRow 0: Place 7\nRow 1: Place 12\nRow 2: Place 2\nRow 3: Place 9\nRow 4: Place 8\nRow 5: Place 5\nRow 6: Place 6\nRow 7: Place 3\nRow 8: Place 10\nRow 9: Place 11\nRow 10: Place 1\nRow 11: Place 4\n\nWait, row indices go from 0 to 11 because there are 12 rows. So row index 10 is the 11th entry? Wait no\u2014actually, in programming, arrays often start at 0, so row 0 is first, up to row 11 which would be the 12th. Let me confirm:\n\nLooking at \"draw\" column: draw 1 is row 0, draw 12 is row 11.\n\nBut the \"place\" column for each entry\u2014looking for place=1 and place=12.\n\nIn row 10 (draw 11), place is 1. So that's first place. The percentage there is 55.52%, which matches the claim.\n\nNow, last place is 12th. Looking at the table, which entry has place 12? That would be draw=2, artist=moto, song=razstoyaniya. Row index for that is row 1 (since draw starts at 1 in column but rows are 0-indexed). The percentage there is 0.37%, which also matches the claim.\n\nSo both parts of the claim are correct: first place has 55.52% and last place has 0.37%.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the claim \"there be 5 artist that only have one name\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll understand what the claim means. It states that there are five artists in the table who each have only one name. That probably refers to their stage names or how they're credited, where their artist name consists of a single word without any additional identifiers like 'feat' or multiple parts.\n\nLooking at the table, I see that it has columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, and place. The relevant column for this claim is the \"artist\" column. Each row lists an artist's name, and some of these names are more complex than others.\n\nI'll go through each row in the table and examine the artist names:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Stefan Ilchev - This has two parts: a first name and a last name.\n2. **Row 1**: Moto - Just one word, seems like a single name.\n3. **Row 2**: Poli Genova - Two parts again.\n4. **Row 3**: Danny Milev - Two names.\n5. **Row 4**: Ivelina - Single name.\n6. **Row 5**: Grafa - Single name.\n7. **Row 6**: Sahara - Single name.\n8. **Row 7**: Mariana Popova - Two parts.\n9. **Row 8**: Jura Tone feat Lady B - This has multiple parts and includes a collaboration, so it's more than one name.\n10. **Row 9**: Stefan Dobrev - Two names.\n11. **Row 10**: Krassimir Avramov - Two names.\n12. **Row 11**: Nora - Single name.\n\nNow, I'll count how many artists have only one name:\n\n- Moto (Row 1)\n- Ivelina (Row 4)\n- Grafa (Row 5)\n- Sahara (Row 6)\n- Nora (Row 11)\n\nThat's five artists with single names. However, the claim is that there are \"5 artist that only have one name.\" Wait a second\u2014the word 'artist' here is in singular form but refers to multiple artists. So perhaps it's a grammatical error and should be \"artists.\" \n\nBut looking back at the table, I found exactly five artists with single names: Moto, Ivelina, Grafa, Sahara, and Nora. However, when checking each row, I realize that one of them is 'Mariana Popova' in Row 7, which has two names, so she doesn't count. \n\nWait, did I miscount? Let me recount:\n\n1. Moto - 1\n2. Ivelina - 2\n3. Grafa - 3\n4. Sahara - 4\n5. Nora - 5\n\nYes, that's five artists with single names. But the claim says \"5 artist,\" which is grammatically incorrect; it should be \"artists.\" However, since this is a minor error and doesn't affect the meaning, I can proceed.\n\nBut wait, let me check again:\n\n- Row 1: Moto - Single name (counted)\n- Row 4: Ivelina - Single (counted)\n- Row 5: Grafa - Single (counted)\n- Row 6: Sahara - Single (counted)\n- Row 11: Nora - Single (counted)\n\nThat's five. However, the claim says \"there be 5 artist,\" but in the table, we have exactly five artists with single names. Therefore, the claim is TRUE.\n\nWait, hold on! Let me make sure I didn't miss any or count incorrectly. The list of single-name artists:\n\n1. Moto\n2. Ivelina\n3. Grafa\n4. Sahara\n5. Nora\n\nYes, that's five. So the claim should be TRUE.\n\nBut wait another thought\u2014could there be an artist with a single name that I missed? Let me go through each row again quickly:\n\nRow 0: Stefan Ilchev - Two names.\nRow 1: Moto - One.\nRow 2: Poli Genova - Two.\nRow 3: Danny Milev - Two.\nRow 4: Ivelina - One.\nRow 5: Grafa - One.\nRow 6: Sahara - One.\nRow 7: Mariana Popova - Two.\nRow 8: Jura Tone feat Lady B - More than one.\nRow 9: Stefan Dobrev - Two.\nRow 10: Krassimir Avramov - Two.\nRow 11: Nora - One.\n\nYes, five artists have single names. So the claim is TRUE.\n\nBut wait, I just noticed that the user's example JSON includes row indices starting at 0. In my count above, the rows are from 0 to 11, but in the table provided, rows are numbered from 1 to 12. Wait no, looking back, the table starts with draw=1 as the first row, which would be index 0 in programming terms. So when I refer to Row 1, that's index 1, etc.\n\nSo the five artists are:\n\n- Row 1: Moto\n- Row 4: Ivelina\n- Row 5: Grafa\n- Row 6: Sahara\n- Row 11: Nora\n\nEach of these rows has an artist with a single name. Therefore, the claim is TRUE, and the relevant cells are in the \"artist\" column for these rows.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are five artists with only one name. Upon reviewing the table, we find exactly five such artists: Moto, Ivelina, Grafa, Sahara, and Nora.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"artist\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information in the table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the table carefully. The table has columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, and place. There are 12 rows of data here.\n\nThe claim is: \"the word love be use in a song 2 time\". Hmm, so they're saying that the word 'love' appears exactly two times across all the songs listed in the table.\n\nOkay, I need to check each song title in the 'song' column and count how many times the word 'love' is used. Let's go through them one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: \"get up\" \u2013 no mention of love.\n2. Row 1: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 that doesn't seem to have 'love'.\n3. Row 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 no 'love' here either.\n4. Row 3: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 I don't think that's love.\n5. Row 4: \"ready for love\" \u2013 oh, there it is! That's one occurrence.\n6. Row 5: \"vrag\" \u2013 nope, not related to love.\n7. Row 6: \"don' t kiss for the money\" \u2013 'kiss' but not 'love'.\n8.

Row 10: \"illusion\" \u2013 nope.\n12. Row 11: \"it's not right\" \u2013 still nothing.\n\nSo, from my count, the word 'love' appears in two song titles: row 4 and row 8. That means the claim is TRUE because it does happen exactly twice.\n\nI should also note down which cells are relevant for this determination.

So my task is to check each song in the table and count how many of them are single-word titles.\n\nLooking at the table row by row:\n\n1. Row 0: Song is \"get up\" \u2013 two words.\n2. Row 1: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 one word.\n3. Row 2: \"one lifetime is not enough\" \u2013 multiple words.\n4. Row 3: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 two words.\n5.

Row 6: \"don' t kiss for the money\" \u2013 multiple words (though there's a typo with the apostrophe, it's still multiple words).\n8. Row 7: \"crazy\" \u2013 one word.\n9.

But the claim says four artists. Hmm, maybe I miscounted or misunderstood.\n\nLet me double-check each row:\n\nRow 0: \"get up\" \u2013 two words.\nRow 1: \"razstoyaniya\" \u2013 one word.\nRow 2: \"one lifetime...\" \u2013 multiple.\nRow 3: \"nyama vreme\" \u2013 two words.\nRow 4: \"ready for love\" \u2013 three.\nRow 5: \"vrag\" \u2013 one.\nRow 6: \"don't kiss...\" \u2013 four words (including the apostrophe).\nRow 7: \"crazy\" \u2013 one.\nRow 8: \"chance to love you\" \u2013 three.\nRow 9: \"everlasting\" \u2013 one.\nRow 10: \"illusion\" \u2013 one.\nRow 11: \"it's not right\" \u2013 three words.\n\nSo that's rows 1,5,7,9,10 with single-word songs. That's five artists. But the claim is four. So why does it say four?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting or perhaps some of these aren't actually one word. Let me check each song title again:\n\n- razstoyaniya: definitely one word.\n- vrag: yes, one word.\n- crazy: yes.\n- everlasting: yes.\n- illusion: yes.\n\nThat's five artists with single-word songs. So the claim is saying four, but according to this, it should be five. Therefore, the claim is FALSE because there are more than four.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding what constitutes a \"one name\" song. Maybe it refers to the song title having only one word. In that case, yes, it's five.

Each row in that column represents the televote/sms score for a particular artist.\n\nThe claim states that 5 artists have scores under 2%. So, I need to check how many entries in the 'televote / sms' column are less than 2%.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1. Stefan Ilchev: 2.95% \u2192 This is above 2%, so not counted.\n2. Moto: 0.37% \u2192 Below 2%, count as 1.\n3. Poli Genova: 11.74% \u2192 Above, not counted.\n4. Danny Milev: 2.39% \u2192 Just over 2%, so not counted.\n5. Ivelina: 2.53% \u2192 Also above, not counted.\n6. Grafa: 3.91% \u2192 Above, nope.\n7. Sahara: 3.20% \u2192 Above, skip.\n8. Mariana Popova: 8.45% \u2192 Way above, so no.\n9.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"there be a 70 percentage point difference between first and last place.\" \n\nFirst, I should identify what constitutes \"first\" and \"last\" place in this context. Looking at the table's \"place\" column, it ranges from 1 to 12, so first place is row 11 (Krassimir Avramov with 55.52%) and last place is row 10 (Stefan Dobrev with 1.16%). \n\nNext, I need to calculate the percentage point difference between these two. The formula for percentage points is simply subtracting the lower value from the higher one without converting them into a ratio of each other.\n\nSo, 55.52% minus 1.16% equals 54.36%. \n\nThe claim mentions a 70 percentage point difference, but our calculation shows it's only about 54.36 points apart. Since 54.36 is less than 70, the claim isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are the televote/sms percentages for first and last place, which are in row 11 and row 10 under the \"televote / sms\" column.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"televote / sms\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the winner have the longest song title",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"the winner have the longest song title\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It states that the winner of whatever competition this is (probably a music contest) has the song with the longest title among all the entries in the table.\n\nLooking at the table, I can see that each row represents an artist and their corresponding song entry along with other details like televote percentage and place. The 'place' column likely indicates the ranking based on votes or points, where 1 is the highest position (winner) and 12 is the lowest.\n\nSo, my first step is to identify who the winner is. Scanning the 'place' column, I see that row index 10 has a place of 1, which means this artist is the winner. The artist in question is Stefan Dobrev with his song \"everlasting\".\n\nNow, I need to check if this song's title is indeed the longest among all entries. To do that, I'll go through each song title and count their characters (including spaces).\n\nLet me list out the songs along with their lengths:\n\n1. get up - 6 characters\n2. razstoyaniya - 12 characters\n3. one lifetime is not enough - 27 characters\n4. nyama vreme - 12 characters\n5. ready for love - 15 characters\n6. vrag - 4 characters\n7. don't kiss for the money - 23 characters\n8. crazy - 5 characters\n9. chance to love you - 18 characters\n10. everlasting - 12 characters (winner)\n11. illusion - 8 characters\n12. it's not right - 12 characters\n\nLooking at these lengths, the longest song title is \"one lifetime is not enough\" with 27 characters. The winner's song, \"everlasting\", is only 12 characters long.\n\nTherefore, the claim that the winner has the longest song title is FALSE because another song in the table (\"one lifetime is not enough\") has a longer title.\n</think>\n\nThe winner, identified by place 1, has the song \"everlasting\" which is shorter than the longest song title \"one lifetime is not enough\".\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "2 song title be in english",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether the claim \"2 song title be in english\" is true or false based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. There are several columns: draw, artist, song, televote/sms, and place. The key column for this claim is the \"song\" column because we're checking how many song titles are in English.\n\nI need to go through each row and examine the song title to see if it's in English or another language. Let's list them out:\n\n1. get up - This sounds like English.\n2. razstoyaniya - I think this is Bulgarian, but not sure. Maybe a misspelled English word?\n3. one lifetime is not enough - Definitely English.\n4. nyama vreme - This looks like Bulgarian again.\n5. ready for love - That's definitely an English phrase.\n6. vrag - Short for \"vrah\" which means \"priest\" in Bulgarian, but could also be a name or another language.\n7. don't kiss for the money - Clearly English.\n8. crazy - Definitely English.\n9. chance to love you - That's English too.\n10. everlasting - This is an English word.\n11. illusion - Also English.\n12. it's not right - English.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"2 song title be in english.\" So I thought maybe only two are in English, but looking through them, most of these titles seem to be in English except a couple. Let me double-check:\n\n- Razstoyaniya: I think that's Bulgarian for \"destruction\" or something similar.\n- Nyama vreme: That might mean \"no time\" in another language, maybe Bulgarian again.\n\nSo perhaps only two are not in English, but the claim says there are 2 song titles in English. Wait, that doesn't make sense because looking at the list, more than two songs have English titles. So maybe I misunderstood the claim.\n\nWait, perhaps the claim is miswritten. It might mean \"only 2 song titles are in English.\" But checking again:\n\nLooking at each song title:\n\n1. get up - English\n2. razstoyaniya - Probably not English\n3. one lifetime... - English\n4. nyama vreme - Not English\n5. ready for love - English\n6. vrag - Not English\n7. don't kiss... - English\n8. crazy - English\n9. chance to love you - English\n10. everlasting - English\n11. illusion - English\n12. it's not right - English\n\nSo only the second and fourth song titles are not in English. That means 10 out of 12 are in English, which contradicts the claim that only two are in English. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the claim. Maybe it's saying \"there are 2 song titles in English,\" meaning exactly two, but according to my analysis, there are more than two. So the claim is false because more than two are in English.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"song\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"song\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
