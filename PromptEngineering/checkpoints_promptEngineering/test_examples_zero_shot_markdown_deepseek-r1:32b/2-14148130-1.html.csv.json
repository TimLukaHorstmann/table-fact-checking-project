    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me first read through the table and understand what each column represents.\n\nThe table has five columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. Each row corresponds to a team's performance with these metrics.\n\nNow, looking at the claim:\n\n\"when there be 14 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 7\"\n\nI need to parse this step by step.\n\nFirst part: \"when there be 14 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7\"\n- So, we're looking for a row where points = 14 and points difference is 41-07. Then check if games equals 7.\n\nSecond part: \"and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 7\"\n- Looking for another row where points = 10, points difference is 26-16, and games =7.\n\nI'll check each condition against the table.\n\nLooking at the first row (index 0):\n- Points:14\n- Point difference:41 - 07\n- Games:7\n\nThis matches the first part of the claim. So this is correct.\n\nNext, for the second part:\nLooking for points=10 and point difference=26-16.\nCheck row index 1:\n- Points:10\n- Point difference:26 -16\n- Games:7\n\nYes, this matches the second condition as well.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim are supported by rows 0 and 1 in the table. So the answer should be TRUE.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells:\nFor row 0, columns points (14), points difference (41-07), games (7).\nSo row_index=0, column names: \"points\", \"points difference\", \"games\".\n\nSimilarly for row 1: same columns, points=10, point diff=26-16, games=7.\n\nWait, but the claim doesn't mention 'drawn' or 'lost', so those aren't relevant. So only the mentioned columns are needed.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be:\n\nFor first part (row 0):\n{\"row_\":0, \"columns\":[\"points\", \"points difference\", \"games\"]}\n\nBut according to instructions, each cell is an object with row_index and column_name.\n\nWait, I think for each condition in the claim, we have to find specific rows. So for points=14 and diff=41-7, that's row 0. For points=10 and diff=26-16, that's row1.\n\nSo relevant_cells should include these two rows with their respective columns.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[\n    {\"row_\":0, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_\":0, \"column_name\":\"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_\":0, \"column_name\":\"games\"},\n    {\"row_\":1, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n    {\"row_\":1, \"column_name\":\"points difference\"},\n    {\"row_\":1, \"column_name\":\"games\"}\n]\n\nBut wait, the answer only needs to include the cells that were checked. So for each condition, the relevant cells are where points=14, diff=41-07, and games=7 in row 0; and points=10, diff=26-16, games=7 in row 1.\n\nSo I need to list all these cells as part of verifying the claim. Therefore, each of these six cells are relevant because they directly support both parts of the claim.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"points difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\":0, \"column_name\":\"games\"},\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"points difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\":1, \"column_name\":\"games\"}\n   ]\n}",

    "claim": "there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn",
    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let's see what the claim is saying and how it relates to the table provided. The claim states: \"there be only 7 game in all the game and on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" Hmm, I need to parse this carefully.\n\nFirst part of the claim: \"only 7 games in all the game.\" Looking at the table, each row under the 'games' column shows a value of 7. So each team played 7 games. But does that mean there are only 7 games total? Wait, no\u2014each row is probably a different team's record. If each team played 7 games, but there are multiple teams, the total number of games would be more than 7 because each game involves two teams.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The claim says \"only 7 games in all the game,\" which might mean that across all teams, there were only 7 games played. But looking at the table, there are 8 rows, meaning 8 teams. Each team has 7 games. That would suggest a total of more than 7 games because each game is counted twice (once for each team). So perhaps the claim is referring to something else.\n\nWait, maybe the first part refers to each team having played 7 games. The table shows that every row under 'games' is 7, so each team has indeed played 7 games. That part might be correct.\n\nNow, the second part: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" So it's saying that on 4 occasions (i.e., in 4 of the games), there were draws, and in no case was there a situation where more than one game was drawn. Wait, perhaps it means that across all teams, only 4 games were drawn, and none had more than one draw.\n\nLooking at the 'drawn' column: each row shows how many games each team drew. Let's sum those up to find the total number of drawn games. \n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 1\nRow 7: 0\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4. So total drawn games are 4.\n\nNow, the claim also says \"never more than 1 game drawn.\" That might mean that no single match had more than one draw? But in sports like football, a game can end in a draw, meaning both teams get a point each. Alternatively, maybe it's saying that no team has more than one draw in their record.\n\nLooking at the 'drawn' column again: each row shows how many games were drawn by that team. The maximum is 1 in rows 2,3,4,6. So yes, no team has more than 1 draw. Therefore, across all teams, only 4 games ended in draws, and each of those was a single game (i.e., one match).\n\nPutting it together: Each team played 7 games, which matches the first part of the claim. There were 4 drawn games in total, and each of these was just one game per occurrence without any multiple draws in a single match.\n\nWait, but when two teams draw, that counts as one drawn game for both teams. So the total number of drawn games across all teams would be double the actual number of drawn matches. For example, if Team A and Team B drew, each team's 'drawn' column increments by 1, so together it's 2.\n\nIn our table, summing 'drawn' gives us 4. That means there were actually 2 drawn matches in total because each match is counted twice (once for each team). But the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw,\" which might mean they're considering each occurrence from each team's perspective, so perhaps that part of the claim is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If two teams draw a game, it counts as one drawn match but adds 1 to each team's 'drawn' column. So in reality, the number of actual drawn games is half the sum of all 'drawn' columns. In our case, sum is 4, so actual drawn matches are 2.\n\nBut the claim says \"on 4 occasion be there draw,\" which seems incorrect because it's actually only 2 drawn matches. Alternatively, perhaps they're counting each team's perspective as separate occasions, so from Team A and Team B's perspectives, each has a draw once, making 2 draws but appearing as two separate 'drawn' entries.\n\nWait, the claim is saying \"on 4 occasion be there draw,\" which might mean that in total, across all teams, there were four instances where a game was drawn. But since each actual drawn match affects two teams, this would imply that there were four such team-level draws, meaning two actual matches (since each match contributes to two teams). So the claim is correct if it's referring to team-level draws as separate occasions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is misphrased and meant to say that in total, there were 4 drawn games across all teams. But since each game involves two teams, the actual number of unique drawn matches would be half of that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's break down the claim:\n\n1. \"only 7 game in all the game\" \u2013 This is tricky. If each team has 7 games, but there are 8 teams, how many total games are there? In a round-robin tournament with 8 teams, each playing 7 others once, that would be (8*7)/2 = 28 games total. But the claim says \"only 7 game in all,\" which seems incorrect because there should be more than 7 games.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. The table shows for each team how many games they played, but perhaps it's a different context. Maybe the claim is referring to the number of games per something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part refers to each team having only 7 games in total, which is correct as per the 'games' column being 7 for all rows.\n\nBut then the second part: \"on 4 occasion be there draw with never more than 1 game drawn.\" So across all teams, there were four draws (as per summing 'drawn'), and each team had at most one draw. That seems correct because in the table, no team has a 'drawn' value higher than 1.\n\nSo the claim is: Each team played 7 games; across all teams, there were four drawn games (each being a single game from each team's perspective), meaning two actual matches ended in draws. So the first part might be correct if interpreted as each team having 7 games, not that only 7 games exist overall.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"only 7 game in all the game,\" which could mean that overall there are only 7 games. But with eight teams, each playing seven others once, it's 28 games. So that part is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me parse it again:\n\n\"You are tasked to determine whether the following statement is true or false: 'Only 7 game in all the game, but there were four occasions when a draw occurred, and each of those was only one game.' \"\n\nWait, maybe \"only 7 game in all the game\" refers to the total number of games being seven. But that contradicts because with eight teams, you can't have each team play seven others without having more than seven games.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Maybe it means each team only played seven games, which is correct as per the table.\n\nBut then, the second part: \"there were four occasions when a draw occurred, and each of those was only one game.\" So in total, four drawn games (from the perspective of all teams), meaning two actual matches ended in draws because each draw affects two teams. But the claim says there were four occasions (i.e., four instances where a team had a draw). That is correct as per the sum of 'drawn' being 4.\n\nSo putting it together: Each team played seven games, and across all teams, there were four drawn results (each from a single game), meaning two actual matches ended in draws. Therefore, the claim seems to be accurate based on the data provided.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true based on the given data:\n\n1. **Each Team Played 7 Games**: As per the 'games' column, every team has exactly 7 games listed.\n\n2. **Four Drawn Outcomes Across All Teams**: Summing the 'drawn' column gives a total of 4 draws across all teams. Since each drawn match affects two teams, this indicates that there were 2 actual matches that ended in draws.\n\n3. **No Team Had More Than One Draw**: Each team's 'drawn' count is either 0 or 1, confirming that no single game had multiple draws beyond one per team.\n\nThus, the statement accurately reflects the data provided. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\text{True}}",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's read the claim carefully: \"there be 9 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30  -15 and 26 -21\". So, there are two main parts here:\n\n1. There are two occasions where a team has 9 points.\n2. On those same occasions, the points differences are 30-15 and 26-21.\n\nI need to check each part against the table provided.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, points.\n\nLet's start by checking how many times a team scored exactly 9 points. I'll go through each row:\n\nRow 0: points = 14 \u2192 Not 9\nRow 1: points = 10 \u2192 Not 9\nRow 2: points = 9 \u2192 Yes\nRow 3: points = 9 \u2192 Yes\nRow 4: points =7 \u2192 No\nRow5: points=4\u2192No\nRow6:points=3\u2192No\nRow7:points=0\u2192No\n\nSo, there are exactly two rows (row indices 2 and 3) where the points column is 9. That satisfies the first part of the claim.\n\nNow, checking the second part: on these occasions (rows 2 and 3), what are their point differences?\n\nRow 2's points difference is 30 -15.\nRow 3's points difference is 26-21.\n\nSo both these differences match exactly as mentioned in the claim. Therefore, both conditions of the claim are satisfied.\n\nI don't see any discrepancies here, so the answer should be TRUE.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"there be no draw more than 1 and no loss more than 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's break down the claim into two parts:\n1. No draw more than 1: This means that in each row, the number of draws should not exceed 1.\n2. No loss more than 7: This implies that in each row, the number of losses should not be more than 7.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll examine each row to check these conditions.\n\nStarting with the \"drawn\" column:\n- Row 0: 0 draws \u2192 OK\n- Row 1: 0 draws \u2192 OK\n- Row 2: 1 draw \u2192 OK\n- Row 3: 1 draw \u2192 OK\n- Row 4: 1 draw \u2192 OK\n- Row 5: 0 draws \u2192 OK\n- Row 6: 1 draw \u2192 OK\n- Row 7: 0 draws \u2192 OK\n\nAll rows have either 0 or 1 draw, so the first part of the claim holds.\n\nNext, checking the \"lost\" column:\n- Row 0: 0 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 1: 2 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 2: 2 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 3: 2 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 4: 3 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 5: 5 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 6: 5 losses \u2192 OK\n- Row 7: 7 losses \u2192 This is exactly the limit set by the claim, so it's acceptable.\n\nSince none of the rows have more than 1 draw or more than 7 losses, the claim is supported. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a table with several rows and columns, and there's a claim that says: \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 0 and lost game be 7.\" My task is to determine if this claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the data in the table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The claim has three parts:\n\n1. Points (points) = 0\n2. Drawn games (drawn) = 0\n3. Lost games (lost) = 7\n\nI need to check if there's a row in the table where all these conditions are met simultaneously.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team or participant with their respective stats across different columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one to see if any of them meet all three conditions specified in the claim.\n\nRow 0:\n- Points: 14\n- Drawn: 0\n- Lost: 0\nThis doesn't satisfy because points are not 0.\n\nRow 1:\n- Points: 10\n- Drawn: 0\n- Lost: 2\nPoints aren't 0, so this doesn't work either.\n\nRow 2:\n- Points: 9\n- Drawn: 1\n- Lost: 2\nAgain, points are not 0.\n\nRow 3:\n- Points: 9\n- Drawn: 1\n- Lost: 2\nSame as above; points aren't 0.\n\nRow 4:\n- Points: 7\n- Drawn: 1\n- Lost: 3\nStill, points are not 0. So this doesn't fit either.\n\nRow 5:\n- Points: 4\n- Drawn: 0\n- Lost: 5\nPoints aren't 0 here as well.\n\nRow 6:\n- Points: 3\n- Drawn: 1\n- Lost: 5\nOnce again, points are not 0. So this doesn't meet the condition either.\n\nNow, let's look at Row 7:\n- Points: 0\n- Drawn: 0\n- Lost: 7\n\nWait a minute! Here we have exactly what the claim is stating. The points column has 0, drawn games are 0, and lost games are 7. This row satisfies all three conditions.\n\nSo, checking Row 7:\n\nPoints = 0 \u2192 Yes.\nDrawn = 0 \u2192 Yes.\nLost = 7 \u2192 Yes.\n\nSince all three conditions are met in this row, the claim is supported by the data. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE.\n\nTo compile the relevant cells for this determination, I need to list each cell that corresponds to the conditions checked:\n\n- For Points being 0: Row 7, Column \"points\".\n- For Drawn games being 0: Row 7, Column \"drawn\".\n- For Lost games being 7: Row 7, Column \"lost\".\n\nSo, these three cells are relevant in confirming the claim.\n\nI think that's all. The key was to look for a row where points were zero and then check if drawn and lost games matched as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Row 7 has points=0, drawn=0, and lost=7.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

There were 4 occasions where draws occurred, but no more than 2 games were drawn in any single instance.\n\nLet me start by checking each row to see how many games and how many draws there are.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different team or entity with their game statistics. The \"games\" column shows that every entry has exactly 7 games. So, for part 1 of the claim, it seems correct\u2014each entity played only 7 games.\n\nNow, onto the second part: draws and how many times they occurred. The \"drawn\" column indicates the number of drawn games per row. Let's list them out:\n\n- Row 0: 0 draws\n- Row 1: 0 draws\n- Row 2: 1 draw\n- Row 3: 1 draw\n- Row 4: 1 draw\n- Row 5: 0 draws\n- Row 6: 1 draw\n- Row 7: 0 draws\n\nAdding up all the drawn games across rows: 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4 draws in total. So, there are 4 occasions where a draw occurred.\n\nHowever, looking at each row's \"drawn\" value, each has either 0 or 1 draw. The maximum number of drawn games in any single occasion (row) is 1, which means no single instance had more than 2 draws. Wait, but the claim says \"never more than 2 game draw.\" Since none have more than 1, it's even better.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misinterpreted the claim. It could mean that across all games, there were only up to 2 draws in any particular game. But looking at each row, no single row has more than 1 draw. So the maximum is indeed 1 per row, which is less than 2.\n\nBut wait another thing: The table shows each team's performance. If I'm considering all games across teams, the total number of drawn games is 4. But in reality, a drawn game involves two teams, so each draw is counted twice in the table (once for each team). Therefore, the actual number of unique drawn games would be half the sum of the \"drawn\" column.\n\nSo, total draws across all rows: 4, which implies there were 2 unique drawn games because each draw affects two teams. So the claim says 4 occasions where draws occurred, but in reality, it's only 2 unique instances.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach row represents a team's performance. Each time a team has a drawn game, that's a separate entry in their \"drawn\" count. However, each actual drawn match is between two teams, so for one drawn game, both teams would have 1 draw each.\n\nLooking at the table, rows 2,3,4,6 all have 1 draw. So that's four teams with 1 draw each, implying two unique drawn games (since each drawn game contributes to two entries in the \"drawn\" column).\n\nTherefore, there were only 2 occasions where draws occurred, not 4. The claim states there were 4 such occasions, which is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the claim is referring to the number of teams that had at least one draw, which would be 4 (rows 2,3,4,6). But in terms of actual drawn games, it's only 2.\n\nThis makes the claim incorrect because there were not 4 occasions where draws occurred but rather 2. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n\nSo, the relevant cells are all rows' \"drawn\" column to check how many draws each team had and sum them up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"when there be 10 point and a point difference of 41 - 07 the game be 7 and when there be 10 point the point difference be 26 - 16 with game of 6.\" \n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. I think it's saying two things:\n1. When points are 10 and the points difference is 41-07, the number of games is 7.\n2. When points are 10 again, the points difference should be 26-16 with a game count of 6.\n\nBut looking at the table, each row has the same number of games (7) except maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nThe table structure is:\n| games | drawn | lost | points difference | points |\nEach row has these columns, and all rows have \"games\" as 7 except... Wait, no, looking at the data:\n\nRow indices from 0 to 7 (assuming zero-based). All rows under 'games' have value 7. So that's interesting because the claim mentions a game count of 6 in one part.\n\nNow, let's check for points =10. Looking through the table, which row has points=10? Let me scan the 'points' column:\n\nRow 0: 14\nRow 1: 10 --> this is points=10.\nRow 2:9\nRow3:9\nRow4:7\nRow5:4\nRow6:3\nRow7:0\n\nSo only row 1 has points=10. Now, what's the 'points difference' in that row? It's 26 - 16.\n\nWait, but the claim says two things:\n- When points are 10 and point difference is 41-07, games should be 7.\nBut looking at row 1, which has points=10, the points difference is 26-16. So for that row, the points difference isn't 41-07 but 26-16. \n\nWait, so does any row have a points difference of 41-07? Looking back:\n\nRow 0 has 41 - 07 as the points difference. And in that row, points are 14.\n\nSo according to the claim, when there's 10 points and a point difference of 41-07, games should be 7. But in reality, the only time we have 10 points is row1 with a different point difference (26-16). So that part doesn't match.\n\nThen the second part: when there are 10 points, the point difference should be 26-16 and games of 6. But in the table, when points=10, games=7, not 6.\n\nSo both parts of the claim don't align with the data. Therefore, the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim makes two assertions that don't hold true based on the provided table. The relevant cells show discrepancies in both point differences and game counts.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"games\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"when the point be 0 the drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. It seems to state that when a team has 0 points, they have 3 drawn games (drawn) and 5 lost games (lost). So I should look for any row in the table where the points column is 0 and check if the corresponding drawn and lost games match 3 and 5 respectively.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a team's performance with columns: games played, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. There are 8 rows in total, indexed from 0 to 7.\n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. Row 0: Points = 14 \u2192 Not relevant.\n2. Row 1: Points = 10 \u2192 Not relevant.\n3. Row 2: Points = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n4. Row 3: Points = 9 \u2192 Not relevant.\n5. Row 4: Points = 7 \u2192 Not relevant.\n6. Row 5: Points = 4 \u2192 Not relevant.\n7. Row 6: Points = 3 \u2192 Not relevant.\n8. Row 7: Points = 0 \u2192 This is the row we're interested in.\n\nIn row 7, let's check the drawn and lost columns:\n- Drawn games: 0\n- Lost games: 7\n\nThe claim expects drawn to be 3 and lost to be 5 when points are 0. However, according to row 7, drawn is 0 and lost is 7. This doesn't match the claim.\n\nTherefore, the claim is not supported by the data in the table. The relevant cells are those in row 7 for the columns 'drawn' and 'lost'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. The task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the table provided in markdown format. It has five columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. There are eight rows of data.\n\nThe claim made is: \"there be 10 point on 2 occasion and the point difference be 30  - 15 and 26  - 21\". \n\nI need to parse this claim carefully. It seems to have two parts:\n1. There are two occasions where the points are 10.\n2. The point differences on these occasions are 30-15 and 26-21.\n\nWait, actually reading again: \"there be 10 point on 2 occasion\" \u2013 does this mean there are two instances where the points column is 10? Or perhaps two instances where points differ by a certain amount? The second part mentions specific point differences: 30-15 and 26-21. So I think the claim is stating that for 10 points, on two occasions, the point differences were 30-15 and 26-21.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Points column has values: 14,10,9,9,7,4,3,0. \nSo the value 10 appears once in row 1 (index starting from 0). There's only one occurrence of 10 points, not two. Therefore, the first part of the claim that there are two occasions with 10 points is false.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I misinterpret. Maybe \"there be 10 point on 2 occasion\" refers to having a total of 10 points across two games? Or maybe it's trying to say that each of those two occasions had 10 points. Let me double-check the table.\n\nLooking at row indices:\nRow 0: points=14\nRow 1: points=10\nRow 2: points=9\nRow 3: points=9\nRow 4: points=7\nRow 5: points=4\nRow 6: points=3\nRow 7: points=0\n\nSo only row 1 has points=10. Therefore, the claim that there are two occasions with 10 points is incorrect.\n\nHowever, looking at the point differences:\nThe claim mentions two specific differences: 30-15 and 26-21.\n\nLooking through the \"points difference\" column:\nRow 0: 41 - 7\nRow 1: 26 -16\nRow 2: 30 -15\nRow 3: 26 -21\nRow 4: 17 -23\nRow 5:19-28\nRow 6:20-28\nRow7:5-46\n\nSo, the differences 30-15 (row 2) and 26-21 (row3) do exist. But are these associated with points=10? \n\nWait, row 2 has points=9, not 10. Row 3 also has points=9. The only row with points=10 is row1, which has a point difference of 26-16.\n\nSo the claim seems to link two things: having points=10 on two occasions and specific point differences on those occasions. But since there's only one occasion with 10 points, the first part is false. Additionally, even if we look at the point differences mentioned (30-15 and 26-21), these are not linked to any 10-point rows; they're in rows where points=9.\n\nTherefore, both parts of the claim don't hold as per the table data. The relevant cells would be those that attempt to verify each part:\n\nFor the points=10: only row1 has points=10.\nFor the point differences 30-15 and 26-21: rows2 and3 respectively.\n\nSo, the claim is false because:\n- There's only one occasion with 10 points, not two.\n- The specific point differences mentioned aren't associated with 10-point games.\n\nThus, the answer should be FALSE. The relevant cells are row1 (points=10), row2 and row3 (point differences).\n</think>\n\nThe claim states there are two occasions with 10 points and specific point differences on those occasions. However, only one row has 10 points, and the mentioned point differences are not associated with that row.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points difference\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. The first part is about draws not being more than 3. That probably refers to the number of drawn games per row, meaning in each team's record. Similarly, the second part says no loss more than 7, which likely means that none of the teams have lost more than 7 games.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: games, drawn, lost, points difference, and points. Each row represents a team's performance. There are eight rows in total.\n\nI'll start by checking each team's drawn games. The claim says \"no draw more than 3,\" so I need to make sure that in every row under the 'drawn' column, the number is 3 or less.\n\nLet me go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Drawn is 0 \u2013 okay.\n2. Row 1: Drawn is 0 \u2013 okay.\n3. Row 2: Drawn is 1 \u2013 okay.\n4. Row 3: Drawn is 1 \u2013 okay.\n5. Row 4: Drawn is 1 \u2013 okay.\n6. Row 5: Drawn is 0 \u2013 okay.\n7. Row 6: Drawn is 1 \u2013 okay.\n8. Row 7: Drawn is 0 \u2013 okay.\n\nSo, all the drawn values are 0 or 1; none exceed 3. That part of the claim holds true.\n\nNext, I'll check the losses. The claim states \"no loss more than 7,\" which means each team's lost games should be \u22647. Looking at the 'lost' column:\n\n1. Row 0: Lost is 0 \u2013 okay.\n2. Row 1: Lost is 2 \u2013 okay.\n3. Row 2: Lost is 2 \u2013 okay.\n4. Row 3: Lost is 2 \u2013 okay.\n5. Row 4: Lost is 3 \u2013 okay.\n6. Row 5: Lost is 5 \u2013 okay.\n7. Row 6: Lost is 5 \u2013 okay.\n8. Row 7: Lost is 7 \u2013 okay.\n\nWait, row 7 has lost games equal to 7. The claim says \"no loss more than 7,\" which would mean up to 7 is allowed. So having exactly 7 losses doesn't violate the condition\u2014it's still within the limit. Therefore, this part also holds true.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied for all rows, the claim should be TRUE. Now, I need to list the relevant cells that were checked. For each row, I looked at 'drawn' and 'lost' columns.\n\nSo the relevant cells include every row's 'drawn' and 'lost' entries because we needed to check each one against the claim. That means 8 rows with both 'drawn' and 'lost' for each.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all drawn values are \u22643 and all lost games are \u22647.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"lost\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
