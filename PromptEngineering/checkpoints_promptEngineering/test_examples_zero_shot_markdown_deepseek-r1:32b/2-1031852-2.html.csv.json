    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim \"kansas city have no post-season record in 2013\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the table. The columns are: season, manager, record, win %, post- season record, post- season win %, and mlb affiliate. Each row represents a different season from 2001 to 2013 with various details about each season.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Kansas City in the year 2013. So I need to find the row corresponding to 2013 and check the relevant columns related to post-season records.\n\nLooking through the table, the last row has the season 2013. The manager for that year was Brian Buchanan, and the mlb affiliate is listed as Kansas City. That's a key point because it connects Kansas City to this specific entry in 2013.\n\nNow, I need to check the \"post- season record\" column for that row. In the table, under the post-season record column for 2013, there are two dashes \"--\", which typically indicate no data or not applicable. This suggests that Kansas City did not have any post-season games or results in that year.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the \"post- season win %\" column for 2013 also shows \"--\", reinforcing the idea that there was no post-season participation or record to report.\n\nSo putting it all together: The claim states that Kansas City had no post-season record in 2013. According to the table, the relevant row for 2013 under the \"post- season record\" and \"post- season win %\" columns shows \"--\", which supports the claim. Therefore, the statement is TRUE.\n\nTo summarize my findings:\n- The 2013 row with Kansas City as the affiliate has \"--\" in both post-season related columns.\n- This indicates there was no post-season activity for Kansas City that year.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"post- season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"mlb affiliate\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has provided a table in markdown format and a claim about the data in that table. My task is to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the information presented.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the claim carefully: \"houston have no post  - season record\". So, the claim is stating that Houston does not have any post-season records listed in the table.\n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: season, manager, record, win %, post-season record, post-season win %, and mlb affiliate. The relevant column for this claim would be \"post - season record\" since we're checking if Houston has any entries here.\n\nNext, I'll go through each row to check the \"mlb affiliate\" and the corresponding \"post - season record\". \n\n- In 2001: Houston's post-season record is 4-0.\n- 2002: The post-season record is listed as \"-\", which might indicate no data or not applicable, but since it's a dash, perhaps it wasn't part of the postseason that year.\n- 2003: Post-season record is 0-2.\n- 2004: \"-\"\n- 2005: \"-\"\n- 2006: 0-2\n- 2007 to 2012: All have \"-\" in post-season record except 2008, which also has \"-\".\n- 2013: The affiliate changes to Kansas City, so not relevant for Houston.\n\nFrom this, I can see that in some years (like 2001 and 2003), Houston does have a post-season record. This contradicts the claim that Houston has no post-season records. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nTo support my answer, I'll need to identify which cells are relevant. Specifically, looking at rows where the affiliate is Houston and checking their post-season records. \n\nFor example:\n- Row 0 (2001): post-season record is 4-0.\n- Row 2 (2003): post-season record is 0-2.\n- Row 6 (2006): post-season record is 0-2.\n\nThese are the relevant cells that show Houston does have post-season records, making the claim FALSE. I'll list these rows in the \"relevant_cells\" section of my JSON response.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"post - season record\"}\n   ]\n}",
