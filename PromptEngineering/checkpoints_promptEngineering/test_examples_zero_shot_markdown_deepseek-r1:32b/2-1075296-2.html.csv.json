    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim about Michael Schumacher is TRUE or FALSE based on the table provided. The claim says: \"michael schumacher be the driver whose constructor be ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retire of 1:32:35.101\"\n\nFirst, let me break down what each part of the claim is asking.\n\n1. **Driver and Constructor Check**: The claim specifies that Michael Schumacher's constructor is Ferrari. Looking at the table, I see that in row 0, under the 'driver' column, it's Michael Schumacher and his 'constructor' is indeed Ferrari. So this part checks out.\n\n2. **Average Grid Number of 1**: The claim states that his average grid number is 1. In the table, each driver has a single grid position listed for the race. For Michael Schumacher, his grid number is 1. Since there's only one grid position mentioned, I'm assuming this refers to the specific race rather than an average over multiple races. So, in this context, his grid number is 1.\n\n3. **Time / Retire of 1:32:35.101**: The time listed for Michael Schumacher under 'time / retired' is exactly 1:32:35.101. This matches the claim perfectly.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other drivers from Ferrari to consider. Looking through the table, Rubens Barrichello is also with Ferrari in row 1. His grid number is 7 and his time is +17.989. So, Michael Schumacher is the only Ferrari driver mentioned in this context, making him the one with grid number 1.\n\nI think all parts of the claim are satisfied based on the information in the table. Therefore, the answer should be TRUE. The relevant cells would include the rows and columns that directly relate to each part of the claim.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"driver\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"grid\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"time  / retired\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
