    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"mcnamara score 3/4 goal when the venue be the stoop\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim. It's saying that Mcnamara scored 3 goals with a conversion ratio of 3 out of 4 attempts (since 3/4 suggests 3 successful conversions from 4 attempts) when the venue was \"the stoop.\" \n\nNow, looking at the table, each row represents a match with various details. The relevant columns here are 'venue' and 'goals.' I need to find any rows where the venue is 'the stoop' and then check if Mcnamara's goals in that row match the claim.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Venue is odsal stadium, not the stoop.\n2. Row 1: Boundary park, nope.\n3. Row 2: The jungle, no.\n4. Row 3: Odsal again.\n5. Row 4: Central park.\n6. Row 5: Stade S\u00e9bastien Charl\u00e9ty, France.\n7. Row 6: Odsal stadium.\n8. Row 7: Same venue.\n9. Row 8: Odsal.\n10. Row 9: Wilderspool stadium.\n11. Row 10: Odsal again.\n12. Row 11: Thrum hall.\n13. Row 12: The willows.\n14. Row 13: Headingley stadium.\n15. Row 14: Odsal.\n16. Row 15: Knowsley road.\n17. Row 16: Odsal again.\n18. Row 17: 10th August at odsal, result is win but looking for 'the stoop'.\n19. Row 18: Don Valley Stadium.\n20. Row 19: Odsal.\n21. Row 20: The Stoop! Here we go.\n\nLooking at row 20: Venue is the stoop. Now, checking the goals column: \"mcnamara 4 / 4.\" So Mcnamara scored 4 goals with 4 conversions. That's a ratio of 4/4, not 3/4 as claimed.\n\nSo the claim says 3/4 at the Stoop, but the table shows 4/4 there. Therefore, the claim is incorrect.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Mcnamara scored 3 goals with a conversion rate of 3 out of 4 when playing at \"the stoop.\" However, the relevant row in the table shows Mcnamara scored 4 goals with all 4 conversions.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 20, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine whether the claim \"at the venue the stoop, the score be 24 - 28\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the instructions carefully. I need to check each condition in the claim against the table and verify if it's supported. The relevant cells are those that match both the venue (\"the stoop\") and the score (\"24 - 28\"). \n\nLooking at the table structure, there are several columns: date, competition, venue, result, score, goals. Each row represents a different match with corresponding details.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row to find where the venue is \"the stoop.\" Scanning down the 'venue' column:\n\n- Row 0: odsal stadium\n- Row 1: boundary park\n- Row 2: the jungle\n- Row 3: odsal stadium\n- ... continuing until I find any occurrence of \"the stoop\"\n\nAfter checking each row, I notice that the last few rows are around August and September. The first occurrence I see is in row 20 (index starts at 0):\n\nRow 21:\n| 31  / 8  / 97 | super league ii | the stoop                 | l         | 24 - 28  | mcnamara 4  / 4 |\n\nSo, the venue here is \"the stoop,\" which matches the claim. Now, I need to check if the score for this row is indeed 24-28. The 'score' column shows \"24 - 28,\" which aligns perfectly with the claim.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there are no other rows where the venue is \"the stoop\" and the score doesn't match. From my scan, it seems this is the only row with \"the stoop\" as the venue.\n\nTherefore, since both conditions (venue and score) are met in this specific row, the claim is fully supported by the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
