    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me read through everything carefully.\n\nThe claim says: \"during 1986, 6 be the value for us dance when the value of us r&b be 9\". Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky, but I think it's saying that in the year 1986, if the US R&B value is 9, then the US Dance value should be 6.\n\nLooking at the table, let me identify which rows are from 1986. Scanning through, I see two entries for 1986:\n\n1. The first one in row index 2 (since we start counting from 0). It has a title \"under the influence\", US value 56, US R&B 9, and US Dance 6.\n2. The second entry is also from 1986, with the title \"animals\". Here, all the values under us, us r&b, and us dance are \"-\".\n\nSo for row index 2, the year is 1986, US R&B is indeed 9, and US Dance is 6. That matches exactly what the claim is stating.\n\nBut wait, there's another entry in 1986 where all values are \"-\", which probably means they aren't relevant here because they don't have any value for us dance or r&b. So this doesn't affect our assessment of the claim since it's specifically about when US R&B is 9.\n\nTherefore, the claim holds true because in that specific row (row index 2) for 1986, when US R&B is 9, US Dance is indeed 6.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE. The relevant cells are from the 1986 row where both us r&b and us dance values are specified.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us r&b\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us dance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a claim about a table is true or false. The table is in markdown format, and the claim is: \"under the influence chart at 56 in the us in 1985 and 1986.\"\n\nFirst, let me understand what the claim is saying. It's talking about the song \"Under the Influence\" charting at position 56 in the US during both 1985 and 1986. I need to check this against the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, it has columns: year, title, us, us r&b, us dance. Each row represents a different entry with these details. My task is to find if \"Under the Influence\" indeed charted at 56 in both 1985 and 1986.\n\nI'll start by scanning through each row of the table to see where \"Under the Influence\" appears. \n\n- The first row is from 1984, title \"pretty mess.\" Not relevant.\n- Second row: 1985, title \"mechanical emotion.\" Not matching.\n- Third row: 1986, \"under the influence.\" This matches part of the claim.\n- Fourth row: 1986 again, but title is \"animals.\" Doesn't match.\n- Fifth row: 1988, \"undress.\" Also doesn't match.\n\nSo, from this, I see that \"Under the Influence\" appears only once in the table, in 1986. Now, looking at the details for that entry:\n\nIn 1986, under \"us,\" it's listed as 56. That matches part of the claim\u2014charting at 56 in 1986.\n\nBut what about 1985? The second row is from 1985 with title \"mechanical emotion.\" There's no entry for \"Under the Influence\" in 1985. Therefore, the claim that it charted in both 1985 and 1986 isn't fully supported because there's no data for 1985.\n\nWait a second\u2014the claim says it charted at 56 in both years. But according to the table, \"Under the Influence\" only has an entry for 1986. There's nothing indicating it charted in 1985. So, the part about 1985 is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the claim isn't fully true because while it did chart at 56 in 1986, there's no data showing it charted in 1985.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that \"Under the Influence\" charted at position 56 in both 1985 and 1986. Checking the table:\n\n- In 1986: The song does have a US chart position of 56.\n- In 1985: There is no entry for \"Under the Influence.\"\n\nThus, the claim is only partially true for 1986 but not for 1985.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"us\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
