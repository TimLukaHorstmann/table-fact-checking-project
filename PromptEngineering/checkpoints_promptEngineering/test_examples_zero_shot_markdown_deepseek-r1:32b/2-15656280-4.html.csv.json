    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let's break down the claim step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"3.0 be the highest number of goal score in the play  - offs that have score 2 in the fa cup.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse this. I think it means we're looking for players who scored exactly 2 goals in the FA Cup and then checking their maximum (highest) goals in the Play-offs.\n\nSo, step one is to identify all rows where the FA Cup column has a value of 2. Then, among those rows, look at the 'play - offs' column to find the highest number there. If that highest number is 3, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n1. Go through each row and check the FA Cup score.\n   - Paul Barnes: FA Cup = 2 \u2192 Yes\n   - Kirk Jackson: FA Cup = 1 \u2192 No\n   - Gregg Blundell: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Junior Agogo: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Wayne Curtis: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Dino Maamria: FA Cup = 1 \u2192 No\n   - Daryl Clare: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Mark Stein: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Christian Moore: FA Cup = 2 \u2192 Yes\n   - Steve West: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - David Brown: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Neil Grayson: FA Cup = 0 \u2192 No\n   - Mark Quayle: FA Cup =1 \u2192 No\n   - Warren Patmore: FA Cup=0\u2192No\n   - Paul Moore: FA Cup=0\u2192No\n   - Kayode Odejayi: FA Cup=1\u2192No\n   - Lee Elam: FA Cup=1\u2192No\n   - Kevin Gall: FA Cup=0\u2192No\n   - Steve Guinan: FA Cup=0\u2192No\n\nSo, only Paul Barnes and Christian Moore have FA Cup scores of 2.\n\nNow, check their 'play - offs' column:\n\n- Paul Barnes has play-offs =1.\n- Christian Moore has play-offs=0.\n\nThe highest among these is 1. The claim says the highest should be 3.0, which isn't the case here. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nThe relevant cells are where FA Cup is 2 and their corresponding play-offs. So, rows 0 (Paul Barnes) and 8 (Christian Moore), columns 'fa cup' and 'play - offs'.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"fa cup\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"play - offs\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
