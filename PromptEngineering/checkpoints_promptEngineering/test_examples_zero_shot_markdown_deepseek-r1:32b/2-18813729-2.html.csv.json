    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: \"only 1 of the song from the remix dead guy remix be not in 2003.\" So it seems like there are songs with the remix \"dead guys remix,\" and out of those, only one is not from the year 2003. Alternatively, it could mean that only one song among all has a remix called \"dead guys remix\" but isn't from 2003.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row for the remix column to see if it's \"dead guys remix.\"\n\n- Row 0: Remix is \"dead guys remix,\" year is 2003. So this song is both with that remix and in 2003.\n- Row 1: Same as above, remix is \"dead guys remix\" and year is 2003.\n- Row 2: Remix is \"dead guys remix,\" year is 2003 again.\n- Row 3: Remix is also \"dead guys remix,\" but the year here is 2005. So this song has that remix but isn't from 2003.\n\nRows 4 and 5 have different remixes, so they don't apply to this claim.\n\nSo in total, out of four songs with \"dead guys remix,\" three are from 2003 and one (row 3) is from 2005. Therefore, only one song with that remix isn't from 2003, which aligns with the claim.\n\nThus, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that among songs remixed by \"dead guys remix,\" only one was not released in 2003. Checking the table:\n\n- Rows 0,1,2 have the remix and year 2003.\n- Row 3 has the same remix but is from 2005.\n\nTherefore, exactly one song with that remix isn't from 2003, making the claim TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"remix\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"remix\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the claim \"the year 2005 be the only ear that do not have multiple song\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Hmm, first, I notice a typo in the claim: \"ear\" should probably be \"year\". So, I think it's saying that 2005 is the only year where there isn't more than one song listed.\n\nLooking at the table, each row represents a different song with its respective details. The years mentioned are 2003, 2003 again (two entries), 2005, and then 2010 twice. So let me count how many songs there are per year.\n\nFor 2003: There are three entries\u2014blondie's \"good boys\", chicane's \"locking down\", and lamb's \"wonder\". That's more than one song.\n\nIn 2005, I see only one entry: texas with \"can't resist\".\n\nThen in 2010, there are two songs: pixie lott's \"turn it up\" and perry mystique's \"party like ur 18 feat sway\". So that's more than one song.\n\nThe claim is saying that 2005 is the only year without multiple songs. From what I see, that seems correct because all other years have either two or three songs listed, except for 2005 which has just one. \n\nSo, relevant cells would be each row in the table where the year column shows 2003, 2005, and 2010. That way, I can confirm how many songs are under each year.\n\nPutting it all together, since 2005 is indeed the only year with a single song, the claim holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe table lists multiple songs per year except for 2005, which has only one entry.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"only 1 of the artist list from the remix dead guy remix have the name of a state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll parse the claim to understand what it's asking.

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. The task is to determine whether the claim \"there be 1 single song that be produce after 2003 that do not have an album title list\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the claim means. So, breaking it down:\n\n- \"produce after 2003\": This refers to songs released in the years 2004 and beyond.\n- \"that do not have an album title list\": This means that for those songs produced after 2003, their album titles should be listed or available. If a song doesn't have its album listed (i.e., it's N/A), then it fits the condition.\n\nLooking at the table provided:\n\nThe years in the table are 2003, 2005, and 2010. So any song with a year after 2003 would be from 2005 or 2010.\n\nLet's list out each relevant row:\n\nRow indices start at 0:\n- Row 0: Year 2003 (blondie) - not after 2003.\n- Row 1: Year 2003 (chicane) - same as above.\n- Row 2: Year 2003 (lamb) - same.\n- Row 3: Year 2005 (texas) - this is after 2003.\n- Row 4: Year 2010 (pixie lott) - also after 2003.\n- Row 5: Year 2010 (perry mystique) - same as above.\n\nNow, check the album titles for rows 3, 4, and 5:\n\nRow 3: Album is \"red book\" \u2013 this is listed, so it has an album title.\nRow 4: Album is \"turn it up\" \u2013 also listed.\nRow 5: Album is \"n/a\" \u2013 which means no album title is provided.\n\nSo the claim says there's exactly one song after 2003 without an album title. Let me count:\n\n- Row 5 (year 2010, perry mystique) has n/a for album.\nThat's just one instance where a song produced after 2003 doesn't have an album listed.\n\nLooking at rows 3 and 4: Both have albums listed.

So, the task is to determine whether a given claim about a table is TRUE or FALSE based on the data provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the claim thoroughly. The claim states: \"the song from dee  - lux remix be preform by different artist but the song be all from the same year.\" Let me break this down into two main parts:\n\n1. **Different Artists Performing the Song with 'dee  - lux remix'**: This means that each song listed under the \"remix\" column as 'dee  - lux remix' should have been performed by different artists.\n\n2. **All These Songs Are From the Same Year**: The year corresponding to these songs should be consistent across all entries where the remix is 'dee  - lux remix'.\n\nNext, I'll look at the table provided to find the relevant data points. \n\nLooking through the \"remix\" column, I see that there are two entries with 'dee  - lux remix':\n- Row 4: Artist is \"pixie lott\", Year is 2010.\n- Row 5: Artist is \"perry mystique\", Year is 2010.\n\nNow, checking the first condition about different artists performing these songs. The two artists are indeed different: Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique. So that checks out.\n\nFor the second condition, both of these entries have the same year, 2010. Therefore, all songs with 'dee  - lux remix' in their remix column are from the same year.\n\nSince both conditions in the claim are satisfied based on the data provided, the answer should be TRUE.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the claim is saying. It mentions \"songs from the dee - lux,\" which I think refers to remixes where the remixer is \"dee - lux.\" So, I should look for rows in the table where the 'remix' column has \"dee - lux remix.\"\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- The first four entries have \"dead guys remix.\"\n- Starting from 2010, there are two entries with \"dee - lux remix\": one by Pixie Lott and another by Perry Mystique.\n\nSo, the songs with \"dee - lux remix\" are in 2010. Now, the claim says that only one of these songs is not from 2005. Wait, but all these songs with \"dee - lux remix\" are from 2010. So none of them are from 2005.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the claim. Let me parse it again: \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" It could mean that among all songs remixed by dee - lux, only one is not released in 2005. But in our table, both dee - lux remixes are from 2010. So none are from 2005.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the claim is trying to say that of the songs associated with \"dee - lux,\" only one isn't from 2005. But looking at the data:\n\n- The rows with \"dee - lux remix\" are row indices 4 and 5 (assuming starting count from 0). Both have years 2010.\n\nSo, none of them are from 2005. Therefore, all of the songs with dee - lux remixes are not in 2005. The claim says \"only 1\" is not in 2005, but actually both are not in 2005. So that makes the claim FALSE.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all rows:\n\nRow 0: 2003\nRow 1: 2003\nRow 2: 2003\nRow 3: 2005\nRows 4 and 5: 2010\n\nSo, the songs with \"dee - lux remix\" are in rows 4 and 5. The claim says that only one of these is not from 2005. But both are from 2010, so neither is from 2005. That means the number of such songs not in 2005 is two, but the claim says it's only one. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe the claim refers to all songs except those remixed by dee - lux? Let me read again. The wording is a bit unclear. \"only 1 of the song from the dee - lux be not in 2005.\" So it's about songs that are from dee - lux, meaning their remix is dee - lux.\n\nIn this case, all such songs (rows 4 and 5) are not in 2005. Therefore, there are two such songs not in 2005, so the claim which says only one is incorrect. Hence, FALSE.\n\nSo the relevant cells would be the rows where remix is dee - lux, i.e., rows 4 and 5, specifically looking at their 'year' column to check if they're not 2005.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that only one song remixed by \"dee - lux\" isn't from 2005.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the table. The columns are: year, artist, song, album, and remix. Each row represents a different song entry with details in these columns.\n\nThe claim is comparing the number of songs released in 2003 versus 2005. So, I need to count how many entries there are for each of those years.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- For 2003:\n  - Row 0: blondie, \"good boys\"\n  - Row 1: chicane, \"locking down\"\n  - Row 2: lamb, \"wonder\"\n  \nSo that's three songs in 2003.\n\n- For 2005:\n  - Row 3: texas, \"can't resist\"\n\nOnly one song is listed for 2005.\n\nWait, but the claim says \"as many songs as\" between 2003 and 2005. Since 2003 has three and 2005 only has one, they aren't equal in number. Therefore, the claim is FALSE.\n\nNow, to identify the relevant cells. I need to look at each row's year column because that's where the data about the years is stored. For each entry, if the year is 2003 or 2005, it's a relevant cell for counting.\n\nSo, looking back:\n\n- Rows 0,1,2: all have year 2003\n- Row 3: has year 2005\n\nThe other rows (4 and 5) are from 2010, which aren't part of the comparison, so they're not relevant.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are the 'year' column for each row.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim \"only 1 of the artist list from the dee - lux remix have the name of a state\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the table. It has columns: year, artist, song, album, and remix. The claim focuses on artists who are associated with the \"dee - lux remix\". So, I'll start by identifying all rows where the remix is \"dee - lux remix\".\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 4 (index 4) has remix as \"dee - lux remix\" with artist \"pixie lott\".\n- Row 5 (index 5) also has remix as \"dee - lux remix\" with artist \"perry mystique\".\n\nSo, there are two artists associated with \"dee - lux remix\": pixie lott and perry mystique.\n\nNext, the claim states that only one of these artists has a name that is the name of a state. I need to check each of these two artists' names against US state names.\n\n1. **pixie lott**: This doesn't seem like a US state. The closest state name might be \"lotte\", but that's not a state. So, pixie lott isn't a state name.\n\n2. **perry mystique**: Again, this doesn't correspond to any US state. Perry is a common name, and Mystique sounds more like a character or brand rather than a state.\n\nWait, did I miss something? Let me double-check the artists. Maybe \"pixie lott\" refers to something else? No, it's an artist's name. Similarly, \"perry mystique\" doesn't match any state names.\n\nBut hold on, looking back at row 4 and 5, both have remix as \"dee - lux\". So that's two artists. The claim says only one of them has a state name. But from my analysis, neither do. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the artists. Are there any other rows with \"dee - lux remix\"? No, only rows 4 and 5 have that remix. So two artists: pixie lott and perry mystique.\n\nNow, do either of these names correspond to a US state? Let's list some states that start with 'p' to check:\n\n- Pennsylvania\n- Texas (but the artist is \"texas\" in row 3, but that's a different remix)\n- Florida\n- California\n\nNo, none match \"pixie lott\" or \"perry mystique\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Could \"mystique\" refer to something? No, it doesn't seem like a state.\n\nSo according to this, neither artist has a name that's a US state. But the claim says only 1 does. So if zero is the correct number, then the claim is FALSE because it's claiming there's one when in reality, there are none.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong about \"pixie lott\". Maybe \"lott\" refers to something? Like a place or abbreviation? Not that I know of.\n\nAlternatively, could \"perry\" refer to a state? Perry is a city name in some states, like Oklahoma has Perry, but it's not a state. Similarly, mystique doesn't match any state.\n\nTherefore, the claim that only one artist from \"dee - lux remix\" has a state name as their name is FALSE because neither of the two artists do.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is evaluated by checking each relevant cell in the table where the remix is \"dee - lux remix\".

So I'm looking for any entry in the table where the year is after 2005, and the artist's album is listed (i.e., not \"n/a\").\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Rows are indexed starting from 0.\n- The columns we care about are \"year\", \"artist\", and \"album\".\n\nNow, checking each row:\n\n1. Row 0: Year 2003, before 2005. Doesn't count.\n2. Row 1: Year 2003, same as above.\n3. Row 2: Year 2003, same.\n4. Row 3: Year 2005. The claim says \"after 2005\", so 2005 is not after, it's the same year. So this doesn't count either.\n5. Row 4: Year 2010. That's after 2005. Album title is \"turn it up\". So that counts.\n6. Row 5: Year 2010. Album is \"n/a\", so even though the year is after 2005, since there's no album listed, this doesn't satisfy the claim.\n\nSo, only row 4 meets all conditions: artist Pixie Lott produced a song in 2010 (after 2005) with an album title listed. Thus, there is exactly one such artist, making the claim TRUE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\":\"album\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim is true or false based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nThe claim says: \"the song from the dee  - lux remix be preform by the same art and the song be from different year.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I think there might be some typos in the claim; maybe it meant \"performed\" instead of \"preform,\" but regardless, the main points seem to be about two songs with a specific remix performed by the same artist from different years.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns here are 'artist' and 'remix', as well as 'year'. The claim mentions the \"dee  - lux remix\", so I'll focus on rows where the remix is that. Let me check each row:\n\n- Row 0: Remix is \"dead guys remix\" \u2013 not relevant.\n- Row 1: Same as above.\n- Row 2: Same as above.\n- Row 3: Same as above, but this one's from 2005. Still, the remix isn't \"dee - lux\".\n- Row 4: The remix is \"dee - lux remix\". So artist here is Pixie Lott, year is 2010.\n- Row 5: Remix is also \"dee - lux remix\", artist is Perry Mystique, year is 2010.\n\nWait, so both of these are in the same year. The claim says they're from different years. So that's a problem because both are from 2010. Therefore, the songs with the dee-lux remix are by two different artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique), but they're both from the same year.\n\nSo the first part of the claim is partially true: the same artist? No, they're different artists. The second part says they're from different years \u2013 which isn't the case here; both are 2010.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the claim. It says \"the song from the dee - lux remix be preform by the same art and the song be from different year.\" So it's saying that the same artist performed both songs with the dee-lux remix in different years? But looking at the data, there are two different artists (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique) each with their own song having the same remix. Both are in 2010.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because the same artist didn't perform both; they're different artists. Also, even if it were the same artist, the years aren't different \u2013 both are in 2010.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is false because there's only one song with the dee-lux remix in 2010 by two different artists.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"artist\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"year\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
