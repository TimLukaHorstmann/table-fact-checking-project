    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the claim: \"on june 9, the record be 28 - 29 with a loss of mulholland (5 - 6) and an opponent of the yankee.\" \n\nFirst, I need to check each part against the table.\n\n1. **Date Check**: The claim mentions June 9. Scanning the date column, row 7 has \"june 9\".\n\n2. **Opponent Check**: Opponent should be the Yankees. Looking at the opponent column for row 7, it's \"yankees\". That matches.\n\n3. **Loss Details**: The loss is attributed to mulholland (5 - 6). In the loss column of row 7, it says \"mulholland (5 - 6)\". This matches exactly.\n\n4. **Record Check**: The record should be 28 - 29. Checking the record column in row 7, it's listed as 28 - 29. That also matches.\n\nAll parts of the claim are supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because all specified details match the table entry for June 9.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"loss\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"record\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
