It lists several matches with details like team names, aggregate scores, and two legs of each match. Each row represents a different match between two teams.\n\nLooking for \"asc diaraf,\" I find them in the third row (row index 2). The columns are: team1 is asc diaraf, agg is 3-4, team2 is stade malien, and the two legs are 3-0 and 0-4. \n\nThe claim states that asc diaraf lost to stade malien in the competition. From the table, asc diaraf's aggregate score (agg) is 3-4 against stade malien. Since 3 is less than 4, this means asc diaraf indeed lost. \n\nAdditionally, looking at each leg: the first leg was a win for asc diaraf with 3-0, but the second leg resulted in a loss of 0-4. The aggregate determines the overall outcome, so despite winning one leg, they lost the series.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the data in the table.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"team 2\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

The columns are team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams with their aggregate scores and each leg's results.\n\nThe claim mentions \"secteur 6\" and \"enugu rangers.\" I'll scan the table for these names. Scanning through team 1 and team 2 columns, I find that in row index 7, team 1 is \"secteur 6\" and team 2 is \"enugu rangers.\"\n\nNext, I need to check the result of this match. The aggregate score (agg) is shown as 1 - 2 for secteur 6 vs enugu rangers. This means secteur 6 scored 1 goal in total, and enugu rangers scored 2 goals.\n\nThe claim states that \"secteur 6 lose by 1 against the enugu ranger.\" Since the aggregate score is 1-2, secteur 6 lost by a margin of 1 goal (2 - 1 = 1). Therefore, the claim is accurate.\n\nTo verify further, looking at each leg: in the 1st leg, it's 1-1, and in the 2nd leg, it's 0-1. Adding up team 1's goals: 1 + 0 = 1; team 2's goals: 1 + 1 = 2.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. It has columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The rows represent matches between different teams with their respective scores.\n\nThe claim mentions \"young african\" which seems like it could be \"young africans\" as in the table. I'll search for that team in the table. Scanning through the \"team 1\" column, I find a row where \"team 1\" is \"young africans\". Let's note down this row index.\n\nLooking at that specific row: team 1 is young africans, agg (aggregate) score is 2-0 against lavori publici. The 1st leg was 2-0 and the 2nd leg was 0-0. So in total, young africans scored 2 goals in the first leg and 0 in the second, making their total aggregate score 2-0.\n\nNow, the claim says they scored 2 points. Wait, in football (soccer), a goal is worth one point towards the match result. However, sometimes \"points\" can refer to league points where a win gives 3 points, a draw gives 1 each, and a loss 0. But in this context of aggregate scores, it's more about goals than points.\n\nBut let me double-check: The claim is about scoring points, not goals. In the table, under \"agg\", young africans have 2-0, which indicates their total score (goals) was 2. If we consider that each goal might equate to a point in some contexts, then they scored 2 points. Alternatively, if it's about match outcome, a 2-0 win would give them 3 points in a league scenario.\n\nBut the table doesn't provide information on points; it shows goals. The claim mentions \"score 2 point\", which is singular, but maybe it's a typo for \"points\". Regardless, the aggregate goals are 2. So if we interpret points as goals, then yes, they scored 2 points (goals). If it's about league points, since they won the match, they'd get 3 points, not 2.\n\nHowever, the table doesn't have a column for points; it only shows scores. Therefore, based on the information given, we can confirm that young africans scored 2 goals in their aggregate (agg) against lavori publici. So the claim is TRUE because they indeed had an aggregate score of 2-0.\n\nRelevant cells would be the \"team 1\" and \"agg\" columns for that row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their scores in both legs and the aggregate result including any penalties if applicable.\n\nThe claim is about \"as porto novo\" scoring no points against \"victoria club mokanda.\" In soccer, a point typically refers to a goal. So, I need to check how many goals as porto novo scored in their matches against victoria club mokanda.\n\nLooking through the table rows:\n\n1. The first row is about al-merrikh vs tele sc asmara.\n2. Second row: abaluhya united vs great olympics.\n3. Third: asc diaraf vs stade malien.\n4. Fourth: maseru united vs mmm tamatave.\n5. Fifth: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda.\n\nAh, here it is. The fifth row shows the match between as porto novo and victoria club mokanda. Let's check their aggregate score and each leg.\n\nAggregate score for team 1 (as porto novo) is 0 - 3 against team 2 (victoria club mokanda). So, in total, as porto novo scored 0 goals, and the opponent scored 3.\n\nNow looking at each leg:\n\n1st leg: as porto novo scored 0, opponent scored 1.\n2nd leg: as porto novo again scored 0, opponent scored 2.\n\nAdding both legs, as porto novo didn't score any goals in either match. Therefore, they indeed scored no points (goals) against victoria club mokanda.\n\nThe relevant cells are the ones showing the scores for as porto novo and their opponents.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the claim \"canon yaound\u00e9 score 5 more points than their opponent\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find the row in the table where canon yaound\u00e9 is mentioned. Looking at the table, I see that each row has a team1 and team2 with some scores under agg (aggregate), 1st leg, and 2nd leg. The rows are indexed starting from 0.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Row 0: al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara\n- Row 1: abaluhya united vs great olympics\n- Row 2: asc diaraf vs stade malien\n- Row 3: maseru united vs mmm tamatave\n- Row 4: as porto novo vs victoria club mokanda\n- Row 5: canon yaound\u00e9 vs as solidarit\u00e9\n- Row 6: esp\u00e9rance vs al - ahly (benghazi)\n- Row 7: secteur 6 vs enugu rangers\n- Row 8: young africans vs lavori publici\n\nSo, canon yaound\u00e9 is in row 5. Let's look at the details for that row.\n\nIn row 5:\n- team1: canon yaound\u00e9\n- agg: 9 - 4\n- team2: as solidarit\u00e9\n- 1st leg: 7 - 3\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 1\n\nThe claim mentions the total points scored by canon yaound\u00e9 and their opponent. I think in sports, especially football/soccer, \"points\" can refer to goals scored. Alternatively, it could mean the aggregate score which includes penalties if there's a shootout.\n\nLooking at the agg column for row 5: 9 - 4. So, canon yaound\u00e9 has 9 and their opponent as solidarit\u00e9 has 4.\n\nThe claim says they scored 5 more points than their opponent. Let me check: 9 (canon) minus 4 (opponent) equals 5. That seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the cells used are relevant. The agg column is the aggregate score which includes both legs and possibly any additional scores from penalty shootouts if needed. In this case, it's just 9-4 without any indication of penalties, so it's straightforward.\n\nSo, the relevant cell for team1's score is the agg column under canon yaound\u00e9 (row 5). The opponent's score is also in the same cell but as their value. Alternatively, I could consider both team1 and team2's scores from the agg column to compare.\n\nWait, should I include both cells? Because to determine if canon scored 5 more than their opponent, I need both scores. So, in row 5, the agg is 9 -4, so canon has 9, opponent 4. The difference is indeed 5 points.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because 9 minus 4 equals 5. The relevant cells are row 5, column \"agg\".\n\nI don't think I need to look at the 1st leg and 2nd leg scores because the agg already combines both legs. But just to be thorough: in the 1st leg, canon scored 7-3, which is a difference of 4. In the 2nd leg, they scored 2-1, a difference of 1. So total over two legs, their scoring was (7+2) - (3+1) =9-4, same as agg.\n\nHence, I'm confident that the claim is TRUE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because canon yaound\u00e9's aggregate score of 9 minus their opponent's 4 equals a difference of 5 points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"agg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

It says that Young Africans scored zero points in the competition. The table lists various teams and their scores across two legs of matches.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll scan each row to find any mention of \"young africans\". Scanning through, I see a row where team 1 is \"young africans\" (note the capitalization). Let me check that row:\n\n- The \"team 1\" column has \"young africans\" (assuming this is a typo and should be \"Young Africans\"). \n- The \"agg\" column shows \"2 - 0\". This likely represents their aggregate score over both legs.\n- In the first leg, they scored 2-0 against team 2, which is \"lavori publici\".\n- In the second leg, it's a draw: 0-0.\n\nWait, but the claim says they scored zero points. Points in football are typically awarded as 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. So let me check each match.\n\nIn the first leg, Young Africans won 2-0 against Lavori Publici. That would give them 3 points. In the second leg, it's a 0-0 draw, which gives each team 1 point. \n\nSo their total points from both legs would be 3 (from the win) + 1 (from the draw) = 4 points. Therefore, they didn't score zero points overall.\n\nAlternatively, if the claim is interpreted as scoring zero goals in either leg, that's also not true because in the first leg, they scored two goals.\n\nSo based on this, the claim that Young Africans scored zero points is FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are from the row where \"young africans\" are listed.

Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their aggregate scores as well as each leg's result.\n\nI need to find the row that involves \"asc diaraf\" and \"stade malien.\" Scanning through the table, I notice the third row:\n\n| asc diaraf       | 3 - 4              | stade malien           | 3 - 0      | 0 - 4      |\n\nHere, team1 is asc diaraf, and team2 is stade malien. The aggregate score is 3-4, which means stade malien won overall because they have the higher number.\n\nNow, looking at each leg: in the first leg (team1's home), asc diaraf scored 3-0 against stade malien. That seems like a win for asc diaraf. However, in the second leg (team2's home), stade malien came back strong with a 4-0 victory. \n\nTo determine the overall winner, we add both legs together. Asc diaraf scored 3+0=3 goals, while stade malien scored 0+4=4 goals. Since 4 is greater than 3, stade malien won the aggregate.\n\nThe claim states that \"asc diaraf win against stade malien.\" Based on the aggregate score (3-4), asc diaraf did not win; they lost. Therefore, the claim is false.\n\nI should also consider if the tournament mentioned (1971 African Cup of Champion Clubs) matches the data in the table. The problem doesn't provide information about the year, so I can only assume that this table pertains to the 1971 event as per the claim.

In football matches, the aggregate score combines both legs. If it's written as 1-2 for secteur 6 against enugu rangers, that means secteur 6 scored 1 goal in total across both legs, and enugu rangers scored 2. \n\nSince 1 is less than 2, secteur 6 did not win the match; they lost.

Let me find that row:\n\nIn row index 5 (assuming rows start at 0), it shows:\n- team 1: canon yaound\u00e9\n- agg: 9 - 4\n- team 2: as solidarit\u00e9\n- 1st leg: 7 - 3\n- 2nd leg: 2 - 1\n\nWait, the aggregate score is 9-4 in favor of canon yaound\u00e9. Breaking it down into legs:\n- In the first leg, canon scored 7 goals and their opponent scored 3.\n- In the second leg, canon scored 2 and the opponent scored 1.\n\nSo adding up both legs for canon: 7 + 2 = 9 goals. Their opponent: 3 + 1 = 4 goals.\n\nThe claim is that canon yaound\u00e9 scored zero points (goals) against their opponent. But according to these numbers, they scored a total of 9 goals across both legs. That means they definitely didn't score zero; in fact, they scored quite a few.\n\nTherefore, the claim is false because canon yaound\u00e9 did score multiple goals, not zero.\n</think>\n\nThe relevant cells are where canon yaound\u00e9's scores are listed: first leg and second leg columns for that row. Since both legs show goals scored by them, it contradicts the claim of scoring zero points.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
