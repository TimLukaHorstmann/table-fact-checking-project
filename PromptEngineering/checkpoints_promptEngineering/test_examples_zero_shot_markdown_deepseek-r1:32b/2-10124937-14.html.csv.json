    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this table here and a claim to check. The claim is: \"When Marseille be the first team, the first leg's score be 3-1.\" I need to figure out if this is TRUE or FALSE by looking at the table provided.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the table. It has columns for team 1, aggregate (agg), team 2, 1st leg, and 2nd leg. Each row represents a match between two teams, showing their scores in both legs and the overall aggregate.\n\nThe claim is specifically about Marseille being the first team, so I need to look for rows where \"team 1\" is Marseille. Scanning through the table, I see that the last row lists \"marseille\" as team 1. \n\nIn that same row, under the \"1st leg\" column, it shows \"3 - 1.\" The claim states that when Marseille is the first team, the first leg's score is 3-1. From this, it seems to match exactly.\n\nI should double-check to make sure there are no other rows where Marseille is listed as team 1. Looking through each row:\n- Anderlecht vs Bayern Munich\n- Rangers vs Werder Bremen\n- Bolton Wanderers vs Sporting CP\n- Bayer Leverkusen vs Hamburg\n- Benfica vs Getafe\n- Fiorentina vs Everton\n- Tottenham Hotspur vs PSV Eindhoven\n- Marseille vs Zenit St. Petersburg\n\nOnly the last row has Marseille as team 1. So, there's only one instance to check.\n\nSince in that row, under \"1st leg,\" it's indeed 3-1, the claim holds true. There are no discrepancies or other entries conflicting with this information.\n\nTherefore, the relevant cells are:\n- The row where \"team 1\" is Marseille (row index 7).\n- The \"1st leg\" column of that same row.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"team 1\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out whether the claim is true or false. The claim states: \"the 1st leg score and the 2nd leg score be the same for the bolton wanderer.\" \n\nFirst, I need to locate Bolton Wanderers in the table. Looking at the table rows:\n\nRow indices start from 0, so let's go through each row.\n\n- Row 0: Anderlecht vs Bayern Munich\n- Row 1: Rangers vs Werder Bremen\n- Row 2: Bolton Wanderers vs Sporting CP\n\nSo, Bolton is in row index 2. Now, I need to check the scores for both legs.\n\nLooking at row 2:\n- Team 1: Bolton Wanderers\n- Agg (aggregate): 1 - 2\n- Team 2: Sporting CP\n- 1st leg: 1 - 1\n- 2nd leg: 0 - 1\n\nWait, the claim is about whether both legs have the same score. So, I need to compare the scores of the 1st and 2nd legs for Bolton Wanderers.\n\nFor the 1st leg (Bolton vs Sporting CP), the score was 1-1.\nIn the 2nd leg, it was 0-1.\n\nHmm, these are different. The 1st leg ended in a draw, while the 2nd leg resulted in a loss for Bolton.\n\nSo, since the scores aren't the same across both legs, the claim is false. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"1st leg\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"2nd leg\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
