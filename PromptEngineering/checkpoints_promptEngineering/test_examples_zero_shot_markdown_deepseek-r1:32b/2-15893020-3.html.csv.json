I need to determine whether the claim \"average be 0.1 for deon kruis\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I'll locate Deon Kruis in the table. Scanning through the player names, I find him at row index 17 (if we start counting from 0). Now, looking at the columns, I need to check his average. The relevant column here is \"average\".\n\nLooking at Deon Kruis' row, under the \"average\" column, it says \"n/a\". This likely stands for 'not applicable' or 'not available', meaning there isn't a recorded average for him in this table.\n\nThe claim states that his average should be 0.1. However, since the table shows \"n/a\", there's no numerical value provided to support an average of 0.1. Without any data indicating an average, we can't verify the claim as true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given in the table, the claim is FALSE.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"average\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
