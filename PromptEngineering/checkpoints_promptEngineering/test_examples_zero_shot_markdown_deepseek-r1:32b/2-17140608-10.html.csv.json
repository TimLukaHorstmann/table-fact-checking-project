Each row corresponds to a game played by the team.\n\nLooking at the 'high points' column for each game:\n\n- Game 76: Paul Pierce (32)\n- Game 77: Paul Pierce (21)\n- Game 78: Rajon Rondo (31)\n- Game 79: Paul Pierce (28)\n- Game 80: Paul Pierce (14) [But this was a loss, but the claim is about leading in points regardless of win/loss]\n- Game 81: Paul Pierce (31)\n- Game 82: Glen Davis (21)\n\nNow, let's count how many times Paul Pierce led:\n\nGame 76: Yes\nGame 77: Yes\nGame 79: Yes\nGame 80: Yes\nGame 81: Yes\n\nThat's five games where Paul Pierce led in points. \n\nWait a minute, Game 82 is the seventh game but it's led by Glen Davis, so that doesn't count towards Paul's total.\n\nTherefore, Paul led in exactly five out of seven games as per the claim.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE because Paul Pierce led in points for 5 out of the 7 listed games.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the given table. The claim states: \"Rajon Rondo have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game.\"\n\nFirst, let me parse the claim carefully. It's saying that Rajon Rondo had the highest number of assists for the Celtics in a single game, specifically 12 assists.\n\nLooking at the table, I need to find which games Rajon Rondo contributed and check his assist numbers. The relevant columns here are \"high assists\" and \"record.\" Each row represents a different game with various details like date, team, score, etc.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n- **Row 76 (April 1):** High assists are Rajon Rondo with 9. That's less than 12.\n- **Row 77 (April 3):** Again, Rondo has 6 assists here. Still lower than 12.\n- **Row 78 (April 8):** The high assists are split between Rondo and Stephon Marbury with 5 each. So Rondo's assist here is 5.\n- **Row 79 (April 10):** Rondo leads with 12 assists in this game. This matches the claim exactly.\n- **Row 80 (April 12):** Rondo has 6 assists, and it's a loss, but that's not relevant to our claim about having the most assists.\n- **Row 81 (April 14):** The high assists are split between Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury with 5 each. Rondo isn't mentioned here.\n- **Row 82 (April 15):** Stephon Marbury has 8 assists, so no mention of Rondo in this game.\n\nSo, in row index 79 (which is the fourth row if starting from zero, but I think the rows are numbered as per the table), Rondo had 12 assists. That's exactly what the claim states. \n\nI should also make sure that there isn't any other game where Rondo has more than 12 assists. Looking through all the rows, 12 is indeed the highest in row 79. No other game shows Rondo with 12 or more.\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because in game number 79 against Miami on April 10th, Rajon Rondo had 12 assists, which is the highest he achieved in a single game as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is verified by checking each row for Rajon Rondo's assist count. The relevant cell is where he has 12 assists.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high assists\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the claim \"the celtics win all of the game they play at td bank north garden\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, let's understand the claim: It states that every game played by the Celtics at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in a win. So, I need to check each game where the location was TD Banknorth Garden and see if all those games were wins for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table, the relevant columns are \"location attendance\" and \"score.\" The \"score\" column shows whether the game was won (w) or lost (l). The \"location attendance\" indicates where the game was played; I'm interested in rows where this is TD Banknorth Garden.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\n1. **Row 0**: April 1 vs Charlotte. Location is TD Banknorth Garden, and the score shows a win with 111-109 in 2OT. So that's a Celtics win.\n2. **Row 1**: April 3 vs Atlanta. Again, location is TD Banknorth Garden, and they won 104-92 in OT.\n3. **Row 2**: April 8 vs New Jersey. Location is same, and it's another win with 106-104 in OT.\n4. **Row 3**: April 10 vs Miami. TD Banknorth Garden again, Celtics won 105-98 in OT.\n5. **Row 4**: April 12 vs Cleveland. The location is Quicken Loans Arena, which isn't TD Banknorth Garden, so I can skip this row as it doesn't affect the claim.\n6. **Row 5**: April 14 vs Philadelphia. Back at TD Banknorth Garden, they won 100-98 in OT.\n7. **Row 6**: April 15 vs Washington. Again at TD Banknorth Garden, Celtics won 115-107 in OT.\n\nSo, all games played at TD Banknorth Garden (rows 0 to 3, 5, and 6) resulted in wins for the Celtics. There's no game where they lost at their home court according to this table. Therefore, the claim holds true based on the provided data.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is TRUE as all games at TD Banknorth Garden were won by the Celtics.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"location attendance\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says, \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by paul pierce.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like we're looking for the highest points scored by any Celtic player in a single game listed in the table, and whether Paul Pierce achieved that high with 32 points.\n\nLooking at the table, there are several rows corresponding to different games. Each row has a \"high points\" column which lists the top scorer(s) for that game along with their point totals. \n\nI'll go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 76):** The high points are listed as \"paul pierce (32)\". So Paul Pierce scored 32 points in this game.\n2. **Row 1 (Game 77):** High points are \"paul pierce (21)\". That's lower than 32.\n3. **Row 2 (Game 78):** Rajon Rondo has the high with 31 points, which is still less than 32.\n4. **Row 3 (Game 79):** Paul Pierce again scores 28 points. Still not higher than 32.\n5. **Row 4 (Game 80):** Paul Pierce has 14 points here. Lower than before.\n6. **Row 5 (Game 81):** Paul Pierce scores 31 points, which is close but still one point less than 32.\n7. **Row 6 (Game 82):** Glen Davis leads with 21 points.\n\nFrom this, it looks like the highest single-game points by a Celtic player in the table are indeed 32 points by Paul Pierce in Game 76. \n\nSo, the claim is correct because in row 0, under \"high points\", Paul Pierce's score of 32 is the highest across all games listed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the claim \"the celtic win 6 of their 7 game during this stretch\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the table structure. The columns are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. Each row represents a game played by the Celtics during that period.\n\nThe claim mentions 7 games in a stretch where they won 6. So I need to check each of these rows to see how many wins there are. Let's go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Game 76 (April 1 vs Charlotte):** The score is listed as \"w 111 - 109 (2ot)\". The 'w' indicates a win, so that's 1-0.\n\n2. **Game 77 (April 3 vs Atlanta):** Score is \"w 104 - 92 (ot)\", another win. Now 2-0.\n\n3. **Game 78 (April 8 vs New Jersey):** Score shows \"w 106 - 104 (ot)\". Third win in a row, so 3 wins.\n\n4. **Game 79 (April 10 vs Miami):** Again, it's a \"w\" with the score 105-98 (ot). That makes four wins.\n\n5. **Game 80 (April 12 vs Cleveland):** This one is an 'l' which stands for loss. So this is their first loss in the series. Now at 4 wins and 1 loss.\n\n6. **Game 81 (April 14 vs Philadelphia):** The score here is \"w 100 - 98 (ot)\", so that's a fifth win.\n\n7. **Game 82 (April 15 vs Washington):** Ends with another \"w\", this time 115-107 (ot). That brings the total to six wins and one loss in these seven games.\n\nLooking at each row, the 'score' column clearly shows whether they won or lost. Only game 80 was a loss; all others were wins. So out of 7 games, they indeed won 6.\n\nNow, compiling the relevant cells: Each row's 'score' column is essential because it indicates the outcome (win or loss). Therefore, I'll note each row index with the \"score\" column as relevant.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that the Celtics won 6 of their 7 games.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"paul pierce lead the team in points for 6 of the 7 games.\" So I need to check each game and see how many times Paul Pierce was the top scorer.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 8 rows because it goes from game 76 to 82. Wait, but the claim mentions 7 games. Hmm, maybe they're referring to a specific set of 7 games, but in the given data, all 8 rows seem to be part of a season, so perhaps I need to check each one.\n\nLet me go through each row one by one:\n\n1. **Row 0 (Game 76):** The high points are Paul Pierce with 32. So yes, he led in points here.\n2. **Row 1 (Game 77):** Again, Paul Pierce leads with 21 points.\n3. **Row 2 (Game 78):** Rajon Rondo has the highest with 31 points. So Paul doesn't lead here.\n4. **Row 3 (Game 79):** Paul Pierce scores 28, which is the highest in this game.\n5. **Row 4 (Game 80):** Paul scores 14, but I don't see another player's points mentioned; however, since it's a loss and he scored 14, maybe someone else scored more? The table only lists high points as Paul here, so perhaps he led.\n6. **Row 5 (Game 81):** Paul has 31 points, which is the highest in this game.\n7. **Row 6 (Game 82):** Glen Davis leads with 21 points, so Paul didn't lead here.\n\nWait a second, I think I made a mistake in row 4. The table shows \"paul pierce (14)\" as high points, but the team lost this game. So maybe someone else scored more? But according to the data provided, Paul is listed as having the highest points in that game. Hmm, perhaps he still led.\n\nSo let's recount:\n\n- Row 0: Yes\n- Row 1: Yes\n- Row 2: No\n- Row 3: Yes\n- Row 4: Maybe yes (since he's listed as high points)\n- Row 5: Yes\n- Row 6: No\n\nWait, that would be games 76,77,79,80,81 where Paul led. That's 5 games, not 6. Did I miss something?\n\nLooking back at row 4 (Game 80), the score is a loss with Paul scoring 14. The team scored 76 points, but perhaps another player scored higher? But according to the table, only Paul is listed as high points in that game. So maybe he did lead.\n\nSo games where Paul led: rows 0,1,3,4,5 \u2014 that's 5 times. Wait, no:\n\nWait row indexes are from 0 to 6 (since there are 7 rows). Let me recount:\n\nRow 0: Yes\nRow 1: Yes\nRow 2: No\nRow 3: Yes\nRow 4: Maybe yes\nRow 5: Yes\nRow 6: No\n\nSo if row 4 counts as a lead, then it's 5 games (rows 0,1,3,4,5). But that's only 5, not 6. So the claim is false because Paul led in 5 out of 7 games, not 6.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me list each row:\n\n- Game 76 (row 0): Paul leads (32)\n- Game 77 (row1): Paul leads (21)\n- Game78 (row2): Rajon leads\n- Game79 (row3): Paul leads (28)\n- Game80 (row4): Paul leads? The table says he has 14, but since it's a loss and the team scored only 76, maybe he didn't lead. Or perhaps he did because he's listed as high points.\n- Game81 (row5): Paul leads (31)\n- Game82 (row6): Glen Davis leads\n\nSo if row4 counts, that's 5 games where Paul led. If not, then 4.\n\nBut the claim says \"6 of the 7 games.\" So unless I'm missing a game where Paul led, which he didn't in rows 2 and 6, and possibly row4 depending on interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe in row4 (Game80), even though they lost, Paul's 14 could still be the highest if others scored less. The table only lists him as high points there, so perhaps it's correct that he led.\n\nSo rows where Paul led: 0,1,3,4,5 \u2014 that's 5 games, not 6. So the claim is false.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that Paul Pierce led in six out of seven games, but according to the data, he only led in five games (rows 0,1,3,4,5). Therefore, the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"claim\": \"Paul Pierce led his team in scoring in 6 out of 7 games.\",\n    \"result\": \"False\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"Paul Pierce led in scoring in 5 out of the 7 games listed.

The task is to determine whether the claim \"kendrick perkins have the most assist for the celtic (12) in 1 game\" is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the claim is saying. It states that Kendrick Perkins had the highest number of assists for the Celtics in a single game, with 12 assists. \n\nNext, I'll look at the table structure to identify where the relevant information might be. The columns present are: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record. \n\nThe key column here is \"high assists,\" as that's what the claim is about. So, I need to check each row under this column to see if Kendrick Perkins ever had 12 assists in a game.\n\nLooking through each row:\n\n- Game 76: Rajon Rondo (9)\n- Game 77: Rajon Rondo (6)\n- Game 78: Rajon Rondo and Stephon Marbury both with (5)\n- Game 79: Rajon Rondo (12) \u2013 Wait, that's 12 assists. But the claim is about Kendrick Perkins, not Rondo.\n- Game 80: Rajon Rondo (6)\n- Game 81: Tony Allen and Stephon Marbury both with (5)\n- Game 82: Stephon Marbury (8)\n\nFrom this, I see that Rajon Rondo had the highest assists in one game (Game 79) with 12. However, Kendrick Perkins isn't listed in any row under \"high assists\" except for a few where he's mentioned, but never reaching 12.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because it attributes 12 assists to Kendrick Perkins, but the table shows Rajon Rondo as having that number of assists instead.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify which rows in the table correspond to games played at TD Banknorth Garden. Looking at the 'location attendance' column, each entry ends with a number, which I assume is the attendance count, preceded by the location. So, for example, \"td banknorth garden 18624\" means the game was held there with an attendance of 18,624.\n\nI'll go through each row:\n\n- **Row 0 (Game 76):** Location is TD Banknorth Garden. The score shows a win: W 111 - 109 (2OT). So, they won this game.\n- **Row 1 (Game 77):** Also at TD Banknorth Garden. Score is W 104 - 92 (OT), another win.\n- **Row 2 (Game 78):** Again at TD Banknorth Garden. The score is W 106 - 104 (OT). They won here too.\n- **Row 3 (Game 79):** Still at TD Banknorth Garden, with a W 105 - 98 (OT) result. Another win.\n- **Row 4 (Game 80):** Location is Quicken Loans Arena this time, so not relevant for the claim about TD Banknorth Garden.\n- **Row 5 (Game 81):** At Wachovia Center, so again, not relevant.\n- **Row 6 (Game 82):** Back to TD Banknorth Garden. The score is W 115 - 107 (OT), another win.\n\nSo all games played at TD Banknorth Garden resulted in wins for the Celtics.

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"the highest point total for a celtic player in 1 game be 32 , by stephon marbury.\"\n\nFirst, let me break down the claim. It says that Stephon Marbury scored the highest points (32) in one game for the Celtics.\n\nLooking at the table, I'll check each row's \"high points\" column to find who had the highest score and if it was Stephon Marbury.\n\nRow 0: Paul Pierce with 32 points. So, someone else already has a higher point total than what the claim attributes to Stephon Marbury.\n\nNext, I should verify if Stephon Marbury ever reached 32 points in any game listed here. Checking each row's \"high points\":\n\n- Row 0: Paul Pierce (32)\n- Row 1: Paul Pierce (21)\n- Row 2: Rajon Rondo (31)\n- Row 3: Paul Pierce (28)\n- Row 4: Paul Pierce (14)\n- Row 5: Paul Pierce (31)\n- Row 6: Glen Davis (21)\n\nI don't see Stephon Marbury listed in any of the \"high points\" columns. The highest point total is indeed 32 by Paul Pierce, not Stephon Marbury.\n\nTherefore, the claim is incorrect because Stephon Marbury didn't score 32 points in a single game as per the table.\n</think>\n\nThe claim is FALSE because Paul Pierce scored 32 points, which was the highest, and Stephon Marbury did not achieve that total.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"high points\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"high points\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "the celtic lose 6 of their 7 game during this stretch",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the claim is true or false. The claim says, \"the celtics lose 6 of their 7 games during this stretch.\" I need to check each game in the table to see how many they lost and then determine if it's six out of seven.\n\nLooking at the table, there are 8 rows, which represent 8 games. Each row has a 'score' column that shows whether the Celtics won or lost. A 'W' means win and an 'L' means loss.\n\nLet me go through each game one by one:\n\n1. Game 76: April 1 vs Charlotte - Score is W 111-109 (2OT). So they won.\n2. Game 77: April 3 vs Atlanta - Score is W 104-92 (OT). Another win.\n3. Game 78: April 8 vs New Jersey - Score is W 106-104 (OT). They won again.\n4. Game 79: April 10 vs Miami - Score is W 105-98 (OT). Fourth win in a row.\n5. Game 80: April 12 vs Cleveland - Score is L 76-107 (OT). This is their first loss.\n6. Game 81: April 14 vs Philadelphia - Score is W 100-98 (OT). Back to winning.\n7. Game 82: April 15 vs Washington - Score is W 115-107 (OT). Another win.\n\nWait, so in these seven games (from game 76 to game 82), how many losses do they have? Let's count:\n\nLooking at each game from row index 0 to 6 (since the claim mentions a stretch of 7 games):\n\nRow 0: Win\nRow 1: Win\nRow 2: Win\nRow 3: Win\nRow 4: Loss\nRow 5: Win\nRow 6: Win\n\nSo that's only 1 loss out of seven, not six. The claim says they lost six, which is way off.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the rows. Let me double-check:\n\nThe table starts at game 76 and goes up to game 82. That's 7 games in total (game numbers 76-82 inclusive). Now checking each 'score' column for those seven games:\n\nGame 76: Win\nGame 77: Win\nGame 78: Win\nGame 79: Win\nGame 80: Loss\nGame 81: Win\nGame 82: Win\n\nSo in these seven games, only one loss. Therefore, the claim is false because they lost just one game, not six.\n</think>\n\nThe Celtics lost only one out of their seven games during this stretch.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
