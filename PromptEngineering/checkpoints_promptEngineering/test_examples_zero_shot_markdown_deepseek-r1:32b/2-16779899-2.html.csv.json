    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if the claim is true or false based on the table provided. The claim says: \"the result of the game on december 14, 1986 on week 15 be a loss of 34 - 3\". Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the row in the table that corresponds to December 14, 1986 and week 15. Looking at the 'week' column, I see weeks numbered from 1 to 16. Week 15 is near the end of the table. Scanning through, I spot row index 14 (since counting starts from 0) which has week 15.\n\nNow, checking the date in that row: it's December 14, 1986, which matches the claim. So far so good.\n\nNext, looking at the 'result' column for that row. The result is listed as \"l 34 - 3\". The 'l' stands for loss, which aligns with the claim stating it's a loss. The score is 34-3, exactly what the claim mentions. So both the outcome and the score match.\n\nAdditionally, I can check other columns to ensure consistency. The opponent in week 15 was Cleveland Browns, and the attendance was 58062. While these aren't part of the claim, they help confirm that the row is correctly identified without conflicting information.\n\nPutting it all together: the date, week number, result type (loss), and score all match the claim exactly. Therefore, the claim is true.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"week\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on the provided table. The claim states: \"week 15th's game on december 14 , 1986 be a win of 34 - 3\". \n\nFirst, I'll parse each part of the claim:\n\n1. **Week 15th**: Looking at the 'week' column in the table.\n2. **Date**: December 14, 1986, which should match under the 'date' column.\n3. **Opponent**: The opponent isn't specified in the claim, so I don't need to check that unless there's ambiguity.\n4. **Result**: It mentions a win of 34-3.\n\nI'll start by locating week 15 in the table. Scanning through the 'week' column, row index 14 (since indexing starts at 0) is week 15. The date for that week is December 14, 1986, which matches the claim's date.\n\nNext, I'll check the result. In the 'result' column of week 15, it says \"l 34 - 3\". Here, \"l\" stands for a loss. The claim states it was a win. This is conflicting because the team actually lost that game by a score of 34-3.\n\nAdditionally, I should ensure there's no other week with December 14 as the date. Looking through all rows, only week 15 has that date, so no ambiguity there.\n\nSince the claim says it was a win (w) but the table shows a loss (l), the information doesn't support the claim. Therefore, the answer should be FALSE.\n</think>\n\nThe claim states that in week 15 on December 14, 1986, there was a win with a score of 34-3. Checking the table, row 14 (week 15) shows a loss (l) with the same score. Thus, the claim is incorrect.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n   \"relevant_cells\": [\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n     {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n   ]\n}\n```",
