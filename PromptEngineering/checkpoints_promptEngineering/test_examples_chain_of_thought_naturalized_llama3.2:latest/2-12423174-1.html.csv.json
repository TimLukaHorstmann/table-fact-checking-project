However, no year is specified for this competition; usually it would be a direct clue about the correct year.\n- **Find asc diaraf's result**: Asc diaraf's score against stade malien was 3 - 4 in both matches.\n\n6. **Conclusion and final answer**:\n- Given that there is no match year mentioned for the African Cup of Champion Club, we can't conclude it refers to a specific year other than \"1971\" being part of the table but not explicitly related. Yet, asc diaraf played against stade malien with an aggregate loss.\n- Therefore, regardless of whether or not this competition is specifically 1971 based on the given information, asc diaraf lost the match.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identify relevant information\", \"text\": \"The claim mentions the African Cup of Champion Club for 1971.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Locate relevant row(s) and column(s)\", \"text\": \"Row 3 for asc diaraf's match against stade malien.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Find the match between asc diaraf and stade malien\", \"text\": \"Match found, but no specific year mentioned.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the relevant information for the claim\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if Young Africans scored 2 points in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Club. This requires examining the aggregate scores for each match.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Row 9 of the table\nIn Row 9, under team \"Young Africans\", the aggregation says \"agg: 2 - 0\". Since this is the overall score after both legs of the match and does not indicate a penalty shootout or other tiebreaker, it suggests that Young Africans scored 2 goals in the aggregate.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if the claim's condition is met\nGiven the information from Row 9, we can determine that Young Africans indeed had an aggregate score of 2 points. However, to directly match the claim's exact wording (\"score 2 point\"), we must assess if this matches any part of the African Cup of Champions Club structure mentioned in the claim.\n\n#### Step 4: Assess the relevance of tournament details\nThe claim mentions the \"1971 African Cup of Champion Club\". There seems to be a small typo or variation in terminology; the actual name of the competition should likely be \"African Cup of Champions Clubs\" (with plural 's'). The specific year mentioned, however, is 1971.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nSince the claim contains an apparent typographical error and we can't verify the accuracy of the tournament name against the table or any external source for a direct match, we focus on the aggregate score provided. However, it's critical to note that without precise information about the tournament specifics (like penalty shootout conditions), accurately assessing the claim becomes speculative.\n\nGiven this context and focusing strictly on what is provided in the table:\n- The claim as stated seems not fully verifiable due to an apparent error.\n- Yet, Young Africans' aggregate score of 2 points matches part of the claim's request for \"scored 2 point\".\n\nHowever, without confirmation of the tournament structure (specifically if it included penalties and thus a 'point' in the traditional sense), we must proceed with caution.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identified relevant info for claim\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Analyzed Row 9\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Determined if claim's condition is met\", \"additional_info\": \"Score of 2 points indicates Young Africans scored enough to win the match, but the exact 'point' in the African Cup context isn't clear without more information.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Assessed tournament details\", \"additional_info\": \"Claim contains a potential typo or variation in competition name\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"agg\"},\n    {\"row_index\": ?, \"column_name\": \"?\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nNote: Since the specific tournament details and rules are not provided or verified against external information, making a definitive judgment on whether Young Africans' aggregate score directly meets the claim's wording (\"score 2 point in the 1971 African Cup of Champion Club\") is challenging. The output reflects the current analysis based on available data from the table alone.",
