To verify this, we need to check the Ofsted numbers of each primary school in the table.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Primary Schools**: First, we need to identify which rows represent primary schools. According to the table, these are Rows 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10.\n   \n   - Row 1: chambersbury\n   - Row 2: hobbs hill wood\n   - Row 5: lime walk\n   - Row 6: nash mills\n   - Row 9: tudor\n   - Row 10: two waters\n\n2. **Check Ofsted Numbers for Primary Schools**: Next, we need to check the Ofsted numbers of these primary schools and compare them with 117107.\n\n   ```\n   For each row identified in Step 1:\n     If the 'ofsted number' column value is less than or equal to 117107:\n       - The claim could be FALSE\n     Else if the 'ofsted number' column value is greater than 117107 and the school type is primary:\n       - Continue with no issue for this school\n   ```\n   \n3. **Evaluate Each Row**: We will now manually evaluate each of these rows.\n\n   - chambersbury: ofsted number = 117214 (primary)\n   - hobbs hill wood: ofsted number = 117368 (primary)\n   - lime walk: ofsted number = 117333 (primary)\n   - nash mills: ofsted number = 117418 (primary)\n   - tudor: ofsted number = 117109 (primary)\n   - two waters: ofsted number = 117108 (primary)\n\n4. **Conclusion**: From the above steps, we can see that none of the primary schools have an Ofsted number less than or equal to 117107.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified primary schools in the table and checked their Ofsted numbers against 117107.

Additionally, we should verify that no more than one such school exists among the 11 total schools.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify schools not categorized as primary\nLooking at the table, we can identify rows where the 'type' is not primary:\n- Row 8: faith - (Roman Catholic), type = special\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, row 8 actually says type=\"primary\" with a value of \"rc\". This is incorrect. Let's continue with step 4.\n\n#### Step 4: Confirm that no more than one school can be the exception\nSince we have identified at least one school listed as primary and special does not match the claim - in row 8 type actually is = 'primary', there must be some confusion here. \n\nHowever, examining the rest of the table again for any potential exceptions among the schools' types doesn't seem to yield another school outside those categorized under \"primary\". In fact, a search of all the values indicates that no other schools are not classified as primary but rather fall into either other faith categories (like row 4: Leverstock Green - which is categorized under 'ce') or special. Thus, we cannot confirm an alternative.\n\n#### Step 5: Draw a conclusion\nGiven the above analysis, since there's actually only one school that appears to be listed as being \"special\" among primary type schools but upon closer inspection, reveals itself to be categorized under primary (a different sub-type), this statement seems misleading. However, it technically states there should only be ONE exception where that exception isn't there.\n\n#### Final Analysis\nGiven all the above considerations and after an exhaustive search of the provided table for any potential exceptions based on the claim provided - it appears we must draw a conclusion based purely on the literal interpretation given to us in our steps thus far. \n\nWe will, therefore, conclude the final answer accordingly.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim was tested by first looking at all schools not classified as primary type but actually categorized under special; however no such school exists.
