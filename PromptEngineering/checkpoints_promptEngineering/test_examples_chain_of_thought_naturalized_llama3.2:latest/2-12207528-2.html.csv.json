First, identify the relevant row based on the opponents involved:\n   - Since the claim involves a matchup between \"Toronto Blue Jay\" (presumably referring to the MLB team) and Athletics, we look for rows where these teams are mentioned.\n2. Check if any of the games listed match the date April 28 with these specific teams playing each other.\n\n### Final Reasoning Steps:\n\n1. Since Row 6 mentions an Athletics loss with \"Lamp\" as a player (who may or may not be from Toronto) but does show a score that matches the opponent of the claim, we can assume this is the relevant game.\n2. Check if the team mentioned in the given claim (Toronto Blue Jay) and the teams listed in Row 6 match.\n3.
