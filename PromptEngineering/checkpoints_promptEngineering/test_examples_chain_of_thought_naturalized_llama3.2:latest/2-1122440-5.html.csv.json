Identify the column to check for the claim: The claim mentions \"format be lp a total of 4 time\", so we need to look at the 'Format' column in the table.\n\n2. Count the occurrences of \"lp\" in the Format column:\n    - Row 1: format = lp\n    - Row 2: format = lp\n    - Row 3: format = lp\n    - Row 4: format = lp\n    - Row 8: format = lp\n    - Total count so far: 6\n\n3. Check if the total count equals to 4:\n    Since 6 is not equal to 4, we need to check further.\n\n4. Count the occurrences of \"lp\" again and also check for other formats like \"cassette\", \"cd\", etc.\n    - Row 1: format = lp\n    - Row 2: format = lp\n    - Row 3: format = lp\n    - Row 8: format = lp\n    - Total count so far: 6\n    - Rows 7 and 9 are in \"cassette\", which is not considered as part of the claim.\n    - Rows 10,11,12 are also not part of the claim.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n    Since total count of \"lp\" format is more than 4 in the given table, we can conclude that the statement 'the format be lp a total of 4 time' is FALSE.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"format\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
