Compare the number of goals scored by Steve Sumner and Shane Smeltz: Since 22 (Steve Sumner's goals) is less than 23 (Shane Smeltz's goals), we can conclude that Steve Sumner scored fewer goals than Shane Smeltz for the New Zealand national football team.\n4. Determine if the difference of 1 goal qualifies as \"only 1 less\" according to the claim: Since Steve Sumner scored 22 goals and Shane Smeltz scored 23 goals, the difference is 1 goal, which is exactly 1 less than what the claim states.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the highest scoring athlete for New Zealand currently.\n2. To do so, we should calculate Shane Smeltz's total goals scored throughout his time with the team (2003-2013), including both caps in New Caledonia and other countries.\n3. Next, we'll find the name of the current highest scoring athlete in the table by comparing the total goals for each row.\n4. We should verify that Shane Smeltz indeed scores 5 more goal than the top-scoring player for the team.\n\n#### Calculation:\n\nLet's calculate Shane Smeltz' total number of goals scored throughout his time with New Zealand. His first cap was in 2003 and his most recent cap was in 2013. We'll add all caps to his current score of 23 (in New Caledonia) and the rest in United States.\n\nShane Smeltz total goals = 23 + (49 - 21)\n                        = 23 + 28\n                        = 51\n\n#### Step-by-Step Comparison:\n\nNow, we should compare Shane Smeltz' goals with other players for their highest scores:\n\n1. Brian Turner is the top scorer in the table with a score of 21 and 59 caps.\n\n2. Darren McClennan has an equal number of goal with 12 but fewer caps than Brian Turner (43 vs 59). Also, he had the same start year as Michael McGarry who also have 12 goals but more caps (54).\n\n3. Michael Mcgarry has a higher score than Darren McClennan, so now Shane Smeltz has to score at least 51 + 5 = 56 goals in order to surpass Brian Turner and be the highest scoring athlete for New Zealand.\n\n#### Verifying Conditions:\n\nNow we can verify if Shane Smeltz has scored 5 more goals than Brian Turner. We have that:\n51 + 5 = 56 \nand\n21\n\nTherefore, if Shane Smeltz scores 5 more goal throughout his time with the new zealand national football team , he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To verify the claim, we need to find out if Chris Wood has the most goals and caps from New Zealand's national football team.\n\n2. We start by looking at Row 17: name: chris wood, career: 2009 -, goals: 10, caps: 31, first cap: 3 june 2009, most recent cap: 5 september 2013. Chris Wood is from New Zealand.\n\n3. Next, we need to verify if he has the most caps among all players with a goal count of 10 or more. We also need to check if there's anyone else in the table with 10 goals and a higher number of caps than Chris Wood.\n\n4. Looking at Row 17 again, we see that Chris Wood has 31 caps from New Zealand.\n\n5. To verify if he is the record holder for most caps, we need to look at other players with a goal count of 10 or more, and check their caps count. Specifically, we need to examine rows where \"column_name\" is 'caps' and compare that value with Chris Wood's 31 caps. Also, we will check if there are other New Zealand players in the table with more than 10 goals.\n\n6. Looking at Rows 15, 16, and 17, we see other players from New Zealand with a goal count of 10 or more (Dave Taylor (47), Colin Walker (15), Chris Wood (31)) but only Chris Wood has the highest caps amount from new zealand with 31 caps.\n\n7. Now that we've verified that Chris Wood indeed holds the record for most caps among all players in New Zealand, we need to verify if he also holds the record for most goals. We look at rows where \"column_name\" is 'goals' and compare the value of Chris Wood (10) with other values.\n\n8. Looking at Rows 4, 14, 15, and others, there are players like Brian Turner (21), Keith Nelson (16), Steve Sumner (22), Jock Newall (17), Chris Jackson (10), Dave Taylor (10), Michael McGarry (12), Darren McClennan (12) who have more goals than Chris Wood.\n\n9. Therefore, it can be concluded that the claim \"Chris wood be the record holder for the most goal and the most cap from the new zealand national football team , dave taylor be second\" is FALSE.\n\n10.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the Claim\nThe claim states that if Chris Wood scores 5 more goals throughout his time with the New Zealand national football team, he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Current Highest Scorer\nTo evaluate this claim, we need to determine who is currently the highest scorer for the New Zealand national football team. We will do this by comparing the number of goals scored by each player listed in the table.\n\n### Step 3: Extract Relevant Information from Table\nExtracting relevant information from the table:\n\n- Row 1: vaughan coveny (28 goals)\n- Row 2: shane smeltz (23 goals)\n- Row 3: steve sumner (22 goals)\n- Row 4: brian turner (21 goals)\n- Row 5: jock newall (17 goals)\n- Row 6: keith nelson (16 goals)\n- Row 7: chris killen (16 goals)\n- Row 8: grant turner (15 goals)\n- Row 9: darren mcclennan (12 goals)\n- Row 10: michael mcgarry (12 goals)\n- Row 11: wynton rufer (12 goals)\n- Row 12: steve wooddin (11 goals)\n- Row 13: roy coxon (10 goals)\n- Row 14: chris jackson (10 goals)\n- Row 15: dave taylor (10 goals)\n- Row 16: colin walker (10 goals)\n- Row 17: chris wood (10 goals)\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Chris Wood's Position\nFrom the table, we can see that Chris Wood has 10 goals, which is tied with several other players.\n\n### Step 5: Determine If Scoring 5 More Goals Would Make Him Top\nSince there are already multiple players with 10 goals each, scoring 5 more goals would not necessarily make Chris Wood the highest scorer. He needs to surpass at least one of these tied players' goal counts.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the information provided in the table, if Chris Wood scores 5 more goals throughout his time with the New Zealand national football team, it does not guarantee that he will be the highest scoring athlete for the team.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Understand the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine current highest scorer\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Extract relevant information from table\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 7,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 8,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 9,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 10,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 11,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 12,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 13,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 14,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 15,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 16,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 17,\n          \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Evaluate Chris Wood's position\",\n      \"result\": \"Tied with several other players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if scoring 5 more goals would make him top\",\n      \"result\": \"Not guaranteed to be highest scorer\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "claim": "vaughn coveney have a cap during his second year and during his third year of the team , overall he have 19 cap throughout his year with the team",
    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim about Vaughan Coveny.\n   - The claim states that Vaughan Coveny has a cap during his second year and third year of the team, and overall he has 19 caps throughout his time with the team.\n\n2. To verify this claim, we should compare each year's caps for Vaughan Coveny to determine if he indeed had caps in both his second and third years.\n   - We know that his first cap was in 1992, which suggests his first year (1991-1992) should have caps.\n\n3. Let's check the relevant cells:\n   ```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n]\n```\n   - For Vaughan Coveny's first and most recent caps: His first cap was June 7th, 1992, and his most recent cap was June 4th, 2006. This indicates he had caps in both the second year (1991-1992) and third year (1992-2003).\n\n4. Now that we have confirmed Vaughan Coveny has a cap in both his second and third years, let's check the total number of caps for clarity:\n   ```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n]\n```\n   - Vaughan Coveny had a total of 64 caps throughout his career.\n\n5. Since we've verified that Vaughan Coveny indeed has a cap in both his second and third years and that the overall number of caps adds up to more than 19 (specifically, 64), the claim can be evaluated as accurate or not based on the comparison between claimed total caps (19) and actual total caps (64).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Compare each year's caps for Vaughan Coveny to determine if he indeed had caps in both his second and third years.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"cells_to_check\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"first cap\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n      ],\n      \"reasoning\": \"Verify that Vaughan Coveny's first and most recent caps indicate he had caps in both his second and third years.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"cells_to_check\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"caps\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"career\"}\n      ],\n      \"reasoning\": \"Check the total number of caps for clarity.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"first cap\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"most recent cap\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
