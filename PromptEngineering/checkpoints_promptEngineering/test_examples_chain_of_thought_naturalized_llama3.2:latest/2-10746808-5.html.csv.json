For South Melbourne, the home team score was 10.15 (75) and the away team score was 11.7 (73). The margin of victory can be calculated as the difference between the two scores: 10.15 - 11.7 = -1.55\n3. Similarly, for Hawthorn, the home team score was 9.13 (67) and the away team score was 14.16 (100). The margin of victory is 14.16 - 9.13 = 5.03.\n4. For Geelong, the home team score was 9.14 (68) and the away team score was 10.15 (75). The margin of victory is 10.15 - 9.14 = 0.99.\n5. Now that we have calculated the margins of victory for all teams, we need to find the smallest one.\n6. Comparing the margins of victory, we can see that South Melbourne had a smaller margin of victory (-1.55) compared to Hawthorn (5.03), Geelong (0.99), and the other teams in the table have larger margins of victory as well.\n7.

Next, we need to calculate the difference between the two teams' scores to see if they indeed differ by a total of 7 points.\n   - The difference in their scores is: 58-48 = 10.\n\n3. We then compare our calculated difference with the given claim that fitzroy beat carlton by a total of 7 points.\n   - Since the calculated difference (10) is not equal to the claimed difference (7), we have found a discrepancy in the information provided by the table and the statement being questioned.\n\n4. We continue with verifying if there are any other possible interpretations or discrepancies that could affect our determination:\n   - Upon reviewing all relevant rows of the table again, we see no additional issues affecting this specific question about fitzroy's margin against carlton.\n\n5. As a final check to ensure that we did not miss anything critical in our analysis, we double-check the given information and verify it is still accurate.\n   - The claim provided indeed states \"fitzroy beat carlton by a total of 7 point\", but based on the results from step 2, this appears incorrect.\n\n6. We then formulate our final answer based on the findings:\n   - Our analysis has led to determining that the statement in question is false because it inaccurately claims fitzroy won by exactly 7 points when their margin was actually 10 points.\n\n#### Final Answer JSON Object:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"difference in scores\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"difference in scores\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
