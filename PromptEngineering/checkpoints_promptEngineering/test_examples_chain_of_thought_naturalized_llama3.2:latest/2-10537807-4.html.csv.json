    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. The claim states there are three songs released in 2000 and only one song released in 1999.\n2. We need to verify the number of songs released each year by checking the release dates.\n3. First, let's count the songs released in 2000: \n   - Row 2 has a release date of 20 March 2000 for \"the cedar room\".\n   - Row 3 has a release date of 29 May 2000 for \"catch the sun\".\n   - Row 4 has a release date of 30 October 2000 for \"the man who told everything\".\n   - Row 5 has a release date of 15 April 2002, which is not in the year 2000. This row can be ignored for this step.\n   - Row 6 has a release date of 22 July 2002, which is also not in the year 2000. This row can be ignored for this step.\n   - Row 7 has a release date of 14 October 2002, which is also not in the year 2000. This row can be ignored for this step.\n4. Next, let's count the songs released in 1999: \n   - Row 1 has a release date of 2 August 1999 for \"here it comes\".\n5. Now that we have counted both sets of songs, let's determine if there are indeed three songs released in 2000 and only one song released in 1999:\n6. Based on the previous steps, there are at least two songs (from Row 2 and Row 4) released in 2000. Since this condition does not meet the claim, we need to verify if all conditions of the claim can be met.\n7. As it turns out, the claim \"there be 3 song that be release in 2000 , while only 1 song be release in 1999\" is FALSE because there are at least two songs released in 2000.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Therefore, the claim \"the number of songs released by Doves increases every year\" is FALSE.\n\n#### Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"release_date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"song\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

There is no overlap between rows 1 through 10.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if there are any songs that fall under the category \"released by Doves\".\nIn row 11, we see the song 'kingdom of rust' and in row 12, we see 'winter hill', both of which are indeed released by Doves.\n\n#### Step 5: Count all unique titles from Rows 1 through 10 to determine how many songs were released before 2009.\nThere are 13 unique titles for the year before (2009): caught by the river, andalucia \n\n#### Step 6: Determine if there is enough data in Row 11 and row 12 about Doves' release in 2009 to answer the question.\nYes.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that all songs except one are released on the album 'Some Cities'. To verify this, we need to check if each song in the table has a release date associated with the album 'Some Cities'.\n\n2. We start by checking row 8 of the table: song: black and white town, release date: 7 february 2005, release info: heavenly (hvn145), formats: cd1 , cd2 , 7 vinyl, album: some cities.\n\n3. Row 8 meets the criteria as it has a release date associated with the album 'Some Cities'.\n\n4. Next, we check row 9 of the table: song: snowden, release date: 9 may 2005, release info: heavenly (hvn150), formats: cd1 , cd2 , 7 vinyl, album: some cities.\n\n5. Row 9 also meets the criteria as it has a release date associated with the album 'Some Cities'.\n\n6. Now, we check row 10 of the table: song: sky starts falling, release date: 12 september 2005, release info: heavenly (hvn152), formats: cd , dvd , 7 vinyl, album: some cities.\n\n7. Row 10 meets the criteria as it has a release date associated with the album 'Some Cities'.\n\n8. We now check row 8 to verify if all songs are released on the album 'some cities' by looking at other rows that contain the song 'some cities' but had different release dates than those listed in row 8.\n- Row 8: black and white town, release date: 7 february 2005\n- Row 9: snowden, release date: 9 may 2005\n- Row 10: sky starts falling, release date: 12 september 2005\n\nThese three songs were the only ones that had different release dates than those in row 8. Next we check for any other releases from \"some cities\" and if there are others that have a later or earlier release date.\n\n9. Row 11 of the table: song: kingdom of rust, release date: 30 march 2009, release info: heavenly (hvn189), formats: cd , 7 vinyl , 3 x 12 vinyl, album: kingdom of rust.\n- Release date is different from row 8\nRow 12: song: winter hill, release date: 20 july 2009, release info: heavenly (hvn192), formats: 7 vinyl , 3 x 12 vinyl, album: kingdom of rust. \n-Release date is different from row 8\n\nWe can continue checking the remaining rows to see if any other songs have a later or earlier release date than those listed in row 8 but since none were found we can proceed.\n\n10. Based on the information gathered so far, it appears that only one song has a release date different from those listed in row 8 of the table (the row for 'some cities'). Since the claim is that all songs except one are released on the album 'Some Cities', and we have confirmed at least three such releases with differing dates, it can be concluded that the claim is not true.\n\n11. Therefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"album\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"release date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
