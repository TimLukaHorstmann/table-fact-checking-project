    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify which countries have earned just 1 medal. We will start by looking at the row with total medals = 84.\n2. We can see that there are multiple rows where gold + silver + bronze = 1 (rows 18, 19, 20, 21). This means that these countries also earned a total of 1 medal, but it is not bronze. Therefore, we don't need to check those rows for bronze medals.\n3. Now we will look at the other rows where gold + silver + bronze = 4 (rows 23-30). These are potential candidates for bronze medals.\n4. We can see that some of these countries have a bronze medal in row 24, but this is because they have only 1 total medal. This is not what we want.\n5. Now we will look at rows where gold + silver = x and bronze = 1 (rows 3-16). We need to check if any country has earned exactly one bronze medal.\n\n6. Now we will list out all the relevant cells for bronze medals:\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 10,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 14,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 17,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 18,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 19,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 20,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 21,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 22,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 23,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 24,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 25,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 26,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 27,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 28,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 29,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 30,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  }\n}\n\n7. Now we can see that there are indeed 10 countries with bronze medals, but the claim says that all of these bronze medals must be earned by just one country (the medal is not shared).\n\n8. Finally, let's check if the countries earning bronze medals have only 1 medal in total:\n   {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 10,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 14,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 17,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 18,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 19,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 20,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 21,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 22,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 23,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 24,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 25,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 26,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 27,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 28,\n    \"column_name\": \"gold\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 29,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 30,\n    \"column_name\": \"silver\"\n  }\n}\n\n9. Now we can see that some of the countries have more than one medal (for example, row 7 has both bronze and gold medals). Therefore, not all of these bronze medals must be earned by just one country.\n\n10. Finally, let's count how many bronze medals are earned by just one country:\n   {\n    \"row_index\": 23,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 25,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 27,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 29,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  }\n}\n\n11. Now we can see that there are indeed 4 countries with bronze medals, but the claim says that all of these bronze medals must be earned by just one country (the medal is not shared).\n\n12. Finally, let's check how many total bronze medals are earned by more than one country:\n   {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 5,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 9,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 10,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 13,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 14,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 15,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 17,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 18,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 19,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 20,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 21,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 22,\n    \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n  }\n}\n\n13. Now we can see that there are indeed more than one bronze medals, but the claim says that all of these bronze medals must be earned by just one country (the medal is not shared).\n\nTherefore, the statement in the problem is false.\n\nHere's a simple Python function to generate this chart:\n\n```python\ndef check_statement():\n    countries_with_one_medal = []\n    total_countries_with_more_than_one_medal = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, 31):\n        if not (i % 2 == 1 and i // 2 + 1 <= 30) or \\\n           ((i % 2 == 1 and i // 2 + 1 > 30) and\n            (i % 3 == 0 and i // 3 <= 29)):\n            continue\n\n        if not (i % 3 == 0 and i // 3 <= 29):\n            countries_with_one_medal.append(i)\n        else:\n            total_countries_with_more_than_one_medal += 1\n    return len(countries_with_one_medal) < 10\n\nprint(check_statement())\n```",
