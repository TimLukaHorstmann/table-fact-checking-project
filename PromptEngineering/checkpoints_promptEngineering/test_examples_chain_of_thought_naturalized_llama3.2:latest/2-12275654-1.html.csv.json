    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the relevant table rows for women's singles\nTo verify the claim, we need to find the rows where Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan both played in the women's singles category.\n\n### Step 2: List Katrin Schmidt's playing years\nLooking at the table, Katrin Schmidt played in the following years:\n- Row 1: 1988 (women 's singles)\n- Row 5: 2000 (women 's singles)\n- Row 9: 2004 (women ' s singles)\n- Row 12: no women's singles, so exclude\n- Row 13: no women's singles, so exclude\n- Row 14: no women's singles, so exclude\n- Row 15: 2010 (no women's singles for Katrin), so exclude\n- Row 16: 2011 (women ' s singles)\n- Row 18: 2013 (no women's singles for Katrin), so exclude\n\n### Step 3: List Pi Hongyan's playing years\nLooking at the table, Pi Hongyan played in the following years:\n- Row 1: 1988 (no men 's singles), so exclude\n- Row 6: 2001 (women ' s singles)\n- Row 10: 2005 (women ' s singles)\n- Row 12: 2007 (no women's doubles for Pi Hongyan, but in the \"mixed\" category no - pi hongyan is there for mixed), so exclude\n- Row 13: 2008 (women ' s singles)\n- Row 15: no women\u2019s' singles for this year, so exclude\n- Row 16: 2011 (no women's doubles for Pi Hongyan), but in the \"mixed\" category - pi hongyan is there for mixed), so exclude\n- Row 17: 2012 (women ' s singles)\n- Row 18: 2013 (women 's singles)\n\n### Step 4: Check if Katrin Schmidt and Pi Hongyan both played in four women's singles tournaments \nLooking at the relevant rows, we see that:\n- In 1988 Katrin was playing but there is no entry for pi hongyan - so exclude\n- In 2001 Katrin was playing but there is no entry for pi hongyan - so exclude\n- In 2004 Katrin was playing but there is no entry for pi hongyan - so exclude\n- In 2007 Pi Hongyan was not in the women's category, but she played mixed doubles and also women's. But we are only looking at women's singles here - so exclude\n- In 2008 Katrin played but again, there is no Pi hongyan - so exclude\n- In 2011 again we have to look at mixed for pi hongyan as well - so exclude\n- In 2012 Katrin was not playing and in 2013 Katrin was playing.\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing data with steps 4 and 3 done:\nWe see that both katrin schmidt and pi hongyan played the following years:\n- Row 1 (1988): Katrin\n- Row 5 (2000): Katrin & Pi Hongyan\n- Row 6 (2001): Pi Hongyan\n- Row 9 (2004): Katrin\n- Row 13 (2008): Katrin & Pi Hongyan\n\n### Step 6: Checking for another Katrin and pi-hongyan together \nLet's see the year 2012. In that year only katrin was playing women's singles - hence exclude.\n\nAnd finally row 18 gives us:\n- Row 16 (2011) : Katrin is not there, so we have to exclude this row as well.\nHowever in the mixed doubles category we do see pi hongyan and one other for 2011, thus excluding this row as well. But since it was in the 'mixed' category, we also can't use it here for our check.\n\n### Step 7: Final Analysis \nNow that we have analyzed all steps let's come to final conclusion:\nBoth katrin schmidt and pi hongyan played the years - 2000 & 2004 (two times) in women's singles. Hence, the answer is that this statement is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\":1,\n      \"column_name\":\"1988\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\":5,\n      \"column_name\":\"2000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\":9,\n      \"column_name\":\"2004\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\":13,\n      \"column_name\":\"2008\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"1988\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"2000\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"2004\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"2008\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
