    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim\nThe claim states that \"nobody have only 1 appearance on this team, though 2 have 2 appearance\". This means we need to check if there are any players with exactly one appearance, as well as players who have exactly two appearances.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate relevant cells in the table\nWe need to find the rows that correspond to a player having only 1 appearance and the rows where a player has exactly 2 appearances. In JSON format, these cells can be represented as:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 1,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Check if a player has exactly 2 appearances\nThe claim mentions that two players have exactly 2 appearances. We need to check the rows for these players:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 14,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 12,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Verify if any player has only 1 appearance\nWe need to check the rows for players with only 1 appearance:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 10,\n    \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the claim is true or false\nAfter checking the relevant cells, we can determine if the claim is true or false. If any player has only 1 appearance and there are indeed two players with exactly 2 appearances, then the claim is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the claim\",\n    \"Step 2: Locate relevant cells in the table\",\n    \"Step 3: Check if a player has exactly 2 appearances\",\n    \"Step 4: Verify if any player has only 1 appearance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"appearances\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
