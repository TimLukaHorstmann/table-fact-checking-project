We can start by looking at the \"method\" column for unanimous decisions:\n\n- Row 3 indicates a unanimous decision against Jonatas Novaes.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if there's only one game that was decided unanimously\nWe also need to check if there is another unanimous decision, as the claim states it's one of two such games. Examining the table again, we see:\n\n- Row 4 also had a unanimous submission win against Mark Sinclair.\n\n#### Step 4: Assess the validity of the claim\nGiven that both Row 3 and Row 4 show unanimous decisions, and considering the claim specifies \"one of two\" such games, it suggests that there are actually multiple games with unanimous outcomes.
