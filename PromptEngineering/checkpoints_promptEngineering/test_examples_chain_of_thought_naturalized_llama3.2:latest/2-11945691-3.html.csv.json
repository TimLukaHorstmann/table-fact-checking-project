Go through each row to find any team playing against Colorado more than once.\n\n4. **Count occurrences for Calgary and Chicago**:\n   - In the table, count how many times Calgary and Chicago play more than one time against Colorado.\n   - Check if they are the only teams with this occurrence.\n\n5. **Verify Colorado's record for each game played in November 1995**:\n   - Look at Colorado's win-loss record to ensure that there isn't a pattern or any instances where Colorado would be playing more than once in a single month and still maintaining a consistent record, indicating other matches might have been omitted from the records.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on steps 1-5, conclude if the claim is true or false.\n\n7. **List relevant cells**:\n   -

We also need to check if any other team had a higher score on the same date within a 5-day period.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Date-Specific Scores for Colorado\nWe'll analyze each row in the table to find out when Colorado scored their highest:\n\n- Row 1 (November 1): Score = 6\n- Row 2 (November 3): Score = 7\n- Row 3 (November 5): Score = 10\n- Row 4 (November 9): Score = 1\n- Row 5 (November 11): Score = 8\n- Row 6 (November 15): Score = 3\n- Row 7 (November 17): Score = 5\n- Row 8 (November 18): Score = 2\n- Row 9 (November 20): Score = 3\n- Row 10 (November 22): Score = 2\n- Row 11 (November 25): Score = 2\n- Row 12 (November 28): Score = 7\n- Row 13 (November 29): Score = 3\n\n### Step 4: Checking for Higher Scores Within a 5-Day Period\nWe'll now check if any other team had a higher score on the same date within a 5-day period.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying Dates and Scores\nLooking at each game, we need to ensure no other team scored more than Colorado's highest scores within a 5-day window:\n\n- Row 1 (November 1): No other team has a higher score.\n- Row 2 (November 3): Colorado's score of 7 is not the highest in that day; Winnipeg's score of 4 is lower, but Colorado's home record shows it's not the highest at this point.\n- Row 3 (November 5): Colorado's score of 10 is indeed higher than any other team's score on that date.\n- Row 4 (November 9): No other team has a higher score within 5 days.\n- Row 5 (November 11): Colorado's score of 8 is not the highest in that day; Vancouver's score of 7 could be higher if only considering game dates, but it\u2019s worth noting this wasn\u2019t in a 5 day span since the previous and next games were not on consecutive dates.\n- Row 6 (November 15): No other team has a higher score within 5 days.\n- Row 7 (November 17): Colorado's score of 5 is lower than Winnipeg's; also, no other team scores more within a 5-day period after November 17th.\n- Row 8 (November 18) and onwards: We need to verify if any game within the last five days exceeded Colorado\u2019s two highest values.\n\n\n### Step 6: Final Evaluation\nColorado had their highest scores on different dates, including row 3. However, we must check for a second instance where this happened within a 5-day span:\n\n- Row 7 shows Winnipeg scored higher than Colorado's score but was before the five day window; however Colorado scored 7 again in row 12 which is after November 29th so it fits the criteria.\n\n\n### Step 7: Output\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that Colorado finished with the highest score 2 times within a 5-day period during the 1995-96 season.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze each row in the table to identify when Colorado scored their highest\",\n      \"condition\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if any other team had a higher score on the same date within a 5-day period\",\n      \"condition\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify dates and scores\",\n      \"condition\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

For rows where Colorado is the visitor, check only the score provided to avoid counting away games.\n   - For the date November 9, since Colorado was the home team, the record of \"10 - 3 - 2\" indicates a win and two losses. However, the record does not indicate if there was any tie on this specific game day.\n   - For the dates November 11 and November 28, since Colorado was the home team in both cases, they contribute to both the win count of \"11\" and \"15\", respectively, but only one record shows a loss on that date. The other record does not show any losses, hence it counts as another win for Colorado.\n4. **Count Total Wins and Ties**:\n   - The claim states there should be 9 wins and 1 tie.\n5. **Conclusion**: Compare the calculated total of wins to 9 and ties to 1 with the information from step 3.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Claim Understanding\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify Relevant Records\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count Wins and Ties for Each Date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Calculate Total Wins and Ties\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare Calculated Totals with Claim Statement\",\n      \"message\": \" Colorado wins total is 10, not 9.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim is about Colorado Avalanche's home loss record on November 28.\n2. **Extract relevant information from the table**:\n\t* On Row 12, date: November 28, visitor: NY Islanders, score: 7 - 3, home: NY Islanders, record: 15 - 4 - 4.\n\t* We need to check if this is indeed a home loss for Colorado Avalanche. \n3. **Check the home team's record**: On Row 13, date: November 29, visitor: Colorado, score: 3 - 4, home: New Jersey, record: 15 - 5 - 4.\n\t* Since the away team is Colorado, we need to check if Colorado has a worse record than this at home on November 28.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Check Colorado's home record before November 28**: We need to find out their record before November 28. \n2. **Find the row with the previous game date**: On Row 12, date: November 28 is a win for NY Islanders. The previous row on November 25 must be for a win or loss that affects Colorado's home loss record.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Check Colorado's record before November 28**:\n\t* On Row 11, date: November 25, visitor: Colorado, score: 2 - 2, home: Montreal, record: 14 - 4 - 4.\n\t* We can see that they won on this day.\n\n2. **Find the row with the previous game date**: \n    * On Row 10, date: November 22, visitor: Colorado, score: 2 - 6, home: Colorado, record: 14 - 4 - 3.\n    * On Row 9, date: November 20, visitor: Colorado, score: 3 - 3, home: Edmonton, record: 13 - 4 - 3.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Check the previous day's game**: \n\t* On Row 8, date: November 18, visitor: Calgary, score: 2 - 5, home: Colorado, record: 13 - 4 - 2.\n    * This is a loss for Colorado Avalanche.\n\n2. **Find the row with the previous game date**:\n    * Since we are looking at Row 8 and it's from November 18th which is before November 28th, there must be another day between these two dates.\n\n3. **Check if this affects the home loss record**: We can see that they won on November 20th (Row 9), but lost on November 22nd (Row 10). This does not change their home loss record since we are looking for a game with a worse score than the one in Row 13.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n1. **Check if there is another day between these two dates**: On Row 8, date: November 18, visitor: Calgary, score: 2 - 5, home: Colorado, record: 13 - 4 - 2 and on row 12, date: November 28, visitor: NY Islanders, score: 7 - 3, home: NY Islanders, record: 15 - 4 - 4.\n\n2. **Find the number of days between November 18th and November 28th**:\n    * There are 10 days between these two dates (counting both ends).\n\n#### Step-By-Step Reasoning Finalized:\n\n1. **Consider if there is a possibility that Colorado Avalanche lost on November 25th**: \n    * On Row 11, date: November 25, visitor: Colorado, score: 2 - 2, home: Montreal, record: 14 - 4 - 4.\n\n2. **Find the row with the previous game date**:\n    * Since we are looking at Row 11 and it's from November 25th which is between November 18th (Row 8) and November 28th (Row 12), there must be another day between these two dates.\n\n3. **Check if this affects the home loss record**: We can see that they won on November 20th (Row 9). Since we are looking for a game with a worse score than the one in Row 13, this does not change their home loss record since Colorado Avalanche's home loss count remains at 2.\n\n\n4. **Check if there is another day between these two dates**: On Row 8, date: November 18, visitor: Calgary, score: 2 - 5, home: Colorado, record: 13 - 4 - 2 and on row 12, date: November 28, visitor: NY Islanders, score: 7 - 3, home: NY Islanders, record: 15 - 4 - 4.\n\n   * There are indeed another day between these two dates.\n\n\n5. **Consider if Colorado Avalanche lost on the next game**: \n    * On Row 9, date: November 20, visitor: Colorado, score: 3 - 3, home: Edmonton, record: 13 - 4 - 3.\n    * Since this is a tie (3-3), we still have not found any information that would indicate that Colorado Avalanche lost on November 28th.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Finalized:\n\n1. **Check if there is another day between these two dates**: On Row 8, date: November 18, visitor: Calgary, score: 2 -

Row 1: 6 wins\n   - Row 2: 7 wins\n   - Row 3: 8 wins\n   - Row 4: 9 wins\n   - Row 5: 10 wins\n   - Row 6: 11 wins\n\nSince the Colorado team started with a score of 0-0, this means that they played 1 game before any losses.\n\nGiven the progression of the rows above, it can be determined that:\n- The row representing the first loss (game number 2) is **Row 3**. This is because Row 3 indicates 8 wins, which would account for the addition of a single win to the team's record from their initial 0-0 score.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of games for the Colorado team in the early season is:\n\nGame 1: 0-0 (Nov 11)\nGame 2: 0-1 (Nov 12)\nGame 3: 0-2 (Nov 13)",
