This can be done by comparing his draft position with that of the other players in the table, especially those who were also drafted in the same years (2009 and 2010).\n\n#### Step 4: Check if there are any earlier drafts among the relevant players\nFrom Row 2, we know Greg Monroe was drafted at the 7th pick. We should look for players with earlier draft positions to see if they came before Greg Monroe.\n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion based on comparison\nSince there is no information in the table about other players being drafted in the same year as Greg Monroe (2009) and having an earlier position than him, we can conclude that Greg Monroe's draft status indicates he was one of the earliest drafts in that particular year, but not necessarily \"the earliest player to be draft\".\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion based on information about all players\nTo fully understand if Greg Monroe was indeed the first (or earliest) drafted among all the listed players, we would ideally need a more extensive dataset showing draft years and positions for every other player mentioned in the table.\n\nHowever, since our analysis is constrained by the available data within Row 2 of the table only, we must rely on that information. Greg Monroe was indeed drafted before any other players mentioned (who also have specific year drafts), but given no further info beyond 2009 and his exact draft position (7th), we cannot definitively claim he's \"the earliest\" without additional context.\n\nTherefore, our determination will be based solely on the available data within Row 2.\n\n#### Step 7: Compile final answer according to instructions\nGiven that Greg Monroe was drafted in 2009 at the 7th pick, and assuming no earlier draft for him among the provided table data, but also acknowledging that without a comprehensive dataset of all player drafts, we can't definitively claim he's \"the earliest\" based solely on this information:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table only shows Greg Monroe was drafted in 2009 at the 7th pick.

We can now conclude that the claim \"Greg Monroe be the most recent player to be draft\" is FALSE because there are other players who were also undrafted or drafted in a later year.\n\n7. Now we will identify relevant cells:\n   {\n    \"row_index\": 2,\n    \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n   }\n   \n  {\n     \"row_index\":1,\n      \"column_name\":\"nba draft\"\n    }\n\n     {\n    \"row_index\":4,\n    \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n   }\n\n     {\n     \"row_index\":5,\n     \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n   } \n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start with Row 2 of Greg Monroe and compare his draft year to the other players' draft years. Find that there are other players (Scotty Hopson, Michael Dunigan) who were also undrafted in later years, Tyler Zeller was drafted in a later year than Greg Monroe. Conclusion is FALSE. The most recent player to be drafted was not Greg Monroe.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\":1,\n      \"column_name\":\"nba draft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\":4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n   },\n     {\n       \"row_index\":5,\n       \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n   }]\n}",
