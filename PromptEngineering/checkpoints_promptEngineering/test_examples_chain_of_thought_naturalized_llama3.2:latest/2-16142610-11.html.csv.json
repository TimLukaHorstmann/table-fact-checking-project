To do this, we should first identify the relevant cells in the table that contain information about East Germany's participation in bobsleigh and their medal count.\n\n3. Looking at row 9 of the table, \"nation: east germany (gdr), sport: bobsleigh\", we can see that East Germany participated in bobsleigh once with 2 gold medals.\n\n4. This suggests that the claim is TRUE, but to be certain, let's also examine the information about East Germany's bobsleigh participation in row 5 of the table.\n\n5. In row 5, \"nation: east germany (gdr), sport: speed skating\", we can see that East Germany participated in speed skating once with a gold medal and two silver medals. This does not affect our conclusion because it is stated as \"for which they earn 2 gold medal\" but there is already an instance of East Germany having 2 Gold Medals from row 9.\n\n6.
