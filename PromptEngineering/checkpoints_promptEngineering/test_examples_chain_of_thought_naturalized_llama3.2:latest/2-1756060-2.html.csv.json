In this case, it's the \"ascent time\" column.\n\n### Step 2: List the fastest times in 2000\nNext, we'll list the ascent time values for riders who participated in 2000. According to the table:\n\n- Row 1: 41:55\n- Row 4: 43:24 (twice)\n- Row 12: 44:13\n\nWe have a total of 3 unique times.\n\n### Step 3: Determine if any other riders had faster times in 2000\nNow we need to check the ascent time for other rows that are not from 2000 to see if there were faster times. The relevant row that could potentially have faster times is Row 9 which has an ascent time of 43:55.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the number of fastest times in 2000\nWe found one more fast time (Row 9). So, we now know that at least two riders had the fastest times in 2000.\n\nHowever, we need to consider all rows. There is no other row from year 2000 that can be faster than those already considered and listed as such. Hence there are indeed only 3 fast times in 2000.\n\n### Step 5: Compare with total number of fastest times\nThe claim states \"2 of the 5 fastest time come in 2000\". In the table, we see a total of 11 rows that have ascent times, so there should be a total of 5 fastest times. Since at least two riders have the fastest times in 2000, and no other year has more than one rider with faster time than those already considered.\n\n### Step 6: Determine if claim is true or false\nSince we found that at least 2 out of the 5 fastest times come from the year 2000, the claim is true.\n\nHere's the JSON format as requested:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\"}, \n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\":\"\"}\n  ]\n}",
