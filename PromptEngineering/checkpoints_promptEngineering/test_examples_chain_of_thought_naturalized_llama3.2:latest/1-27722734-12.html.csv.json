However, we also need to check if Kobe Bryant was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers at the time of the game.\n\n7. Looking at Row 4 again, we see that the location attendance is \"new orleans arena\", which means the game was played in New Orleans, not in Los Angeles.\n\n8. Since Kobe Bryant was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers and the claim states he had a high point of 17 on April 24th with the Los Angeles Lakers, the information seems contradictory.\n\n9. However, upon closer inspection, we see that Row 4 states \"team: new orleans\", which suggests that Kobe Bryant was indeed playing for New Orleans at the time of this game.\n\n10. Given that our initial assessment in step 7 and step 8 appears to be inconsistent with our conclusion in step 5 , let's revisit our assumptions - the claim says \"of the los angeles lakers\". If we check Row 4 again, we see that kobe bryant of the new orleans has a high point of 17 . This means Kobe Bryant was playing for New Orleans at the time.\n\n11.

However, we know that the Los Angeles Lakers are often referred to by their city (Los Angeles). We can infer that \"New Orleans\" likely refers to the city of New Orleans where they were playing (i.e., at the time), but still not accurate for this particular date.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze further and check another column\nWe notice that there is a difference between team name \"New Orleans\", which is often known as \"Los Angeles\". The claim does state \"los angeles lakers\" with lowercase \"s\" in 'season'. Therefore, we should be looking at the value for \"team\" which contains \"new orleans\".\n\n#### Step 5: Look up another column to get more information\nWe can confirm this by looking up the cell that would include a reference to season. We find Row 1's \"game\" has been listed as \"1\". Looking further, in row 5 we have the following cell: game = 5, date: april 26, team: los angeles lakers\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if the Los Angeles Lakers played on April 17\nFrom step 2, we already know that Row 1 has a date of April 17.
