    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle in the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.\n2. To verify this, we need to find the relevant information about Tisha Venturini and her games played at Gavle in the table.\n\n#### Search for Relevant Information:\n\n- **Row 1**: This row contains general information about the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final, but it does not mention Tisha Venturini.\n  \n- **Row 2**: This row refers to a match number (1) with a date of 06/06/95 and a location of Gavle. It also mentions that Tisha Venturini was in the lineup for this match.\n\n- **Row 3**: Similar to Row 2, this row is about another match at Gavle but does not mention Tisha Venturini playing.\n\n- **Row 5**: This row says Tisha Venturini entered the game in the 80th minute and resulted in a score of 4-0. It also mentions that it was a quarterfinal match, which happens before the final, supporting the idea that she played multiple games.\n\n- **Row 6**: Tisha Venturini is mentioned again but as being in the lineup for a semifinal match at Vasteras, not Gavle.\n\n- The rest of the rows do not provide any additional relevant information about Tisha Venturini playing games at Gavle or her overall performance in the tournament.\n\n\n#### Analysis Conclusion:\n\nGiven that Row 2 and Row 5 mention Tisha Venturini's participation in matches played at Gavle, it seems plausible that she did indeed play multiple games there. However, without more specific information about all of these matches (like whether they were also quarterfinals), we cannot definitively say for sure that she played exactly four games.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The claim states Tisha Venturini played 4 matches at Gavle in the Sweden 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.\",\n    \"To verify this, we need to find the relevant information about Tisha Venturini and her games played at Gavle in the table.\",\n    \"We found that Row 2 and Row 5 mention Tisha Venturini's participation in matches played at Gavle.

However, we notice that Row 11 has no match on this date. We should also check Row 13, but it only mentions \"usa 1999 fifa women 's world cup\" and does not have a match with this specific date in row 11, although row 13 says there is no result, row 11 only says start.\n\t* For 1999-07-10: Match #13 had a result of \"0 - 0 (pso 5 - 4)\", indicating a draw after extra time.\n4. **Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE**:\n\t* Based on our analysis, the claim is TRUE because there are indeed three matches where Tisha Venturini's career ended in a draw: Match #1 in 1995, and Match #13 and row 11 3-3 match which has no date in that row, although row 13 has the final but does not contain any date for this specific game.\n5. **Identify relevant cells**:\n\t* For each date mentioned in the claim, we need to identify the corresponding rows and columns where the match data is located.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim.
