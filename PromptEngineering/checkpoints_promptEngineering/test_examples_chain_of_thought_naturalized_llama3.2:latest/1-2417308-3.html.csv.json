However, we need to check the number of these successors.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify if the claim about two successors starting in 1855 is true\nBased on our verification that both Benjamin Fitzpatrick and John Parker Hale started their terms in 1855, the claim is partially correct because it does mention them correctly.

Since November is before December, it doesn't fall within our defined time frame.\n\n3. **Check Row 3 (Pennsylvania) for Successor in Congress Within Specified Time Frame**: January 14, 1856, does not fall within our defined time frame since it's after December 31, 1855.\n\n4. **Check Row 4 (California) for Successor in Congress Within Specified Time Frame**: January 13, 1857, falls within the specified time frame, making Graham N.

The column \"state (class): new hampshire (2)\" indicates that he was the representative for this state.\n\n### Step 3: Check if any information about his congressional appointment or joining Congress can be found\nSince Row 1 only provides information about John Parker Hale's succession as Governor of New Hampshire and not about his representation in Congress, we need to look at Row 2 to see if he is listed with the title \"Representative\" for New Hampshire.\n\n### Step 4: Determine John Parker Hale's role based on relevant table rows\nRow 1 states that John Parker Hale became governor after a legislative failure to elect a successor. However, it does not mention his appointment or joining Congress.\nTo determine if he joined Congress, we need to look at the information about Alabama and Pennsylvania in Row 2 and Row 3.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze information from other relevant rows\nRows 2 and 3 both report that John Parker Hale was appointed as a Representative after legislative failure in his respective states. \nRow 4 also reports him being elected to Congress for the same state, although this appears to be related to the original election rather than an appointment.\nFurthermore, Row 5 contains Graham N Fitch who became an Indiana Congressman and indicates that John Parker Hale did not receive a similar designation as \"representative\".\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven our analysis of the relevant table rows, we can conclude that John Parker Hale was appointed by the state legislature for New Hampshire to represent the state, but he is mentioned in row 4 of the table as becoming governor (not representative) in California.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant column**: The column to focus on for determining successors is \"successor\".\n2. **Filter by time period**: We need to check the dates of successors' formal installations within the specified range: 1855 and 1857.\n3. **Check Row 1's successor**: John Parker Hale (R) was installed on July 30, 1855. This is outside the desired time frame.\n4. **Check Row 2's successor**: Benjamin Fitzpatrick (D) was installed on November 26, 1855. This falls within our target range.\n5. **Check Row 3's successor**: William Bigler (D) was installed on January 14, 1856. This also falls within the desired time frame.\n6. **Check Row 4's successor**: William M Gwin (D) was installed on January 13, 1857. This is within our target range as well.\n7. **Count and verify the successors within the specified time period**:\n   - Total number of successors: 3\n   We verified that all three were indeed between 1855 and 1857.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"successor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"successor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"successor\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"successor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"successor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"successor\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
