To do this, we check row 7 of the table, which specifies the year, award name, category, nominee's name, and result for the Drama Desk Award in 2005.\n3. Since the category is \"outstanding choreography\" and the result is \"nominated\", it indicates that William Ivey Long was not a winner for this specific category.\n4. Next, we need to check if William Ivey Long won the award for outstanding costume design in 2005.\n5. We do this by checking row 7 of the table again, which indeed specifies that William Ivey Long was nominated for \"outstanding costume design\".\n6. Now, we verify whether Jerry Mitchell (nominated for \"outstanding choreography\") and Jerry Mitchell (won) are related to the award for \"outstanding choreography\". Since they are in different rows and categories, it appears there is some confusion with the names in the table.\n7. However, this step can be skipped since we have already determined that William Ivey Long was nominated but not won for the category of outstanding costume design, and we know he was also nominated for another award (outstanding costume design), so this doesn't affect our decision about whether or not William Ivey Long has won \"outstanding choreography\" (which is a separate award from outstanding costume design).\n8. Finally, to check if William Ivey Long has won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for outstanding choreography, we refer back to row 6 of the table.\n9. We see that this award was indeed won by Jerry Mitchell in 2005, not by William Ivey Long.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"category\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Next, let's look at the results of nominees for Best Costume Design:\n   - According to the table, William Ivey Long was nominated but did not win (result: nominated).\n\n3. Since we're looking for a winner, not just a nominee, and we know that the nominee didn't win, let's confirm if there are any other nominees or winners in 2005 for Best Costume Design:\n   - There is no additional information provided about another winner.\n\n4. Now, considering our findings from step 1 to step 3, we can conclude whether the claim \"the 2005 nominee for best costume design win the award\" is true or false.\n   - Given that there was a nominee and they didn't win, the statement is FALSE.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify relevant information about Best Costume Design award\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Check if nominee won the award\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Confirm there are no other winners for Best Costume Design in 2005\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Determine claim's truth value based on findings\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 4,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"result\"\n        }\n    ]\n}",
