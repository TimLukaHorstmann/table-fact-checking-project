Next, we will calculate the total number of points for the season 2009 by adding up the points from all relevant cells in the table. We will look at rows with seasons 2008 and 2009.\n\n3. After verifying the points for each season, we can compare them to the given claim to determine if it is true or false.\n\n4.

Now, let's verify if there are indeed 293 points for the season 2010 by looking at row 7:\n   The relevant information is in column 2. From this table we see that races: 30, wins: 5, poles: 2, f / laps: 4, podiums: 12, and points: 293.\n   Since there are indeed 293 points for the season 2010, this verifies the first part of the claim.\n\n6. Next, let's calculate the total number of points for the season 2009:\n   The relevant information is in columns 3 and 4 (series and season).\n   For the series British Formula Renault 2.0 we see that races: 20, wins: 8, poles: 10, f / laps: 7, podiums: 12, and points: 457.\n   For the series Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup we see that races: 6, wins: 0, poles: 0, f / laps: 1, podiums: 0, and points: 10.\n   Adding up these values gives us 457 + 10 = 467.\n\n7. Comparing the total number of points for season 2009 to the claim results in a match (467).\n\n8.

We can do this by looking at Row 8 (GP3 series) and Row 9 (GP2 final). \n\nAccording to Row 8, races in 2011: 16. \nHowever, according to Row 9, races in 2011: 2.\nBut Row 7 of the table also states the Series name as GP3 Series for which races = 16 and Lotas Art team participated.\n\nThus we can assume that the other series has races equal to 6.\n\nSo total number of race = 16 + 6 = 22\n\nTherefore, there is no way that a total of 18 races happened in 2011.\n\n### Step 2: Verify the total number of pole positions in 2011\nNext, we need to check if there was one pole position in 2011. According to Row 8 (GP3 series), poles in 2011: 1 and according to row 7 (British Formula Three Championship) , poles in 2011: 2.\nAnd also according to row 9, poles in 2011: 0\nThus pole position is only from GP3 Series which has a value of 1.\n\nTherefore, there is one pole position in 2011\n\n### Step 3: Verify the total number of wins in 2011\nNext, we need to check if there were two wins in 2011. According to Row 8 (GP3 series), wins in 2011: 1 and according to row 9, wins in 2011: 1.\nThus wins are equal to one.\n\nTherefore, there is no way that a total of two wins happened in 2011.\n\n\n\n### Chain of thought:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the total number of races in 2011\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the total number of pole positions in 2011\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Verify the total number of wins in 2011\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"races\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"races\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"races\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"poles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"poles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"poles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Check if Fortec Motorsport has 55 points in the year 2011 by looking at row 8 of the table.\n   - Relevant cells: \n     - `row_index`: 8\n     - `column_name`: \"points\"\n   - Values in these cells are: `55`.\n   - Since the value is equal to 55, the claim that Fortec Motorsport has 55 points in 2011 is TRUE.\n\n3. The claim contains two parts, and we need to verify both parts of it (Fortec Motorsport having 293 points in 2009 and having 55 points in 2011).
