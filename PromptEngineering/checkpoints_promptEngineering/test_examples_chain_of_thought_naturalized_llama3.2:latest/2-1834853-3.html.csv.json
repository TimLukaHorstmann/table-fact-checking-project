However, we don't have information on his goals in other games.\n\n### Step 4: Check if Carsten Jancker scored a goal in any of the World Cup qualifier games\nIn Row 4, Carsten Jancker was part of a 2-2 draw and he didn't score the winning goal.\nHowever, looking at row 5 we can see that Carsten Jancker's team played with 3 goals difference but since there isn't an official score of 3 goals made by carsten jancker in this game.\n\nIn Row 6, Carsten Jancker scored a single goal for his team. In the context of world cup qualifier games this is one of two qualifying games where he has been on the winning team\n\n### Step 5: Count how many times Carsten Jancker scores a goal\nCarsten Jancker was part of a World Cup Qualifier game where he had scored in and hence one is confirmed.\nHowever, to find out if there are indeed three goals from carsten jancker we need to check row 7. In this friendly game Carsten Jancker scored 1 goal.\n\n\n\n### Step 6: Check if Carsten Jancker scores a goal in another World Cup qualifier game\nAfter checking all games for Carsten Jancker's participation, it seems that the number of confirmed goals from carsten jancker is more than one.\n\n\n\n### Step 7: Determine if three of Carsten Jancker's international goals were scored in either World Cup game or World Cup qualifier game.\nCarsten Jancker played a total of two world cup games with scores.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. First, we need to identify the number of international goals scored in friendly games. We can do this by filtering out the games with a competition of \"2002 World Cup\" since they are not considered friendly games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Filtering non-friendly games from 2002 World Cup\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n2. After removing the games related to the 2002 World Cup, we can count the number of goals scored in friendly games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Counting international goals in friendly games\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n3. Next, we need to check if only one international goal was scored in all friendly games.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verifying the claim \\\"only 1 international goal be score in all friendly game\\\"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n4. Finally, we can compare the number of goals scored in friendly games with the claim that only one international goal was scored.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing the number of goals to the claim\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n5. The number of goals scored in friendly games is more than one, so the claim that only one international goal was scored in all friendly games is FALSE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion: Claim is FALSE\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The actual values in the table are not provided, but the step-by-step reasoning process is explained above.",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Start by finding Carsten Jancker's lowest score of all time:\n   - In the table, we need to find rows where Carsten Jancker played for his team.\n   - We notice that there are multiple instances of Carsten Jancker in different rows.\n\n2. Analyze Row 6 (date: 1 September 2001, venue: Olympiastadion, Munich) and its details:\n   - In this row, we can see that the score is 1-0 with a result of 1-5.\n   - This means that Carsten Jancker's team lost to another opponent.\n\n3. Analyze Row 9 (date: 21 August 2002, venue: Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia) and its details:\n   - In this row, we can see that the score is 2-2 with a result of 2-2.\n   - This means that Carsten Jancker's team drew against another opponent.\n\n4. Analyze Row 10 (date: 11 October 2002, venue: Asim Ferhatovi\u0107 Hase Stadium, Sarajevo) and its details:\n   - In this row, we can see that the score is 1-1 with a result of 1-1.\n   - This means that Carsten Jancker's team drew against another opponent.\n\n5. Find the lowest score of all time for Carsten Jancker's team:\n   - Looking at the table again, we notice that in Row 6 and Rows 9 and 10 there is a lower value than 3-2 which is present in row 1.\n   - Since this lower score (1-0) is indeed below 3-2; this means Carsten Jancker's team lowest score of all time is actually 1, not 3.\n\n6. Based on our findings, determine whether the claim \"Carsten Jancker 's team 's lowest score of all time be 3\" is TRUE or FALSE:\n   - The claim is FALSE because we found that Carsten Jancker's team has scored as low as 1 in one instance.\n\n7. List the relevant cells:\n   ```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n]\n```\n   This list includes rows where Carsten Jancker's team had a score below 3.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find Carsten Jancker's lowest score of all time\",\n    \"Analyze Row 6 (1-0) and its details\",\n    \"Analyze Row 9 (2-2) and its details\",\n    \"Analyze Row 10 (1-1) and its details\",\n    \"Find the lowest score of all time for Carsten Jancker's team\",\n    \"Based on our findings, determine whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
