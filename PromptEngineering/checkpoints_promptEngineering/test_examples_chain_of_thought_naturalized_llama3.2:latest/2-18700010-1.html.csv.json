    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the column of interest\nThe claim mentions \"league goals\", so we need to look for the column related to league goals.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the row of interest\nWe are interested in finding out if Tommy Smith has the highest number of league goals, so we need to find his row in the table.\n\n#### Step 3: Check Tommy Smith's row\nTommy Smith's row is row 14 with the following values:\n- name: tommy smith\n- league apps: 0\n- league goals: 0\n- fa cup apps: 0\n- fa cup goals: 0\n- league cup apps: 1\n- league cup goals: 0\n- total apps: 1\n- total goals: 0\n\n#### Step 4: Compare with other rows\nWe need to compare Tommy Smith's league goals (0) with the league goals of other players. Since the number is 0, it is not possible for anyone to have a higher value.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSince Tommy Smith has a league goal count of 0, and no one else in the table has a lower number than that, he does indeed have the highest number of league goals. However, we can only determine this by referring to all rows in the table:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON format output will be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"league goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 17,\n      \"column_name\": \"league apps\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
