However, from row 1 of the table, we can see that the name is indeed \"the shock wave\". \n\n#### Step 4: Determine if the claim is true or false\nWe need to check if \"the shock wave\" was opened 7 years after \"buffalo mountain coaster\". Since we know the opening year of \"buffalo mountain coaster\", we can calculate this.\n\nIf \"the shock wave\" was opened 7 years after \"buffalo mountain coaster\", then its opening year would be 1987 + 7 = 1994. \n\nWe can check if this is true by looking at row 1 of the table, which says that the name is indeed \"the shock wave\" and it was opened in 1994.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine relevant cells\nSince we are using information from rows 1 and 4 of the table to calculate the difference between opening years, our relevant cells are:\n- Cell [0, 3]: value = 1994 (opening year of \"the shock wave\")\n- Cell [3, 2]: value = 1987 (opening year of \"buffalo mountain coaster\")\n\n#### Final answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim is true because the opening year of 'the shock wave' (1994) is indeed 7 years after the opening year of 'buffalo mountain coaster' (1987).\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"opened\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"opened\"}\n  ]\n}",
