    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that Gamal Hamza scored the second highest goal in the Caf Champions League.\n\n2. **Locate relevant information**:\n   - To verify this claim, we need to find out how many goals were scored by players in the Caf Champions League and which player scored the most.\n   - We can do this by looking at the column \"caf champions league\" for each player's total score.\n\n3. **Determine total number of goals**:\n   - To confirm that Gamal Hamza scored the second highest goal, we need to know how many players scored in the Caf Champions League.\n   - This information is found in row 17 (Total) under column \"caf champions league\" with a value of 4.\n\n4. **Find out who scored the most goals**:\n   - To confirm that Gamal Hamza scored the second highest goal, we need to find out who scored the most goals.\n   - This information is found in row 17 (Total) under column \"caf champions league\" with a value of 4 and column \"total\" also confirms this.\n\n5. **Look up Gamal Hamza\u2019s score**:\n   - We now look at Gamal Hamza's total score in the Caf Champions League.\n   - This information is found in row 7 (Gamal Hamza) under column \"caf champions league\" with a value of 2.\n\n6. **Compare scores**:\n   - Now that we know how many goals were scored by players and who scored the most, we can compare Gamal Hamza's score to determine if he scored the second highest goal.\n   - If the second highest score is indeed 2 (Gamal Hamza\u2019s) and it's not equal to the highest score in Caf Champions League which is also 4.\n\n7. **Verify claim**: \n   - Based on step 6, we can conclude that Gamal Hamza did not score the second-highest goal in the Caf champions league because 2 is less than the highest goal scored by another player.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim: The claim states that Gamal Hamza scored the second highest goal in the Caf Champions League.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant information: Look at column &quot;caf champions league&quot; for each player\u2019s total score to verify this claim.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Determine total number of goals: Find out how many players scored in the Caf Champions League and confirm Gamal Hamza\u2019s performance based on that information.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Find out who scored the most goals: Check if there is any other player with more than Gamal Hamza\u2019s Caf Champions League score.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Look up Gamal Hamza\u2019s score: Verify that Gamal Hamza has indeed scored in the Caf Champions League and his score to determine if he is in second place.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Compare scores: Check which player scored the highest goal in the Caf Champions league, then see if Gamal Hamza\u2019s score (2) is indeed the second-highest.
