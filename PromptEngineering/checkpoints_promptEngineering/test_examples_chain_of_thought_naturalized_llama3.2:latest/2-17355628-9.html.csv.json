    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the specific month in question\nThe problem mentions \"march 2009\", but there's no explicit date given for any game. However, we can infer that since the seasons are mentioned and dates range from March to April (indicating a basketball season), \"March\" is indeed the correct month.\n\n#### Step 2: Find all games played in march\nLooking through each row of data:\n- Row 1 has a date of March 2.\n- Row 2 has a date of March 4.\n- Rows 3 to 15 contain dates from March 7 onwards, but they are not all in \"March\" since most of them are in April.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for games where the oklahoma city thunder score at least 100 points\nIn Row 1 (March 2), the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 96 points.\nIn Row 2 (March 4), the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 88 points, which is less than 100.\nFrom Rows 3 to 9, there are a few more games where the Oklahoma City Thunder score at least 100 points. The exact details for these games are as follows:\n- Row 3 (March 7): l 90 - 108\n- Row 4 (March 8): w 89 - 74\n- Row 5 (March 10): w 99 - 98\n- Row 6 (March 11) and Row 9 (March 18) both have losses where the Oklahoma City Thunder scored more than 100 points.\n- Rows 7 to 10 contain games with losses, except for one game in row 5 which is a win.\n\n#### Step 4: Find the first game where the oklahoma city thunder score at least 100 points\nLooking through Row 3 (March 7), we see that the Oklahoma City Thunder lost to new orleans with a final score of 108 - 90. This confirms that there are indeed games in march where the team scored more than 100.\n\n#### Step 5: Check if any game during this time has the oklahoma city thunder scoring less than 100 points\nFrom the data available, no other games have Oklahoma City Thunder scores below 100 points.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nBased on these observations and steps, we can now determine that our claim about the table is:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the specific month in question\",\n    \"Step 2: Find all games played in march\",\n    \"Step 3: Check for games where the oklahoma city thunder score at least 100 points\",\n    \"Step 4: Find the first game where the oklahoma city thunder score at least 100 points\",\n    \"Step 5: Check if any game during this time has the oklahoma city thunder scoring less than 100 points\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, since the name is most likely referring to high points only, we will first search for rows with \"kevin durant\" as the top scorer.\n\n#### Step 3: Look up rows where Kevin Durant scored the most points\nBy inspecting each row, we can identify which games Kevin Durant had the highest point score. Since no exact date (not March 2009) is provided in the table for Kevin Durant, we look at the scores. However, it seems he didn't top the list 6 times.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if a six-game lead was achieved\nIn order to achieve a 6 game lead in points per game, there must be enough relevant data (i.e., enough games where \"kevin durant\" had a high point score).\n\n#### Step 5: Count the number of Kevin Durant's top scoring games\nLooking at the table, we see that Kevin Durant was a top scorer in 6 games. However, it is still unclear if his performance for those six games would be enough to put him at the top of the overall team leaderboard.\n\n#### Step 6: Check if there were more games played by the rest of the players\nIf any other player had as many or more points than Kevin Durant in these six games, their higher average point totals would likely put them in the lead.\n\n#### Step 7: Look at the total game record to find out how many games each team played.\nChecking that the Thunder played enough games to make a statistical comparison of his performance with other players possible.\n\n\n\n#### Step 8: Check if any other player had as high or more points than Kevin Durant for those six games.\nSince we can only see the relevant data, looking at the table we find no other score equaling Kevin Durant's 6 times.\n\n#### Step 9: Evaluate the total number of points scored in those six games\nKevin Durant led his team in scoring for these six games.\n\n\n\n#### Step 10: Compare it with the rest of the player statistics in the relevant timeframe.\nHowever, there was a lack of data about other players in those same timeframe to know that they did not beat Kevin's point totals.\n\n#### Step 11: Conclude based on available information.\nSince we can see he had a 6 game lead and his teammates didn't have as many points in those six games, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check if Kevin Durant scored the most points\",\n    \"Look for relevant data to confirm his top scoring performances\",\n    \"Compare with other players' scores\",\n    \"Find out how many games each team played.\",\n    \"Consider the total number of points scored in those six games\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"high_points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"high_points\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the table structure and data does not provide a definitive answer to the claim about Kevin Durant's point scoring performance in March of 2009.",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the condition for breaking a 100-point game\nTo break 100 points, a team must score more than 99 points.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify the relevant games where Oklahoma City Thunder could have broken 100 points\nWe need to examine each row of the table to see if the Thunder's score exceeds 99 in any of the \"score\" columns that correspond to their games.\n\n#### Step 3: Examine Row 5 for a possible break of 100 points\nIn game 64, the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 99 points. This is less than 100 points but close enough to potentially be relevant if we missed any other scores being higher in this row or subsequent rows.\n\n#### Step 4: Move on to examine each game row starting from Row 6 to see if there's a break\nStarting with Row 6, since the Thunder lost and scored 99 points (in row 5), checking for their games is redundant because we've already seen that in Row 5. We only need to check subsequent rows.\n\n#### Step 5: Examine Row 7\nIn game 67 of Row 7, the Oklahoma City Thunder scored 106 points. This exceeds the threshold and indicates a break of 100 points during March.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify if there's any other row where this condition is met after Row 7.\nSince we've already established in Row 7 that they scored over 100 points, it seems unlikely that any further breakdowns occur given their performance in subsequent games appears to be trending downward or similar to what has occurred up until the end of the examined rows.\n\n#### Step 7: Count how many times this condition is met\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder broke a 100-point barrier at least once and possibly more based on the data available, but as seen in Row 7, it was confirmed that they did break the 100 point mark. Given there are only two rows examined with scores over 99 points without additional breakdowns occurring after this (Row 5 and then Row 7), and considering the instruction to look for a break \"5 time during march\" might be a misinterpretation or error given we have confirmed but potentially undercounted due to how data was interpreted from table rows.\n\n#### Step 8: Finalize the answer based on step count\nSince we've identified at least one instance of breaking 100 points and potentially more (but were unable to verify additional occurrences due to the nature of the task), it seems likely that there are indeed multiple instances. However, strictly adhering to the instruction format without deviating from provided requirements necessitates a focus on direct data validation rather than speculative counting based on table entries beyond those directly verified.\n\n#### Step 9: Determine relevance of specific cells to final answer\nThe relevant cell is Row 7 and any potentially other row that meets the criteria, however, only confirming one instance in the process makes it difficult to affirmatively state multiple occurrences without risking overcounting or misinterpretation.

Analyze the relevant locations and their corresponding attendance numbers from Row 8:\n\n- Ford Center attendance: 19136\n- New Orleans Arena attendance: 18114\n- Air Canada Centre attendance: 17127\n\n3. Compare the attendance at Air Canada Centre in March with the given claim (4 separate occasions during March 2009):\n   - The attendance on March 7th was 18114.\n   - The attendance on March 16th was 19136.\n   - The attendance on March 31st was 18797.\n\n4. Based on this comparison, determine if the claim is true or false:\n\n- Since all attendance figures for Air Canada Centre in March were not equal and they only occur four times during a month (which we have), it is possible that there might be multiple instances.\n   - Therefore, let's recheck all other rows for attendance at Air Canada Centre:\n    Row 13: Air Canada Centre attendance was 17127\n    Row 14: Not mentioned\n    Row 15: Attendance was 18797\n\n5. Now we know the attendance for these four games, and their dates are also given in March 2009:\n\n- The claim is indeed true because there were at least 4 different occasions where fans attended San Antonio Spurs game at Air Canada Centre during March 2009.\n\n6.
