We start by looking at Row 10 of the table as it contains information about driver Raymond Sommer.\n3. In Row 10, the \"engine\" column shows that the engine type is Ferrari V12S.\n4. Next, we verify that the driver's name in Row 10 matches with Raymond Sommer.\n5. Since both conditions are met (Ferrari V12S engine and Raymond Sommer as the driver), we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"1\", \"reasoning\": \"To verify the claim, we need to check if the engine is indeed Ferrari V12S and the driver is Raymond Sommer.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"2\", \"reasoning\": \"We start by looking at Row 10 of the table as it contains information about driver Raymond Sommer.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"3\", \"reasoning\": \"In Row 10, the \\\"engine\\\" column shows that the engine type is Ferrari V12S.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"4\", \"reasoning\": \"Next, we verify that the driver's name in Row 10 matches with Raymond Sommer.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"5\", \"reasoning\": \"Since both conditions are met (Ferrari V12S engine and Raymond Sommer as the driver), we can conclude that the claim is true.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"engine\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"driver\"}\n  ]\n}",
