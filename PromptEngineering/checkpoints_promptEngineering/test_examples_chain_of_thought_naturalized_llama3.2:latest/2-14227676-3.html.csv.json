    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to determine if Noiz has held the title for the longest time.\n   - We will start by looking at the column 'days held' which contains the number of days each wrestler held the title.\n\n2. Next, we compare the value in the 'days held' column with 2127 +.\n   - Since the '+' symbol is used as a mathematical operator in this context, it means that the actual day limit for Noiz's reign should be considered as \"not specified\" or potentially longer than stated (but likely not), so the comparison of \"2127 +\" to 'days held' would yield an error.\n\n3. Given that we have compared 2127 + with 'days held', which is in a different format, we now look for other relevant data within the table.\n   - We will check if there's another entry where someone else has held the title for less time than Noiz. Since the 'event' column lists 'live event' and no one else holds the title for more days, this will be our benchmark.\n\n4. Next, we compare the value in the 'days held' column with the actual day limit of 2127 + (without considering the '+' operator).\n   - Given that \"unknown\" is listed as an entry for 'days held', it does not match or exceed Noiz's title duration.\n\n5. Since there are no other wrestlers who have held the title for more days than Noiz, we must determine if \"not specified\" is a valid value.\n    - Because \"2127 +\", although written with a mathematical '+' symbol, can be interpreted as an undefined/unknown quantity in its place, we cannot draw a logical conclusion to this claim solely based on that entry.\n\n6. Our last step will be verifying whether the table allows Noiz to hold the title for more than 2127 days.\n   - However, given our earlier ambiguity regarding the mathematical symbol '+' used, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty if \"not specified\" means greater or less than this amount.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if Noiz has held the title for the longest time, we looked at 'days held'. We then compared 2127 + to that value but were unable to do so meaningfully due to the use of a mathematical '+' symbol. The value in this column was also unknown.

However, we should note that no other rows are completely missing any data about how many times they were reigned in.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if there's enough information to conclude\nThere is indeed insufficient data to confidently say all wrestlers meet this criteria because row 7 has an unreasonably high number of days (2127 +), which might be a calculation error. Therefore, we can't definitively make the claim that every single wrestler had at least one reign.\n\n#### Step 6: Final conclusion based on available information\nGiven the nature of the data provided and acknowledging some inconsistencies in total length of time reigned for noiz (row 7), it's possible to make an argument that not all wrestlers meet this condition due to discrepancies or lack of detail, rather than outright falsehoods.\n\n#### Step 7: Output final answer in JSON format\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze each row and their reign values.\",\n    \"Check for any missing data or unclear information.\",\n    \"Look for cases where the amount of days held is unreasonably high or unclear (like noiz).\",\n    \"Evaluate if all wrestlers meet the condition based on available information.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"reign\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"reign\"}\n  ]\n}",

Also in Row 3, it is mentioned that the location is Tokyo, Japan and event was live event. We can disregard those because there is another entry with more shorter title reign for us to check:  Row 2.\n\n3. In Row 2 of the table, Osamu Namiguchi's reign lasted 7 days. Since we are evaluating if noiz hold his title for the shortest time at 7 day, and in Row 2 we know he had a reign that was shorter than what was given by the claim. So, this is relevant information.\n\n4.
