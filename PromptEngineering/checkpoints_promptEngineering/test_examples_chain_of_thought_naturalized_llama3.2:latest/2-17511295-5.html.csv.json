    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. First, we need to verify the number of home games played by Philadelphia Flyers during their 2008 - 2009 season.\n2. We will iterate through each row of the table and check if the date falls within December 2008 or any other month, and if the game is a home game for the Philadelphia Flyers.\n3. For each home game, we need to verify that it occurs in the 2008 - 2009 season.\n4. We will count the total number of home games played by the Philadelphia Flyers during their 2008 - 2009 season.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Continued:\n\n5. We can see from Row 1 that December 2, 2008 was a home game for the Philadelphia Flyers with an attendance of 19227 and a decision of Biron.\n6. From Row 4, we have another home game on December 9, 2008, with the same conditions (attendance: 19037).\n7. We can see from Row 5 that December 11, 2008 was also a home game for the Philadelphia Flyers with an attendance of 19057 and a decision of Niittymaki.\n8. From Row 6, we have another home game on December 13, 2008, again for the Philadelphia Flyers (attendance: 19811).\n9. Additionally, from Row 7, December 16, 2008 was also a home game with an attendance of 19219 and a decision of Niittymaki.\n10. Furthermore, we have another home game on December 18, 2008 (Row 8) with the same conditions for Philadelphia Flyers, (attendance: 21273).\n11. From Row 9, we see that December 20 was also a home game for Philadelphia Flyers (attendance: 19897).\n12. Continuing, from Row 10, December 21 was a home game for Philadelphia Flyers with the correct attendance and decision (14426, Niittymaki). \n13. Next, in row 11, we can see another match up for Philadelphia Flyers on December 23 of 2008 with an attendance of 19578 (Nittymaki).\n14. Lastly from Row 12 to Row 14 we have last few games that were played on the same dates for the flyers during their 2008 - 2009 season.\n15. Now, we can verify if these home games occur within the month of December and in the 2008-2009 season.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Continued:\n\n16. By counting the number of home games that meet our criteria, we have a total of 14 home games played by Philadelphia Flyers during their 2008 - 2009 season.\n17. Since this matches the condition stated in the claim (the Philadelphia Flyer play 8 home game in the month of December during their 2008 - 2009 season), we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":11,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":12,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"date\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":1,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":11,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":12,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":13,\"column_name\":\"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\":14,\"column_name\":\"date\"}\n  ]\n}",

Actually, row 12's game has the highest attendance at 22712 which cannot be lower or equal to any other row in this context and thus no need to continue checking rows.\n\n8. **Verify the season for year**: The date is December 26 during the 2008-2009 season, which seems plausible based on typical NHL seasons.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Check the claim's condition: the game with the highest attendance must be on December 26 during the Philadelphia Flyers' 2008-2009 season.\",\n    \"Locate relevant data to verify if this indeed occurred and what its attendance was against all other games in the table.\",\n    \"Identify that a game did occur on December 26, confirmed by row 12's data with an attendance of 22712.\",\n    \"Verify highest attendance value: since no other record has higher or equal attendance than 22712 for any mentioned date (December 26), we can say this is indeed the highest recorded attendance during the specified season and date.\",\n    \"Find that there were no games in the table with a greater attendance, confirming our conclusion from above.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 0, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the date in December for each row to determine if any games were played in December 2008.\n\n2. Looking at Row 3: The game was on \"December 6\" which is before December 2008.\n\n3. Next, looking at Row 10: The game was on \"December 21\" which is after December 2008.\n\n4. Since we found a row where the game took place in December of 2008 and the claim says that Philadelphia Flyers won 3 games and lost 11 in December 2008, let's analyze that specific date.\n\n5. Now looking at Row 14: The game was on \"December 30\" which is within December 2008. \n\n6. Checking the wins for December 30 in Row 14 shows a win for Philadelphia Flyers with score \"3 - 2\".\n\n7. To verify if there were 11 losses, we need to check all the games played before and including December 30.\n\n8. We should confirm that there weren't any more than 11 losses.\n\n9. Now looking at other rows like Row 4: \"December 9\" doesn't meet our criteria because there are no wins and losses in December 2008.\n\n10. Further, looking at Row 5 shows a loss on the same day (December 11), however that isn't enough to reach 11 games lost.\n\n11. Continuing further down rows like Row 6: \"December 13\" does have 1 win and loss but still not sufficient for our requirements.\n\n12. Similarly we can check row 8: \"December 18\". There was 1 win in the same period that meets our criteria.\n\n13. Now, continuing to row 9 & 11: there is another loss on the same date, December 20 & December 23.\n\n14. Also checking row 12 and row 13 we see wins with losses before December 30 but none after it (the only game in this time that Philadelphia loses was \"December 27\"). Therefore, there are no more games than 11 for our requirements.\n\n15. We can also verify Row 1 doesn't contain any wins or losses from December 2008 and row 2 shows another win with the score being 3 - 2 but no other date in December 2008 that is relevant to our query exists.\n\n16. In conclusion we need at least three more wins to see if there were indeed eleven total loss games.\n\n17. Since Row 14 has a win, let's check how many additional wins are necessary for the statement to be true.\n\n18. Looking at row 12: \"December 26\", it does have another loss but this isn't enough for our criteria.\n\n19. The next game would be row 13, \"December 27\". There is indeed a win in the same period that meets our requirements.\n\n20. We continue looking down rows until we reach the required amount of wins to meet the statement's conditions.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",

We need to verify if December 18 game has it's corresponding team as \"home\".\n\nFor this row index, and column name \"Attendance\", the values are:\nRow 8: date: december 18, visitor: philadelphia, score: 2 - 5, home: montreal, attendance: 21273, record: 17 - 8 - 6\n\nThe team is listed as visiting Philadelphia.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if the claim is True or False\nBased on our findings:\n- The game with the highest attendance was not a home game on December 26.\n- We have found that in row index 8, column name \"Attendance\" has the value 21273 for the date of December 18, and team Philadelphia as visitor.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude the claim is False.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"reasoning\": \"Verify if highest attendance game on December 26 was a home game.\"},\n    {\"reasoning\": \"Find row with highest attendance in December\"},\n    {\"column_name\": \"Attendance\", \"row_index\": 8, \"value\": 21273},\n    {\"reasoning\": \"The team is listed as visiting Philadelphia.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"Attendance\", \"value\": 21273},\n    {\"column_name\": \"\", \"row_index\": 8, \"value\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}",
