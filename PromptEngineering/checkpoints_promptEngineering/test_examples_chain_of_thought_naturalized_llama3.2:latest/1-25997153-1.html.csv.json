Finally, we will check if the claim is true by comparing the two dates obtained in steps 2 and 1.\n   - If they are equal, the claim is True; otherwise, it's False.\n\n4. Now let's do this step-by-step with the data provided:\n- First, find episode 10 of season 2\n    - Since we have a table that lists all episodes of Season 2 in ascending order of their numbers, we can determine which row corresponds to episode 10.\n        - Row 16 is \"Code Red\" and this is not episode 10. \n        - We continue counting until we find the 10th episode\n    - We have Episode 9 = \"Episode 8\" (Row 7), and the next episode is Row 8 which is \"Episode 9\". We continue to the next row.\n    - The next row after \"Episode 9\" is row 10. This must be the 10th episode in season 2\n        - Relevant cell: {\n            \"row_index\": 10,\n            \"column_name\": \"episode\"\n        }\n- Next, find what air date is exactly one week after Episode 8\n    - The relevant air date for Episode 8 = Row 7 and this date can be determined by examining row 7.\n        - Relevant cell: {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"air_date\"\n        }\n- Now, add a week to the air date of Episode 9\n    - The relevant air date for Episode 8 is April 1, 2010\n    - Add one week (7 days) to this date.\n        - April 1 + 7 days = April 8, 2010\n    - The relevant cell: {\n            \"row_index\": 18,\n            \"column_name\": \"air_date\"\n        }\n\n- Finally compare the two air dates obtained in steps 4 and 5:\n    - Row 10 is episode 10 of season 2 with an air date of April 8, 2010\n    - Row 7 has an air date of April 1, 2010. \n    - One week after \"Episode 8\" would be April 8, 2010.\n\nBased on these steps and comparisons, the chain of thought is as follows:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Find episode 10 in season 2\",\n    \"The 10th episode is in row 16\",\n    \"Find air date for Episode 9 (row 8)\",\n    \"Episode 9 (row 8) has an air date of April 1, 2010.
