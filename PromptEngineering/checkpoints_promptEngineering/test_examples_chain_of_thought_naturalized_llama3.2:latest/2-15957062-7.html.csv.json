To verify this claim, find the row with ankaszk's data (since no cell contains \"anka sk\", I will look for rows where ankara is the home town).\n3. In that row, find the founded column to get the year the club was founded.\n4. If the club has been around since 1954 or earlier, then ankaszk is indeed the oldest club in Turkish ice hockey.\n\nNow let's evaluate each step with relevant table cells:\n\n\n1. Check if ankaszk has a valid claim about being the oldest club: No cell contains \"anka sk\", so I have to check rows where ankara is the home town.\n2. In that row, find the founded column to get the year the club was founded: \n- For Row 6: ankara is the home town, and founded = 1954. This could be a strong candidate for being the oldest club in Turkish ice hockey.\n- However, we should also verify this by checking if ankara has clubs that were founded after 1954 but have been active longer than ankaszk.\n\n3. Verify ankarsk's claim with the clubs founded later:\n- In Row 1: klub founded 2004 (after 1954) and has a rank of 3rd.\n- In Row 5: polis akademisi founded 1996 (between 1954 and 2004), but still after 1954.
