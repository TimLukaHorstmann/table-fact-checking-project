Locate the relevant data for 1984 and 1985 in the table:\n   - For 1984, the relevant cells are Row 9 (year=1984, entrant=barclay nordica arrows bmw) and Row 10 (year=1984, entrant=barclay nordica arrows bmw).\n   - For 1985, the relevant cell is Row 11 (year=1985, entrant=motor racing developments ltd).\n3. Extract the points scored in each year:\n   - In 1984, the points scored were 1 from both Rows 9 and 10.\n   - In 1985, the points scored were 5 from Row 11.\n4. Compare the points scored in 1985 with those in 1984:\n   - The difference between the points scored in 1985 (5) and 1984 (1) is 4.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nSince the difference in points scored between 1985 and 1984 matches the claim's assertion, the evaluation can proceed to determine if the claim is true or false based on this calculation.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The relevant data was located in Rows 9-11.

To find out if this adds up to 8 points, we add these together:\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on our calculation\nSince our calculation indicates that Marc Surer indeed scored a total of 8 points in both races of 1981 (which are Ensign and Theodore), we can say that the statement about scoring a total of 8 points in 2 races of 1981 is correct.\n\n#### Step 5: Format the answer according to the JSON format\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified the claim by adding the points scored by Ensign Racing and Theodore Racing Team for 1981.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim being made about Marc Surer's scores.\n2. The claim states that Marc Surer scored 4 points 1 time less than he scored 0 points.\n3. To evaluate this claim, we need to compare the number of times each score occurred.\n   a) We will count the number of times Marc Surer scored 4 points and the number of times he scored 0 points.\n   b) If he scored 4 points more often than 0 points, the claim would be false. \n   c) If he scored 4 points as many times as 0 points or fewer times, the claim could still be true depending on the frequency but based on the information given it will indicate a \"less\" scenario thus false\n4. To do this, we need to look at the columns of the table that show the number of times each score occurred. In this case, we are looking for data in the points column.\n5. We can find this data by selecting rows 8 and 10 (since row 9 is the same as row 10 and both have the same entries) because they both contain the scores we are interested in.\n\n6. For row 4: \"points: 4\"\n   a) This entry indicates that Marc Surer scored 4 points exactly one time.\n7. For row 8: \"points: 4\"\n   a) This entry also indicates that Marc Surer scored 4 points exactly once\n8. For row 10: \"points: 1\"\n   a) This entry indicates that Marc Surer scored 0 points exactly once\n9. Since we are comparing the number of times each score occurred, we can see that:\n   - The entry for row 8 contains an entry with \"4\" and another with \"0\", but because both have only one time.\n    however this still indicates a false statement based on the comparison.\n10. Based on our reasoning steps above, the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We looked at rows 8 and 10 in the points column of the table to determine how many times Marc Surer scored 4 and 0 points respectively which turned out equal with one each.

The relevant columns are \"year\", \"entrant\", and \"points\".\n2. **Find the relevant rows**: Since we're interested in 1981, we'll look for rows where the \"year\" column matches 1981.\n3. **Check the entrant**: We need to verify that Marc Surer is listed as the entrant for both races in 1981.\n4. **Verify points scores**: For each race in 1981, check if the points scored by Marc Surer are the same.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 3,\n    \"column_name\": \"points\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"entrant\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 4,\n    \"column_name\": \"points\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n- In row 3, Marc Surer's entrant is listed as \"ensign racing\", and he scored 4 points.\n- In row 4, Marc Surer's entrant is also listed as \"theodore racing team\", but the name is slightly different. This might be a typo or an error in the table.\n- Assuming this is an error, we'll focus on the first instance of Marc Surer's score in 1981.\n\nSince we can't verify the consistency of points scored by Marc Surer in both races due to the discrepancy in entrant names and potential errors, the claim cannot be definitively confirmed as TRUE or FALSE without further clarification.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. List the entrants for each year:\n   - 1979: team ensign\n   - 1980: team ats\n   - 1981: ensign racing, theoade racing team\n   - 1982: arrows racing team\n   - 1983: arrows racing team\n   - 1984: barclay nordica arrows bmw\n   - 1985: motor racing developments ltd\n   - 1986: barclay arrows bmw\n\n2. Identify the entrants for the year of interest (1982):\n   - arrows racing team, entries in two different chassis (a4 and a5)\n\n3. Find the points scored by each entry:\n   - Row 6: arrows racing team (chassis a4) with engine cosworth v8 scored points: 3\n   - Row 7: arrows racing team (chassis a5) with engine cosworth v8 scored points: 3\n\n4. Check if Marc Surer is in the list of entrants for 1982:\n   - No, there's no mention of Marc Surer\n\n5. Verify if any other driver on the table could have achieved the stated score (9 points):\n   - No other driver seems to have achieved a total score close to 9\n   - However, we should look at all entrants that scored in 1982.\n\n6. Review the results of each entry for 1982:\n   - We previously noted two entries: \n     - Row 6: arrows racing team (chassis a4) with engine cosworth v8 scored points: 3\n     - Row 7: arrows racing team (chassis a5) with engine cosworth v8 scored points: 3\n\n7. Check if the total score for any entry could add up to 9:\n   - No single driver's total seems to be close to 9.\n\n8. Look at other entries that have a possibility of achieving scores close to 9 in 1982.\n   - None are found.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"List the entrants for each year and mark those that participated in 1982\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identify the entrants for the year of interest (1982) and find the points scored by each entry\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Check if Marc Surer is in the list of entrants for 1982\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Verify if any other driver on the table could have achieved the stated score (9 points)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Review the results of each entry for 1982\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Check if the total score for any entry could add up to 9 \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Look at other entries that have a possibility of achieving scores close to 9 in 1982\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
