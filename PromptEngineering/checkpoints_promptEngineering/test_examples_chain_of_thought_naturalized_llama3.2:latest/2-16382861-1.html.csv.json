To determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to compare the enrollment of schools located in Newark, DE, with the enrollment of other schools.\n2. First, let's identify the school located in Newark, DE from the table. According to Row 1, the school \"University of Delaware\" meets this criterion.\n3. Next, we'll look at the enrollment of the University of Delaware, which is listed as 19067.\n4. Now, we need to find the school with the lowest enrollment that is not located in Newark, DE. To do this, we can compare the enrollments of schools in other locations with the enrollment of the University of Delaware.\n5. Looking at Row 2, we see that Lebanon Valley College has an enrollment of 2100, which is higher than the University of Delaware's enrollment.\n6. Similarly, examining Row 3 and Row 4 doesn't yield a school with a lower enrollment than the University of Delaware either.\n7. Moving on to Row 5, Stony Brook University has an enrollment of 23997, which is also higher than the University of Delaware's enrollment.\n8. For Row 6, West Chester University has an enrollment of 12800, which is less than the University of Delaware's enrollment.\n\nNow that we've identified a school with a lower enrollment (West Chester University), we can conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the enrollment of schools located in Newark, DE\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"Row 1\", \"Column: enrollment\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the school with the lowest enrollment that is not located in Newark, DE\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"Row 2\", \"Row 3\", \"Row 4\", \"Row 5\", \"Row 6\", \"Column: enrollment\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find a school with a lower enrollment than the University of Delaware\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"Row 6\", \"Column: enrollment\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"enrollment\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

To determine if the claim \"Lebanon Valley University be the most recent college to be found\" is true, we need to compare the 'founded' column of all the schools in the table.\n\n2. The 'founded' value of each school will help us identify the most recent one.\n\n3. We can start by looking at Lebanon Valley College, whose founded date is 1866.\n\n4. Next, let's look at University of Delaware, whose founded date is 1743.\n\n5. Comparing these two dates, we find that the university with the latest founded date has a more recent 'founded' year (which implies it was established more recently).\n\n6. However, we must examine all schools before declaring one as \"the most recent.\" So let's check University of Rhode Island (1892) and Rutgers University (1766). \n\n7. Comparing these two dates with the Lebanon Valley College date, we find that 1892 > 1866 and also greater than 1766. And since 1766 < 1866, then 1892 must be more recent.\n\n8. However, in order to check whether it is the most recent, we need to verify it against all schools.\n\n9. In addition to University of Rhode Island (1892), West Chester University was also found (1871) that was more recent than Rutgers University and Lebanon Valley College, but less recent than the University of Rhode Island.\n\n10. Lastly, Stony Brook University was not included in our examination because it has a founding date far later than 1957, whereas we were only looking for colleges founded after or equal to 1866.\n\n11.
