This means we need to find all the globular clusters in the table and compare their declinations with each other.\n\n2. Next, let's look at the table for globular clusters: Row 3 has a ngc number of 5466, object type as \"globular cluster\", constellation as \"bo\u00f6tes\", right ascension ( j2000 ) as \"14h05 m27.4s\" and declination ( j2000 ) as \"degree32\u203204\u2033\". Since there is only one entry for a globular cluster in the table, this row must correspond to the only globular cluster in the list.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second column: Row 1 has an object type of \"irregular galaxy\", not a globular cluster. So, it does not count towards our comparison.\n\n4. Next, let's look at the third column: Row 2 has an object type of \"spiral galaxy\", not a globular cluster. So, it does not count towards our comparison.\n\n5. Now, we need to compare the declination ( j2000 ) value in row 3 with the second highest declination value in the table that is from a global cluster or any other relevant cell. Since there is only one entry for a globular cluster and no other values are present in the table that could be considered as another \"global\" global cluster, we need to check if its value is greater than all other relevant declinations ( j2000 ). In this case, it's likely that \"degree32\u203204\u2033\"  is greater than any others.\n\n6. Now, let's look at column \"ngc number\": We can see that row 4 and row 5 also contain ngc numbers of 5474 and 5477 respectively which are greater than the ngc number of row 3 (5466). Thus, these two rows must correspond to objects with higher declinations ( j2000 ) in the table. \n\n7. Since there is only one entry for a globular cluster in the table, its declination value should be less than both 5474 and 5477.\n\n8.
