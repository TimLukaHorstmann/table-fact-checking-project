    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\nStep 1: Determine which rows fall under only the primary type of pollutant.\nTo do this, I will look for rows where the \"type\" column is \"primary\". If a row has only one type listed, it falls under only that type.\n\nStep 2: Check Row 6 - Type is \"primary\", so it's in question. According to the table, its averaging time is annual.\nSince the averaging time for primary pollutants typically refers to 1-year or less, and this averages over a year, I will assume this does indeed meet the criteria for only being under the primary type.\n\nStep 3: Check Row 7 - Type is \"primary\", so it's in question. According to the table, its averaging time is 1 hour.\nAccording to standard practices for evaluating pollutant averages by time period (typically hourly or daily), this appears to be a primary pollutant as well since its average duration falls under less than a year.\n\nStep 4: Check Row 8 - Type is \"primary\", so it's in question. According to the table, its averaging time is 8 hours.\nAlthough the time frame is longer than hourly or daily averages, this still appears to fall under only the primary type because of the specific averaging time given (i.e., not more than a year).\n\nStep 5: Check Row 11 - Type is \"primary and secondary\", so it's in question. According to the table, its averaging time is annual.\nAs mentioned earlier, according to standard practices for evaluating pollutant averages by time period, this appears to be only under the primary type because of the specific averaging time given (i.e., not more than a year).\n\nStep 6: Count how many rows meet the criteria from steps 2 through 5.\nBased on the analysis in those steps, the following three rows fall only under the primary type:\n- Row 6\n- Row 7\n- Row 8\n- Row 11\n\nTherefore, there are four rows that fall under only the primary type of pollutant.\n\nStep 7: Compare the number from step 6 to the statement in the claim.\nThe claim states that \"5 of the pollutant fall only under the primary type of pollutant\". Since we found four rows (Row 6 through Row 11) meeting this criterion, and not five as claimed, we can conclude that the claim is false.\n\nStep 8: List the relevant cells for reference.\nBased on our analysis in step 7, the following cells are relevant:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 6,\n    \"column_name\": \"type\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 7,\n    \"column_name\": \"type\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 8,\n    \"column_name\": \"type\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\": 11,\n    \"column_name\": \"type\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nHere's the output in the specified format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Determine which rows fall under only the primary type of pollutant.\",\n    \"Step 2: Check Row 6 - Type is 'primary', so it's in question.

Compare the standards for SO 2:\n   - The highest value between Row 7 (35ppm) and Row 8 (9ppm) is 35ppm.\n\n4. Determine if this claim is true or false based on the comparison:\n   - Since the highest standard value is 35 ppm, the claim that \"so 2 have the highest allowable standard at 35 ppm for a 1 - hour time\" is TRUE.\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. I will review each row in the table to identify the type of pollutant (primary or secondary) and check if the claim states there be only 3 pollutant in the chart that be classify as secondary pollutant.\n\n2. For Row 1, the pollutant is so 2 with a type of primary. This does not match the claim, which requires secondary pollutants, so I will move on to the next row.\n\n3. For Row 2, the pollutant is also so 2 but with a type of primary and standard 0.030 ppm (80 \u03bcg / m cubic). Again, this does not match the claim, which states that there be only 3 secondary pollutants, so I will continue.\n\n4. For Row 3, the pollutant is so 2 with a type of secondary. This matches part of the claim and will be counted as one of the required number of secondary pollutants.\n\n5. Moving on to Rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11: for each row, I check if pollutant is listed and the type as primary or secondary. If it is secondary, it should be counted towards the required number of secondary pollutants.\n\n   - Row 4 lists pm 10 with a type of primary and secondary (but only one standard given). This does not match the claim because at least one of those standards was primary.\n   \n   - Row 5 lists pm 2.5 with a type of secondary. This matches part of the claim.\n   \n   - Row 6 lists pm 2.5 with a type of primary, which doesn't fit the criteria in the claim statement.\n   \n   - Row 7 lists co with a type of primary, not matching what we are looking for (secondary).\n   \n   - Row 8 lists co with a type of primary, not matching what we are looking for (secondary).\n   \n   - Row 9 lists o 3 with a type of primary and secondary. This matches part of the claim.\n   \n   - Row 10 lists o 3 with a type of primary and secondary. This also matches part of the claim.\n   \n   - Row 11 lists no 2 with a type of primary and secondary, matching what we are looking for in the claim statement.\n\n6. Now I have checked all rows in the table to determine if there be only 3 pollutant in the chart that be classify as secondary pollutant.\n\n7. Since Rows 3, 5, 9, 10, and 11 match part of the claim (these five are the only secondary pollutants listed in the table), I can proceed with determining if all conditions were met based on the information in the table.\n\n8. Based on this analysis, since there are indeed exactly 5 rows that classify as a secondary pollutant as required by the statement, I will conclude:\n\n9. Finalize my reasoning process.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Review table to identify type of pollutant\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Row 1 does not match claim (primary)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Row 2 does not match claim (primary)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Row 3 matches part of the claim (secondary)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will be examined\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Continue examining Rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 for secondary pollutants\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Conclude based on analysis if claim is true or false\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
