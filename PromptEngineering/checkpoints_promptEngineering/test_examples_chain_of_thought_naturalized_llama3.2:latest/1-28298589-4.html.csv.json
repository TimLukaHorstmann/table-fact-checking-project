    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Extract the claim**: Understand what is being claimed, which is that the home team wins 5 out of the 7 games played on a specific day.\n\n2. **Review each row for relevant information**:\n   - For each game listed in the table, we need to check if it matches our claim.\n   - Specifically, we are interested in columns related to the outcome of the game and which team is at home (the 'home team' column).\n\n3. **Count the number of games won by the home team**:\n   - After examining each row of the table, count how many times the home team wins.\n\n4. **Compare the count with the claim**:\n   - If the home team wins 5 out of 7 games, our claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Continued\n\n- Looking at Row 1: The visiting team (WVU) is not at home, so this doesn't count towards our win total for the home team.\n  \n- In Row 2: The home team (Florida) loses to South Florida. This does not contribute to the home team's wins.\n\n- For Row 3: Cincinnati is the home team and beats Indiana State. That counts as one of their wins.\n\n- Similarly, in Row 4, Connecticut is the home team and wins against Texas Southern. This adds another win for the home team.\n\n- In Row 5, Pittsburgh is at home but loses to New Hampshire. Thus, this does not contribute to the count.\n\n- For Row 6, Louisville (the home team) beats Eastern Kentucky. That's yet another win for the home team.\n\n- Lastly, in Row 7, Washington is at home and wins against Syracuse. This completes a total of five wins for the home team.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven that we have identified five games where the home team won out of the seven listed on the day, our claim is true.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

Identify the relevant information in the table:\nThe claim mentions a game between Washington and Syracuse, so we need to find the rows related to these teams.\n\n2. Locate the row related to Washington's home game against Syracuse:\nWe can see that Row 7 has the following data: date: September 11, time: 7:00 pm, visiting team: Syracuse, home team: Washington, site: Husky Stadium Seattle, WA, broadcast: FSN Northwest, result: loss 20 - 41, attendance: 62418.\n\n3. Check if the attendance matches the claim:\nThe attendance in Row 7 is indeed 62418, which matches the claim.\n\n4. Evaluate the home team information:\nSince Washington is listed as the home team (not visiting), this supports the claim that it was a home game for Washington against Syracuse.\n\n5. Determine if the rest of the information in the claim is true based on Row 7:\nThe time and result also match the claim, but we only have one instance of a game meeting all three conditions specified by the claim.\n\n6. Combine our findings into a conclusion about the claim:\nBased on the fact that Washington played Syracuse at home with an attendance of 62418, and the rest of the information matching, we can say the claim is true.\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"home team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"time\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"broadcast\"}\n  ]\n}",
