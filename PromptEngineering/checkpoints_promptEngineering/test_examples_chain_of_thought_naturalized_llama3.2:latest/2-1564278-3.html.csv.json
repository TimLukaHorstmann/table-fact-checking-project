We then need to find out who the person is whose name appears in row 8 of the table under 'opponent in final'. \n5. Since we know from step 3 that Rik de Voest\u2019s opponent was not Alex Bogdanovic, we now look at Row 8 of the table and we see that rik de voest's actual opponent was actually Rik De Voest's actual opponent - \u201crik de voest\u2019s actual opponent\u201d - we must have made a mistake in interpreting our initial interpretation \u2013 actually it is indeed  Rik De Voest who lost to  his own opponent (not Alex Bogdanovic) that person is therefore indeed  \u201crik de voest\u2019s actual opponent\u201d as stated under \u201copponent in final\u201d  row 8 of the table.\n6.
