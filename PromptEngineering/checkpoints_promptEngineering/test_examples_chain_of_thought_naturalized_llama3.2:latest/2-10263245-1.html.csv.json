The cell containing this information is located in row 13 with column name \"opponent\" having value \"otis grant\", but we must verify that there's a corresponding entry for Librado Andrade being the winner.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify if Librado Andrade loses the fight against Mikkel Kessler\nNext, we compare the result of the fight between Librado Andrade and Mikkel Kessler. The cell containing this information is located in row 7 with column name \"opponent\" having value \"lucian bute\", however that's incorrect because it was against Lucian Bute, not Mikkel Kessler.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the correct opponent for Librado Andrade vs Mikkel Kessler\nIn order to verify if Librado Andrade wins or loses against Mikkel Kessler we need to look at row 11 of the table since that contains information about a loss by Mikkel kessler. We must check column name \"opponent\" because it is the value in the \"opponent\" cell, but again we will check this with another source.\n\n#### Step 5: Find correct source for Librado Andrade's fight against Mikkel Kessler\nGiven that information about a loss of Mikkel Kessler was found on row 11, and given that row 7 had an incorrect entry, we must search for the entry related to Librado Andrade vs. Mikkel Kessler in another place.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify if Librado Andrade wins the fight against Otis Grant\nWe check column \"result\" of row 13 because it contains information about whether the person with that name was the winner or not.\n\n#### Step 7: Verify if Librado Andrade loses the fight against Mikkel Kessler\nNow we look in the correct cell that contains this type of information for Librado Andrade and Mikkel Kessler. The relevant value must be found on a row that is consistent with one person having won, while another has lost.\n\n#### Step 8: List our results\nBased on our analysis:\n- In order to determine if Librado Andrade beats Otis Grant we look at column \"result\" in row 13.\n- To verify whether or not he loses against Mikkel Kessler we need the correct cell from the table as explained before.\n\n\n#### Step 9: Finalize answer\nAfter comparing values, we can now conclude our answers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify relevant cells for Librado Andrade's fights against Otis Grant and Mikkel Kessler\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Verify if Librado Andrade wins the fight against Otis Grant\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 13,\n        \"column_name\": \"result\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Incorrect cell for finding Mikkel Kessler information.

For our purposes here, this does not change the fact that Librado Andrade lost.\n\n#### Step 5: Find the relevant cell(s) for the second part of the claim (\"Librado Andrade lose\")\nWe need to find the row with \"result\" equal to \"loss\" for Librado Andrade. Looking at rows 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, and others will help identify other losses.\n\n#### Step 6: Extract the relevant data from the cells\nRow 2:\n- Result: win\n\nRow 3:\n- Result: loss\n\nRow 5 (already analyzed in step 3):\n\nRow 7 (already analyzed in step 3):\n\nRow 9:\n- Result: win\n\nRow 10:\n- Result: win\n\nRows like 11, 12... will contain wins for Librado Andrade.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine if Librado Andrade lost any other fights\nAfter examining rows 2 through 10 and beyond, we find that the only loss for Librado Andrade is in row 3.\n\n#### Step 8: Conclusion on the first part of the claim (\"the match against Lucian Bute\")\nGiven that both rows 5 and 7 contain a result of \"loss\" when facing Lucian Bute, this supports the claim.\n\n#### Step 9: Conclusion on the second part of the claim (\"Librado Andrade lose\")\nSince only row 3 has a loss for Librado Andrade, not all claims in the statement hold true as written.\n\n#### Step 10: Determine if the entire claim is valid\nBecause one part of the claim (the match against Lucian Bute) holds and another part (all other fights that Librado Andrade lost) does not hold entirely true, we cannot conclude the entire claim without error.\n\n#### Step 11: Create JSON object for the final answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Find the match against Lucian Bute\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Extract data from rows 5 and 7\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if Librado Andrade lost to Lucian Bute\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Find other losses for Librado Andrade\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Extract data from rows with wins and others\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if Librado Andrade lost any other fights\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion on the second part of the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 9,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion on the first part of the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 10,\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the entire claim is valid\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"Result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Type\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON object describes the step-by-step reasoning process for evaluating the given claim, including which cells contain relevant data and what conclusions were drawn from this data.",

This means we need to check if Librado Andrade has won every fight he has had against Paul Jones.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Data in the Table\nTo verify this claim, we need to find data about Librado Andrade vs. Paul Jones in the table. However, since there is no direct entry for \"Paul Jones\" as an opponent, we should look for entries where Paul Jones could be a potential opponent and see if Librado Andrade won.\n\n### Step 3: Find Potential Matches\nGiven the information available, we are looking for instances where Librado Andrade's opponent matches or is very close to matching \"Paul Jones\" in either spelling or known full name. One such instance could potentially be Paul Jones (since it seems likely he'd be spelled as 'Jones' in a context like this), but since there isn't an exact match, we must consider if any data implies Paul Jones.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Data for Relevant Entries\nUpon reviewing the table, there is no direct entry that explicitly names \"Paul Jones\" as Librado Andrade's opponent. However, one possible candidate could be George Jones or another variation of a name close to 'Jones'. But without an exact match in row numbers and dates, this becomes speculative.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nGiven the lack of explicit information about Paul Jones being a direct opponent of Librado Andrade and without any matching rows that clearly state \"Paul Jones\" as the opponent for Librado Andrade, we cannot definitively conclude that Librado Andrade won all his fights against Paul Jones based on the provided table data.\n\n### JSON Output\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\",\n      \"info\": \"The claim is 'Librado Andrade win all his fight against Paul Jones'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate relevant data in the table\",\n      \"info\": \"Looking for Librado Andrade vs. Paul Jones, but no direct match found\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Consider potential matches\",\n      \"info\": \"No exact spelling of 'Paul Jones', consider variations like George Jones or other names close to 'Jones'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze data for relevant entries\",\n      \"info\": \"No clear match with Paul Jones as opponent, no direct evidence to support the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on analysis\",\n      \"info\": \"Cannot confirm Librado Andrade won all fights against a known 'Paul Jones'\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, we need to check if there are any fights listed for both Librado Andrade and Terry Smith in the table.\n3. Looking at rows 32 and 33 of the table, we see that Terry Smith has a win against Paul Jones (row 33) with no recorded fight before Marcus Harvey (row 31).\n4. We also see that Librado Andrade has a win against George Johnson (row 34) with no recorded fight before Marcus Harvey (row 31), and a loss against Lucian Bute (row 5) before his fight with Vitali Tsypko (row 6), but there is no connection to Terry Smith.\n5. However, looking at row 32, it shows that Librado Andrade's opponent in the fight was actually George Johnson not Terry Smith, but in another entry of the table we see that in row 35 Terry smith has a win against Marcus Harvey\n6. Since row 32 shows that Librado Andrade had a fight with George Johnson before his fight with Vitali Tsypko, and there are no other fights with Terry Smith prior to his fight with Marcus harvey, then the claim \"librado andrade have a fight with terry smith before the fight with marcus harvey\" is True.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"The claim is about a fight between Librado Andrade and Terry Smith before the fight between Marcus Harvey.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"To verify this, we need to check if there are any fights listed for both Librado Andrade and Terry Smith in the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Looking at rows 32 and 33 of the table, we see that Terry Smith has a win against Paul Jones (row 33) with no recorded fight before Marcus Harvey (row 31).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"We also see that Librado Andrade has a win against George Johnson (row 34) with no recorded fight before Marcus Harvey (row 31), and a loss against Lucian Bute (row 5) before his fight with Vitali Tsypko (row 6), but there is no connection to Terry Smith.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"However, looking at row 35 of the table we see that Librado Andrade had a loss against Marcus harvey.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"Since row 32 shows that Librado Andrade had a fight with George Johnson before his fight with Vitali Tsypko, and there are no other fights with Terry Smith prior to his fight with Marcus harvey, then the claim \\\"librado andrade have a fight with terry smith before the fight with marcus harvey\\\" is True.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 32,\n      \"column_name\": \"row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 33,\n      \"column_name\": \"row\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
