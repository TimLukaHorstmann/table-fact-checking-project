However, the correct cell is for Pentium III 1000 with a frequency of 1 GHz. Since 1000 is not the same as 850, we will use the closest one which is Pentium III 933 with a frequency of 933 MHz.\n   - Pentium III 800 EB has a frequency of 1 GHz.\n\n2. Find the average of these two frequencies.\n   Average = (Frequency of Pentium III 933 / 10) + (Frequency of Pentium III 1000)\n\n3. Plug in the numbers and calculate the average.\n   Average = (933/10) + 1000\n\n4. Calculate each fraction separately\n   - 933 divided by 10 is 93.3\n\n5.
