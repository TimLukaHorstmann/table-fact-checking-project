Our claim focuses on comparing attendance between two specific weeks:\n   - Week 1: week=1, row_index = 1\n   - Week 2: week=2, row_index = 2\n\n3. To verify the claim, we need to check if the attendance in Week 2 is indeed more than the attendance in Week 1.\n\n4. Let's compare attendance for both weeks:\n   - Attendance in Week 1: 44773\n   - Attendance in Week 2: 46460\n\n5.

The relevant cells for each week are:\n- Row 1: { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 44773\n- Row 2: { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 46460\n- Row 3: { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 59983\n- Row 4: { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 80291\n- Row 5: { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 47583\n- Row 6: { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 46751\n- Row 8: { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 56191\n- Row 9: { \"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 52060\n- Row 10: { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 46264\n- Row 11: { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 46032\n- Row 12: { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 47234\n- Row 13: { \"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 30936\n- Row 14: { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 65649\n- Row 15: { \"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 42202\n- Row 16: { \"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" } = 51064\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the claim's validity\nFrom our comparison of all weeks, we can see that week 14 has an attendance greater than week 7 (65649 vs. 44487). So, there is another team with higher attendance in another week.\n\n#### Step 5: Create final answer\nBased on our comparison, the claim \"the highest number of crowd attend be in week 7\" is FALSE because we found that week 14 had a higher attendance than week 7.\n\nHere's the output as required:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Analyzing claim statement\",\n    \"Comparing with other weeks' attendance\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\" }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's identify the data we need to analyze: attendance at week 13.\n\n2. We know from the table that week 13 occurred on November 30, 1980, with an opponent of New Orleans Saints and a result of w 23 - 20.\n\n3. Next, we will check which row contains this information: Row 13 in our naturalized format matches these details.\n\n4. Since we know that the attendance was 30936 for week 13, we can see if there's any other row with a higher attendance than this:\n\nRow 1 has an attendance of 44773 and is from Week 1.\n\nRow 2 also contains data in its relevant columns with an attendance of 46460 and occurs during Week 2.\n\nRow 3 shows data for Week 3, which features an attendance of 59983.\n\nRow 4 presents information about Week 4 with an attendance of 80291.\n\nRow 5 has data from Week 5 but contains lower attendance than Row 4 (47583).\n\nRow 6 features Week 6's attendance as 46751.\n\nRow 7 provides Week 7's attendance, which is less than Row 3's (44487).\n\nRow 8 presents information about Week 8 with an attendance of 56191.\n\nRow 9 contains data from Week 9 and has an attendance higher than both Rows 6 and 7 but lower than Row 4's (52060).\n\nRow 10 features data for Week 10, which includes a significantly higher attendance than Rows 1 through 3 and even higher than Rows 5 through 8 (46264).\n\nRow 11 contains details of Week 11 with an attendance less than Rows 9 and 10 but higher than Rows 6 through 8 (46032).\n\nRow 12 has data for Week 12, which includes a lower attendance than Row 4's (47234).\n\nRow 13 presents the data for Week 13, featuring the lowest attendance of all rows at 30936.\n\nRow 14 contains information from Week 14 with an attendance much greater than Rows 1-3 and even greater than Rows 9 through 12. (65649)\n\nRow 15 shows details from Week 15, featuring lower attendance compared to Row 4 but higher than most of the preceding rows (42202).\n\nRow 16 contains data for Week 16 with an attendance less than both Row 10's and Row 14's (51064).\n\n\n5.
