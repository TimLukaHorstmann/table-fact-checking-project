The relevant column names are:\n- Manufacturing: \"industry: manufacturing\"\n- Facility Management: \"industry: facility management\"\n\n### Step 2: Extract data for both industries\nWe need to extract the employee count values for both the manufacturing and facility management industries.\n\n#### Industry - Manufacturing\nThe company in the manufacturing industry has a reference date of 2011 with an employee count of 52916.\n\n#### Industry - Facility Management\nThe company in the facility management industry has a reference date of 2011 with an employee count of 534500.\n\n### Step 3: Determine which company is larger in each industry\nBy comparing the employee counts for both industries:\n- The company in the manufacturing industry (electrolux) has fewer employees than the company in the facility management industry (iss).\n- Therefore, it's not true that the company in the manufacturing industry be larger.\n\n### Step 4: Create the JSON output\nBased on our analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Identify relevant columns and their corresponding values.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Extract employee count for both industries\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Determine which company is larger in each industry by comparing the counts\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": \"Conclusion: it's not true that the company in the manufacturing industry be larger.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 8,\n            \"column_name\": \"employees\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 1,\n            \"column_name\": \"employees\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
