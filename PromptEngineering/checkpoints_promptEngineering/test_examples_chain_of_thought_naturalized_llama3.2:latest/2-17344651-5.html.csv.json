Since it\u2019s given that there were only five games played before Dec 2, if Boston Celtics play a sixth game after these, it must be against Cleveland Cavaliers.\n   In row 2, opponent of the Boston Celtics' game on Dec 2 is indeed \"cleveland cavaliers\".\n\n5.

    "resp": "### Step 1: Analyze the claim\nWe need to check if the Boston Celtics had the largest lose margin of 25 points in December, which occurred on December 30.\n\n### Step 2: Find the largest lose margin in December for the Boston Celtics\nTo do this, we will look at each game played by the Boston Celtics in December and find the largest difference between their score and the opposing team's score.\n\n### Step 3: Look up the relevant rows in the table\nFor row 18 (game: 32, date: sun dec 30), opponent: milwaukee bucks, score: 98 - 114. Since this is a loss for Boston Celtics, we will subtract their score from the opposing team's score.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with other games\nWe need to check if any other game has a larger difference in December.\n\n### Step 5: Look up row 11 (game: 25)\nFor row 11 (game: 25, date: tue dec 18), opponent: new york knicks, score: 126 - 108. The difference is 18 points, which is smaller than the 16 point difference in row 18.\n\n### Step 6: Check if any other game has a larger difference\nWe will look up other rows to see if there's a larger difference.\n\n### Step 7: Look up row 12 (game: 26)\nFor row 12 (game: 26, date: wed dec 19), opponent: milwaukee bucks, score: 92 - 107. The difference is 15 points, which is smaller than the 16 point difference in row 18.\n\n### Step 8: Look up row 13 (game: 27)\nFor row 13 (game: 27, date: fri dec 21), opponent: indiana pacers, score: 117 - 107. The difference is 10 points, which is smaller than the 16 point difference in row 18.\n\n### Step 9: Look up row 14 (game: 28)\nFor row 14 (game: 28, date: sat dec 22), opponent: chicago bulls, score: 85 - 110. The difference is 25 points, which is the same as the claim.\n\n### Step 10: Compare with other games\nWe have found one game that has a larger difference than row 18.\n\n### Step 11: Conclusion\nThe claim that \"boston celtic largest lose margin in december be 25 point , and it happen on dec 30\" is FALSE because there's another game (row 14) with the same 25-point loss margin, which occurred before December 30.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Analyze the claim; Find the largest lose margin in December for the Boston Celtics; Look up the relevant rows in the table; Compare with other games; Look up row 11 and 12; Check if any other game has a larger difference; Look up row 13 and 14; Conclusion: The claim is FALSE because there's another game with the same 25-point loss margin, which occurred before December 30.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to check if there are any games played by the Celtics on a Thursday in December.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there are multiple games for different dates, but only one date is mentioned: \"tue dec 11\" (game 21), where the Celtics play the New Jersey Nets.\n\n3. Additionally, another game is listed as taking place on \"wed dec 26\" with no date mentioned being correct to match the day of the week given by the initial question, so we need to take a look at \"sun dec 30\", however this has 'Milwaukee Bucks' which isn't relevant to our search.\n\n4. Now that we have identified two games played on Thursdays in December (one on tue dec 11 and one on sun dec 30) the first one for us does not show as having a date beginning with 'thu', so now looking at the second game, if it does indeed match the statement then we need to see how many of those games the team lost.\n\n5. Looking at \"sun dec 30\", we can see that the Celtics lose to the Milwaukee Bucks with a score of 98 - 114.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"1: The claim is about the celtic only playing 1 game on a thursday in december and losing\"},\n    {\"step\": \"2: There are multiple games played by the Celtics on a Thursday in December, but only one date is mentioned\"},\n    {\"step\": \"3: Looking at the table, we can see that there is another game that takes place on 'wed dec 26'\"},\n    {\"step\": \"4: Now that we have identified two games played on Thursdays in December (one on tue dec 11 and one on sun dec 30) we need to check how many of those games the team lost\"},\n    {\"step\": \"5: Looking at \\\"sun dec 30\\\", we can see that the Celtics lose to the Milwaukee Bucks with a score of 98 - 114\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"game\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
