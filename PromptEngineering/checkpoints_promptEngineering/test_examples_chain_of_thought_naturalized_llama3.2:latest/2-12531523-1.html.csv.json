To determine the truth of the statement, we will check how many wins does Zach Johnson have as per given data.\n4. **Compare Zach's wins with Phil Mickelson**: As mentioned earlier, since Zach only has 1 win according to table, which is lower than Phil's \"2\" claimed in the statement, it means that Phil Mickelson indeed won more times than Zach.\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison, we conclude that the claim is True.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Count the number of rows where the country is \"united states\" (the location of the tournament) and the total is a whole number (indicating a win).\n3. Check if the count from step 2 is equal to 3.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n- First, we need to identify which columns contain the information relevant to our claim. The country column tells us where each player won, and the total column shows the total score of each player.\n- Next, we will look for rows in the table where the country is \"united states\" (which corresponds to row index 1 and row index 5), and the total is a whole number (indicating a win).\n- Finally, we compare this count with the target value (3) in our claim.\n\nLet's list out all relevant cells that correspond to these conditions:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"country\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"country\"}\n]\n```\n\nNow we know how many players from the United States have won The Masters. Let's find out if this number is equal to 3.\n\nLooking at row index 1 and row index 5, we can see that these rows correspond to Tiger Woods (won in 1997, 2001, and 2002) and Zach Johnson (won in 2007). Both of them are from the United States.

Since Sandy Lyle had a higher total (302) than Vijay Singh (289), we can subtract Vijay Singh's total from Sandy Lyle's total:\n- Difference = 302 - 289 = 13\n\n#### Step 4: Compare the calculated difference with the claim statement\nThe difference between Sandy Lyle and Vijay Singh is indeed 13, which matches the claim. However, we need to check if Vijay Singh has a final total win that corresponds to this score.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze Vijay Singh's finish position\nSince Vijay Singh finished in a tie for 14th place (t14), it means he did not have the lowest score among all players. Therefore, it is unlikely that he achieved a final total win of 13 under Sandy Lyle's score.\n\n#### Step 6: Draw conclusions based on analysis\nAlthough the difference between their scores matches the claim, we cannot confirm that Vijay Singh had a final total win with a score 13 under Sandy Lyle's score due to his tie finish position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Analyze the claim statement\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Extract relevant information from the table\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Calculate the difference between Vijay Singh and Sandy Lyle's scores\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Compare the calculated difference with the claim statement\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Analyze Vijay Singh's finish position\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"total\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"total\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote: The claim is FALSE because Vijay Singh did not achieve a final total win with a score 13 under Sandy Lyle's score due to his tie finish position.",

According to row 3, Vijay Singh's total is 289.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": 1,\n            \"text\": \"Find Vijay Singh's total score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 2,\n            \"text\": \"Vijay Singh's total score is 289\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nStep 2: \nNext, I need to find Sandy Lyle's final score from the table. According to row 7, Sandy Lyle's total is 302.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": 1,\n            \"text\": \"Find Vijay Singh's total score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 2,\n            \"text\": \"Vijay Singh's total score is 289\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 3,\n            \"text\": \"Find Sandy Lyle's total score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 4,\n            \"text\": \"Sandy Lyle's total score is 302\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nStep 3: \nNow, I need to compare Vijay Singh's final score with Sandy Lyle's final score. Since 289 is less than 10 and also less than 302, the claim that Vijay Singh has a final score that is less than 10 under the score of Sandy Lyle can be evaluated.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step\": 1,\n            \"text\": \"Find Vijay Singh's total score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 2,\n            \"text\": \"Vijay Singh's total score is 289\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 3,\n            \"text\": \"Find Sandy Lyle's total score\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 4,\n            \"text\": \"Sandy Lyle's total score is 302\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 5,\n            \"text\": \"Compare Vijay Singh's and Sandy Lyle's scores\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step\": 6,\n            \"text\": \"Vijay Singh's final score (289) is less than 10 under the score of Sandy Lyle(302)\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 3,\n            \"column_name\": \"total\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 7,\n            \"column_name\": \"total\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",
