    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states that when the score of the first leg is 1 - 2, the club is Paok FC in the 2011 - 12 Uefa Europa League.\n2. We need to find all occurrences of a score of 1 - 2 in the table and check if Paok FC is the corresponding club.\n\n#### Relevant Cell Search:\n\n- First, we search for rows where the score is 1 - 2:\n  - Row 30: season: 2011 - 12 uefa europa league, competition: uefa europa league, round: group stages, club: paok fc, 1st leg: 1 - 2\n  - Row 31: season: 2011 - 12 uefa europa league, competition: uefa europa league, round: group stages, club: paok fc, 1st leg: 1 - 3\n\n- Next, we check the clubs for these rows:\n  - In row 30, Paok FC is indeed the club.\n  - However, in row 31, the club is not Paok FC; it's actually Rubin Kazan.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nSince there's only one occurrence of a score of 1 - 2 and its corresponding club does not match the claim (Paok FC), the claim cannot be true based on this single instance. However, since we've confirmed that Paok FC is indeed associated with a score of 1 - 2 in row 30 but not in row 31, it indicates that at least one scenario where the claim can be true exists.\n\nHowever, strictly following instructions for the JSON output requested:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"club\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 30,\n      \"column_name\": \"club\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 31,\n      \"column_name\": \"club\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Since there were no other scores greater than this in the same row, we can conclude that the largest first leg score of 0 - 7 is for team G\u00f3rnik Zabrze in the 1994 - 95 season.\n\nSo, the claim \"the largest first leg be 0 - 7 for team g\u00f3rnik zabrze in the 1994 - 95 season\" was supported by data.",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. Check if Juve had a 0-1 result in the first leg of their 2010-11 Europa League match.\n   - Look at row 24: season: 2010 - 11 uefa europa league, competition: uefa europa league, round: third qualifying round, club: juventus fc, 1st leg: 0 - 1\n   - The claim that in the 2010-11 uefa europa league season Juventus FC have a 1st leg of 0 - 1 is correct.\n\n2. Check if Flora Tallinn had a 1-0 result in the first leg of their 2011-12 Europa League match.\n   - Look at row 25: season: 2011 - 12 uefa europa league, competition: uefa europa league, round: second qualifying round, club: fc flora tallinn, 1st leg: 1 - 0\n   - The claim that in the 2011-12 uefa europa league season FC Flora Tallinn have a 1st leg of 1 - 0 is correct.\n\n3. Now we can conclude if the chain of thoughts has shown us anything about the claim's validity.\n   - Since both Juventus and Flora Tallinn had results matching the first part of their respective claims, it means that they indeed did have this result in their respective seasons.\n\n4. Check how many times these results are stated to see if the statement is fully accurate.\n   - Row 24 has the same information as our claim about Juventus FC while row 25 also matches Flora Tallinn's result but states 1-0 which is not exactly the same as our first leg record of \"1 - 0\". Hence, even though it does state the correct score, we need to look at another season's match for this information.\n\n5. Look for any other relevant information that could potentially affect the claim.\n   - After reviewing all rows, there is no conflicting information about either Juventus FC or Flora Tallinn having a first leg of 0-1 in the respective seasons given.\n\n6. Decide if the chain of thoughts has shown us anything about the claim's validity.\n   - Since both Juventus and Flora Tallinn had results matching the first part of their respective claims, we can determine that the statement is only partially true because it does not include the second leg result.\n\n7. Check how many times this information would be needed to know if either club won or lost in that season's Europa League.\n   - In order to truly verify the claim as stated, one needs both the first and second leg results for each club given since their winning or losing in the league depends on these two numbers.\n\n8. Look at all other relevant information again for any new clues about how many times you need to look at a team's results.\n   - Upon reviewing all rows once more, we can conclude that we don't have enough information about either club's second leg result in order to verify the claim as stated because there is no cell with the second leg of either Juventus FC or Flora Tallinn.\n\n9. Decide if this chain of thoughts has shown us anything about the claim's validity.\n   - Since the statement only partially matches what we can see from our chain of thought, we cannot conclude that it is true; instead, we can say it is not fully accurate because it does not include all relevant information.\n\n10. Check if there is any possible interpretation for what \"the 2010-11 uefa europa league season\" means in the context of this claim.\n    - The statement likely only refers to the regular season part of that Europa League competition (excluding playoffs and finals) because those are often used as separate entities.\n\n11. Decide if there is any other interpretation for what \"the 2011-12 uefa europa league season\" means in the context of this claim.\n    - The statement likely also refers to only the regular season part of that Europa League competition (excluding playoffs and finals) because those are often used as separate entities.\n\n12. Decide if there is any other interpretation for what \"the 2010-11 uefa europa league season\" or \"the 2011-12 uefa europa league season\" means in the context of this claim.\n    - There does not appear to be any other interpretation given that each club's match results are clearly listed in their respective seasons.\n\n13. Decide if there is any information that could have changed your decision about what \"the 2010-11 uefa europa league season\" or \"the 2011-12 uefa europa league season\" means.\n    - We can't think of anything that would change our interpretation of either term as used in this claim.\n\n14.

This requires verifying if Paok FC participated in the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League.\n\n### Step 2: Locate Relevant Cells in the Table\nTo verify, we need to check cells related to Paok FC's participation in the 2011-12 season of the European competition that matches the claim. Specifically, we're looking for any mention of a match in the \"UEFA Europa League\" where Paok FC is both the home and away team.\n\n### Step 3: Examine Matches Involving Paok FC\nWe'll check each relevant row in the table to see if it mentions a match involving Paok FC, specifically during the 2011-12 season of the UEFA Europa League. This involves checking:\n- The competition name for matches involving Paok FC.\n- Whether the match is part of the \"Europa League\" or another European competition.\n- That Paok FC appears as either the home team (in the first leg) or the away team (in the second leg).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Specific Matches\nWe will analyze each relevant match to confirm if:\n1. The competition is indeed the UEFA Europa League for that season.\n2. Paok FC participated in at least one of the matches.\n\nGiven the specific request, we'll focus on any row where \"paok fc\" appears in both a 1st leg and potentially a second leg of a match involving Paok FC in the \"UEFA Europa League\" or similar competition. Since there's no explicit distinction between European leagues in our table structure beyond competitions, we will primarily look for matches with \"Europa League\".\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate Evidence\n- If any row shows Paok FC as either the home team in the first leg or the away team in the second leg of a match labeled as \"UEFA Europa League\" during the 2011-12 season, we have evidence that contradicts the claim.\n- The absence of such matches would support the claim.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nAfter evaluating relevant cells and specific matches involving Paok FC in the UEFA Europa League for the 2011-12 season, if there's at least one match found where Paok FC played, then the claim is False. If no such matches are found, then the claim would be True.\n\n### Output JSON\n\nGiven this logical process without direct reference to a specific row or cell due to the format constraints, we deduce:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step through table to find Paok FC in 2011-12 Europa League.

This doesn't mean there isn't a record of such a match; it just means our table lacks specific details on this occasion.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclude based on the available information\nSince there's no explicit evidence against our claim within the provided table (i.e., at least one team did not score more than 6 goals in the first leg in the 1994-95 season), we must conclude that:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"text\": \"Claim needs to be analyzed from given table\"},\n    {\"text\": \"Locate relevant row(s) for 1994-95 season within UEFA Cup\"},\n    {\"text\": \"Row 18 corresponds to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze vs. an unspecified opponent in the preliminary round of the 1994-95 UEFA Cup\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Club\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nThe final answer is: {\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"text\": \"Claim needs to be analyzed from given table\"},\n    {\"text\": \"Locate relevant row(s) for 1994-95 season within UEFA Cup\"},\n    {\"text\": \"Row 18 corresponds to G\u00f3rnik Zabrze vs. an unspecified opponent in the preliminary round of the 1994-95 UEFA Cup\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"Club\"}\n  ]\n}",

However, their first leg matches are not described as being tied.\n\n#### Step 4: Look for other potential matches where the first and second round tie in the first leg\nExamining row 21, we find another match from 2003 (Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC) that could potentially be a tie. However, this does not explicitly state that it is a first/second round tie.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if there are any other relevant matches to consider\nChecking the rest of rows, we don't find any additional information about a UEFA Intertoto Cup match in 2003 where the first and second rounds were tied in the first leg.\n\n#### Chain of Thought:\n- The problem asks for evidence that in 2003 at the UEFA Intertoto Cup the first and second round be tie in the first leg.\n- Row 21 contains information about Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC, but only one match is described (not two rounds).\n- There's a possible match between Odra Wodzis\u0142aw and Juventus FC, however, there is no evidence of it being both the first and second round.\n- Further investigation reveals that this claim might be true for another year or competition.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 21, \"column_name\": \"Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 22, \"column_name\": \"Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"Odra Wodzis\u0142aw vs Juventus FC\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim:** The claim is about Celtic FC and AC Omonia never having a first leg of 0 - 1 in any UEFA competition.\n2. **Locate relevant data:**\n   - Look up the table for both clubs (Celtic and AC Omonia) under different competitions and seasons to find records of their matches.\n3.  Search through the table's rows (specifically looking at \"season\" and \"competition\") to identify any instances where one of these teams has had a first leg with Celtic FC against AC Omonia being either win or loss, but specifically focusing on match outcomes that resulted in a score of 0 - 1.\n4. Check the table data under all the mentioned competitions, including but not limited to uefa cup winners' cup, uefa cup, european cup and so forth.\n5. Extract relevant information from these rows about Celtic FC vs AC Omonia for their first leg outcomes in various seasons.\n\n#### Relevant Data Identification:\n- For each club (Celtic and AC Omonia), find any matches where one team was playing the other under the same competition but with different teams being on the same side of the scoreline as 0 -1.\n\n- Specifically check rows like Row 16, Row 17, Row 32 for both clubs in their respective competitions to determine if either of them has played AC Omonia and scored a goal (i.e., Celtic vs AC Omonia) in which case we need to verify that this match had an outcome such as the first leg was one where neither team scored any goals; therefore, no first leg score was 0 -1.\n\n- Verify if there is any other season, competition, or even a different team playing against AC Omonia in Celtic's name but still with the desired outcome to be recorded correctly for our claim.\n\n\n\n#### Claim Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: The claim that 'celtic and omonia never have a first leg of 0 - 1' needs to be verified through analysis of data.\",\n    \"Step 2: Locate relevant data from table about Celtic FC vs AC Omonia matches, focusing on seasons and competitions with the desired outcome for 0-1 result in that match.\",\n    \"Step 3: Verify if there are any records where one team scores a goal and the other doesn't during their respective first legs.\",\n    \"Step 4: Compare data about Celtic FC's vs AC Omonia's matches from different competitions and seasons to confirm the claim.\",\n    \"Conclusion: Based on review of all available information, verify or falsify claim.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 16, \"column_name\": \"Celtic FC vs AC Omonia\", \"cell_value\": \"0-1\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 17, \"column_name\": \"AC Omonia vs Celtic FC\", \"cell_value\": \"0-1\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
