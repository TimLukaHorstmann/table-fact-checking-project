    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. The claim states that the table shows game vs different team show score on different location.\n2. We need to check if the table indeed displays scores for games against different teams at various locations (home, away, neutral).\n3. First, we examine each row of the table and its corresponding \"opponent's venue\" column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued)\n\n4. Row 1: \"texas vs: baylor\", \"opponent's venue\": ut , 22 - 13.\n   - The score is displayed as a home team advantage, which doesn't necessarily show the location of the game.\n5. Row 2: \" texas vs: colorado\", \"opponent's venue\": ut , 6 - 2.\n   - Same issue, it appears that scores are only showing the home or away status but not explicitly stating if a score was obtained at home, away or neutral.\n6. The same can be said for other rows, such as Row 3: \" texas vs: iowa state\", \"opponent's venue\": isu , 5 - 2 and Row 4: \"texas vs: kansas\", \"opponent's venue\": tied , 4 - 4.\n7. Looking at the table, we see that none of the scores explicitly mention whether they were obtained from home, away or neutral grounds.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued)\n\n8.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant columns**: To determine if the current streak of l 2 is indeed the score with Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State, we need to look at the columns that contain these teams' names.\n\n   - The column for Baylor's name starts from row 1, column \"vs\" with the text \"baylor\".\n   - The column for Iowa State's name starts from row 3, column \"vs\" with the text \"iowa state\".\n   - The column for Nebraska's name starts from row 7, column \"vs\" with the text \"nebraska\".\n   - The column for Oklahoma State's name starts from row 9, column \"vs\" with the text \"oklahoma state\".\n\n2. **Verify if the streak is mentioned in each of these columns**: Since we need to confirm that the current streak of l 2 specifically refers to Baylor, Iowa State, Nebraska, and Oklahoma State, we should check if there are any mentions of a score (the number after 'l') other than 'l' or another value for these teams. The text in each relevant column contains the name of the team followed by its win-loss record against Texas.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the streak is directly associated with Baylor's, Iowa State's, Nebraska's, and Oklahoma State's columns without any mention of a score other than 'l', we can confirm that the current streak of l 2 indeed refers to these teams' scores against Texas.\n\n4. **Output in JSON format**:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant columns (baylor, iowa state, nebraska, oklahoma state), verified if the streak is mentioned in each of these columns without any other score information, thus confirming the claim.\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"vs\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"vs\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"vs\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"vs\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The final answer is TRUE.",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the claim to be verified\nThe claim states that, in the last 10 meetings, the score was tie (5-5) 4 times and 2 times at UT's venue (8-2).\n\n### Step 2: Locate the relevant cells in the table\nTo verify this claim, we need to find the rows for each of these scores in the table. We will then check if the conditions specified by the claim are met.\n\n### Step 3: Check the condition for \"tie, 5 - 5\" in the last 10 meetings\nWe look for a row where the overall record shows \"ut\", and there is an entry in the \"last 10 meetings\" column indicating a tie (5-5).\n\n### Step 4: Search for rows matching the \"tie, 5 - 5\" condition\nIn Row 3, we see that under \"last 10 meetings,\" it says \"tied, 5 - 5,\" which meets part of the claim. However, there is no row that shows this tie in both overall record as \"ut\" and at a neutral site, which seems to be part of the claim's requirements.\n\n### Step 5: Check the condition for \"2 time at UT, 8 - 2\"\nWe need to find rows where the venue is listed as \"UT\" and the score is \"8-2\". There are multiple instances of this in different rows (Row 7, Row 10), but we must ensure it aligns with the claim's exact wording.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze the row matching \"2 time at UT, 8 - 2\"\nRow 7 has \"ut , 3 - 2\", which does not match. However, Row 10 has \"a&m , 4 - 1\", which doesn't fit directly but shows instances of UT with that score in other rows.\n\n### Step 7: Re-evaluate the claim based on found matches\nGiven that there is at least one instance where the conditions are met (\"tied, 5 - 5\") and considering there might be confusion in the direct match for \"2 time at UT, 8 - 2\" but knowing that scores of 8-2 occur across multiple venues, we need to assess if this claim's wording allows for interpretation.\n\n### Step 8: Final assessment\nThe claim can't be directly confirmed by finding an exact match across all specified conditions due to the phrasing and specifics. However, it is clear that there are instances where the score of 5-5 occurs in ties across different meetings (as seen in Row 3) and multiple venues also see the UT record with a score similar to what's claimed.\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion based on provided details\nGiven the complexity of interpreting the claim against the data, without an exact match for both specified conditions (\"tie, 5 - 5\" in \"last 10 meetings\" exactly as stated and \"2 time at UT, 8 - 2\") and considering some variability in how these scores are reported across different venues (neutral sites), a strict interpretation of the claim seems challenging.\n\n### Step 10: Format the conclusion into JSON\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Step 3-9 analysis led to difficulty confirming exact claim due to conditions' specificity and varying venue reports. Some scores match partially, but not fully across all specified parts of the claim.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"overall record\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"a&m , last 5 meetings\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Note\nThe format and structure of the JSON output was requested specifically.",

To do this, we need to check each relevant cell in the table:\n   - Row 3: `austin: ut , 6 - 2`\n   - Row 4: `austin: ut , 4 - 3` (Kansas vs Oklahoma does not apply here but we can confirm it is \"tied\" which also implies a tie with same score)\n   \n   We will only focus on cells that have the match-up in question: `texas v iowa state` and `texas v kansa state`.\n\n3. Row 1 of matchup between Texas vs Iowa State has overall record as `ut`, but we need to see if it is also at Austin, therefore checking row 3 where we can confirm this:\n   - `austin: ut , 6 - 2`\n\n4. Similarly for matchup between `Texas v Kansas state` we will check:\n   - Row 4 : For overall record of the matchup Texas vs Oklahoma State has `tied`, so we need to see if it's also at neutral site because both are \"tie\".

    "resp": "### Step 1: Read the Claim and Identify Relevant Information\nThe claim states: \"at opponent's venue, the score be tie on 2 game, tie, 4 - 4 against Kansas and tie, 7 - 7 against Oklahoma\". This implies we need to check if there is a tied score at an opponent's venue in both cases.\n\n### Step 2: Check Row 1 for Relevant Information\nRow 1 provides information about the match against Baylor. Looking at \"opponent's venue\", we see that Texas lost with a score of 13-22, which is not a tie.\n\n### Step 3: Check Row 2 for Relevant Information\nRow 2 pertains to the match against Colorado. For \"neutral site\", Texas won with a score of 2-1, which does not match our claim.\n\n### Step 4: Check Row 3 for Relevant Information\nRow 3 is about Iowa State. In \"opponent's venue\" (ISU), there is no indication that the game ended in a tie.\n\n### Step 5: Check Row 4 for Relevant Information\nRow 4 discusses Kansas. The match at \"neutral site\" resulted in a tied score of 4-4, which aligns with part of our claim.\n\n### Step 6: Check Row 5 for Relevant Information\nRow 5 is about Kansas State. In \"opponent's venue\", the game was won by Texas but no specific details are mentioned about the score, so we cannot confirm this as a tie.\n\n### Step 7: Check Row 6 for Relevant Information\nRow 6 concerns Missouri. For \"neutral site\", there isn't enough information to support that the score was tied.\n\n### Step 8: Check Row 7 for Relevant Information\nRow 7 pertains to Nebraska. At \"opponent's venue\" (UT), while close, it does not exactly match our claim of a tie.\n\n### Step 9: Check Row 8 for Relevant Information\nRow 8 addresses Oklahoma. In the \"neutral site\", Texas won with a score of 2-3, which is very close to being tied but doesn't fully meet the criteria specified by the claim.\n\n### Step 10: Check Row 9 for Relevant Information\nRow 9 talks about Oklahoma State. At \"opponent's venue\" (UT), it states that the score was tied at 7-7, matching our claim.\n\n### Step 11: Check Row 10 for Relevant Information\nRow 10 is about Texas A&M. There isn't any information provided about a tie in this match to support our claim.\n\n### Step 12: Check Row 11 for Relevant Information\nRow 11 is about Texas Tech. In \"neutral site\", the game ended with a score of 13-4, which does not align with being tied.\n\n### Step 13: Analyze the Matches Against Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth against Kansas and Oklahoma in \"neutral site\" resulted in tied scores (4-4 and 7-7 respectively), thus supporting part of the claim.\n\n### Step 14: Determine if Claim is True or False\nThe match against Oklahoma State at their venue indeed had a tie, matching our criteria. However, the claim's other condition requires it to happen at \"opponent's venue\". Since only one out of two conditions provided in the claim was met (the specific match against Oklahoma), we must conclude that not all parts of the claim are satisfied as presented.\n\n### Step 15: Conclude and Format Final Answer\nSince the match at Oklahoma State matches but not the part concerning Kansas, and there isn't a match that fits both parts of the condition correctly across all provided data, the final answer should reflect this nuanced understanding.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Read the claim and identify relevant information.\",\n            \"conclusion\": \"The claim pertains to whether at opponent's venue the score is tie on 2 games.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"reasoning\": \"Step 2: Check Row 1 for relevant information.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. The claim states that in the first 10 meetings, the score should be tied at 5-5, 4 times, and 2 times at the University of Texas (UT) venue.\n2. To verify this, we need to examine the overall record and last 10 meeting statistics for each team.\n3. Starting from Row 1: texas vs: baylor, we can see that the overall record is UT, 57 - 23, which implies that Baylor has won more games than Texas in their overall meetings (assuming they have played each other at least once).\n4. Moving on to Row 2: texas vs: colorado, we find that Colorado's last 10 meeting statistic is UT, 8-2, indicating that Colorado has won more games than Texas in their recent meetings.\n5. However, when we examine Row 11: texas vs: texas tech, we see that the overall record for Texas Tech is UT, 55 - 24, but the last 10 meeting statistic shows Texas Tech winning (TTU), 6 - 4, which means Texas has actually won more games than Texas Tech in their recent meetings.\n6. Given this information, it's possible that some teams might have an equal number of wins and losses against each other or have a different overall record for the first 10 meetings.\n7. To further verify the claim, let's look at the relevant cells:\n\t* Row 1: Column \"last 5 meetings\" shows Baylor has won (BU), 3 - 2, and Texas Tech does not show any wins/losses in this specific column as it indicates only a tied result (ttu).\n    *   Thus, we could verify that there are indeed 4 ties with the score 5-5.\n\t* Row 11: Column \"last 10 meetings\" shows Texas Tech won (TTU), 6 - 4. Therefore, this row does not satisfy the claim of having a tie with a score of 8-2 as per column 'neutra site'.\n\nAfter analyzing each step and relevant data in the table, I conclude that there are indeed 4 ties for scores 5-5. Thus, here's the output: \n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check overall record for Baylor vs Texas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check last 10 meeting statistic for Baylor vs Texas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check overall record for Colorado vs Texas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check last 10 meeting statistic for Colorado vs Texas\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check overall record and last 10 meeting statistics for other teams\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Verify the claim with relevant data in the table\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"last 5 meetings\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"last 10 meetings\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that at opponent's venue, the score be tie on only 1 game, specifically 4 - 4 against Kansas.\n\n2. **Locate the relevant cells in the table**: To verify this claim, we need to find the row where Texas vs. Kansas is played and see if their score is indeed a tie (4-4) at opponent's venue.\n\n3. **Extract the relevant data from the table**:\n   - Row 4 represents Texas vs. Kansas.\n   - The column \"opponent's venue\" in this row indicates that the game was played at a neutral site, not at an opponent's venue. However, looking closely, we see that \"tied\" is listed under \"neutral site\", but since it actually says \"tied\" for overall meetings against Kansas, we look at the \"overall record\" section to get the actual result of the Texas vs. Kansas game at a neutral site.\n   - The relevant cell here for our claim would be:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n4. **Check if the score was indeed tie**: Looking at the row where Texas vs. Kansas is listed again, we find:\n   - The relevant cell for this claim would be:\n     ```\n     {\n       \"row_index\": 4,\n       \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify if it's a single game that matches the claim**: After examining all relevant rows and columns again for any other instances where Texas vs. Kansas might have played at an opponent's venue with a score of tie, we can conclude our analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n6. **Conclusion based on findings**:\n   - Since \"tied\" is indeed listed under the \"neutral site\" column for the overall record against Kansas, this indicates that there was at least one game where Texas vs. Kansas ended in a tie.\n   - However, we must verify if only one such instance exists as per the claim.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n7. **Final analysis of all relevant data**:\n   - Upon reviewing all columns and rows for this specific matchup at an opponent's venue, it becomes clear that no other instances exist where Texas vs. Kansas ended in a tie besides the one mentioned.\n   - Therefore, our claim is verified.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"neutral site\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent's venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Verify that the result in cell (4,2) matches the claim's expected value for the game between Texas and Kansas State.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- **Step 1:** The claim states that UT, 58 - 15 is the result on the game at Austin, Texas vs Iowa State. To verify this, I need to check if cell (2,3) contains the value \"ut , 58 - 15\".\n- Cell (2,3) contains the value \"ut , 58 - 15\", so it matches the claim's expected value for the game between Texas and Iowa State at Austin.\n- **Step 2:** The claim also states that UT, 58 - 15 is the result on the game at Austin, Texas vs Kansas State. To verify this, I need to check if cell (4,3) contains the value \"ut , 58 - 15\".\n- Cell (4,3) does not contain the value \"ut , 58 - 15\".
