In row 13, chauncey billups is alone with \"8\" in the \"high assists\". Since we are only counting when there is no tie, then it should be excluded because his assist number was tied for the high assist of that game.\n\nStep 3: Determine if Chauncey Billups leads or ties for the lead in assists for at least 10 out of 13 games.\n\n* Since Chauncey Billups appears as having high assists alone in rows 2, 3, 4 and 9. In row 5, chauncey billups has a tie with another player for high assists, then we only count the remaining rows after that, and he again has the same amount of assists as another player (in row 11). Chauncey Billups is alone in two additional games: row 13's assist number was not enough to be alone, but chauncey billups has an alone assist game. \n* Therefore, we can see that Chauncey Billups appears as having high assists alone in rows 2, 3, 4, 9, and 11.\n* We now know that Chauncey Billups is tied for the lead on one row (row 13) because his assist number was not enough to be the only player with high assists. Thus, we should exclude this from our count.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether the claim about Chauncey Billups leading or tying for the lead in assists for at least 10 out of 13 games is TRUE or FALSE based on the previous steps.\n\n* Based on the analysis above, Chauncey Billups leads or ties for the lead in assists for 9 out of 13 games.

So, this doesn't give us any loss, only a win.\n   - Game 13 (bulls): Win, so no consecutive losses.\n\n4. **Check the Remaining Games Played by Denver in November for Consecutive Losses**:\n   - Game: 12, date: November 20, team: clippers\n   - Game: 14, date: November 24, team: nets\n   - Game: 15, date: November 25, team: timberwolves\n\n5. **Determine the Outcome of Remaining Games**:\n   - Game 12 (clippers): Loss, so consecutive losses.\n   - Game 13 (bulls) already counted as a win in step 3.\n   - Game 14 (nets): Win, so no consecutive losses.\n\n6. **Check for the Second Occasion of Consecutive Losses**:\n   - Game: 15 (timberwolves)\n   - Game 16 (knicks): Loss and also has more than one game in a row loss because their first loss was in game 13 against bulls which doesn't count here.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The Denver team loses more than 1 game in a row on two occasions during November, which are games 12 and 15 of the season.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"List All Games Played by Denver in November\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the Number of Consecutive Losses for Each Game\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check the Remaining Games Played by Denver in November for Consecutive Losses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the Outcome of Remaining Games\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check for the Second Occasion of Consecutive Losses\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion: The first instance was found to be correct in the prompt.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"game\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"game\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

Therefore, we can identify other relevant cells for tracking assists as follows:\n- Row 6: high assists: Chauncey Billups (5), Ty Lawon (5)\n- Row 8: high assists: Chauncey Billups (10), Ty Lawon (10)\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the claim\nBased on our count, Ty Lawson leads or ties for the lead in assist only once and that is on rows where other players also have 7 assists.
