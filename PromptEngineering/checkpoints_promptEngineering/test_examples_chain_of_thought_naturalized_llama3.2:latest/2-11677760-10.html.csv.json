List all the heights for each player in the table:\n   - Alonzo Mourning: 6 - 10\n   - Chris Jackson: 6 - 0\n   - Chris Mills: 6 - 7\n   - Billy Owens: 6 - 9\n   - Kenny Williams: 6 - 10\n\n2. Check if the range of heights is within the given claim (6'0 to 6'10).\n   - Since 6 - 10 is equivalent to 6 feet 10 inches, and Chris Jackson's height is only 6 - 0, which is 6 feet 0 inches, we need to check all other heights.\n   - All players except Chris Jackson have a height of at least 6'0 (i.e., 48 inches).\n   - However, Chris Mills has a height of 6 - 7, and Billy Owens has a height of 6 - 9. Both are under 6 feet 10 inches.\n   - Only Alonzo Mourning is in the range specified in the claim.\n\n3.

Therefore, this row does not support the claim that all but 1 players were selected in their first round draft.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Row 2\nChris Jackson was drafted as the 3rd pick in the 1990 NBA draft, which is also not his first round draft. So, this row supports the claim that at least one player was not selected in their first round draft.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Row 3\nChris Mills was drafted as the 22nd pick in the 1993 NBA draft, which is not his first round draft. Therefore, this row also supports the claim.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Row 4\nBilly Owens was drafted as the 3rd pick in the 1991 NBA draft, which means he was selected in his first round draft. This row does not support the claim that all but 1 players were selected in their first round draft.\n\n### Step 6: Analyze Row 5\nKenny Williams was drafted as the 46th pick in the 1990 NBA draft, which is also not his first round draft.

We will compare each player's reported NBA draft year with their likely eligibility year based on their height.\n\n### Height and Eligibility:\n- For a player of height 6'0\" or below, they are typically eligible for the NBA draft immediately after high school (17th year after birth).\n- A player between 6'1\" and 6'9\", they would be eligible in their 18th year.\n- A player at or above 6'10\", they would likely be a first-round pick, usually in their 19th year.\n\n3. For each player, we'll determine if the reported draft year matches their expected eligibility year based on height:\n    - Row 1: alonzo mourning (height of 6-10) is more likely to be eligible in his 19th year.\n    - Row 2: chris jackson (height of 6-0) should be eligible immediately after high school, so a draft year of 1990 seems correct.\n    - Row 3: chris mills (height of 6-7) should be eligible in his 18th year. A draft year of 1993 is not expected to align with the eligibility period for this height range.\n    - Row 4: billy owens (height of 6-9) should also be eligible in his 18th year, but a draft year of 1991 seems too early given their actual age at entry would have been around 19 years old. \n    - Row 5: kenny williams (height of 6-10) is likely to be selected in his 19th year.\n\n4.

    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. To determine whether the claim about only 2 players being selected in the NBA draft in their eligible season is true, we need to analyze each player's information.\n2. We start with Row 1: alonzo mourning. His college was listed as Georgetown, which means he likely graduated during his senior year (elible season). However, his NBA draft position is not explicitly stated as a \"senior\" or \"junior\", but since it's a first-round pick in the 1992 draft and all the other players have a later year of graduation than their entry into the league, we will assume this was true.\n\n3. Next, we move to Row 2: chris jackson. His college is listed as LSU, which means he likely graduated during his senior year (elible season). Since his NBA draft position is stated as a first-round pick in the 1990 draft and there's no indication of him being drafted later than his collegiate graduation year, we will also assume this was true.\n\n4. Now, let's look at Row 3: chris mills. His college years are combined at Kentucky/Arizona; hence, he can be considered to have likely graduated during either senior or junior year, but because it is mentioned that he entered the league after being selected 22nd in a 1993 draft and all other players had earlier entry into the league than their graduation year, we will assume this was true.\n\n5. Moving on to Row 4: billy owens. His college years are listed as Syracuse; hence, he likely graduated during his senior year (elible season). As with Chris Mills' situation, there's no indication that Billy Owens entered the league after being selected in a draft later than his collegiate graduation year.\n\n6. Lastly, we examine Row 5: kenny williams. His college years are listed as barton cc/elizabeth city state; he was likely considered to be drafted during either junior or senior year but again, since there's no indication that he entered the league after being selected in a draft later than his collegiate graduation year, we can also assume this was true.\n\n7. Having analyzed all players, it seems that only two of them (Alonzo Mourning and Chris Jackson) are considered to have been drafted during their senior year. However, we need to note that there is one player who fits into a disputed situation: Kenny Williams' draft year isn't specified clearly; however the 2 other players mentioned in previous steps were both drafted in a draft year after they had finished college so this would place Chris Mills and Billy Owens as also being eligible for this claim.\n\n8. With all information analyzed, we can now determine whether only 2 of these players were selected in their eligible season based on available data.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"nba draft\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
