    "resp": "#### Step 1: Understanding the claim\nThe claim states that 3 teams from Melbourne should include 1 each from north and south, implying that there are at least three teams from Melbourne in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Identifying relevant cells\nWe need to examine rows 2, 4, and 5, as these are the ones where teams from Melbourne play against other teams. Specifically, we'll look at the \"away team\" column for each row, which will tell us if the away team is a Melbourne-based team.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyzing Row 2\nRow 2 has the home team \"Melbourne\" with an away team score of 10.11 (71). This indicates that Richmond is not a Melbourne-based team.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyzing Row 3\nRow 3 has the home team \"Footscray\" with an away team score of 7.15 (57), indicating Hawthorn is not a Melbourne-based team.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyzing Row 4\nRow 4 has the home team \"Fitzroy\" with an away team \"Geelong\". Since Geelong is not mentioned as being from Melbourne, this row does not meet the criteria.\n\n#### Step 6: Analyzing Row 5\nRow 5 has the home team \"St Kilda\" with an away team score of 7.14 (56). This indicates that Collingwood is not a Melbourne-based team.\n\n#### Step 7: Drawing a conclusion based on data \nBased on rows 2, 3, and 5 having teams from north and south as the home team, but none of them have teams from both North and South Melbourne in their Away Team column.",

Investigate if the claim is true based on another factor: Since all the games were played in 1957, it's likely that all the matches took place before the advent of the Super Saturday or any other major changes to scheduling that might have changed how these games are scheduled across the weeks and months.\n\n4.

Since we've found two rows with a crowd size of 10000, it's possible that this claim could be true.\n6. However, we need to check if there are any other rows with a crowd size of 10000 to confirm that exactly 2 games have this attendance.\n7. After reviewing the table again, we can see that there is no other row with a crowd size of 10000.\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check if Row 1 has a crowd size of 10000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\",\n      \"value\": 10000\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
