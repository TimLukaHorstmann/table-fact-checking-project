Next, let's look at all other versions to make sure none have a shorter duration:\n   - Row 1 has an album version with a length of 3:53.\n   - Row 2 shows a single version with a length of 3:50.\n   - Row 3 is the instrumental version and has the same length as the single version, which is 3:50.\n   - Row 4 displays \"aches remix\" with a length of 3:58.\n   - The pain killer mix (Row 5) has a duration of 6:20, longer than the upside down remix.\n   - The live version (Recorded in 1996), whether audio or video, both have a length greater than that of the \"upside down remix\" as well.\n\n5.
