Identify the specific matches involving Bordeaux.\n   - Match 1: Bordeaux (h) vs Fiorentina, Row 3.\n   - Match 2: Bordeaux (a) vs Fiorentina, Row 4.\n   - Match 3: Bordeaux (h) vs Valencia, Row 3.\n\n2. Extract attendance values for relevant matches involving Bordeaux from the table:\n   - Match 1 Attendance: 59786\n   - Match 2 Attendance: 30130\n   - Match 3 Attendance: Not directly relevant for comparison but shows the same match type in a different row (h).\n\n3. Compare attendance of Match 1 and Match 2 to determine if the claim is true.\n   - The difference between Match 1 and Match 2 attendance values = 59786 - 30130 = 29656\n\n4. Check if this difference meets the condition stated by the claim (\"over 20000 less than in the first match with Bordeaux\").\n   - Since 29656 is indeed over 20,000 more than the attendance of the second match (the claim would be false), we must correct our approach considering the actual phrasing of the claim.\n\n5. Correct interpretation based on the claim's wording:\n   - The claim states \"over 20000 less\". This implies a comparison where if the first match's attendance is x, then the second should have been at least x-20,000 for the statement to be true.\n   \n6. Recalculate with correct understanding of the phrasing:\n   - Match 1 Attendance: 59786\n   - The claim essentially compares it against the expected value after subtracting 20,000.\n\n7. Given that we are interested in the claim's truth and not just direct subtraction or comparison, let's properly assess the situation:\n   - Since the attendance at Match 2 was less than Match 1 by a significant margin (over 29,600), for the statement to be true based on its wording (\"over 20000 less\"), it would have needed to be even lower to satisfy \"less than\" in the context of comparisons. However, we are looking for whether the attendance at the second match was indeed over 20,000 less (which seems counterintuitive given our initial direct subtraction).\n\n8. Realization:\n   - The claim's phrasing seems somewhat illogical or potentially misstated as it relates to \"over 20000 less\". Typically, such a comparison would be stated in terms of one value being greater than another by a certain amount (e.g., \"greater than\" instead of the reversed comparative).\n\n9. Conclusion based on correct interpretation and logical flow:\n   - The claim's wording (\"over 20000 less\") is confusing. However, we've determined that Match 2 was indeed significantly lower than Match 1.\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify specific matches involving Bordeaux: Bordeaux (h) vs Fiorentina, Bordeaux (a) vs Fiorentina, Bordeaux (h) vs Valencia\",\n    \"Extract attendance values for relevant matches: Match 1 Attendance: 59786, Match 2 Attendance: 30130\",\n    \"Compare the attendance difference to check claim validity\",\n    \"Determine if the attendance at the second match with Bordeaux was over 20,000 less than in the first match with Bordeaux based on correct claim interpretation\",\n    \"Conclusion: The claim's wording seems misstated or illogical but Match 2 indeed had a significantly lower attendance\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the answer is based on the interpretation provided and aligns with logical reasoning regarding typical usage of comparative language.",
