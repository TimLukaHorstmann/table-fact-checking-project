    "resp": "1. First, let's start by finding the total number of championships played by Richard Krajicek.\n2. From the table, we can see that there are 16 matches where Richard krajicek was a winner (outcomes: \"winner\" and date in bold) - row 4, row 6, row 7, row 11, row 14, row 17, row 18, row 20, row 22, row 23, row 24, row 25, row 26.\n3. Next, let's find the number of championships played by Richard krajicek where he was a runner-up (outcomes: \"runner - up\" and date in bold) - row 2, row 5, row 9, row 19, row 21, row 23, row 25, row 26.\n4. Since the claim says that Richard krajicek played in 25 championship tennis matches, we need to verify if this is true by checking both the number of wins and runner-up appearances.\n5. Now let's list all relevant championships: \n    - Row 1: winner, date: 8 april 1991\n    - Row 2: runner - up, date: not bold (this should be in **bold**)\n    - Row 3: not present\n    - Row 4: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 5: runner - up, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 6: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 7: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 8: not present\n    - Row 9: runner - up, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 10: not present\n    - Row 11: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 12: not present\n    - Row 13: not present\n    - Row 14: winner, date: **not bold**\n    - Row 15: runner-up (missing information)\n    - Row 16: not present\n    - Row 17: winner, date: **not bold**\n    - Row 18: winner, date: **not bold**\n    - Row 19: runner - up, date: **not bold**\n    - Row 20: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 21: runner - up, date: **not bold**\n    - Row 22: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 23: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 24: winner, date: not bold (**not present**)\n    - Row 25: runner - up, date: **not bold**\n    - Row 26: runner-up (missing information), date: **not bold**\n6.

Let's look at Row 4 for example: \"Row 4: outcome: winner, date: 16 November 1992, championship: antwerp , Belgium, surface: carpet (i), opponent: mark woodforde, score: 6 - 2 , 6 - 2.\"\n\n4. In this row, the opponent is 'mark woodforde' not 'krajicek'. So we can ignore Row 4.\n\n5. Let's look at Row 1 again: \"Row 1: outcome: winner, date: 8 April 1991, championship: hong kong , UK, surface: hard, opponent: wally masur, score: 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3.\"\n\n6. In this row, the opponent is 'wally masur' not 'krajicek'. So we can ignore Row 1.\n\n7. Let's look at Row 17 for example: \"Row 17: outcome: winner, date: 21 April 1997, championship: tokyo , Japan, surface: hard, opponent: lionel roux, score: 6 - 2 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 1.\"\n\n8. In this row, the opponent is 'lionel roux' not 'krajicek'. So we can ignore Row 17.\n\n9. Let's look at Row 20 for example: \"Row 20: outcome: winner, date: 16 February 1998, championship: st petersburg , Russia, surface: carpet (i), opponent: marc rosset, score: 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 (7 - 5).\"\n\n10. In this row, the opponent is 'marc rosset' not 'krajicek'. So we can ignore Row 20.\n\n11. Let's count the number of rows where the opponent in the match is indeed 'krajicek'.\n\n12. From the table, we can see that there are two rows where the opponent in the match is indeed 'krajicek': \n\n   - Row 2: \"Row 2: outcome: winner, date: 14 April 1992, championship: Barcelona , Spain, surface: carpet (i), opponent: krajicek, score: 6-3, 4-6, 7-5.\"\n   \n   - Row 22: \"Row 22: outcome: winner, date: 2 November 1998, championship: stuttgart , Germany, surface: hard (i), opponent: yevgeny kafelnikov, score: 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3.\"\n\n13. So Krajicek won in 2 matches.\n\n14. We can now compare the number of championships won by krajicek to the total number of championships he played.\n\n15. The claim is \"krajicek win 7 out of 25 championship match he play\". Let's check if this is true:\n\n   - Krajicek played in 25 matches.\n   - Krajicek won in 2 matches.\n   \n   Since 2 is less than 7, the claim is FALSE.\n\n16. Finally, let's output a JSON object with our reasoning and answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the total number of championships won by Krajicek out of all 25 matches played.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"To do this, we need to go through each row in the table (from Row 1 to Row 20) and check if the opponent in that match is indeed 'krajicek'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Let's look at Row 4 for example: Row 4: outcome: winner, date: 16 November 1992, championship: antwerp , Belgium, surface: carpet (i), opponent: mark woodforde, score: 6 - 2 , 6 - 2.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the championship where Roger Federer won only three times.\n2. We will examine each row of the table to determine which championships are associated with only one win for Roger Federer.\n3. The table shows that Rotterdam, Netherlands is a championship where Roger Federer has participated multiple times.\n4. Now, we need to check the specific column values in rows 6, 11, and 16 to see if they have won Rotterdam, Netherlands three times.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n[\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 6,\n        \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 11,\n        \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"row_index\": 16,\n        \"column_name\": \"outcome\"\n    }\n]\n\n#### Step-by-Step Conclusion:\n\nFrom row 6, Roger Federer won Rotterdam, Netherlands three times ( outcome: winner ). From row 11 and row 16, Roger Federer also won Rotterdam, Netherlands three times ( outcome: winner ).\n\nSince there is no instance of Roger Federer not winning the championship in Rotterdam, Netherlands three times. Thus, he has won Rotterdam, Netherlands only three time.\n\n#### JSON Response:\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"The claim states that Roger Federer only won 3 times in the Rotterdam, Netherlands championship.

The claim is incorrect about this player.\n\n### Step 4: Check Richard Krajicek's matches with Michael Stich\nThere are three rows where Richard krajicek played against Michael Stich:\n- Row 10: winner, Michael Stich, carpet (i) surface.\n- Row 5: runner-up, Michael Stich, carpet (i) surface.\n- Row 22: winner, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, but Michael was opponent in the final of this event; however, looking for matches against players named 'Michael Stich', Richard played him only once at a different stage (as he defeated Kafelnikov, not his last loss, so that's incorrect).\n\nSo, Richard Krajicek did play against Michael Stich at least twice. The claim is partially correct about this player.\n\n### Step 5: Check Richard krajicek's matches with Andre Agassi\nThere are two rows where Richard krajicek played against Andre Agassi:\n- Row 20: winner, Marc Rosset but it was against another opponent; however we have 'Andre Agassi' in the list of opponents in a row with Krajicek.\n- There is no row with both names (R. Krajicek and A. Agassi). However there are rows where Andre was paired with R. krajicek only once, which isn't enough to fulfill the claim.\n\n\n### Step 6: Gather relevant information for JSON output\nHere's a summary of what we found:\n- Claim about Michael Chang is false.\n- Claim about Michael Stich is true.\n- Claim about Andre Agassi is false.\n\nThis means that Richard Krajicek played against Michael Stich at least twice, but not the other two players.
