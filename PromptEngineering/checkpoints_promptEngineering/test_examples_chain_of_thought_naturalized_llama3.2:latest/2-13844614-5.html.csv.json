We need to check if every position has 5 matches.\n   - Looking at the table, we see that all rows have a column named 'matches' with a value of 5.\n\n2. Now we need to verify if only one position wins all its matches.\n   - Looking at the 'wins' column for each row, we can check which row has only 1 win and no other wins. \n\n3. We then calculate the points and difference to ensure they are consistent with a single win or loss.\n\n4. Verify that there is no other position with the same characteristics as Row 6 (only 0 wins).\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nBased on steps 1-4, we conclude that:\n- Every row has exactly 5 matches.\n- Only Row 4 has exactly one win and no other wins.\n\nSince this conclusion does not align with the claim that 'only 1 of them' have won all their matches, there is a discrepancy.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"All rows have 5 matches\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Row 6 has only 0 wins and no other wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Only Row 4 has exactly one win and no other wins\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"results\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"wins\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
