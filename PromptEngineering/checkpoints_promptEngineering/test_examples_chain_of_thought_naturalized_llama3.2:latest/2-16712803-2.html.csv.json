We can see from row 2 of the table that the attendance for the Denver Broncos game was 74488.\n3. Next, let's check if this is indeed the highest attendance in the entire season by comparing it with other games' attendance values. The largest attendance after week 2 is 57760 for the Kansas City Chiefs game (row 1).\n4. Comparing the attendance of the Denver Broncos game to other weeks we can conclude that it has the highest attendance so far.\n5. Now we need to check if this claim can be true only in week 2 against the Denver Bronco by seeing if there isn't another row with a higher attendance value for any other week and opposing team.\n6. To make sure, let's check the attendance of the game that was played on Week 10, which is also 47365 for Seattle Seahawks (row 10), this value is less than the one we have so far (74488). Hence, it can't be a higher attendance than the Denver Broncos game in week 2.\n7. Since there isn't another row with a higher attendance value than week 2 against the Denver Bronco's, we can conclude that the claim is true.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The \"date\" for row 15 is December 15, 1985. Given that the team played against San Francisco 49ers (the home team in this match) and the game was played on 15 Dec 1985 as indicated by the calendar day being a Sunday which falls under a weekend in USA hence would be a home or away depending on which city you consider, but it can be inferred that since a monday morning game occurs 3 weeks prior (December 8th), The team must have been playing at a home stadium. Hence for this row we have determined the match was played on home.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Row 16\nRow 16 has a \"week\" value of 16, indicating it is week 16. The \"date\" for row 16 is December 22, 1985. Given that the team played against Atlanta Falcons and the game was played on 15 Dec 1985 as indicated by the calendar day being a Sunday which falls under a weekend in USA hence would be a home or away depending on which city you consider but given it occurs 7 days after (December 22, 1985) we can safely say that the match was not played at home.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if either of these games were lost\nFor row 15:\nResult for this week is l 31 - 19 , hence this game was lost\n\nFor row 16:\nResult for this week is l 16 - 10 , hence this game was also lost\n\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the last two games of the season (week 15 and 16) were both lost to opponents at a home game, the claim that \"the last 2 game of the season be lose to opponent at a home game\" is TRUE.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify the last two games of the season\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the last two games were played at a home game for row 15\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Analyze Row 15\",\n      \"value\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if the last two games were played at a home game for row 16\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Analyze Row 16\",\n      \"value\": false\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if either of these games were lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"For row 15: Result for this week is l 31 - 19 , hence this game was lost\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"For row 16: Result for this week is l 16 - 10 , hence this game was also lost\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 16,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

This data is located in columns starting from `attendance` (column 4) and going up.\n3. **Find the Row with Highest Attendance**: To determine if the St. Louis Cardinals have the highest attendance, we need to compare their attendance data with all other teams' attendance data.\n4. **Identify Relevant Rows for Comparison**:\n    - For the St. Louis Cardinals, we will compare their attendance data in rows 14 (`row_index: 14`) and any row where they appear as an opponent (if that row has a higher attendance).\n    - Other relevant rows include those where other teams' attendance is higher than the St. Louis Cardinals', particularly if these teams are opponents of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n5. **Check for Games with Higher Attendance**: We should also check if there are games played by any team against the St. Louis Cardinals that have a higher attendance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Continued\n\n6. **Compare Attendance**: For row 14 (`row_index: 14`), we see that their attendance is `29527`. This value needs to be compared with other teams' attendance data, particularly those where the St. Louis Cardinals are opponents.\n7. **Check Opponent's Games Against Cardinals**: We must check if there's a game against the St. Louis Cardinals in another row (`row_index`) with higher attendance than in row 14.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Finalized\n\n8. **Conclusion on Claim Validity**:\n    - If we find any row where a team has played against the St. Louis Cardinals and that opponent's attendance is higher, or if there are games involving teams not listed as opponents but have an attendance higher than the St. Louis Cardinals', then the claim is false.\n    - Otherwise, if no such rows exist, and all their attendance data is higher than the 29527 of row 14, the claim could be true but it would require checking every single opponent's games to ensure there aren't any with a higher attendance.\n\n### Final Answer Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Steps for finding the highest attendance team against St. Louis Cardinals and comparison with other teams' attendances in their respective row.\",\n    \"Checking if St. Louis Cardinals have the highest attendance in row 14, comparing it with all other rows where they appear as opponents or higher attendance\",\n    \"Verifying games played by other teams against Cardinals for potential higher attendance\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\", // Based on step-by-step reasoning\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"} // Placeholder to indicate checking other rows without specific data\n  ]\n}\n```",
