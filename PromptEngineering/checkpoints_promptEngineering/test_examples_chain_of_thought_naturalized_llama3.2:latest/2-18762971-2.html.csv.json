    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant dates**: To determine the shortest time between two consecutive matches in March, we need to first identify all matches that took place in March.\n\n2. **Locate the March matches**:\n   - Row 23: date: 16 december 2000, opponent: sheffield united, venue: a, result: 1 - 1.\n   - Row 24: date: 23 december 2000, opponent: wolverhampton wanderers, venue: h, result: 0 - 1.\n   - Row 25: date: 26 december 2000, opponent: grimsby town, venue: a, result: 2 - 2. (Although not directly in March, it's close to the beginning of the month.)\n   - However, we are looking for matches that occur in March. Therefore:\n     Row 40: date: 1 april 2001, opponent: sheffield united, venue: h, result: 1 - 2.\n     Row 41: date: 7 april 2001, opponent: stockport county, venue: a, result: 1 - 2.\n   - Also:\n     Row 39: date: 24 march 2001, opponent: birmingham city, venue: a, result: 2 - 1.\n\n3. **Identify the row with the shortest time between two consecutive March matches**: To find this out we need to list all rows from March and check how many days apart they are.\n   Row 39 (24 March): Date: 24-03-2001\n   Row 40 (01 April): Date: 01-04-2001\n\n4. **Calculate the difference in days**: \n   The match on 24th of March was played at 1st of April which is a difference of one day.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since we have identified two consecutive matches in March with only a 1-day gap, we must verify if there are any other instances that could be shorter and hence declare it false.\n\n\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 39,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 40,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 39,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 40,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
