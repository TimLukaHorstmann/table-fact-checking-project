According to the table, his years are 1942 - 1955, regular season: 258, playoffs: 10, total: 268. So, we know that Bill Mosienko scored a total of 268 postseason goals.\n\n#### Step 3: Find each player's total and compare it with Bill Mosienko's\nWe need to find the total for each player in Rows 1-8.\n\n#### Step 4: Compare Bill Mosienko's total with other players' totals\nWe will then compare Bill Mosienko's total of 268 with other players' totals. If we can't find anyone who scored fewer goals, then the claim is FALSE. Otherwise, it is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 5: Find all relevant rows and their corresponding column values in a list.\nWe can now get our relevant rows for comparison by making a list of these row indices.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 9,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 2,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 3,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 5,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 6,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 7,\"column_name\": \"total\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8,\"column_name\": \"total\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 6: Determine whether Bill Mosienko scored the fewest number of postseason goals\nBill Mosienko's total (268) is greater than Steve Larmer's total (451).

We will look at columns 'playoffs' since they likely contain the postseason goal counts.\n\n#### Step 3: Locate the relevant cells for comparison\nTo compare, we need to locate the cell that contains Bill Mosienko's postseason goal count and another cell containing a player with a known number of postseason goals so we can verify if Bill Mosienko indeed has scored the most. However since we are looking at his specific entry as the basis, we must refer to \"Row 9: name: bill mosienko\" in this context.\n\n#### Step 4: Identify a relevant comparison cell\nLooking for another player's postseason goal count for comparison is not necessary here because the claim specifically refers to Bill Mosienko having scored the most number of postseason goals. Therefore, comparing with any other player isn't required. Our focus remains solely on Bill Mosienko.\n\n#### Step 5: Extract relevant information\nThe relevant cell for Bill Mosienko is Row 9, where his years and regular season/total goal counts are listed, but we specifically need the 'playoffs' column to verify the claim about postseason goals scored by him. Upon looking at it, we can see that indeed \"playoffs: 10\" which would be the number of goals for Bill Mosienko in postseason.\n\n#### Step 6: Compare with others if necessary\nSince we are only verifying Bill Mosienko's total and not comparing to any other player's totals directly here. Therefore no further comparison is required, as our focus is just on his own entry.\n\n#### Step 7: Conclusion based on the extracted information\nBased on the given 'playoffs' column for Bill Mosienko (\"playoffs: 10\"), we can see he indeed scored 10 postseason goals which matches what's stated in the claim, making it TRUE.\n\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified Bill Mosienko's total of postseason goals as per his entry in playoffs (10) matches the number of postseason goals mentioned in the claim (33 is actually wrong and so we will verify the highest for correct answer)\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"playoffs\"}\n    ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the highest scorer\nTo determine if there are only 20 goals separating the highest scorer from the lowest scorer, we need to first identify who the highest scorer is and their total number of goals.\n\nLooking at the table, Row 1 has Bobby Hull with a total of 666 goals, which appears to be the highest score. We will verify this by comparing it with other rows.\n\n### Step 2: Find the lowest scorer\nNext, we need to find who among the remaining players in the table has the fewest number of goals, as they are our reference point for comparison.\n\nRow 3 has Steve Larmer with a total of 451 goals, which is relatively low compared to other players. We can see that he indeed has fewer goals than most of the other players listed in the table, especially those with more seasons played. However, we must also consider whether there are players with even lower totals.\n\n### Step 3: Check for any player with a total of 268 or less\nRow 9 and Row 10 have Ken Wharram and Bill Mosienko both with 268 goals, which is significantly lower than the rest of the players on the table. Given that we are considering the range between the highest scorer and the lowest scorer, this gives us the lower end of our target.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Row 1's value against our claim\nSince Bobby Hull has a total of 666 goals (the highest), we must determine if there is only one player with fewer than 666 goals. However, from our analysis in steps 2 and 3, we see that several players have totals below or very close to this number.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the relevance of each row\n- Row 1 contains Bobby Hull's information.\n- Row 2 shows Stan Mikita with a relatively low total but higher than Steve Larmer\u2019s. His presence is not directly relevant as the lowest scorer among the verified information provided so far, though it does give context on how goals are distributed over time.\n- Rows 3 to 10 list players from different eras with varying number of goals.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\nGiven that there's at least one player (Steve Larmer) with fewer than 666 goals and another set of players (Ken Wharram, Bill Mosienko) right above the lower bound of what we've established (268 goals), not all values fall within a 20-goal range between our identified \"highest\" total and confirmed lowest.
