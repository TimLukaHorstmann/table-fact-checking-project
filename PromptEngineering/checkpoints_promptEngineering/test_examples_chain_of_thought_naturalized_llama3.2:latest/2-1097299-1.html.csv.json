We can see from Row 4 that federico hern\u00e1ndez denton is indeed a Chief Justice, so this meets one part of the condition.\n4. Now, we need to count how many judges have been appointed as Chief Justice out of all the judges in the table.\n5. There are 2 judges with \"Chief Justice\" rank (Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton and none other), but also another row has a chief justice with the name: federico hern\u00e1ndez denton is already considered, we need to check how many other exist: federico hern\u00e1ndez denton and 2 more.\n6. Thus, there are 3 judges who have been appointed as Chief Justice in total (federico hern\u00e1ndez denton and 2 others), which contradicts the claim \"just 1 of the judge be appoint as a chief justice\"\n7.

We can see that there are 8 judges with names mentioned in the table.\n\n\n#### Step 2: Count the number of judges with more than 10 years until mandatory retirement\nNext, we need to count how many judges have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement.\n\nFrom row 1 to row 9, we can see that:\n\n* Row 4 has 0 year until mandatory retirement (Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton).\n* Rows 5 and 6 do not meet the condition of having more than 10 years until mandatory retirement.\n* Rows 7 and 8 have 13 years and 15 years until mandatory retirement, respectively, which is less than or equal to 10 years. \n* Row 9 has 19 years until mandatory retirement.\n\nWe can see that only one judge meets this condition: Roberto Feliberti Cintr\u00f3n (row 9).\n\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the claim\nSince we are trying to find out if 2/3 of the judges have more than 10 years until their mandatory retirement, and there is only 1 judge meeting this condition. We can conclude that 2/8 = 0.25 which is less than 2/3\n\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the answer\nSince we determined in step 3 that only 1 out of the total judges meet the given conditions, and since that number was lower than the required ratio (2/3) we can conclude that the statement is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"There are 8 judges appointed\",\n      \"info\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Only one of those have more than 10 years until mandatory retirement\",\n      \"info\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"The number one judge meets the condition of having more than 10 years until his retirement\",\n      \"info\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"years until mandatory retirement\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n{",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Review the claim\nThe claim states that \"the chief justice be appoint in 2011\". This implies that the chief justice should have been appointed in 2011.\n\n#### Step 2: Find the relevant rows\nTo verify the claim, we need to check if there is a row where the rank is \"chief justice\" and the year appointed is 2011. We will look at the table for Row 4, which has the chief justice's information.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the claim\nAccording to Row 4 of the table, Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton is the chief justice and was appointed in 2004, not 2011.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine the answer\nSince the chief justice was not appointed in 2011 according to the table, we can conclude that the claim is FALSE.\n\n#### Step 5: List relevant cells\nWe don't need any specific data from the table for this problem as the final determination of our answer has already been made.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Reviewed the claim, found the relevant rows, verified the claim, determined the answer based on the table's information\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis output adheres strictly to the specified JSON format.",
