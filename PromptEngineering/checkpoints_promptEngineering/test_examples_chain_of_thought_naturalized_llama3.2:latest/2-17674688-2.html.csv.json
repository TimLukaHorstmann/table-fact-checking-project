    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the Nations in Question\nTo verify if the claim about Poland and France receiving 1 of each medal is true, we first need to confirm their respective counts for gold, silver, and bronze medals.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Medal Counts for Poland\nLooking at Row 6 of the table, we see that Poland has:\n- Gold: 0\n- Silver: 0\n- Bronze: 1\n\nThis matches the claim since Poland is said to receive 1 of each medal.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Medal Counts for France\nNext, examining Row 4, France has:\n- Gold: 0\n- Silver: 1\n- Bronze: 0\n\nThis also aligns with the claim because France receives 1 silver and no gold or bronze medals.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Claim Based on Verification\nGiven that both Poland and France are verified to have received exactly one of each medal type, as per the claim stated, we can now conclude whether the claim is true or false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Verified Poland has 1 bronze medal.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. We need to determine if all nations apart from China receive a bronze medal.\n2. Looking at the table, we see that Row 3 corresponds to China with no bronze medals (gold: 0, silver: 1, bronze: 0, total: 1).\n3. Since Row 3 is for China, which does not have a bronze medal, we need to check if all other nations apart from China also receive a bronze medal.\n4. Looking at Rows 4 and 5, both Canada and Poland do not receive any bronze medals (gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 1, total: 1).\n5. However, there are two more rows to consider in the list of nations apart from China (Rows 1 and 2). Rows 1 and 2 also have a bronze medal recipient.\n6.
