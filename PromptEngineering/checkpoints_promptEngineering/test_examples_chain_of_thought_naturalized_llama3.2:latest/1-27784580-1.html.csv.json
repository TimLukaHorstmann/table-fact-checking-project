    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the earliest broadcast date\nThe table shows the broadcast dates for each episode, but not the title. However, we can refer to the Japanese names of the episodes to identify the earliest one: \"Fukusy\u016b no Prop\u014dzu\" (the proposal out of revenge) with a romanized title of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\", and translation of \"the proposal out of revenge\". This is listed in row 3 as \"Unnamed: 0: ep 3\".\n\n#### Step 2: Look up the broadcast date for the episode identified by step 1\nFrom row 3, we know that the Romanized title is \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\", and the translation of the episode is \"the proposal out of revenge\". The relevant part to check from row 3 will be: \"broadcast date: may 24 , 2010\".\n\n\n#### Step 3: Check if Arienai kisu was broadcast 7 days after May 24th, 2010.\nWe can now calculate the 7 day difference between May 24th and June 1st (May 31st) to see how much time passed. There are only 6 full 24-hour periods from the 24th of May till the 31st of May - we just need to check that the episode aired on the first day of June.\n\n\n#### Step 4: Find Arienai kisu in the table and determine its broadcast date\nLooking at row 5, \"Unnamed: 0: ep 5\" has an episode title romanized as \"suki to ietara iinoni\", which translates to \"If only I could say, 'I like you'\", and a broadcast date of June 7 , 2010.\n\n\n#### Step 5: Compare the dates determined in steps 3 and 4\nJune 1st was 6 days after May 24th, not 7. Therefore, Arienai kisu was indeed broadcast 7 days after the earliest title with a broadcast date of May 24 , 2010.\n\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE based on step 5\nSince June 7, 2010 (the broadcast date for \"suki to ietara iinoni\") was indeed 7 days after May 31 , 2010 (the earliest title's broadcast date) according to our calculations, we can determine that the claim is TRUE.\n\n\n#### Step 7: Output the answer in JSON format\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"broadcast date\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The earliest broadcast date is May 10, 2010.\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate the difference in ratings\nWe need to calculate 3.2% of the rating of arieni kisu (19.2%) and then subtract this from the rating to see if it's less than the earliest broadcast title.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 2: Identify the relevant cells\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Step 3: Determine the earliest broadcast date.

According to Row 2, the episode \"\u3042\u308a\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30ad\u30b9\" (The Unthinkable Kiss) was broadcast on May 17, 2010, which is 7 days after May 10.\n\n#### Step 4: Check if there are any titles with an earlier date\nComparing the dates of other episodes, we see that none have an earlier date than May 17.\n\n#### Step 5: Compare the difference in days between May 17 and June 14\nAccording to Row 6, the episode \"\u6700\u7d42\u7ae0\u5e8f\u5e55\u30fb\u5225\u308c\" (A Prologue of Final Chapter - Farewell) was broadcast on June 14, 2010. The difference between May 17 and June 14 is 28 days.\n\n#### Step 6: Compare the claimed duration with the actual duration\nThe claim states that the title with the earliest broadcast date should be broadcast 14 days after its title. However, according to our calculation, there are not enough episodes with earlier dates (in a chain of at least two) for this condition to hold.\n\n#### Step 7: Check if there is any episode that is within 14 days before May 10\nLooking back to the row with earliest date of May 10, we find \"\u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3044\u3044\u306e\u306b\" broadcasted on June 7.

Comparing June 7, 2010 (from relevant cell 2) with June 14, 2010 (from relevant cell 3), we can also see that June 14 is more recent than the first one.\n\nSince \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has two different broadcast dates and they are not consecutive in time (May 24 comes before June 7 but June 14 comes after June 7), it cannot be said to have only the 2nd most recent broadcast date.\n\nHowever, considering the initial interpretation that the claim refers to a comparison with another single row where \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" appears and has a more recent date than May 24, we find such a cell in Row 6 with June 14 as its broadcast date. Therefore, June 14 can be considered the most recent among all occurrences of \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu,\" implying that it doesn't have the 2nd most recent but rather is itself the most recent one.\n\nThe claim seems to be misunderstood in the initial interpretation; however, re-evaluating strictly according to how the claim is phrased, we find that Row 5 (broadcast date: June 7) actually precedes the earliest mentioned \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" in row 3. This suggests a misinterpretation of what was sought - whether \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has the second most recent broadcast, given it itself is part of that sequence.\n\nGiven this clarification and sticking strictly to the claim as stated, comparing its earliest occurrence's date (May 24) against another instance's date to see if it's the 2nd most recent:\n\n- The first \"fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu\" has a more recent broadcast date than any other except one mentioned before it and after it. This implies there is at least one other that is more recent, making the claim FALSE.\n\n#### Step 5: Compile findings into JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated as 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu have the 2nd most recent broadcast date'\",\n    \"Step 2: Locate relevant cells in table for evaluation\",\n    \"Step 3: Compare broadcast dates of 'fukusy\u016b no purop\u014dzu' to determine if it has the 2nd most recent one\",\n    \"Step 4: Analyze comparison result, realizing that the claim does not apply correctly based on its wording\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"Broadcast date\", \"value\": \"May 24 , 2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Broadcast date\", \"value\": \"June 7 , 2010\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Broadcast date\", \"value\": \"June 14 , 2010\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
