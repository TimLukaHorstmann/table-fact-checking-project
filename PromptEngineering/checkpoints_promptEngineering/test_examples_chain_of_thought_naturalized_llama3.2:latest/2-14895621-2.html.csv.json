But row 4 tells us that Kang Haeng-Suk won with Hwang Sun once.\n\nNow let\u2019s review what else can tell us more about Hwang Sun and her wins:\n \n- Row 6 has an event named \"wd\" (short for World Doubles), it's in 1985, and the partner is Kang Haeng-Suk. This indicates that one of their wins was indeed in 1985.\n \nNow we need to go back to row 4: since this row contains information about Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk\u2019s partnership (winning \"wd\" in 1982) , it seems like we do have some relevant data.\n\nLet's continue evaluating the claim:\n \n- We know from row 6 that one of their wins was in 1985.\n  \nHowever, according to row 4, another win took place in 1982. But only for the \"wd\" event (short for World Doubles), not the \"double woman's double event\".\n\nSince we are looking for evidence of Hwang Sun\u2019s participation and a first-place finish in a specific event (\"double woman's double event\"), row 6 provides information about one more win by Kang Haeng-Suk, which was indeed with Hwang Sun. However, there is no other direct data that links to the \"double woman's double event\".\n\nNow let us consider whether we can find evidence of a first-place finish in that event.\n \nHowever, based on our findings so far (row 4 provides information about a partnership win for the \"wd\" event), we cannot confirm if Hwang Sun also won in the \"double woman's double event\".\n  \n- In order to provide an answer to the claim \"in 1982 , hwang sun participate in the asian game in the double woman 's double event , finish first , 1 of 2 time she win an event with kang haeng\", it seems necessary to determine whether there is evidence for a first-place finish.\n \nHowever, given our analysis so far, we cannot find any direct information that would confirm this claim.\n\n#### Step 4: Draw conclusions based on the findings\nBased on our review of the table, we can conclude that:\n- There are some wins by Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk in 1982 (short for World Doubles), as indicated by row 4.\n- A first-place finish is mentioned, but only for the \"wd\" event.\n- We cannot confirm a first-place finish for the specific event of interest (\"double woman's double event\").\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the final answer\nGiven that we have found some relevant information about Hwang Sun and Kang Haeng-Suk\u2019s partnership in row 4, but we are unable to find any direct evidence supporting the claim about her participation in the \"double woman's double event\" or a first-place finish there, we can say:\n\n- The table does not provide sufficient information to confirm all aspects of the claim.\n\nHowever, since our task was to determine whether the statement is true or false and considering that we found some related information:\n \nThe truth value for this specific question seems to be: FALSE",

Looking at the table, in Row 3, the outcome is \"asian games\", and the partner is also \"asian games\". This matches our criteria.\n\n4.

However, the exact match can be found in Row 6 where the event is 'wd' (most likely referring to Asian games) with a different venue.\n    - Moving forward to find a more direct connection.\n\n2. **Find the row containing the partner's name \"hwang sun\" and year 1985**:\n    - Looking at Row 6, we see that Hwang Sun participates in the event 'wd' (which likely refers to Asian Games) with Kang Haeng-Suk as their partner.\n    - However, this is still not a direct match for our claim about participating in \"asian games\" and winning an event.\n\n3. **Find the row containing the outcome \"asian games\" for the year 1985**:\n    - Looking at Row 6 again, we see that it's an Asian Games event with venue 'india open' (which is incorrect) or more directly the venue of the event should be specified to know if it indeed was Asian Games.

This can be done by looking for a row where the outcome is \"1\", the partner is \"kang haeng - suk\" in row 6 of the table, and the event is also \"wd\". In this case, it's found that Hwang Sun indeed won another tournament \"2 years after win the world championship\" in year 1987. \n\n4. Lastly, we need to confirm if there was no other tournament won by Hwang Sun 2 years after winning the first time (which is in row 5) and this can be verified as it has an outcome of \"other open tournaments\". As stated, this doesn't contradict our findings from step 3.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identify year after which Hwang Sun won the world championship\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Find row where Hwang Sun finished first after winning the world championship\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Verify if there was another tournament won by Hwang Sun 2 years after the 1985 world championship year\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"year\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"outcome\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"partner\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps for my reasoning process:\n\n1. Determine which row(s) in the table contain information about Hwang Sun's partner being Kang Haeng-suk.\n   - These rows will be Rows 2, 4, and 6.\n\n2. For each of these rows, determine if the outcome is \"other open tournaments\" or if the outcome is a number (specifically 1 or 3).\n   - Row 5 has an outcome of \"other open tournaments\", so this row does not meet the criteria.\n   - Rows 2 and 6 have outcomes that are numbers. For these rows, I will verify that they are indeed Hwang Sun's results.\n\n3. Verify if each number in Steps 2 is indeed a result achieved by Hwang Sun with Kang Haeng-suk as her partner from 1982 to 1985.\n   - Row 2: The year given is 1985 which meets the criteria, but I must confirm that \"wd\" represents an event that matches what we know about the WD format and that it was a competition in which Hwang Sun achieved this score with Kang Haeng-suk. \n   - Row 4: The year given is 1982, so this also meets the criteria.\n   - Row 6: Similar to Step 3a, I must confirm if \"wd\" represents an event that matches what we know about the WD format and if Hwang Sun achieved a score with Kang Haeng-suk. Also, I need to find out which venue it was.\n\n4. Now, verify that all venues for each of these numbers (Steps 3a-6) are indeed different venues.\n   - Row 2's competition, \"wd\" in 1985 at Calgary , Canada, is a unique venue.\n   - Row 4's competition, also \"wd\" in 1982 at New Delhi , India, is another unique venue. \n   - Row 6's competition, again \"wd\" in 1985 but this time at the \"india open\", is yet another unique venue.\n\n5. Since I have found all of the necessary information (Steps 3-4) that the claim can be verified with, now let me conclude:\n   - As I've been able to find instances where Hwang Sun achieved first place with Kang Haeng-suk in different venues from 1982 to 1985, I must verify one more thing: does this make the claim true?\n   - Based on my analysis above, for the outcomes of 1 and 3 in rows 4 and 2 respectively, it is not stated that Hwang Sun was with Kang Haeng-suk as her partner. In Row 6, I found a venue (\"india open\") which doesn't appear anywhere else in this claim.\n   - Therefore, for the statement to be true, both of these numbers must have had Kang Haeng-suk as their partner (which they do), and they should also be at a different location.\n\n6. As the claim is not entirely accurate because it implies that Hwang Sun achieved first place with Kang Haeng-suk in three venues from 1982 to 1985 without specifying India open , my final answer will reflect this.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Determine which row(s) contain information about Hwang Sun's partner being Kang Haeng-suk.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 2: For each of these rows, determine if the outcome is \\\"other open tournaments\\\" or if the outcome is a number (specifically 1 or 3).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 3: Verify if each number in Step 2 is indeed a result achieved by Hwang Sun with Kang Haeng-suk as her partner from 1982 to 1985.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 4: Now, verify that all venues for each of these numbers are indeed different venues.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 5: Since I have found all of the necessary information (Steps 3-4) that the claim can be verified with, now let me conclude\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"venue\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
