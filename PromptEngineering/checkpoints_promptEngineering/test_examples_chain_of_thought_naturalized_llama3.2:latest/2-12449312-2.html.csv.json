To do this, we can look at row 16 of the table.\n   - Relevant cell: `row_index=16`, `column_name=\"total\"`\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total medal tally for Chile in 2007. To do this, we can look at row 15 of the table.\n   - Relevant cell: `row_index=15`, `column_name=\"total\"`\n\n3. Now that we have the total medal tally for Chile in both years, we need to compare it to double the total from 2007. Double the total from 2007 is calculated as `2 * row_15.total`.\n   - Relevant cell: `row_index=15`, `column_name=\"total\"`\n   - Calculation: `2 * row_15.total = 2 * 20 = 40`\n\n4. After calculating double the total from 2007, we can now compare Chile's total medal tally in 2011 to this value.\n   - Relevant cell: `row_index=16`, `column_name=\"total\"`\n\n5. Finally, we can determine if Chile over double its total medal tally in 2011 by comparing the two values calculated above.\n   - Calculation: `row_16.total > 2 * row_15.total`\n   - Calculation simplification:\n     - `row_16.total = 43`\n     - `2 * row_15.total = 40`\n\n6.

There is no information about Chile winning any silver medals in 1951. So, this row does not meet the condition.\n4. **Analyze Rows 2-14**: We need to check if Chile won 10 or more silver medals in these years:\n\t* Row 2 (1955): Chile has a total of 7 silver medals.\n\t* Row 3 (1959) and onwards: The available data does not indicate that Chile won 10 or more silver medals.\n5. **Analyze Row 17 (Total)**: This row represents the overall count for all countries, including Chile. Although it shows Chile having a high number of silver medals, it's not relevant to our specific claim since we are looking for instances where Chile specifically met the condition in 1951, 2003, and 2011.\n6. **Analyze Row 4 (1963)**: In this row, Chile has a total of 2 silver medals.\n7. **Analyze Rows 5-11**: The available data does not indicate that Chile won 10 or more silver medals in these years.\n8. **Analyze Row 12 (1995)**: In this row, Chile has a total of 6 silver medals.\n9. **Analyze Rows 13 and 14 (1999 and 2003)**: Although Chile had a higher number of silver medals in Row 14, it is only specified that there was no instance where they won 10 or more silver medals before this year. There are no other instances mentioned between these two dates.\n10. **Analyze Row 15 (2007)**: In this row, Chile has a total of 5 silver medals.\n11. **Analyze Rows 16 and 17**: The available data does not indicate that Chile won 10 or more silver medals in these years.\n12. **Check for the third instance in Row 3-15**: Only rows 14 (2003) and none other than row 17 are relevant to our claim.
