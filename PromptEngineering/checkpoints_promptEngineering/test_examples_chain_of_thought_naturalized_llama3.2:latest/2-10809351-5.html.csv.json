    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the condition for a team's score to be considered less than 10**: According to the table, we need to check if the away team's score (found in column \"Away Team Score\") is less than 10.00.\n\n2. **Find the relevant cells where this condition can be applied**:\n   - Row 1: away team score = 6.12 (48)\n   - Row 5: away team score = 6.14 (50) \n   - Row 6: away team score = 14.21 (105)\n\n3. **Count the number of rows where this condition is met**:\n   - There are two matches where an away team's score is less than 10.\n\n4. **Consider if the given claim requires the count to be equal to 3**: The claim states that a total of 3 away teams have an away team score less than 10.00. Since we found only 2 rows meeting this criterion, it seems the claim might not hold true for all cases as stated.\n\n5. **Consider if there are indeed more than three teams**:\n   - There's no indication in the provided table that any other team has a score under 10. \n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on our analysis, we can safely conclude that the claim about \"a total of 3 away team have an away team score less than 10.00\" is FALSE since only two teams meet this criterion.\n\n7. **Output the final answer in JSON format**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"Away Team Score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
