    "resp": "### Step 1: Identify the claim\nThe claim states that the vessel \"gallion\" has the lowest maximum speed of 26 knots.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the relevant information from the table\nTo verify the claim, we need to find the maximum speed of each vessel in the table and compare it with the claimed value (26 knots) for the gallion vessel.\n\n### Step 3: Find the row for the gallion vessel\nThe gallion vessel is listed in Row 1 of the table.\n\n### Step 4: Extract the relevant information from Row 1\nFrom Row 1, we have:\n- max speed = 30 knots\n\n### Step 5: Compare with the claimed value\nSince 30 knots is greater than 26 knots, the gallion vessel's maximum speed does not match the claimed lowest maximum speed of 26 knots.\n\n### Step 6: Identify another vessel for comparison\nTo determine if there is a lower maximum speed than 26 knots, we need to look at other vessels. Row 6 contains the Marianarray with a max speed of 26 knots.\n\n### Step 7: Verify the claim\nSince the Marianarray's max speed (26 knots) is indeed less than that of the gallion vessel (30 knots), and it has the lowest listed max speed, the claim is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Determine the relevant information from the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find the row for the gallion vessel\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Extract the relevant information from Row 1\",\n      \"values\": {\n        \"max_speed\": \"30 knots\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Compare with the claimed value\",\n      \"claim_value\": \"26 knots\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identify another vessel for comparison\",\n      \"column_name\": \"propulsion\",\n      \"row_index\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Verify the claim\",\n      \"values\": {\n        \"max_speed\": \"26 knots\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"max speed\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"max speed\" }\n  ]\n}",
