This means we need to check if Nikola Kova\u010devi\u0107 was part of the Gabeca Montichiari team in 2008.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate relevant information about 2008 clubs\nWe need to look at row 2 for the name \"dejan bojovi\u0107\" and row 5 for the name \"vlado petkovi\u0107\", as well as rows 7, 10, and 11 which also have names associated with them.

Determine the relevance of each cell in the table to this claim:\n   - Rows related to women's teams (no row with name, height, weight, spike and 2008 club is given) are irrelevant.\n   - Row that contains information about the male team roster is relevant for analyzing a possible female team roster but doesn't help us directly.\n   - Each row in the table has information about clubs: rpa perugia, gabeca montichiari, copra nordmeccanica, marmi lanza verona, tours vb, trentino volley, sparkling milano, lube banca marche, m roma volley, famigliulo corigliano and budu\u0107nost podgorica.\n   - Budu\u0107nost podgorica seems to be the relevant club as per claim. Therefore only those who have played for this club are considered.\n\n3. Find how many players are from the Podgorica club of Budu\u0107nost:\n   - According to row 5, vlado petkovi\u0107 is a male player from budu\u0107nost podgorica.\n   - Also, according to row 11, sa\u0161a starovi\u0107 is also a male player from budu\u0107nost podgorica.\n\n4. Determine if the number of players from the Podgorica club meets the claim's criteria:\n   - The claim states that 2 people on a female team roster come from the Podgorica club of Budu\u0107nost.\n   - There are no rows with information about women in the table, thus it can be assumed there is no female team roster. Since this would mean the criteria cannot be met, we could say the statement false but let's continue further.\n\n5. Re-examine the statement that 2 people on a female team roster come from budu\u0107nost podgorica.\n   - As per claim, there are two players (vlado petkovi\u0107 and sa\u0161a starovi\u0107) with club information matching budu\u0107nost podgorica. However they could be from any gender.\n   - There's no information available in the table that confirms or denies the genders of these players.\n\n6. The only way we can continue is to analyze whether there are two female players on a team roster that come from the club Budu\u0107nost Podgorica:\n   - Unfortunately, due to lack of females data being provided for the teams mentioned in row 2-12 it cannot be concluded if any of these players were women.\n\n7.
