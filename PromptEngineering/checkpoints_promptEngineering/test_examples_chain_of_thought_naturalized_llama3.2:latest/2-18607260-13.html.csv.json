Looking at the table, we see that Row 11 corresponds to a World Cup game on June 12, with the venue listed as \"stade de la mosson montpellier\", which is located in France.\n3. However, this does not necessarily confirm that all four games took place in France, so let's continue examining the rest of the table.\n4. Row 12 also corresponds to a World Cup game on June 19, with the venue listed as \"stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne\", which is located in France.\n5. However, we must now consider whether this information alone is enough to verify the claim.\n6. We notice that Row 13 has a score and report, but no country or city associated with it. This is because the match was abandoned due to a goal being scored during injury time (aet), hence, the team playing at home were declared the winner by a single goal.\n7. Row 14 corresponds to a World Cup game on June 28, but its score and report do not provide information about the location of the venue.\n8. Now we have examined all relevant information for the claim.\n9. Since there is evidence that three games took place in France during June 1998 (Row 11, Row 12, and Row 14), it seems reasonable to conclude that the fourth game must also be in France.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"evaluate claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"check Row 11 for World Cup game on June 12, with venue stade de la mosson montpellier in France\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Row 11 World Cup game did take place in France, but does not confirm all four games took place here \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"check Row 12 for World Cup game on June 19, with venue stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne in France\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Row 12 World Cup game did take place in France, but does not confirm all four games took place here \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"check Row 13 for abandoned World Cup game on June 24 with unknown location\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"text\": \"Row 13 is an abandonment, does not confirm game took place in France. \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"text\": \"check Row 14 for World Cup game on June 28, but score and report do not provide location of the venue\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 9,\n      \"text\": \"We have now examined all relevant information for the claim.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 10,\n      \"text\": \"Since we verified three games in France and only two more were unknown, it seems reasonable to assume that fourth game must also be in France\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"venue\"}\n  ]\n}",

Looking at the table, we can see that there are several World Cup matches listed under rows 11-14.\n3. The dates of these World Cup matches are June 12, June 19, and two dates after that (June 24 and June 28).\n4. However, none of the World Cup matches in July 1998 are explicitly mentioned in the table.\n5. We need to look at rows 11-14 more closely to see if any of these matches were played in Japan.\n6. Row 11 mentions a match on June 12, which is not in July, and the venue is France, not Japan.\n7. Row 12 also mentions a match on June 19, which is not in July, and the venue is France, not Japan.\n8. Row 13 mentions a match on June 24, which is not in July, but it does mention that the match was played in France, and then there's row 14 mentioning a different date and different result for a match played in Lens, but still no match in July 1998 in Japan.\n9. However we can see that two other games were played in Japan on June 21 and June 17, which are close to july 1998\n10. Looking at the claim more carefully now we realize we have to look for 3 game throughout july 1998 in japan , the closest dates to july are june 21st and june 17th.\n11. Now let's go back and double-check that there aren't any other games on july 1st, july 2nd or July 3rd that could have been omitted\n12. The only other game played in july is from row 14 with the result 0 -0 ( 1-0 aet ) which was actually played on June 28th and then another one in row 13 which was also not in july.\n13. Now we can safely say that there are two games that were close to july but actually played on june so we need to check the remaining rows again, from 15-20\n14.

The relevant rows are:\n- Row 11: date: 1998 - 06 - 12, venue: stade de la mosson montpellier , france, score: 0 - 0, comp: world cup, report: report.\n- Row 12: date: 1998 - 06 - 19, venue: stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne , france, score: 0 - 0, comp: world cup, report: report.\n- Row 13: date: 1998 - 06 - 24, venue: stade de toulouse toulouse , france, score: 1 - 3, comp: world cup, report: report.\n- Row 14: date: 1998 - 06 - 28, venue: stade f\u00e9lix bollaert lens , france, score: 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet ), comp: world cup, report: report.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the first game of World Cup\nWe need to verify which one is the first match. The dates are June 12th and June 14th and June 17th for the three games mentioned above, however, there is no indication that row 11 was played before row 13 and row 14 since June 28th date in row 14 indicate this game was the third one (due to a 30min overtime) thus we should verify the information of Row 12.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify row 12\nRow 12 is from June 19, which indicates that row 11 has been played before row 12.\nSince the score in row 11 is 0-0, neither team scored a goal. This satisfies our claim since we verified it was the first match.\n\n#### Step 5: Output the answer and relevant information\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Find the relevant information\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Determine the first game of World Cup\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Verify row 12\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to check the table for any games played on June 18 and June 28.\n2. Looking at Row 11 of the table, I see a game played on June 12, but no game played on June 18.\n3. However, in Row 14, there is a game played on June 28 with a score of 0-0 (1-0 aet).\n4. Since the claim states that both games have a score of 2-0, I need to check if either of these games had this specific score.\n5. Upon reviewing Row 11 and Row 14 again, I see that neither game has a score of 2-0; one is 0-0 (1-0 aet) and the other is 0-0 with no report for the second part of the score.\n6. However, looking at row 13 in the table which is played on june 24 , it says stade de toulouse toulouse, france - score: 1 - 3; comp: world cup, report: report. Then checking Row 14, there's a game with a score of 0-0 (1-0 aet) and not \"2-0\". However, looking at row 12 which is played on june 19, it says stade geoffroy - guichard saint - \u00e9tienne , france - score: 0 - 0. Then looking again at Row 13 we see that it also has the same score as row 12 \"0-0\" with a different comp but this time aet.\n7. I have to review other relevant rows to make sure all games for june 18 and 28 are checked but then checking further down the table, there's no more information about either date being played on June 18 or June 28 that has a score of 2-0.\n8. The only two dates that match \"june 18\" and \"june 28\" and have their scores evaluated in the previous step are rows 12 and 14, which both report \"0-0\" with no further information about having a 2-0 score for June 18 (only row 13 has this but not in june 18; it's june 24) - or rather does have a non-zero score on june 24 but that is the only other date where we evaluated the \"june 18\" and \"june 28\" dates in the table.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"report\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
