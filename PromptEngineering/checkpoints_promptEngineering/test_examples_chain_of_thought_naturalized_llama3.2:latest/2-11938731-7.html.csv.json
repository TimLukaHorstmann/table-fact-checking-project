Otherwise, it must be false.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the condition that there should only be one player with fewer than 2 tackles.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Examine the table structure to locate relevant columns for tackling statistics.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Locate the 'tackles' column in each row of the table.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check each row's tackles statistic to identify players with fewer than 2 tackles and their corresponding counts.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Count all instances where a player has fewer than 2 tackles.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_index\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Determine the truth value of the claim based on this count against the assertion that there should only be one such player.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"tackles\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Locate the column for solo tackles in the table.\nTo determine if the claim about the player with the highest number of solo tackles is true, first locate the column that contains this information. In this case, it's called \"solo\".\n\n#### Step 2: Find the row with the highest value in the \"solo\" column.\nNext, identify the row(s) where the \"solo\" values are the largest. This requires looking at each row and comparing their \"solo\" tackle numbers to find the highest.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Row 15 for its solo tackles value.\nIn this case, we can quickly see that Lee Larsen has a solo tackle value of 2, which is lower than many other players.\n\n#### Step 4: Check all rows to confirm if anyone else has more solo tackles.\nGo through each row from Row 1 to Row 14 and compare their \"solo\" values. This will ensure no one else has as many solo tackles as Lee Larsen.\n\n#### Step 5: Confirm there is no other player with a higher number of solo tackles than Lee Larsen.\nAfter comparing all the rows, confirm if indeed there's no player who has more solo tackles than Lee Larsen. If such a player exists, then the claim is false; otherwise, it remains true.\n\n#### Conclusion Based on Reasoning:\nBased on the comparison in Step 4, since we've checked each row and haven't found anyone with as many or more solo tackles, Lee Larsen indeed has one of the highest numbers among all players considered. However, to be sure if he's the player with the \"highest\" number (considering the context might imply total or another metric), further clarification would be needed for absolute certainty.\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"1\",\n      \"description\": \"Locate the column for solo tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"2\",\n      \"description\": \"Find the row with the highest value in the solo column\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"3\",\n      \"description\": \"Analyze Row 15 for its solo tackles value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"4\",\n      \"description\": \"Check all rows to confirm if anyone else has more solo tackles\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"5\",\n      \"description\": \"Confirm there is no other player with a higher number of solo tackles than Lee Larsen\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\", // Since we found another player (Lee isn't actually the highest)\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 15, \"column_name\": \"solo\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"solo\"}\n  ]\n}",
