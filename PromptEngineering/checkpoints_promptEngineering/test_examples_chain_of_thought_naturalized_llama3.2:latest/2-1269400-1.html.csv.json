    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. The claim mentions Tomasz Sikora participating in the 1994 Lillehammer event.\n   - Check if Tomasz Sikora participated in the 1994 Lillehammer event by looking at row 1 of the table where \"event\" and \"individual\" are located.\n\n2. In row 1, the \"individual\" is not filled, which indicates that information about individual participants for this event might be missing.\n   - Since there's no relevant data in the provided table to confirm or deny Tomasz Sikora's participation in the 1994 Lillehammer individual event, we proceed with caution.\n\n3. However, since the claim specifically mentions \"sprint\" and not just any event, let's verify if Tomasz Sikora participated in the sprint.\n   - The sprint results are located in column \"sprint\".\n\n4. In row 1 of the table, there is no information about who finished in which position in the sprint event because the column for this is empty (-).\n   - This indicates that while we cannot confirm participation due to missing data in the individual category, there's insufficient information about performance in any category.\n\n5. Since the claim directly references a specific outcome (32nd at the sprint) and we can't verify either participation or the exact result due to incomplete data, let's check if Tomasz Sikora has an entry for this event that might confirm his presence.\n\n6. There is no direct entry for individual performance in row 1 to accurately assess if the claim about finishing 32nd could be verified directly from the table.\n   - Hence, without explicit information on participation or a specific result, we cannot definitively confirm the claim's truthfulness based solely on the provided data.\n\n7. Given that there is no concrete evidence of Tomasz Sikora participating in the event (individual or otherwise) with sufficient detail to verify the 32nd place finish in sprint according to the table\u2019s current information,\n   - The statement as presented cannot be definitively confirmed true by examining the given details in the table.\n\n8.

Next, we need to verify that Tomasz Sikora finished 7th in the individual event at the 2010 Vancouver event. The table shows that he indeed finished 7th in the individual event at the 2010 Vancouver event.\n\n3. Since the claim is saying that there is no value for the individual at the 1994 Lillehammer event but Tomasz Sikora still managed to finish 7th in the individual event at the 2010 Vancouver event, we need to check if the absence of a value at one event means he couldn't have finished well at another.\n\n4. However, we can see from row 5 that there is no information about his performance in other events like sprint, pursuit and mass start in the 1994 Lillehammer. The only information available for that event is the individual event where Tomasz Sikora didn't show any value (-), meaning he couldn't have been at 7th place.\n\n5.

He is indeed ranked below the 20th.\n\n```json\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"sprint\"},\n    {\"value\": \"28\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nSince Tomasz Sikora has finished above the 32nd position in the sprint (28th) and below the 20th position in the sprint is not required to be true for the claim, we can conclude that the statement is false.\n\n```json\n\"chain_of_thought\": \"Tomasz Sikora is ranked 28th in the sprint.
