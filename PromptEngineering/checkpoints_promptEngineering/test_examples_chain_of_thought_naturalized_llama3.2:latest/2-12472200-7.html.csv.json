    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, let's check if Olga Govortsova won at least 5 Grand Slam tournaments in any given year from 2007-2011.\n\n2. We need to find the number of Grand Slam tournament matches won by Olga Govortsova for each year separately. \n\n3. For 2007, according to cell row 6, column \"win - loss\", we see that Olga Govortsova had a win-loss record of 2-2 in Grand slam tournaments.\n\n4. For 2008, according to the same cell, we see that she lost more matches than she won. Hence her total number of wins will be 3.\n\n5. For 2009, again from row 6, column \"win - loss\", Olga Govortsova had a win-loss record of 3-4 in Grand slam tournaments.\n\n6. For 2010, according to the same cell, we see that she lost more matches than she won. Hence her total number of wins will be 1.\n\n7. For 2011, again from row 6, column \"win - loss\", Olga Govortsova had a win-loss record of 1-4 in Grand slam tournaments.\n\n8. To evaluate the claim that Olga Govortsova won at least 5 Grand Slam tournament matches in any given year from 2007-2011, we need to check if she has won more than or equal to 5 matches for each year separately\n\n9. For 2007, her total number of wins is 2 and it is less than 5.\n\n10. For 2008, her total number of wins is 3 and it is also less than 5.\n\n11. For 2009, her total number of wins is 3 and it is also less than 5.\n\n12. For 2010, her total number of wins is 1 and it is also less than 5.\n\n13. For 2011, her total number of wins is 1 and it is also less than 5.\n\n\n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, the claim that \"Olga Govortsova have win at least 5 grand slam tournament match in any give year from 2007 - 2011\" is FALSE.\n\n\n\nHere's how we can represent this reasoning as a valid JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Check if Olga Govortsova won at least 5 Grand Slam tournaments in any given year from 2007-2011\",\n      \"input\": null,\n      \"output\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Find the number of Grand Slam tournament matches won by Olga Govortsova for each year separately.\",\n      \"input\": row 6 column \"win - loss\" cells from 2007-2011,\n      \"output\": [\n        {\"year\": 2007, \"wins\": 2},\n        {\"year\": 2008, \"wins\": 3},\n        {\"year\": 2009, \"wins\": 3},\n        {\"year\": 2010, \"wins\": 1},\n        {\"year\": 2011, \"wins\": 1}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: For each year, check if Olga Govortsova won at least 5 Grand Slam tournament matches\",\n      \"input\": row 6 column \"win - loss\" cells from 2007-2011,\n      \"output\": [\n        {\"year\": 2007, \"wins\": 2, \"result\": false},\n        {\"year\": 2008, \"wins\": 3, \"result\": false},\n        {\"year\": 2009, \"wins\": 3, \"result\": false},\n        {\"year\": 2010, \"wins\": 1, \"result\": false},\n        {\"year\": 2011, \"wins\": 1, \"result\": false}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\",\n      \"year\": 2007\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\",\n      \"year\": 2008\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\",\n      \"year\": 2009\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\",\n      \"year\": 2010\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"win - loss\",\n      \"year\": 2011\n    }\n  ]\n}",
