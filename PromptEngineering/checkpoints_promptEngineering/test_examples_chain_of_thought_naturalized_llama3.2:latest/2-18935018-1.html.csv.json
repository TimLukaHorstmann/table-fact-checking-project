In Row 5, we can see that the school's information includes \"enrollment: 397\", \"ihsaa class: aa\", and \"county: 16 decatur\". This data allows us to identify North Decatur but does not directly confirm their primary conference.\n\n3. Looking further into Row 5, we find the field labeled \"primary conference\" which indicates that this is indeed where we will determine North Decatur's primary conference affiliation.\n\n4. Next, we must verify whether the specified primary conference corresponds with Ohio River Valley. This requires us to look at both columns related to conferences: 'primary conference' and 'primary conference:'. \n\n5. In Row 4 of our table, we find that 'milan', whose county is 69 ripley (similar as a county number), is part of the 'Ohio River Valley' primary conference.\n\n6. Finally, since there is an Ohio River Valley primary conference mentioned in Row 4 and no other row has this affiliation for North Decatur's school, it can be said that the claim about \"north decatur do not have ohio river valley as their primary conference\" is actually false.\n\n7.
