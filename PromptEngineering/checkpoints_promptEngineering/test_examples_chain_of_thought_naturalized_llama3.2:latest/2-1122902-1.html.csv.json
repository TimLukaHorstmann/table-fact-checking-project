    "predicted_response": 1,
    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the completion time of Alain Prost from the table.\n   The relevant cell for Alain Prost's information can be found at Row 1 with column name \"time / retired\". Therefore, its value is \"1:35:13.284\".\n\n2. Next, we need to identify the runner-up driver and their completion time from the table.\n   To do this, we must first determine who the runner-up is by looking for the row with a positive completion time that comes immediately after Alain Prost's in the sorted order of laps (in case there are drivers with the same number of laps but different completion times). However, since there isn't an explicit \"next\" or \"runner-up\" column given in the table directly, we'll rely on the fact that the completion time is given as \"+ 23.911\". Since this indicates how much faster than Alain Prost it took for Michele Alboreto to complete his race, and considering the information about Alboreto comes immediately after Alain's in the sorted order of laps, we can infer that Michele Alboreto must be the runner-up.\n\n3. Now, we need to compare Alain Prost's completion time with the runner-up driver (Michele Alboreto) to check if his record is faster.\n   The completion time for Michele Alboreto is given as \"+ 23.911\". This means he was 23.911 seconds behind Alain Prost.\n\n4. Determine whether Alain Prost's record of 1:35:13.284 is indeed faster than the runner-up's completion time of +23.911 seconds.\n   Since Alain Prost took 1:35:13.284, which is obviously less than the positive value of +23.911 for Michele Alboreto (as a positive number indicates a time behind), it can be concluded that Alain Prost indeed recorded a faster completion time compared to the runner-up.\n\n5. Confirm if the statement about Alain Prost setting a record by being faster than the next driver, which is Michele Alboreto, is true.\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": {\n    \"Step 1: Identify Alain Prost's completion time\",\n    \"Step 2: Determine the runner-up and their completion time\",\n    \"Step 3: Compare Alain Prost's completion time with the runner-up's\"\n  },\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": undefined, \"column_name\": \"+\"}\n  ]\n}",

In F1 races, the fastest driver is generally determined by their qualifying time before any laps are taken during the actual race.
