We'll start by listing these rows:\n   - Row 1: Botswana Defence Force XI vs Mbabane Highlanders\n   - Row 2: Arsenal (Maseru) vs Eleven Arrows FC\n   - Row 3: CD El\u00e1 Nguema vs Primeiro de Agosto\n   - Row 4: LPRC Oilers vs Mighty Blackpool\n   - Row 5: ASC Police vs AS Real Bamako\n   - Row 6: Port Autonome vs Sporting Clube da Praia\n   - Row 7: Saint-Georges SA vs Al Ittihad\n   - Row 8: Saint-Louis FC vs Young Africans\n   - Row 9: Sahel SC vs Postel Sport\n   - Row 10: Tourbillon FC vs Forces Arm\u00e9es CA\n\n2. **Extract the score from each relevant row**: Next, we'll extract the scores mentioned in these rows:\n   ```\n[\n   {\"score\": \"1-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"3-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"2-3\"},\n   {\"score\": \"1-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"1-1\"},\n   {\"score\": \"0-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"2-1\"},\n   {\"score\": \"1-3\"},\n   {\"score\": \"2-1\"},\n   {\"score\": \"0-0\"}\n ]\n```\n3. **Compare each score with the others to find duplicates**: We'll now compare these scores to see if there are any duplicates:\n   ```\n[\n   {\"score\": \"1-0\"}, // duplicate\n   {\"score\": \"3-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"2-3\"},\n   {\"score\": \"1-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"1-1\"},\n   {\"score\": \"0-0\"},\n   {\"score\": \"2-1\"},\n   {\"score\": \"1-3\"},\n   {\"score\": \"2-1\"},\n   {\"score\": \"0-0\"}\n ]\n```\n   We can see that there are two unique scores: `1-0` and `3-0`.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim is about comparing the 4th game on the list to the 6th game on the list in terms of score.\n\n2. **Locate the games on the list**:\n   - The 4th game on the list is located in Row 4.\n   - The 6th game on the list is located in Row 6.\n\n3. **Extract relevant information from Rows 4 and 6**:\n   - From Row 4, we have `team_1: lprc oilers, agg: 2 - 3`\n   - From Row 6, we have `team_1: port autonome, agg: 0 - 0 (1 - 3)`\n\n4. **Determine the scores for each game**:\n   - The score for the 4th game is 2-3.\n   - The score for the 6th game is 1-3.\n\n5. **Compare the scores**: Since 1 < 2, the 4th game has a higher score than the 6th game.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the comparison of the scores, the claim that \"the 4th game on the list be a higher scoring game than the sixth game on the list\" is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identify the claim: The claim is about comparing the 4th game on the list to the 6th game on the list in terms of score.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Locate the games on the list: The 4th game on the list is located in Row 4.
