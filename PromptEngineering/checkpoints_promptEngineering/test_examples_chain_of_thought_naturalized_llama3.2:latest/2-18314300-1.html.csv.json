This means we need to check if Cyprus has any clubs that appear in every season.\n\n#### Step 2: Check for clubs in all seasons\nLet's look at the table and see which clubs appear in multiple seasons. We can start by checking Row 4, where the country is \"cyprus\" and the club is \"omonia nicosia\". This means that Omonia Nicosia appears in the 2000/01 season.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for Cyprus clubs in other seasons\nWe need to check if there are any other clubs from Cyprus that appear in all seasons.

    "predicted_response": 0,
    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim about FC Denderleeuw 2002/03 scoring the lowest amount of goals, we need to first identify their total number of goals during that season.\n\n2. We can find this information in Row 6 of the table: `season: 2002 / 03, club: fc denderleeuw, country: belgium, apps: 32, goals: 23.`\n\n3. Now we need to check if 23 is indeed the lowest amount of goals scored by any team during that season.\n\n4. To do this, we should compare 23 with the total number of goals scored by all other teams in the same season (2002/03).\n\n5. We can find this information in Row 14: `season: total, club: last updated, country: 8 july 2009, apps: 302, goals: 132.`\n\n6. However, to determine if 23 is indeed the lowest amount of goals scored by any team during that season, we need to know the number of games played by each team in that season.\n\n7. We can find this information in Row 2 and Row 3 for KSC Eendracht Aalst (the same club as FC Denderleeuw in 2002/03), Row 5 for Omonia Nicosia, Row 6 for FC Denderleeuw, Row 7 for 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken, Row 8 and Row 9 for 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken again, and Row 10 and Row 11 for SV Zulte Waregem and FCV Dender Eh respectively.\n\n8. Since we are looking for the team with the lowest amount of goals scored in a specific season (2002/03), we only need to consider teams that played that season. So we can ignore rows 7, 8 and 9 because they belong to a different season. \n\n9. Next we should identify which teams played during 2002 / 03:\n    - Row 2: KSC Eendracht Aalst \n    - Row 3: KSC Eendracht Aalst\n    - Row 5: Omonia Nicosia\n    - Row 6: FC Denderleeuw\n\n10. Now we need to compare the goals scored by each of these teams in the 2002 / 03 season.\n\n11. For KSC Eendracht Aalst, the number of goals is not provided directly, but we can infer from row 3 that they played one more game than FC Denderleeuw (31 apps vs 32 apps), and since this information is about two different teams playing in the same season, it cannot be used to compare with FC Denderleeuw.\n\n12. We know the number of goals scored by Omonia Nicosia is not provided directly either.\n\n13. The number of goals scored by FC Denderleeuw in 2002/03 is given as 23.\n\n14. Since we have only one valid comparison for this season, and that team scored 23 goals, but it does not tell us if that was the lowest, we need to check other teams playing in the same season (for which data exists):\n\n   - We have already identified two of them: KSC Eendracht Aalst and Omonia Nicosia.\n\n15. For KSC Eendracht Aalst:\n    The number of games played is provided by row 2, but not the total goals scored. It will be useful to find this in another season.\n\n   - We can see that row 14 has a \"total\" column which contains information about all teams. So we should look for the row with KSC Eendracht Aalst's data from the same season (2002 / 03).\n    - Row 4 gives us some information on KSC Eendracht Aalst from that season: `season: 2000 / 01, club: ksc eendracht aalst, country: belgium, apps: 30, goals: 6.`. This row does not tell us anything about their total amount of goals in the 2002/03 season.\n\n   - But we can find this information by looking at another team with more games played:\n     - We have already identified Omonia Nicosia as one of them.\n     - However, there is a problem here because if we go to row 5: `season: 2001 / 02, club: omonia nicosia, country: cyprus, apps: 22, goals: 8.`, then it appears that Omonia Nicosia played in one less game than FC Denderleeuw (but Omonia scored more goals). However this doesn't prove that Omonia Nicosia's actual number of goals will be the lowest. But we can see what row 11 says about FCV Dender Eh:\n     - `season: 2006 / 07, club: fcv dender eh, country: belgium, apps: 33, goals: 21.`\n\n    Since FCV Dender Eh played in the same season as FC Denderleeuw and we know that they scored less than 23, then we should check the number of games played by Omonia Nicosia:\n     - `season: 2001 / 02, club: omonia nicosia, country: cyprus, apps: 22, goals: 8.`\n\n    As stated previously, the only team that can be compared to FC Denderleeuw (and KSC Eendracht Aalst) in this season is Omonia Nicosia because both are known to have played in the same season. But we cannot say for certain that their scores are lower than 23 just from the fact that they played less games.\n\n    Now, let's calculate total amount of goals scored by FC Denderleeuw and then look at KSC Eendracht Aalst:\n     - Row 6 gives us `goals: 23` but we cannot compare this with something because there is no information about KSC Eendracht Aalst from that season in the table.\n\n    Let's first check what row 14 says about KSC Eendracht Aalst for a different season:\n     - Row 4 says `goals: 6`. But since we are trying to calculate the total amount of goals scored by FC Denderleeuw, it will be useful to look at another team with more games played in that season.\n    - There is a problem here because if row 3 says KSC Eendracht Aalst played one game less than FC Denderleeuw (31 apps vs 32 apps) then this information about the total number of goals is irrelevant and we can't use it for our purpose. \n\n16. Now let's calculate the total amount of goals scored by FCV Dender Eh, Omonia Nicosia, KSC Eendracht Aalst and compare them with FC Denderleeuw:\n     - Row 6 says `goals: 23` for FC Denderleeuw.\n     - We can see that row 11 says `goals: 21` for FCV Dender Eh. \n     - There is a problem here because we do not know the total amount of goals scored by Omonia Nicosia and KSC Eendracht Aalst from that season.\n\n    Since FCV Dender Eh played in one less game than FC Denderleeuw, then it scored less than 23. This means that either Omonia Nicosia or KSC Eendracht Aalst must have scored more than 23. \n\n17. We are unable to determine which team between Omonia Nicosia and KSC Endrecht has the lowest amount of goals in the table because we cannot calculate their totals for that season.\n\n18. Based on this, since FCV Dender Eh played one less game than FC Denderleeuw and they scored 21, and we know that Omonia Nicosia (who played in one more game) scored more than 23 and KSC Eendracht Aalst must have also scored more than 23 but the amount is unknown because we can't calculate their totals from that season.\n\n    Therefore, based on the information given by the table, we cannot determine which team between Omonia Nicosia and KSC Endrecht has the lowest amount of goals in the season 2002/03.",

First, let's look at the relevant data for these two seasons:\n\t* Row 12: season: 2007 / 08, club: mvv, country: netherlands, apps: 33, goals: 22\n\t* Row 13: season: 2008 / 09, club: mvv, country: netherlands, apps: 32, goals: 20\n3. We notice that the number of appearances (apps) is not relevant for this comparison, so we can ignore it.\n4. Next, let's compare the number of goals achieved by MVV in both seasons:\n\t* In the 2007 / 08 season, they scored 22 goals.\n\t* In the 2008 / 09 season, they scored 20 goals.\n5. Since 22 is not equal to 20, the claim that MVV achieved the same number of goals in both the 2007 / 08 and the 2008 / 09 seasons is FALSE.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"apps\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
