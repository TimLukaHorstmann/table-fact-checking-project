So, we can ignore this row.\n   - For Row 5: The previous conference is indeed \"lake suburban\", which is not the same as \"calumet\". So, we can ignore this row.\n   - For Row 7: The previous conference is indeed \"calumet\".\n   - For Row 8: The previous conference is indeed \"independents\", which is not the same as \"calumet\". So, we can ignore this row.\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. To determine if the claim is true or false, we need to check if any of the schools were previously part of the Calumet conference before joining.\n\n2. Looking at Row 1 of the table, it states that the school \"chesterton\" joined the Calumet conference in the past (previous conference: calumet).\n\n3. Since Chesterton was indeed part of the Calumet conference before joining, we can conclude that this claim is false because there is at least one school (Chesterton) whose case contradicts it.\n\n4. We do not need to check other rows as one counterexample is enough to reject a universal statement.\n\n5. We also need to confirm that no row of the table provides us with the required information, which are not needed for our claim because we already found one school who was part of the Calumet conference in the past (Chesterton).\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"previous conference\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
