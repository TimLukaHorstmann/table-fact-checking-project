Compare this count to 1 to determine if Tampa Bay had Detroit Lions as an opponent only once:\n   - Since there are more than one instances where Detroit Lions is an opponent, we must determine how many times Detroit Lions appears for the team's record.\n\n5. Count the number of times \"Detroit Lions\" is mentioned in rows with \"record\":\n   - Row 12 has a record of \"3 - 8\", which includes Detroit Lions.\n   - Similarly, other rows (13, 14) also have records that include Detroit Lions.\n\n6. Determine if there are more instances than just one:\n   - If the number is greater than 1, then the claim is FALSE.\n\n7. Verify that we didn't miss any row with \"Detroit Lions\" as an opponent for Tampa Bay:\n   - After reviewing all rows, we can confirm that no other instance of Detroit Lions was listed for Tampa Bay.\n   \n8.

Row 8: opponent 'indianapolis colts' played at 'hoosier dome', which is also not the same as Lambeau Field; therefore, this row does not meet our criteria.\n\n6. Row 9: opponent 'minnesota vikings' again played at 'tampa stadium', so it doesn't match our criteria since we are looking for games at Lambeau Field with loss result.\n\n7. Since none of the rows from the table mention a game where the opponents played at 'Lambeau field' and had a loss, except the one mentioned in row 3 which has a win, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Step 1: Identify rows from table where opponent played at Lambeau Field with loss result\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 2: From row 3, we see that the game was played by 'green bay packers' and they had a win.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 3: The only other relevant row after row 7 is not mentioned in the table\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 4: Check if any further rows meet our criteria\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 5: Rows 8 and 9 do not meet the criteria since they don't play at Lambeau Field with loss results\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 6: Conclusion that none other than row 3 had a win so no other game meets the criteria\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Step 7: Conclusion that all relevant rows result in only loss\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
