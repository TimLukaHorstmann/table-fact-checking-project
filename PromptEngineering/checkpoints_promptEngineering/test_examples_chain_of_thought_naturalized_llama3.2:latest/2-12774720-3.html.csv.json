Looking at Row 6, we see a column named \"win - loss\" with values listed for each year. We need to find the specific rows for 1999 and 2002 to check the score.\n6. For 1999, we can see that the value in Row 6 is indeed \"1 - 4\", which matches our claim.\n7. For 2002, we can also see that the value in Row 6 is indeed \"1 - 4\", which matches our claim.\n8.
