    "resp": "### Step 1: Analyze the Claim\nThe claim states that in 1975, the Denver Broncos never had more than 2 wins in a row. We need to verify if this statement is true based on the provided table.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Relevant Data\nWe'll need to look for instances where the Broncos won consecutive games (more than 1 win in a row) and see if any of these instances occurred in 1975.\n\n### Step 3: Examine the Table for Consecutive Wins\nLooking at the table, we notice that some rows provide information about consecutive wins. Specifically, Row 9 indicates the Broncos won against the San Diego Chargers (27-17), which is a part of their winning streak, and Row 11 shows they won another game against the same team in overtime (13-10). There's no direct row indicating two consecutive wins before these.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Dates for 1975\nSince we're asked about 1975 specifically, let's verify if any games played during this year are relevant. The table doesn't explicitly state dates for all games; however, it provides the start of each season and a general pattern of increase in attendance, which can sometimes give hints about historical data.\n\n### Step 5: Identify Any Relevant Data for 1975\nUpon reviewing the row numbers provided at the beginning of the table (from 1 to 14), we can infer that these correspond to seasons starting from Week 1 to Week 14. Since only Row 1 indicates a game in early September and no specific mention of games within 1975 is mentioned, it's hard to pinpoint exact 1975 data directly.\n\n### Step 6: Assess the Claim Based on Available Data\nGiven that we can't determine with certainty if any Denver Broncos won more than two consecutive wins without direct data for 1975 and based on our analysis that only a couple of instances (Row 9 & Row 11) show them winning consecutive games, it's challenging to claim definitively. However, the statement suggests an absolute condition (\"never have more than 2 win in a row\") which is hard to prove or disprove conclusively with given data.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nSince we can't directly determine if any instance of three consecutive wins occurred before those shown (Row 9 and Row 11), the only way to address this claim accurately would be knowing the complete historical record of Broncos' games from 1975. Given our analysis, we cannot conclusively declare it false because there isn't clear-cut evidence of two or more consecutive wins being broken in 1975.\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Analyze the Claim: The claim about Denver Broncos' performance in 1975.\",\n    \"Determine Relevant Data: Look for instances where Broncos won consecutive games and verify if any occurred in 1975.\",\n    \"Examine the Table for Consecutive Wins: Found a sequence of wins before and during the season but no direct information on 1975.\",\n    \"Verify Dates for 1975: Lack of explicit data for this year makes it hard to determine its relevance.\",\n    \"Identify Any Relevant Data for 1975: Inferred that starting from Week 1 might be relevant, but lack of specific 1975 dates hampers conclusive assessment.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"result\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"result\"}\n  ]\n}",

However, since Row 9 and Row 10 both have a date that is before December 31st, 1974 (Row 9) or after January 1st, 1975 but before December 31st, 1975 (Row 10), we can conclude that the table data does not provide any attendance information for games played at San Diego Stadium in 1975.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis and comparison of relevant rows from the table, it appears that there is no game played by Denver Broncos at San Diego stadium with an attendance in 1975. Therefore, we can conclude that the claim \"the lowest attendance for a denver bronco game in 1975 be at the san diego stadium\" cannot be evaluated as TRUE or FALSE based on our data.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify relevant information: Look for any row with a date of 1975.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Analyze the table data.

Check if the team finished the season with a loss at the specified location (Miami Orange Bowl).\n3. If both conditions are met, then verify that the season is indeed 1975.\n\nNow let's move on to explaining how I determined this:\n\n1. The season of the Denver Broncos team can be found by looking at row 14 in the table: week=14 and date=december 20.\n2. The location where the team finished the season with a loss can be verified by checking the \"game site\" column for that specific row (row 14): it is indeed \"miami orange bowl\".\n3. Finally, we need to check if the year of the season mentioned in the claim (1975) matches the year implied by the table (december 20). Since we don't have enough information about a single game from 1975, we can't verify this yet.\n\nThe claim is only possible if the season takes place after December 8 and before December 14. However, there isn't any direct evidence that would allow us to make such a determination. The last row for the year 1975 is indeed November 30 but there's no further information on whether games take place in December or January.\n\nHowever, since we know that the season ends after week 14 and before week 15 (given the Denver Broncos team finished at the end of their 13th and 14th weeks), it can be reasonably inferred that the season will not last until December 20 but rather end on a date between November 30 and December 8.\n\nConsidering these observations, I can only deduce that it's likely that games played in week 15 do take place after December 8. Given this evidence, we cannot confirm whether or not the team loses at Miami Orange Bowl on December 20, but we can determine that if a loss occurs there it would indeed be in a later part of the season.",

Unfortunately, there's no direct match; however, this step confirms our search.\n\n4. **Check consecutive wins**: Since our data doesn't explicitly state the years for each game and only gives week numbers, we'll need to determine if 1975 fits any of these weeks or if the Broncos ever had more than one win in a row that year without specific information.\n\n5. **Verify 1975 for Denver Broncos records**: Given no specific season data and without exact dates for each game, there isn't enough direct evidence from this table alone to conclusively determine the answer based on week numbers alone since we lack explicit start of the season dates.\n\n6. **Determine the relevance of week numbers alone**: If the Broncos had a win in one week but lost the next (which doesn't directly appear in our data), it wouldn't be conclusive without knowing the exact year these games occurred, which isn't provided here.\n\n7. **Assess if 1975 is known or relevant based on table format**: Unfortunately, there's not enough information to accurately verify this claim since we can't discern the year from the week numbers directly and no specific data for 'opponent' matching 'denver broncos' that also contains an approximate year.\n\n### Conclusion Without Year Information\n\nDue to lack of sufficient year-specific matchings between Denver Broncos games and a stated year or confirmation that a game took place before 1975 (the claimed year), the evaluation cannot be completed accurately without additional assumptions.\n\nHowever, for the sake of format compliance:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Due to the lack of specific year information in the provided table regarding Denver Broncos games, it's impossible to definitively determine if they ever had more than one win in a row in 1975.

However, overtime details aren't explicitly stated; they are implicitly indicated when there's a \"(OT)\" next to the score.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. **Counting Overtime Games**: The only way we can determine how many times Denver Broncos went into overtime in 1975 is by examining each game's outcome and score for any indication of an overtime period.\n   - We look at each \"result\" and corresponding \"score.\" Since the \"(OT)\" symbol isn't used, but rather a win/loss result format throughout the table, we'll instead rely on when a game wasn't decided in the standard time (usually a \"w\" followed by a score), or if it is an overtime (\"w OT\") to conclude if overtime was played.\n\n2. **Reviewing Overtime Games**:\n   - In row 9, week 9, Denver won against San Diego Chargers with a final score of \"27-17.\" There's no \"(OT)\" but this result shows the game did not go into overtime because it ended in standard time.\n   - In row 11, week 11, Denver won against San Diego Chargers with a final score of \"13-10 (OT)\". This explicitly states the game went into overtime.\n   - In row 12, week 12, Oakland Raiders defeated the Broncos with a final score of \"10-17\". Again, no \"(OT)\" is present; this result indicates it did not go into overtime.\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown Continued\n\n3. **Checking for Other Overtime Games**:\n   - Looking through each row for any indication that a game went into overtime and considering there are only two instances where \"(OT)\" is explicitly noted, we determine the remaining games' outcomes do not necessarily confirm their involvement in overtime as per the given data.\n\n4. **Concluding on the Claim**:\n   - Given our review of the table, to answer whether Denver Broncos went into overtime \"only 2 times\" in 1975 with the explicit use of \"(OT)\", we find that it is indeed so for only those two games explicitly noted as being in overtime.\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify relevant claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate relevant information about Denver Broncos and overtime in 1975.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look through the table for any games that went into overtime\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Review row 9, week 9; row 11, week 11; row 12, week 12 as they have (OT)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check other rows to confirm no additional instances of (OT)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine the relevance of Denver Broncos going into overtime in 1975.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"week\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
