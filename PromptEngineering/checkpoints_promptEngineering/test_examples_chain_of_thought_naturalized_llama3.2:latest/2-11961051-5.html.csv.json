Next, we need to check if the point score was ever greater than 122 or less than 80 during this season.\n\nFrom Row 9 to Row 14, we can see that there is no entry where a Pacers game had a score more than 122 (the closest score was in row 9 with 110-104). In addition, for the lower limit, we need to find a scoring margin of at least 80 points. From Rows 10 through 13, all games have scores that are greater than or equal to 90 points. \n\nHowever, looking closer into Row 14, there is no entry where the Pacers played against any team and won with a score less than 80 (there is another row in which they lost 110-104).

First, we need to find the attendance for the grizzlies game and the hawks game from the table.\n   - The attendance for the grizzlies game can be found in Row 1 of the table: `10186`.\n   - The attendance for the hawks game can be found in Row 2 of the table: `10797`.\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate the difference between the attendance for the hawks game and the grizzlies game.\n   - Attendance difference = Attendance of hawks game - Attendance of grizzlies game\n   - Attendance difference = `10797` - `10186`\n   - Attendance difference = `611`\n\n3. Now, let's compare this calculated difference with the claim that \"the attendance for the hawks game exceed the attendance of the grizzlies game by 101 crowd\".\n   - Since the attendance difference is not equal to `101`, we need to check if it is less than or greater than `101`.\n   - Attendance difference (`611`) is greater than `101`.\n\n4. However, there seems to be a mistake in my previous step as I calculated a wrong value; instead I should have stated that since 10797 is indeed larger than 10186 by 611 which does not equal 101 it's actually the other way around - the attendance of the hawks game exceeds the attendance of the grizzlies by 611 and thus, does not satisfy the claim.\n\n5. Thus our final answer is false.\n\n\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
