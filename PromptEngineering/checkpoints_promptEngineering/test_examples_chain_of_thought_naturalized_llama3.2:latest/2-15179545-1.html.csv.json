Based on the column names and their values:\n   - The 'race track' for the 1st Grand Prix Des Nations is indeed \"Circuit des Nations\".\n   - However, for other races such as the 2nd Grand Prix De Geneve, Formula 2 Fia Non-Championship and Formula 1 Fia Non-Championship races on May 2, 1948; and the 3rd Grand Prix De Geneve, Formula 2 Fia Non-Championship and Formula 1 Fia Non-Championship races on July 30, 1950, \"Circuit des Nations\" is not mentioned as the race track in the table.\n\n\n7. After comparing with given condition, we can say that at least one race does not take place on \"Circuit des Nations\".\n8.
