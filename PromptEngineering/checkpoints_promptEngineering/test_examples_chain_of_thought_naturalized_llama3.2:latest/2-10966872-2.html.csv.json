Therefore, the statement in question can be assessed as false if it is true that William Wyler received exactly 10 times more nominations compared to John Ford, but not \"more than\" because it would have to be a number more than double (20). \n\nHowever, for this question, we want \"more than two\", so since we found out that 12 isn't more than twice the amount of nominations he got but exactly double, it means William Wyler has received more than 10 and therefore does indeed get more than 2 times John Ford's nomination.
