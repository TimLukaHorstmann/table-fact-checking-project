This implies two separate events: WEC 9 where Lavar Johnson is involved, and WEC 8 where Anthony Fuller is involved.\n\n2. **Locate relevant cells in the table**:\n   - For Lavar Johnson's event, look for rows with opponent named \"lavart johnson\" or any variation of it.\n   - For Anthony Fuller's event, look for rows with opponent named \"anthony fuller\".\n\n3. **Verify the events and opponents**: \n   - In row 23, we find an entry that matches Lavar Johnson (column: 'opponent' contains 'lavart johnson') in WEC 9.\n   - In row 24, we find an entry matching Anthony Fuller (column: 'opponent' contains 'anthony fuller') in WEC 8.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since both opponents are correctly matched with their respective events and there are no discrepancies found, the claim is true.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Claim verified through table matching: Lavar Johnson for WEC 9 and Anthony Fuller for WEC 8.\\n\",\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"opponent\"}\n    ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim states that both matches against James Irvin and Anthony Arria lasted less than a minute.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the relevant cells in the table\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to find the rows corresponding to these two fighters and check the time it took for their respective matches to end. The relevant cells are:\n- Row 20: opponent = James Irvin, round = 2, time = 0:45\n- Row 22: opponent = Anthony Arria, round = 1, time = 0:22\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the claim for James Irvin\nThe match against James Irvin lasted 0 minutes and 45 seconds (0:45), which is greater than 1 minute. Therefore, the claim that this match lasted less than a minute is FALSE.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the claim for Anthony Arria\nThe match against Anthony Arria lasted 0 minutes and 22 seconds (0:22), which is indeed less than 1 minute.

The fight against Sultan Aliev actually ended in 5:00, but this refers to the round duration, not the total time of the fight.
