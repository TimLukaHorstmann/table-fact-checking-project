    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that Austria ranks highest due to the number of medals, but there's an additional condition that only Austria won bronze in the 1961 world luge championship.\n2. To verify the first part of the claim, I need to check if Austria indeed has the most medals among all countries (not just gold medals). Looking at rows 1 and 4, Poland also has a total of 3 medals (all of which are gold), but when comparing bronze counts, row 1 has 3 bronze compared to row 4's 0. However I will now look further down the table.\n3. Continuing with my previous step: In Row 5 Switzerland also has a total of 1 medal, and in row 2 Italy has more than 1 gold and therefore more medals then Poland. I am comparing Austria's bronze count here to see if they indeed hold the highest when compared to both the other bronze counts (which are 0) and overall count.\n4. Upon checking rows 3 and 5: They have a total of 2, which is less than row 1 and therefore does not meet the conditions for Austria's ranking.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Claim states Austria ranks highest due to number of medals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Verify first part of claim: Austria has most medals among all countries\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Verify second part of claim: Austria's bronze count is highest\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check if row 1's bronze count meets the conditions for Austria's ranking\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"bronze\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
