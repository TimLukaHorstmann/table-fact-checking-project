    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to find the values for us viewers at row 14 (episode a goat 's tale) and row 18 (the road to audition). These values are given in millions as 4.3 and 4.3 respectively.\n\n2. Next, we compare these two numbers to see if they match: since both numbers are equal, that means our claim is correct at this point.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Episode a goat \\u2019s tale and the road to audition both have the same number of us viewer at 4.6 million\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"us viewers (millions)\"}\n  ]\n}",
