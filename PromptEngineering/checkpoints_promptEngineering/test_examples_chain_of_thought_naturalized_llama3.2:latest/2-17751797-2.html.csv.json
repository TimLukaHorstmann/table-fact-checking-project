    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Start by examining the claim: \"the most point score by a team in a single game be 5 , by woking\"\n   - The claim is stating that the highest score in a single game belongs to Woking with a score of 5.\n\n2. Look up the table for the row number and column name corresponding to Woking's score.\n   - Row 6: tie no: 5, home team: woking, score: 5 - 1, away team: merthyr tydfil, date: 08 / 12 / 1990.\n\n3. Check if the score in row 6 is indeed 5, which matches the claim.\n   - The score for Woking in row 6 is 5, so the condition for \"the most point score by a team in a single game be 5\" holds true for Woking.\n\n4. Look for any other rows where another team might have scored more than 5 points in a single game to confirm that Woking indeed has the highest score.\n   - Examine row 20: tie no: 16, home team: wigan athletic, score: 2 - 0, away team: hartlepool united, date: 08 / 12 / 1990. This shows a score of 2, which is less than the claim's condition.\n   - Examine row 23: tie no: 18, home team: birmingham city, score: 1 - 3, away team: brentford, date: 12 / 12 / 1990. This shows a score of 4, which is more than the claim's condition.\n   - Examine row 26: tie no: 20, home team: swansea city, score: 2 - 1, away team: walsall, date: 08 / 12 / 1990. This shows a score of 3, which is less than the claim's condition.\n   - Upon reviewing these rows, it appears there are no other teams with scores exceeding 5.\n\n5. Based on this examination, we can confirm that Woking indeed has the highest single-game score of 5.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check claim statement for accuracy regarding Woking's score\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Verify if Woking has a high single game score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Locate row number and column name in table corresponding to Woking's score\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find Woking's data in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check score for Woking against any other team\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Ensure no other teams have a higher single game score than Woking's 5\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim is about chester city playing the highest scoring shutout game, which is a 4-0 win.\n\n#### Step 2: Find relevant information from the table\nTo evaluate this claim, we need to find rows that involve chester city in a match with a score of 4-0. We will also look for any other matches where chester city played and won by a larger margin than 4-0.\n\n#### Step 3: Look for relevant matches in the table\nRow 25 indicates chester city playing leek town, but the result is not 4-0 (it's actually 4-0 for chester city, but there was no match before that with the same score as claim). Row 1 and row 5 indicate chester field and burnley vs bolton wanderers and stoke city respectively. Neither of these scores are 4-0.\n\n#### Step 4: Look further in the table\nRow 25 does indeed show a result for chester city, but we need to know there was no previous match with the same score as claim. However, it is actually row 26 that does not match our criteria because it is swansea vs walsall.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify other potential matches\nNo further rows indicate any chester city result of a higher margin than 4-0.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nWe are left with no other possibilities after the table.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine the validity of the claim \"8 team score zero point\", we need to examine each row of the table.\n\n2. In Row 9, the home team Wycombe Wanderers scored a score of 1-1 against Peterborough United, which is not equal to zero.\n\n3. However, we should continue examining other rows as well for confirmation and thoroughness.\n\n4. Since the claim is \"8 team score zero point\", we need at least one row where this condition is met.\n\n5. After re-examining each row carefully, it appears that there are multiple instances of teams scoring zero points against another team in different matches (e.g., Row 3: Barnet 0-0 Northampton Town; Row 9: Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Peterborough United; Row 11: Fulham 0-0 Cambridge United; Row 15: Huddersfield Town 0-2 Blackpool).\n\n6. However, we must verify if these instances match the claim \"8 team score zero point\".\n\n7. To confirm, let's check the score in each instance mentioned above:\n   - Row 3 (Barnet vs Northampton Town): Scored zero points\n   - Row 9 (Wycombe Wanderers vs Peterborough United): Scored one point (1-1)\n   - Row 11 (Fulham vs Cambridge United): Scored zero points\n   - Row 15 (Huddersfield Town vs Blackpool): Scored two points, not zero\n\n8. We've found a match in Row 3 and Row 11 that meets the claim's condition.\n\n9. Now we must check if any other rows could have been missed which also meet this criteria.\n \n10. After verifying all relevant rows again, there is an additional instance of a team scoring zero points in another row (Row 4: Northampton Town vs Barnet; Row 7: Shrewsbury Town vs Chorley; Row 12: Cambridge United vs Fulham) as well as another match that we missed initially.\n\n11. So the total number of instances where \"8 team score zero point\" is met are three, which does indeed meet or exceed the value '8'.\n\n12. Having found multiple rows meeting this condition confirms our reasoning and leads us to conclude that the claim is true.\n\n\n#### Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",

Next, we must verify if this score is indeed a shutout (0-0) and that it was the highest-scoring shutout in Woking's games.\n   - We already know the score is 5-1 but for the comparison we need the 4-0 result which should be found in row 22.\n\n3. Since the claim says \"highest scoring shut out game\" we must verify both scores and compare them.\n   - The first score in step 2 was 5-1, which isn't a shutout.\n   - The second score (4-0) is in the context of a replay match but is still relevant to Woking's highest shutout.\n\n4. We also need to make sure there are no other games that could be the \"highest scoring shutout\" by Woking, so we should verify if there are any other 4-0 shutouts for Woking.\n   - Since this game isn't mentioned in row 6 but is mentioned in row 22 and only one record of Woking's highest scoring match is required, then that would be it.\n\n5. Finally, compare the score of 4-0 with the first given shutout score of 5-1.\n   - Since 4-0 > 5-1, we can say this is indeed the highest-scoring shutout game for Woking.\n\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"Look up row 6 to get score and team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reason\": \"Check the first given shutout score from step 1 to compare it with the second game result.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine whether the claim \"7 team score zero point\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to find a row where the away team scored 0 goals.\n\n2. Looking at each row, we can see that there are several instances of home teams and away teams with scores of 0-0 (draw) or home team scoring while away team scored 0 goals.\n\n3. However, since the question is asking about the \"away\" team's performance, we need to focus on rows where the away team is listed in the first column of the table.\n\n4. Upon examining each row, we can see that some teams like Fulham, Northampton Town, Shrewsbury Town, Whitley Bay, Rotherham United, and Leyton Orient all had games against other teams where they scored 0 goals.\n\n5. After carefully reviewing each row, we find that Row 11 is a notable instance where the away team (Cambridge United) scored 2 goals, but another relevant game involves Fulham's away match at Cambridge United with a final score of 2-1 in favor of Cambridge on 11 / 12 / 1990.\n\n6. Another important point is that Row 23 lists Birmingham City scoring against Brentford with the final score being 1-3 in favor of Brentford, meaning Birmingham City did not win or lose this game due to an away team score of zero. However this does indeed show another game involving a zero-score result.\n\n7. Looking at each relevant row again and comparing their \"away\" scores to zero, we can see that the claim's truth value is not dependent on any single data point but rather the overall count of instances where the \"away\" team scored 0 goals across all relevant rows.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We need to check if there are multiple away teams that score zero points. Upon further review, we can see instances like Fulham's 2-1 loss at Cambridge United and Birmingham City's 1-3 loss at Brentford. Furthermore, games involving Whitley Bay, Rotherham United, Leyton Orient all had scores of zero for their respective away teams against other opposing teams in the table.
