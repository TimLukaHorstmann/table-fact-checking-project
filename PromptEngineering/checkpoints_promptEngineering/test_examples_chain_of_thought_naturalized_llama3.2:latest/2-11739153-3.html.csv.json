    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's list all the rows where Minnesota is the home team:\n   - Row 2: date: october 6, visitor: columbus, score: 2 - 3, home: minnesota, decision: backstrom, attendance: 18568, record: 2 - 0 - 0.\n   - Row 8: date: october 21, visitor: colorado, score: 2 - 3, home: minnesota, decision: backstrom, attendance: 18568, record: 7 - 0 - 1.\n   - Row 9: date: october 24, visitor: minnesota, score: 3 - 5, home: calgary, decision: backstrom, attendance: 19289, record: 7 - 1 - 1.\n   - Row 10: date: october 25, visitor: minnesota, score: 4 - 5, home: edmonton, decision: harding, attendance: 16839, record: 7 - 1 - 2.\n   - Row 11: date: october 28, visitor: minnesota, score: 1 - 3, home: colorado, decision: harding, attendance: 17041, record: 7 - 2 - 2.\n   - Row 12: date: october 30, visitor: pittsburgh, score: 4 - 2, home: minnesota, decision: harding, attendance: 18568, record: 7 - 3 - 2.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the attendance for each of these rows to see if they are all the same:\n   - Row 2: attendance = 18568\n   - Row 8: attendance = 18568\n   - Row 9: attendance = 19289\n   - Row 10: attendance = 16839\n   - Row 11: attendance = 17041\n   - Row 12: attendance = 18568\n\n3. We can see that the attendance is not the same for all of these rows, specifically Rows 9 and 10 have different attendances.\n\n4. Since we found an exception where Minnesota is the home team and the attendance is not the same, our claim is FALSE.\n\n5. Now let's list the relevant cells as objects with \"row_index\" and \"column_name\":\n   ```\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n]\n```\n\n6.

To do this, we will count the number of games Minnesota played at home and away based on the \"Attendance\" column in the table.\n3. For each game, we will check if the attendance was greater than 17000 (the threshold for away games).\n4. If the attendance is greater than 17000, we will increment a counter for away games.\n5. We will also keep track of the total number of home games by checking if the row index starts with \"0\" in the \"Attendance\" column.\n6.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the condition**: The claim states that Minnesota plays more home than away games in the 2007 season.\n\n2. **Count the number of home games**: To verify this, we need to count the number of rows where \"home\" is listed as \"Minnesota\".\n   - Rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 have \"Minnesota\" as their \"home\" team.\n   - There are a total of 6 rows where Minnesota plays at home.\n\n3. **Count the number of away games**: Now, we need to count the number of rows where \"away\" is listed as \"Minnesota\".\n   - Rows 1, 2, and 10 have \"Minnesota\" as their \"visitor\" team.\n   - There are a total of 3 rows where Minnesota plays away from home.\n\n4. **Compare the counts**: Since there are more rows with Minnesota playing at home (6) than away (3), it seems likely that Minnesota plays more home games than away games.\n\n5. **Verify the season**: The table does not explicitly mention the year, but based on the style of the table and the teams involved, we can reasonably assume it's for the 2007-08 NHL regular season or an earlier one. However, without explicit confirmation, this step cannot be confirmed as true.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identify the condition: Minnesota plays more home than away games in the 2007 season.\",\n    \"Count the number of home games: Rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12 have Minnesota as their home team.\",\n    \"There are a total of 6 rows where Minnesota plays at home.\",\n    \"Count the number of away games: Rows 1, 2, and 10 have Minnesota as their visitor team.\",\n    \"There are a total of 3 rows where Minnesota plays away from home.\",\n    \"Compare the counts: Since there are more rows with Minnesota playing at home (6) than away (3), it seems likely that Minnesota plays more home games than away games.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"home\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"visitor\" }\n  ]\n}",
