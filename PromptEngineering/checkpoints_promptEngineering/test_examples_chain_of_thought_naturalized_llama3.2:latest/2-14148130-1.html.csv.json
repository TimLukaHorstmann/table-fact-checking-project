This implies the whole set of data is for one team, so we check that the team played exactly 7 games.\n\nHowever, looking at rows 3 and 4, both have drawn 1 game. The claim states never more than 1 game drawn.\n\nStep 3: Analyzing \"never more than 1 game drawn\"\nGiven this fact from step 2, let's now look for other rows that may violate this rule.\n- Row 5 has drawn 1 game.\n- Row 7 has drawn 1 game.\n- Row 6 has drawn 0 games.\nThis analysis seems to confirm the claim but we still need to examine row 8.\n\nStep 4: Analyzing \"never more than 1 game drawn\" (continued)\nFor row 8, it says that the team drew 0 games, which is in line with our rule and so does not violate this condition.\n\nConclusion:\n- Given that all rows have exactly 7 games.\n- Given that only rows 3 and 4 violated the \"never more than 1 game drawn\" condition.",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to evaluate the claim:\n\n1. First, let's analyze Row 1: games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 0, points difference: 41 - 07, points: 14.\n   - In this row, we see that \"games\" is indeed 7.\n   - The point difference is calculated as 41 - 07 = 34. This value should be equal to the difference between the points and the opponent's points. However, it seems there is an error in this case because we have a 41-7 (point difference of 34), but the actual points are 14.\n\n2. Let's move on to Row 2: games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 2, points difference: 26 - 16, points: 10.\n   - The point difference here is indeed 26-16 = 10. This matches the claim since we have 10 points.\n\n3. Next, let's examine Row 3: games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 2, points difference: 30 - 15, points: 9.\n   - Here as well, the point difference is 30-15 = 15. This does not match the claim because we have a difference of 15 (not 26-16), so this row disproves the claim.\n\n4. Moving on to Row 4: games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 2, points difference: 26 - 21, points: 9.\n   - This point difference is indeed 26-21 = 5. It also does not match the claim because we have a difference of 5 (not 26-16), so this row disproves the claim.\n\n5. Examining Row 5: games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 3, points difference: 17 - 23, points: 7.\n   - The point difference here is indeed 17-23 = -6. It does not match the claim because we have a negative difference of -6 (not 26-16), so this row disproves the claim.\n\n6. Looking at Row 6: games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 5, points difference: 19 - 28, points: 4.\n   - In this case, we have a point difference of 19-28 = -9. This does not match the claim since it has a negative difference (-9), and also is 10 less than in row 2.\n\n7. Examining Row 7: games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 5, points difference: 20 - 28, points: 3.\n   - The point difference here is indeed 20-28 = -8. It does not match the claim because we have a negative difference of -8 (not 26-16), so this row disproves the claim.\n\n8. Finally, examining Row 8: games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 7, points difference: 05 - 46, points: 0.\n   - In this case, we have a point difference of 5-46 = -41. This does not match the claim since it has a positive difference (-41), and also is 14 less than in row 1.\n\nGiven our analysis, only Row 2 meets both conditions specified by the claim (having points equal to 10 and a point difference that matches this amount).

Evaluate the claim based on the steps above:\n    Since the claim states that there should be two occasions of 10 points and only one corresponding to Row 3, but there is another game (Row 4) where the points are also 9, we might need a closer look at if \"there be 10 point\" should actually mean \"one or more 10 point occasion\".\n    Considering this as \"one or more 10 point occasion\", since there isn't any other case of exactly 10 points in the table that matches one of the given conditions, and only two games with a point difference equal to 30 - 15 and 26 - 21.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. We are given a table containing the number of games, drawn matches, lost matches, points difference, and total points for each row.\n2. The claim states that when the point is 0, the drawn game should be 3 and lost game should be 5.\n\nTo verify this claim, we need to check if there's any row in the table where the point value is 0, and both the drawn games and lost games are 3 and 5 respectively.\n\n3. Looking at row 8 of the table:\n\t* The number of games played (games) is indeed 7.\n\t* The drawn matches (drawn) is 0.\n\t* The points difference between wins and losses (points difference) is -41.\n\t* However, there's no information about the exact number of drawn games or lost games in terms of quantities, not even \"3 and 5\".\n\n4. Given that we can't directly assess the claim with the given data due to missing cell value on row 8, let's consider the possible interpretation: if the 'drawn' and 'lost' values were meant to be 0 instead of '3 and 5', this wouldn't support our claim.\n\n5. Since there is no indication in any other rows that meets the 'drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5' requirement when the point value is zero, we can safely make a conclusion about the truth value of the claim based solely on the data provided.\n\n6. Thus, the only way for our claim to be valid (when points = 0) is if there's some information that wasn't explicitly stated in the table - but since there isn't, then we have to reject the claim.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"The given data doesn't support a valid interpretation of 'drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5' when point value is zero.\",\n    \"Assuming that this condition would not meet with either drawn or lost games being represented as numbers in other cells of the table, but there's an explicit indication on row8 where both are '0'.\",\n    \"No information about exact quantities was provided for 'drawn game be 3 and lost game be 5' when point value is zero.\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"drawn\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"lost\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. Start by examining the claim: \"there be no draw more than 3 and no loss more than 7\"\n2. To verify this claim, we need to check each row of the table for a draw value greater than 3 or a loss value greater than 7.\n3. For Row 1, games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 0, points difference: 41 - 07, points: 14\n   - Drawn is 0, which is less than 3, and lost is 0, which is also less than 7.\n4. For Row 2, games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 2, points difference: 26 - 16, points: 10\n   - Drawn is 0, which is less than 3, and lost is 2, which is also less than 7.\n5. For Row 3, games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 2, points difference: 30 - 15, points: 9\n   - Drawn is 1, which is less than 3, and lost is 2, which is also less than 7.\n6. For Row 4, games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 2, points difference: 26 - 21, points: 9\n   - Drawn is 1, which is less than 3, and lost is 2, which is also less than 7.\n7. For Row 5, games: 7, drawn: 1, lost: 3, points difference: 17 - 23, points: 7\n   - Drawn is 1, which is less than 3, and lost is 3, which is also less than 7.\n8. For Row 6, games: 7, drawn: 0, lost: 5, points difference: 19 - 28, points: 4\n   - Drawn is 0, which is less than 3, and lost is 5, which is greater than 7.\n9.
