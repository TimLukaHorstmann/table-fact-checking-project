We then need to filter those rows and sort them based on that value so we can compare and find the maximum value. \n    - For the claim \"detroit have the highest visitor score , with 5 point\" to be true, the value must be greater than or equal to 5.\n\n3. Next, we need to check if any of these sorted rows have a score of exactly 5 for Detroit.\n   - The row will contain the home team 'Detroit' in column 'visitor'.\n\n4.

In this case, however, we can confirm Detroit's highest home score because no one else scored more.\n\n### JSON Response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Determine if any other team has a higher score than Detroit's 4-1 and 2-4 wins; verify that no other team scored exactly 6 points in any game played at home\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will track their scores and attendance throughout the period.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze attendance to validate scoring averages\nHigher attendance generally indicates a more competitive team or a higher-scoring game. However, it's not a direct indicator of scoring average without considering the actual score difference.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate scoring trends for Detroit and Carolina\nWe look at how each team has performed, especially Detroit, as it directly relates to the claim. We need to see if their scores have been the lowest among all teams by late January.\n\n### Step 5: Compare scoring averages of Detroit and Carolina\nBy late January, we compare the total goals scored by both Detroit and Carolina to determine which team is indeed the lowest-scoring based on their performance during this time period.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the lack of information about other teams' performances in detail, our comparison mainly focuses on Detroit and Carolina. Without specific scores for other teams beyond Detroit and Carolina, it's challenging to definitively state whether Detroit is the \"lowest\" scoring team without assuming that all other teams have scored more than or equal to Detroit by late January.\n\nHowever, based on the provided data:\n\n- By early January (rows 1 through 4), Detroit had a relatively low score difference.\n- As January progresses, especially from row 5 onwards, Detroit's record doesn't show them as having significantly worse scores compared to Carolina until row 14, where their final score is only tied with Carolina.\n\nGiven these observations and the nature of the question asking for a definitive answer based on late January performance:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        \"The claim requires determining if Detroit is the lowest scoring team by late January.\",\n        \"To do this, we need to compare their scoring average with other teams.\",\n        \"However, without detailed information about all teams' performances, we can only make a comparison based on what's provided for Detroit and Carolina.\",\n        \"By row 14, both Detroit and Carolina have the same record but differ in some games' scores.
