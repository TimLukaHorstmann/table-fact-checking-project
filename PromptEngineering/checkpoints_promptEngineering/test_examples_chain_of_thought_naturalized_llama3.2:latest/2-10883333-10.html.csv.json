    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the row and column containing the crowd data for both Moorabbin Oval and Kardinia Park.\n   - Relevant cells for \"Moorabbin Oval\" are: Row 2, Column 5 (crowd)\n   - Relevant cell for \"Kardinia Park\" is: Row 1, Column 4 (crowd)\n\n2. Next, we compare the crowd values in both relevant rows to determine if Moorabbin Oval has less crowd than Kardinia Park.\n   - Value at Row 2, Column 5 = 17811\n   - Value at Row 1, Column 4 = 13328\n\n3. Since 17811 (Moorabbin Oval's crowd) is greater than 13328 (Kardinia Park's crowd), the claim \"moorabbin oval have less crowd than kardinia park\" is False.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify relevant cells for Moorabbin Oval and Kardinia Park, compare their crowd values, and conclude based on comparison.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
