Identify the players who play offensive tackle: The players who play offensive tackle are Dylan McFarland and Jonathan Smith (in Rows 5 and 6 respectively).

Determine the pick numbers for these players: In Row 2, JP Losman was picked with the 22nd overall pick. In Rows 5 and 6, Dylan McFarland was picked with the 207th overall pick and Jonathan Smith was picked with the 214th overall pick.\n\n4. Compare the pick numbers to determine if the claim is true or false: Since 214 (Jonathan Smith's pick number) is before 207 (Dylan McFarland's pick number), the claim is true for Jonathan Smith.
