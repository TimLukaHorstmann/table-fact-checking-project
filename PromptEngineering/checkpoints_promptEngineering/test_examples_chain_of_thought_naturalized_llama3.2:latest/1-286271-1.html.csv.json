Looking at the table, we can see that row 1 corresponds to election 1984 with total votes = 26921.\n\nStep 3: Identify and read the values of the relevant cells in rows 3 (corresponding to 1993) and 7 (corresponding to 2006), as well as row 8 (corresponding to 2008). We can see that in row 3, there are no seats won by any party. Looking at the values for row 7 and 8, we see that in both cases there was a total of only 665940 and 941097 votes respectively.\n\nStep 4: Now, using those numbers, compare them to the number of votes received in 1997 (cell 55583) - the result will show the claim about the number of people voting for the green party in 1993 being FALSE.",
