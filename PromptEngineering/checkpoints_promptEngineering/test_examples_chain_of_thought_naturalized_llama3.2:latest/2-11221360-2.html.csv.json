Determine which rows have a win, since we're only interested in wins.\n3. In each row with a win, check if the `method` is \"majority decision\".\n4. Count the number of rows where the method is \"majority decision\" to see how many of Usui's wins are by majority decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n5. Check Row 10: `res: win`, `record: 5 - 5`, `method: decision (majority)`. This is one win by majority decision.\n6. Check Row 15: `res: win`, `record: 2 - 3`, `method: decision (majority)`. This is another win by majority decision.\n7. Check Row 16: `res: win`, `record: 1 - 3`, `method: decision (majority)`. This is yet another win by majority decision.\n8. Check Row 4: `res: win`, `record: 9 - 6 - 1`, `method: decision (majority)`. This is a fourth win by majority decision.\n9. Check Row 11: `res: win`, `record: 4 - 5`, `method: decision (unanimous)`. The method in this case was not a majority decision, so it's excluded from our count.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n10. Now we have four wins by majority decision for Usui. We need to determine if only one of these is true.\n11. Since there are multiple rows with wins by majority decision and more than one can be true at the same time, we must conclude that not all of Usui's wins were by majority decision.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning (continued):\n\n12. Now let us identify how many of these are relevant to the claim: \"only 1 of Usui's win be by majority decision\". We need to check every row in the table for a win and if it was by majority decision.\n\n### JSON Response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify relevant columns\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Determine which rows have a win\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Check each row with a win for majority decision method\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Count the number of wins by majority decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Examine rows one through nine, excluding row 11\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"Examine row ten, eleventh and sixteenth.
