    "resp": "#### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a table containing information about a cycling race, specifically the Giro d'Italia, for each stage from stage 1 to stage 20 (and final), as well as stage 21 and 22 which aren't part of the normal stages but were part in another race. We need to determine whether there were 3 riders who led the point classification at different points during the race.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify relevant information\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out if there are three different riders who have been leading the general classification (which is equivalent to the points classification in cycling due to a system called \"points system\" - where the rider with the most points at each stage gets a certain amount of time deduction from their overall total) at various stages during the race.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare rows\nWe can do this by comparing different rows of the table. \n\n#### Step 4: Check if there are three different riders in the point classification\nBy looking at row 1 and row 2 for example, we see that Mario Cipollini led the points classification initially but lost to Rolf S\u00f8rensen on stage 2. Now we need to check all other rows of the table to verify this.\n\n#### Step 5: Check if there are three different riders who have been leading at different times\nWe compare row 3 and then row 4, for example, where we see Tony Rominger taking over the general classification after stage 2 (and thus also points classification), while Mario Cipollini re-takes it on stage 3. \n\nThis process continues until the end of row 20.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if the claim is true or false\nIf during this process, we find out that there are indeed three different riders who have led the general classification at three separate times, then our answer will be TRUE; otherwise it will be FALSE.\n\n#### Step 7: List relevant cells to support reasoning \nWe can list all of these rows to provide evidence for our reasoning:\n1. Row 1: stage: 1, winner: mario cipollini, general classification: mario cipollini\n2. Row 2: stage: 2, winner: tony rominger, general classification: tony rominger\n3. Row 3: stage: 3, winner: mario cipollini, general classification: tony rominger\n4. Row 4: stage: 4, winner: tony rominger, general classification: tony rominger\n5. Row 5: stage: 5, winner: filippo casagrande, general classification: tony rominger\n6. Row 6: stage: 6, winner: nicola minali, general classification: tony rominger\n7.

Row 20: stage: 20, winner: serguei outschakov, general classification: tony rominger\n\n#### Step 8: Final decision\nWe can see that only one rider (Giovanni Lombardi) has led the point classification throughout all the stages from stages 1 to 20. This means there are not three different riders who have led at different times.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"To determine if 3 riders lead the points classification at different times, we compared rows in the table, finding that Giovanni Lombardi leads throughout all stages from stage 1 to 20.

To determine whether the claim that 3 riders won more than one stage is true, we first identify which column to check (the winner) and then count how many times each rider appears as a winner. We find three riders who won more than once: Mario Cipollini, Tony Rominger, and Rolf S\u00f8rensen. This indicates that the claim is indeed true.\n\nNote that this solution only checks for riders with exactly 2 wins since we need to determine if there are any such riders in order to conclude that the statement about three riders winning more than one stage is true.",
