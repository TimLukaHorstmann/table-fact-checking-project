    "resp": "#### Step 1: Find the date range for the 2006 FIFA World Cup\nTo verify the claim, we need to determine when the 2006 FIFA World Cup took place. The relevant row in the table is Row 8: goal: 8, date: 24 june 2006, score: 1 - 0, result: 1 - 2 ( aet ), competition: 2006 fifa world cup.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Rafael M\u00e1rquez's participation in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\nThe claim states that Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but remained scoreless during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. We need to find out if Rafael M\u00e1rquez participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n#### Step 3: Find Rafael M\u00e1rquez's goals in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\nThe relevant row for the 2010 FIFA World Cup is Row 11: goal: 11, date: 11 june 2010, score: 1 - 1, result: 1 - 1, competition: 2010 fifa world cup. \n\n#### Step 4: Verify Rafael M\u00e1rquez's participation in the 2010 FIFA World Cup\nAlthough Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal during the 2010 FIFA World Cup (Row 11), we need to check if he participated in any matches.\n\n#### Step 5: Find Rafael M\u00e1rquez's goals in the 2010 FIFA World Cup (continued)\nUpon closer inspection, Row 10: goal: 10, date: 10 september 2008 seems relevant as it appears that the team played a qualifying match for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. However, this row is outside of our time frame of interest.\n\n#### Step 6: Verify Rafael M\u00e1rquez's participation in the 2010 FIFA World Cup (continued)\nGiven that there is no clear evidence of Rafael M\u00e1rquez participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup within the table's provided data, we will assume he did not participate.\n\n#### Step 7: Combine steps to evaluate the claim\nRafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but it cannot be verified that he participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. We therefore cannot confirm that he remained scoreless during the tournament, as we do not have information on whether he played any matches.\n\n#### Step 8: Determine answer\nBased on our steps above, it appears the claim could be considered TRUE since Rafael M\u00e1rquez scored a goal at the 2006 FIFA World Cup but there is insufficient evidence to confirm that he participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"date\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"date\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"date\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "To evaluate the claim, we need to check if Rafael M\u00e1rquez was scoreless in international competition in 2001, 2009, or 2012.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's look at the table to see when Rafael M\u00e1rquez played in international competitions.\n2. We can find the relevant information by looking for rows with \"competition\" that indicates an international match.\n3. From row 4, we know that Rafael M\u00e1rquez played in a friendly match on May 12, 2002, and scored a goal (goal: 4). This means he was not scoreless in this competition.\n4. Next, let's check if there is any mention of international competitions in 2001 or 2009.\n5. We can't find any row that corresponds to these years, which suggests that Rafael M\u00e1rquez might have been scoreless in both competitions.\n\nNow, we need to verify if Rafael M\u00e1rquez was scoreless in the competition on June 12, 2012. Let's look at rows related to this date:\n6. From row 11, we know that Rafael M\u00e1rquez played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup on June 11, 2010, and his team ended with a score of 1-1.\n7. From row 12, we also see that Rafael M\u00e1rquez played in the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup on June 12, 2011, and scored a goal (goal: 12).\n8. Since we found a score for one of these competitions, it means Rafael M\u00e1rquez was not necessarily scoreless.\n\nConclusion:\nThe claim \"rafael m\u00e1rquez do not remain scoreless in international competition in 2001 or 2009 or 2012\" is FALSE because:\n\n- We have no information about Rafael M\u00e1rquez being scoreless in the 2001 or 2009 competitions.\n- However, we know that he was scoreless in the 2010 FIFA World Cup on June 11, 2010.\n\nHere's the relevant information for your JSON output:\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"goal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"competition\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": null, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"friendly\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"2010 fifa world cup qualifier\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"2011 concacaf gold cup\" }\n  ]\n}",
