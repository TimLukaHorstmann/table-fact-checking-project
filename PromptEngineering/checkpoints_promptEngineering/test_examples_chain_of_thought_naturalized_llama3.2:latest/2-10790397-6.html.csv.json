Now, we can calculate the difference between these two scores: 71 - 60 = 11.\n4.

It is located at Row 1, Column 3: \"9.6 (60)\".\n\n\n### Step 3: Locate Geelong's Score in the Table\nNext, we need to locate Geelong's score in the table, which can be found in Row 2, Column 4: \"10.11 (71)\". However, since the claim is about Hawthorn's away team score being higher by a certain amount than Geelong's, this row actually gives us Hawthorn and Geelong playing on the same date with Hawthorn scoring 9.6 but also at the same venue. We should check another match for Geelong to ensure that our comparison is accurate.\n\n### Step 4: Check Another Row for Geelong\nLooking through the table again, we can find another row for Geelong by checking Row 5 where Geelong plays against Melbourne:\n- Column 2 of this row contains \"Melbourne\", so it must be a different match day.\n- In Row 5, column 3, we can see that Geelong's score is indeed \"12.15 (87)\".\n\n\n### Step 5: Compare Hawthorn\u2019s Away Score to Geelong\u2019s\nNow that we have confirmed that the away team for Hawthorn and the home team for Geelong are actually playing each other on the same day but not necessarily at the exact same venue, let's look at how their scores compare.\n- For Hawthorn, the score is 9.6 (60).\n- The statement says it should be higher by a certain amount from Geelong\u2019s score of \"12.15 (87)\".\n\n\n### Step 6: Calculate if Hawthorn\u2019s Score is Higher by 1.5 Than Geelong\u2019s\nGeelong's away team score of 9.6 isn't directly comparable to the claim due to the difference in venue for both teams on the same date. However, we can see from Row 4 and 5 that when comparing Hawthorn (Row 1) and Geelong (Row 2, and also another match day with Row 5), Hawthorn's actual away score of \"9.6\" (60) isn't greater than Geelong's but since this comparison actually compares the same match-day Hawthorn vs Geelong at the same venue it can still be used for the calculation.\n- To calculate if Hawthorn\u2019s score is higher by 1.5 than Geelong\u2019s, we subtract 9.6 from Geelong's score and see if that equals 1.5:\n  - $12.15 (87) - 9.6 = 2.55$\nSince $2.55$ isn't equal to $1.5$, Hawthorn's away team score of \"9.6\" is not higher by exactly $1.5$ than Geelong\u2019s.\n\n\n### Step 7: Conclude on the Claim\nBased on our calculation, since the difference between Hawthorn and Geelong's scores isn't exactly $1.5$, the claim that \"hawthorn 's away team score of 9.6 (60) be higher by 1.5 than that of geelong\" is FALSE.\n\n\n### Step 8: List Relevant Cells\nThe relevant cells for this problem are:\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"3\"\n}\nfor the Hawthorn's away team score and the other match-day Geelong, as well as Row 2 and 5 where both have different matches:\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Steps taken to verify claim: compared Hawthorn\u2019s score against Geelong\u2019s for the correct comparison.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim to be evaluated is: \"the crowd in Arden Street Oval be 4000 less than the crowd who watch at the Brunswick Street Oval\"\n\n#### Step 2: Locate the relevant cells in the table\nTo evaluate this claim, we need to find the values of the crowd for each oval. The relevant cells are:\n- Row 6, Column \"crowd\": 18000 (Arden Street Oval)\n- Row 3, Column \"crowd\": 14000 (Brunswick Street Oval)\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate the difference between the crowds\nTo determine if the claim is true or false, we need to calculate the difference in crowd size between the two ovals. We will subtract the crowd at Arden Street from the crowd at Brunswick Street.\ncrowd_difference = 14000 - 18000\n\n#### Step 4: Compare the calculated difference with the given value\nWe need to compare this difference with the value of 4000. If they are equal, then the claim is true; otherwise, it's false.\n\n#### Step 5: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison\nSince crowd_difference = -4000 and not 4000, it means the statement cannot be true as written because you'd expect to subtract less than or greater than if you're looking for less than rather than more than. The difference is indeed 4000 but in the opposite direction (less), hence we should state that the claim \"the crowd in Arden Street Oval be 4000 less than the crowd who watch at the Brunswick Street Oval\" is actually FALSE.\n\n#### Step 6: Formulate a JSON response\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim to be evaluated\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate the relevant cells in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate the difference between the crowds\",\n      \"value\": -4000\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Compare the calculated difference with the given value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Draw a conclusion based on the comparison\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
