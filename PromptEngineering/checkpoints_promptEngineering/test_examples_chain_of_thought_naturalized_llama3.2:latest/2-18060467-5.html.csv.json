To evaluate this claim, we need to find out how many players from the US have a score with a to par of -1 in the table.\n3. We will start by examining each row and looking for rows where the country is \"United States\" (US) and the to par is \"-1\".\n4. In Row 9, we see that mark calcavecchia has a to par of -1, so this player meets one of our criteria. \n5. In Row 10, we find jay haas with a to par of -1, another US player meeting our condition.\n6. We then proceed down the rows and come across tom watson (Row 12) who also has a score of 141.\n7. Next, in row 11, davis love iii's score is found to be 141 which meets our requirements as well.\n\n8. Having found three US players with scores of 141 that meet our condition, we need to see if there are two more US players who also have a to par of -1.\n9. In the next row after number 11 and 12, mark calcavecchia ( Row 9) is the first player from the US listed whose score is 141 and has a to par of -1, however since we already counted him in step 5, he can be skipped over.\n10. Next row after that contains jay haas's data for round one which also meets our condition (scores 141 with a to par of -1).\n11. Lastly we come across tom kite who also scores 139 and thus has a score with a to-par of -3, not meeting the conditions.\n\n\n\n12. We've now found four US players with a score of 141 that have a to par of -1, which supports our claim.\n\n13.
