From the comparison, we can see that there are scores higher than North Melbourne's (`13.18 (96)` from Richmond and `14.15 (99)` from South Melbourne).\n\n5.

To determine if the claim about the second largest crowd being on the venue of Lake Oval is true or false, we need to first identify which row contains the information about Lake Oval.\n2. Looking at the table, we see that Row 6 contains the details about South Melbourne playing Essendon at Lake Oval. Since it's a home team match and the crowd is mentioned, this row likely has the correct information for our purposes.\n3. Next, we need to determine if there are any other rows with larger crowds than what is reported in Row 6. To do this, we should compare the crowd sizes of each venue across all rows.\n4. Since we are only interested in finding the second largest crowd, we don't necessarily have to check every single row; we can stop once we find another crowd that matches or exceeds the one at Lake Oval (28000), assuming it's not the largest crowd reported overall.\n5. Now let\u2019s compare each venue with an attending crowd of over 10000 and especially look for venues which, if they are in a larger attendance than what Lake Oval has. \n6. For instance, at Row 3: Carlton is playing Collingwood at Princes Park, where the crowd was 32000. Since that's greater than 28000 (the reported size of Lake Oval\u2019s crowd), it matches our criteria and may be worth further comparison.\n7. It also seems likely we would need to compare this one with Row 5 and Row 4 as well due to attendance of over 10000 in their respective venues.\n\n\n### Relevant Rows\n\n- Row Index: 3 (Carlton)\n- Column Name: crowd (32000)\n\n- Row Index: 5 (Richmond)\n- Column Name: crowd (10000)\n\n- Row Index: 4 (North Melbourne)\n- Column Name: crowd (12000)\n\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": \"Identified the correct row for Lake Oval\": \"Row 6 is where we find information about Lake Oval\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Compare crowd sizes with Lake Oval\u2019s reported crowd of 28000\": \"Look for any other venue that may have a larger attendance than this one.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Consider each relevant match that has an attendance greater than or equal to 10000\": \"Specifically Row 3 (32000) seems like it could be the second largest\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Rule out potentially larger crowds by comparing them directly\": \"Need to see if there are any other crowds larger still.\"},\n    {\"step\": \"Verify which of these venues is actually second largest in attendance\": \"Row 3\u2019s crowd appears to be significantly larger than Lake Oval's and both Row 4 & 5 also have over 10000 attendees.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
