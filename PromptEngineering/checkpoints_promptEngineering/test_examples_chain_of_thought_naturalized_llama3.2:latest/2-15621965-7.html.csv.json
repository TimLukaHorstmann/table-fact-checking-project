According to the table, there are two players with a position of center: Row 7 (Marcin Gortat) and Row 8/9 (Horace Grant).\n\n2. **Check nationality of identified players**: Now that we've identified the players with a position of center, we need to verify their nationalities. \n   - For Marcin Gortat (Row 7): nationality = Poland.\n   - For Horace Grant (Row 8/9): There are two separate entries for Horace Grant, but since both have the same columns and rows only row 8 contains \"United States\".\n\n3. **Determine if every player with a position of center is from the United States**: Based on our checks in Step 2, we see that Marcin Gortat (Row 7) is not from the United States but Poland.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since at least one player with a position of center is not from the United States, the claim \"every player with a position of center have be from the united state\" must be FALSE.\n\n#### Output in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify players with a position of center\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Check nationality of identified players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Determine if every player with a position of center is from the United States\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"nationality\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
