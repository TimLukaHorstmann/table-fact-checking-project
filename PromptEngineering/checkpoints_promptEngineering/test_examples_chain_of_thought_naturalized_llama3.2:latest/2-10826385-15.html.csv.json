    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. To verify the claim, we need to check if Melbourne has the lowest score when playing as the away team.\n2. Since there are six rows of data for each match-up (home and away scores), we can start by analyzing Row 6: home team: collingwood, home team score: 10.13 (73), away team: melbourne, away team score: 8.10 (58).\n3. In this row, Melbourne's score as the away team is indeed lower than that of Collingwood.\n4. Next, we should consider Row 5: home team: hawthorn, home team score: 19.14 (128), away team: geelong, away team score: 15.8 (98).\n5. In this row, Melbourne's score as the away team is lower than that of Hawthorn.\n6. Now we need to check if there are any other instances where Melbourne has a lower score when playing as the away team in the remaining rows.\n7. After analyzing Rows 4 and 3, it appears that Melbourne's scores as the away team (20.8, 19.14) are also lower than those of Carlton and Hawthorn, respectively.\n8. Additionally, we should check if there are any other teams with a higher score when playing as the away team compared to Melbourne in Rows 1, 2, and 6.\n9. Upon reviewing Rows 1, 2, and 6, we can see that neither Footscray (14.7), Fitzroy (16.14), nor Collingwood (10.13) has a higher score than Melbourne when playing as the away team.\n10.

To determine whether the claim about Melbourne's score when playing as the away team is TRUE or FALSE, we need to first find all the scores of Melbourne as the away team.\n2. We will then compare these scores with each other and with the overall second-lowest score in the table to validate the claim.\n\n### Relevant Table Data\n\n| Row Index | Home Team | Away Team Score | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1      | St Kilda | 9.11 (65)     | 15 July 1972 |\n| 2      | North Melbourne | 9.12 (66)    | 15 July 1972 |\n| 3      | Richmond | 17.9 (111)    | 15 July 1972 |\n| 4      | South Melbourne | 8.15 (63)    | 15 July 1972 |\n| 5      | Geelong | 15.8 (98)     | 15 July 1972 |\n| 6      | Collingwood | 8.10 (58)    | 15 July 1972 |\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Claim\n\n1. First, find the scores of Melbourne as the away team:\n   - From row 6: Melbourne's score = 8.10 (58)\n\n2. Now compare this with other teams' scores:\n   - The only score that can be directly compared is 9.12 from North Melbourne.\n   - Since 9.12 is higher than 8.10, we know that for Melbourne to have the second-lowest away team score, North Melbourne's away team must also have a lower score than their own or there should not be any other away team with a score in between.\n\n3. To find if North Melbourne can indeed have an even lower score:\n   - Looking at row 2 again: Away team is North Melbourne and score is 9.12.\n   - There's no indication that another away team has a lower score, given the provided data.\n   \n4. Determine if there are other teams with scores in between Melbourne\u2019s away team score and the lowest recorded away team score:\n   - The lowest away team score mentioned in the table is from row 6: Collingwood (8.10).\n   - Since Collingwood's score of 8.10 falls below Melbourne\u2019s, it indicates that there are indeed teams with scores lower than Melbourne's.\n\n5.

We can calculate the difference in attendance between these two games by subtracting the crowd value of the Essendon v Richmond game from the crowd value of the Fitzroy v North Melbourne game.\n4. Let's get the values for both crowds: \n    - The crowd for the \"Fitzroy vs North Melbourne\" game is 7007\n    - The crowd for the \"Essendon v Richmond\" game is 22251\n5. The difference in attendance between these two games can be calculated as follows:\n    - Attendance at Fitzroy vs North Melbourne = 7007\n    - Attendance at Essendon v Richmond = 22251\n    - Difference in attendance: 22251 - 7007 = 14144\n\n6. Since the crowd value for the \"Essendon v Richmond\" game is larger than that of the \"Fitzroy vs North Melbourne\" game, more people attended the Essendon v Richmond game.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the claim is FALSE. \n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step_number\":1,\"text\":\"To compare the attendance at two games, we need to compare the crowd values for each game.\"},\n    {\"step_number\":2,\"text\":\"The claim compares the attendance at the \\u201cFitzroy vs North Melbourne\\u2032 game (row 2) with the attendance at the \\u201cEssendon v Richmond\\u2032 game (row 3).\"},\n    {\"step_number\":3,\"text\":\"We can calculate the difference in attendance between these two games by subtracting the crowd value of the Essendon v Richmond game from the crowd value of the Fitzroy v North Melbourne game.\"},\n    {\"step_number\":4,\"text\":\"Let\\u2019s get the values for both crowds:  \\n- The crowd for the \\u201cFitzroy vs North Melbourne\\u2032 game is 7007 \\n- The crowd for the \\u201cEssendon v Richmond\\u2032 game is 22251\"},\n    {\"step_number\":5,\"text\":\"The difference in attendance between these two games can be calculated as follows: \\n  - Attendance at Fitzroy vs North Melbourne = 7007 \\n  - Attendance at Essendon v Richmond = 22251 \\n  - Difference in attendance: 22251 - 7007 = 14144\"},\n    {\"step_number\":6,\"text\":\"Since the crowd value for the \\u201cEssendon v Richmond\\u2032 game is larger than that of the \\u201cFitzroy vs North Melbourne\\u2032 game, more people attended the Essendon v Richmond game.\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3,\"column_name\":\"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10.\n2. To verify this, we need to identify all the rows where the home team was the away team (i.e., \"away team\" column is not empty).\n3. From the table, the rows where the away team is not empty are Rows 1-6: Footscray, North Melbourne, Richmond, South Melbourne, Geelong, and Melbourne.\n4. Now, we need to check if more than half of these away teams have a score greater than 10.\n5. We will count the number of away teams with a score greater than 10 in each row and then determine if this count is more than half of all away teams.\n6. Row 1 (St Kilda): Score = 9.11, which is not greater than 10.\n7. Row 2 (North Melbourne): Score = 9.12, which is not greater than 10.\n8. Row 3 (Richmond): Score = 17.9, which is greater than 10.\n9. Row 4 (South Melbourne): Score = 8.15, which is not greater than 10.\n10. Row 5 (Geelong): Score = 15.8, which is greater than 10.\n11. Row 6 (Melbourne): Score = 8.10, which is not greater than 10.\n12. There are 3 away teams with a score greater than 10 and 5 rows where the away team was present.\n13. Since there are more away teams in Rows 3 and 5 compared to others (i.e., only two other away teams didn't have a higher than 10), we can see that indeed more than half of away teams do have scores greater than 10.\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"List rows where away team is not empty\",\n    \"Count away teams with score greater than 10 in each row\",\n    \"Verify count of away teams with higher than 10 against total number of away teams\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away team\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
