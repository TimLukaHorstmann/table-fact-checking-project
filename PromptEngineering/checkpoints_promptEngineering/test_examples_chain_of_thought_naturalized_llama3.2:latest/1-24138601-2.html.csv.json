In the given table, there are columns for scoring (e.g., `l` or `w`) that represent wins or losses with a score value, and a column called `final score`. We need to focus on rows where `final score` is higher than 44 since it would indicate giving up points.\n\n2. Analyze each row's final score to determine if the team gave up more than 44 points:\n\n- For every loss (l), we'll check its final score.\n- We're looking for instances where the team loses with a final score greater than 44, as these represent situations where they \"give up\" more than 44 points.\n\n3. Verify that there are no instances of this happening twice to confirm accuracy.\n\n4. List all relevant cells if needed.\n\n5.

And since they lose only once in row 12 and row 13 we can infer there is one more win after that loss.\n\n6. **Check row 13 for ending of streak**:\n   - In row 13 argonauts looses against alouettes, which means our sequence ends here.\n\n\n\n7. **Evaluate if there's indeed a stretch with 7 consecutive wins**: \n   - Row 10 shows two consecutive games won by Argonauts and we can infer that they won one more game before the loss in row 13 (based on step 5). That gives us three consecutive wins.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The claim is true, there was indeed a stretch where Argonauts won 7 or more consecutive games.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Understand the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Look for consecutive winning streaks in the table\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Examine each week and opponent's performance\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -7\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": +14\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -24\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -17\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -21\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -14\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 7,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -4\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 8,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -10\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 9,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": -15\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 10,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": +0\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 11,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": +41\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 12,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": +24\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Check row 10 for consecutive wins\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 10,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"+37\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Check row 11 for the start of another stretch\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 11,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"+41\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Check row 13 for ending of streak\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 13,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"-7\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Evaluate if there's indeed a stretch with 7 consecutive wins\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 10,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"+37\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 11,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"+41\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion\",\n      \"details\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 10,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"+37\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 11,\n          \"column_name\": \"final_score\",\n          \"value\": \"+41\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"final_answer\": true\n}",

This requires locating rows with the highest attendances.\n\n#### Step 3: Find the row(s) with the first highest attendance\nTo verify if this claim is true, we must first determine the game with the first highest attendance. We will search for a row with the highest attendance in the table.\n\n#### Step 4: Locate data on the last (ninth or tenth) game of the season to compare against the high attendance found.\nWe also need to identify which game took place during the ninth week of the season and then check it's attendance against that of the first. \n\n#### Step 5: Compare highest attendance in a non-last game with that of last/second last\nIf both attendances are not equal, then we can say our claim is false because no second highest attendance was in a non-last game\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\",\n      \"description\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Locate the relevant data for comparison\",\n      \"description\": \"Locating rows with highest attendances\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Find the row(s) with the first highest attendance\",\n      \"description\": \"\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Locate data on the last (ninth or tenth) game of the season to compare against the high attendance found.\",\n      \"description\":\"\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n       {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\":\"attendance\"},\n       {\"row_index\":10,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n     ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 5: Compare highest attendance in a non-last game with that of last/second last\",\n      \"description\":\"\",\n      \"relevant_cells\":\n        [\n          {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\":\"attendance\"},\n          {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\":\"attendance\"}\n        ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": (10[\"attendance\"] > 9[\"attendance\"]) ? \"TRUE\" : \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":2, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":3, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":4, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":5, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":6, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":8, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\":10, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is: `{ \"chain_of_thought\": [...], \"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [...] }`",
