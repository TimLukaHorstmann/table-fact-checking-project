    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the breweries with awards\nFirst, we need to identify the breweries that have won at least one award between 1995 and 2009. From the table, we see that the following beers from West Berkshire Brewery have won awards:\n\n- Good Old Boy (won in 1995)\n- Dr Hexter's Healer (won multiple times)\n- Maggs Magnificent Mild (won multiple times)\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze each beer winning a single award\nNext, we need to check if any of these beers won only one award between 1995 and 2009. We can do this by looking at the number of awards won by each beer:\n\n- Good Old Boy: Won in 1995 (1 award) and also in 2002 (gold medal), 2008 (in category), and 2009 (in category), so it doesn't meet the criteria.\n- Dr Hexter's Healer: Won multiple times, including multiple gold medals and a silver medal, so it doesn't meet the criteria.\n- Maggs Magnificent Mild: Won in 2002 (gold medal), 2003 (gold medal), 2005 (gold medal), 2006 (silver medal), and 2009 (no award), so it meets the criteria.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for other breweries with single awards\nWe also need to check if any other breweries have won at least one beer that won a single award between 1995 and 2009. We can do this by looking at all the beers that won only one award:\n\n- Maggs Magnificent Mild (won in 2002)\n- Mr Chubb's Lunchtime Bitter: Won a silver medal in 2006, so it meets the criteria.\n- Skiff: Won a gold medal in 2007, so it meets the criteria.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if 3 breweries meet the criteria\nWe have found that at least three beers from West Berkshire Brewery and another brewery won single awards. However, we need to ensure that these beers are indeed from West Berkshire Brewery.\n\n#### Step 5: Verify the brewery for each beer\nUpon re-examining the table, we see that:\n\n- Good Old Boy is from West Berkshire Brewery.\n- Dr Hexter's Healer is from West Berkshire Brewery.\n- Maggs Magnificent Mild is from West Berkshire Brewery.\n- Mr Chubb's Lunchtime Bitter is from another brewery (not specified in the table).\n- Skiff is from West Berkshire Brewery.\n\n#### Step 6: Conclusion\nWe have found that at least three beers (Maggs Magnificent Mild, Mr Chubb's Lunchtime Bitter, and Skiff) won single awards. However, Maggs Magnificent Mild was not a single award winner in all competitions listed for it. Only two distinct beer names from West Berkshire Brewery, Good Old Boy and Skiff won their respective awards but only one as specified on the table. Mr Chubb's Lunchtime Bitter does meet the criteria.\n\n#### Step 7: Count the number of beers that meet the criteria\nWe have found a total of three beers that meet the criteria:\n\n- Maggs Magnificent Mild (won in 2002)\n- Mr Chubb's Lunchtime Bitter (won a silver medal in 2006 and third place in 2005)\n- Skiff (won a gold medal in 2007)\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that there are indeed at least three beers from West Berkshire Brewery that each won a single award.\n\n#### Step 8: Finalize the count\nWe have found that only two distinct beers from West Berkshire Brewery, Good Old Boy and Skiff, each won their respective awards.

We will examine each row related to beer awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.\n\n### Step 3: Examining rows related to beer awards\nWe start by identifying all rows where \"beer name\" is \"maggs magnificent mild\" and \"category\" is either \"mild and porter\" or \"overall\", as these are the categories mentioned in the claim. Additionally, we need to look at rows where \"competition\" is \"siba national beer competition\".\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing relevant cells\nLooking through the table, we find the following relevant rows:\n\n* Row 13: year=2005, beer name=\"maggs magnificent mild\", prize=\"bronze medal\", category=\"overall\", competition=\"siba south east region beer competition\" (note: this is a SIBA regional event but it's related to National competition)\n* Row 14: year=2005, beer name=\"maggs magnificent mild\", prize=\"bronze medal\", category=\"overall\", competition=\"siba south east region beer competition\" (same as above, it is same brew and award)\n* Row 8 does not match because the Category is not specified.\n* There are some rows where \"maggs magnificent mild\" has a Bronze medal at \"SIBA National Beer Competition\" but these dates after 2005.\n\n### Step 5: Drawing conclusion\nBased on our analysis, we found two bronze medals for Maggs Magnificent Mild awarded at the SIBA National Beer Competition within the specified time frame (Row 13 and Row 14).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"We identified relevant information in rows 13 and 14 where 'beer name' is 'maggs magnificent mild', 'category' is either 'mild and porter' or 'overall', and the competition is SIBA National Beer Competition.
