Check if Dallembert's high score (23) is higher than anyone else in terms of high points: No one has a higher high point than Dallembert in the table.\n4. Verify that no other player also has a higher rebound total: In Row 1, Row 2, and Row 6, players have less rebounds than Dallembert's 16 in game 3.\n5.

We will look at the values of 'high assists' in each row.\n\n2. Next, we need to determine if there are any rows where the assist value is 0 (empty cell). If there are, those cells should be excluded from our consideration because the problem statement asks us to identify when a player has lower assistance than another player who also has an assist value of 0 in that row.\n\n3.

Next, we will compare the assist values of iguodala and evans.\n   Since both iguodala and evans have non-zero assist values in all instances, we should determine if there is an instance where iguodala has a lower value than evans.\n\n5. Comparing (8, 4, 6) and (14, 11, 7), it can be seen that while Iguodala's lowest assist was the highest for him, in row 3, Evans' lowest assist was also higher than Iguodala's lowest assist. Therefore, we need to check if there are instances where iguodala has a lower assist value than evans.\n\n6. Next, since we want to make sure our answer is correct, let us see another instance of assists in row 5.\n   - (6)\n\n7. Comparing (8, 4, 6) and (14, 11, 7), it can be seen that while Iguodala's lowest assist was the highest for him, in row 3, Evans' lowest assist was also higher than Iguodala's lowest assist. However, looking at row 5, we see a value of (6) for Igoudala and (7) for Evans. Since (6) is lower than (7), we can safely say that iguodala has lower assists in one instance.\n\n8. Given the above data, we can safely conclude that our answer will be TRUE because there is indeed an instance where Iguodala's lowest assist value was lower than Evans' lowest assist value.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"high assists\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
