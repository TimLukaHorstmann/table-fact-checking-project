    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the claim being made: \"only 1 of the songs from the 'Dead Guy's Remix' be not in 2003\".\n\n2. To verify this claim, we should look for rows where the song title contains \"Dead Guy's Remix\" and check if they are not all from the year 2003.\n\n3. We will list out all rows that contain a song with \"Dead Guy's Remix\" and then check their release years to see which ones do or do not match the claim.\n\n4. Let's start by identifying these rows:\n   - Row 1: blondie, good boys, The Curse of Blondie, Dead Guys Remix\n   - Row 2: Chicane, Locking Down, The Best of Chicane : 19962008, Dead Guys Remix\n   - Row 3: Lamb, Wonder, Between Darkness and Wonder, Dead Guys Remix\n   - Row 4: Texas, Can't Resist, Red Book, Dead Guys Remix\n\n5. We can see that there are four rows where the song title includes \"Dead Guy's Remix\". Now we need to check their release years.\n\n6. The row corresponding to blondie has a year of 2003.\n7. The row for Chicane, while including a remix named Dead Guys Remix, does not solely refer to it in its description - instead referring to both 1996-2008 and 2003 releases mixed in the track title which might mislead from the real release year of \"Locking Down\". So this one is ambiguous.\n8. Lamb's Wonder also has a 2003 release year.\n9. Texas's Can't Resist has a 2005 release year.\n\n10. From these observations, we can conclude that not all songs by Dead Guy's Remix were released in the year 2003. Specifically:\n    - Blondie (2003) is included\n    - Lamb (2003) is included\n    - Texas (2005) is not included\n\n11. Since only one song doesn't match the claim, and that is \"Can't Resist\" by Texas with a release year of 2005, we can say that our original claim about only one being not in 2003 isn't accurate given the broader interpretation.\n\n### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify rows containing song with 'Dead Guy's Remix'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Check release years of identified songs\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"List the songs where the claim that only one was not in 2003 seems to be true based on release year\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This information will be used later to compare with other artists.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Row 2 (Chicane) and Row 3 (Lamb)\nBoth Chicane and Lamb have only one entry in the year 2003, both with a single song each.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Row 4 (Texas)\nThere is one entry for Texas in the year 2005. This information will be used to compare with other artists in the same year.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Row 5 and Row 6 (Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique)\nBoth Pixie Lott and Perry Mystique have multiple song entries in the year 2010, one for each row.\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate the claim\nBased on the analysis above, it appears that only Texas has a single song entry in the year 2005, while all other artists listed had at least two song entries in their respective years.
