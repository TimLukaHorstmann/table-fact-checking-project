First, let's look at the given dataset to understand its structure:\n\t* Each row represents a game.\n\t* The columns are as follows: \"date\", \"player\", \"opponent\", etc.\n\n2.

Let's compare these dates across rows to find the earliest one:\n\t* Upon closer inspection, we see that there are multiple instances of April 20, but no earlier date than this is mentioned.\n\t* However, it seems that other dates like March 7 and February 22 might be part of later games in their respective sequences.\n\n5.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The problem asks us to determine if Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan tie for the highest point total based on a given dataset.\n2. To solve this, we need to analyze each row of the dataset to find the highest point total scored by any player.\n3. We'll start from the last row (Row 30) and move upwards to identify the player with the highest point total.\n4. For Row 30, LeBron James has a point total of 51, which is not tied with anyone else in the dataset.\n5. Moving to Row 29, Hakeem Olajuwon also has a point total of 46, but it's lower than LeBron's.\n6. Continuing this process for Rows 28 and 27, we find that Karl Malone's point total (52) is higher than both LeBron's and Hakeem's, but there's no mention of Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan in these rows.\n7. We'll keep moving upwards to check if Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan have the highest point total.\n8. In Row 26, Michael Jordan has a point total of 50, which is not tied with anyone else.\n9. However, we need to check Rows 25 and 24 for other players, especially since Michael Jordan's point total is still relatively high.\n10. Upon inspecting Rows 25 and 24, we find that both Kobe Bryant (61) and Michael Jordan (53 in Row 24) have higher point totals than Michael Jordan's current score in Row 26.\n11. This means that either Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan must have the highest point total, but which one?\n12. Let's re-examine Rows 25 and 24 to see who has the highest point total: In Row 25, Kobe Bryant scores a whopping 61 points, while in Row 24, Michael Jordan scores 53 points.\n13.
