    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. We need to find the first Grand Slam tournament match win for player Poloma.\n   - Refer to table Row 1, Column 'tournament' which lists tournaments throughout the years. Find all the grand slam tournaments she participated in by looking at the years with 'grand slam tournaments'.\n   - The relevant values are: row 1, column 'tournament'.\n\n2. We need to find the first match win for player Poloma.\n   - Refer to table Row 28, Column 'year end ranking'. Find her highest year-end ranking, which indicates the best performing season of the year. \n   - Her highest year-end ranking is at row 28, column 'year end ranking'.\n\n3. We need to find the first match win for player Poloma after she won a Grand Slam tournament.\n   - From step 1 and step 2, we have her participation in grand slam tournaments (row 1, column 'tournament') and highest year-end ranking (row 28, column 'year end ranking'). But now, let's check the relevant columns for matches first.\n   - Refer to table Row 22, Column 'win - loss'. Look at all of her wins and losses. Her win percentage is also in this row. We are looking for a specific year. Thus, we need to look at column 'year' which isn't present but we have other relevant columns.\n   - Look at Table Row 28, Column 'year end ranking' and find the year she ranked highest, then go to table Row 22, Column 'win loss'. In this case, there is no clear match win year. Thus, her first grand slam tournament will be in row 1, column 'tournament', so we need to find all wins for that specific year.\n\n4. Let's look at Table Row 22, Column 'year'. If there are multiple matches of the same player in different years, they will have a unique year.\n   - Refer to Table Row 25, Column 'tour level win %' and row 24, column 'tour level win - loss'. This shows us the winning percentage for that specific year. In this case, we are looking for an exact year where she has won her first grand slam match. We will need to compare with other relevant columns.\n   - Refer back to table Row 28, Column 'year end ranking' and find her highest year-end ranking and then refer to Table Row 22, Column 'win loss'. From here, we can find the exact year where she won a grand slam tournament match for the first time.\n\n5. Now let's look at Table Row 23, Column 'statistics'.\n   - This column lists statistics throughout the years. She is listed in this table as 'statistics' because we do not have any specific information on Poloma. \n   - It would be logical to find her win percentage for that year and compare it with other columns but we can't conclude anything here, so let's move forward.\n\n6. Finally, refer to Table Row 24, Column 'tour level win - loss'. Here we will look at the number of wins for each tournament level in different years.\n   - Let's find her first match win for that year by looking through table row 22. The relevant values are: row 22, column 'year'.\n\n7. Now let's determine if this is indeed her first grand slam match win after she won a grand slam tournament.\n   - From step 1 and step 6 we have the year she participated in the grand slam tournaments (row 1, column 'tournament') and the number of wins that year (row 24, column 'tour level win - loss'). Now let's look at table row 22, Column 'win loss'. Find her first match win for that specific year.\n   - Her first match win comes after she won a grand slam tournament match. But if we refer to Table Row 25, Column 'tour level win %', then the next possible value of 'year' is indeed in table row 22, column 'win loss'.\n\n8. Therefore, since her first grand slam match was after winning that specific year's match, she must have won a match before or at the same time as her first grand slam tournament match.\n   - In this case we can conclude that \"poloma 's first premier mandatory match win comes after her first grand slam tournament match win\" is TRUE.\n\n9. Finally, let's output the final answer in JSON format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Find all the grand slam tournaments Poloma participated in\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Find her highest year-end ranking\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Look at column 'win loss' for a match win after she won a grand slam tournament\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Compare with table row 25, Column 'tour level win %'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Look at table row 23, Column 'statistics'\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"Find her first match win in that year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"text\": \"Determine if this is indeed her first grand slam match win after she won a grand slam tournament\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"text\": \"Conclude and output the final answer\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": true\n}\n```",

To determine if the claim about Polona having the most grand slam match win in 2010 and 2011, we need to analyze the table provided for these specific years.\n\n2. First, let's find the total number of grand slam matches won by Polona in 2010 and 2011 from row 26 (overall win - loss) as it lists the year end overall wins.\n\n3. Next, compare the number of grand slam match wins with the number of other tour level wins for both years to ensure that Polona had more wins than other matches.\n\n4. Then, verify if there are any other years where Polona won more grand slam matches than in 2010 and 2011 by examining the overall win - loss records from row 26.\n\n5. After confirming Polona had no higher number of grand slam match wins than 2010 and 2011, let's look at the year end ranking for each year to confirm that 2010 and 2011 indeed are when she held this record from row 28.\n\n6. Finally, double-check if there were other years where Polona had more overall tour level win % (row 27) than in 2010 and 2011 as a tiebreaker or comparison for overall performance.\n\n\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 1: Analyze table provided to identify relevant data.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\"row_index\": 26, \"column_name\": \"2010\"],\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 2: Extract grand slam wins for Polona in 2010 and 2011 from the overall win - loss records in row 26.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 26,\n          \"column_name\": \"2010\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"32 - 26\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 26,\n          \"column_name\": \"2011\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"32 - 27\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 3: Check if Polona had more grand slam matches won than other tour level wins in both years.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": []\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 4: Verify there are no other years where Polona had more grand slam match wins than in 2010 and 2011.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 26,\n          \"column_name\": \"2010\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"32 - 26\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 26,\n          \"column_name\": \"2011\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"32 - 27\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 5: Confirm Polona's year-end rankings in row 28 to confirm the record.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 28,\n          \"column_name\": \"2010\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"48\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 28,\n          \"column_name\": \"2011\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"36\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning\": \"Step 6: Compare year-end overall tour level win % (row 27) to ensure no other years have a higher percentage than Polona in 2010 and 2011.\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 27,\n          \"column_name\": \"2010\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"55%\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 27,\n          \"column_name\": \"2011\",\n          \"cell_value\": \"54%\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"2010\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"2011\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the relevant table columns for the claim.\nThe claim mentions two types of wins: total match win and grand slam match win. We need to identify the columns in the table where these wins are recorded.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n- Total match win is recorded in column \"win - loss\" under row 24 (specifically, the cell at row_index = 24, column_name = \"Tour level win - loss\").\n- Grand slam match win is not explicitly listed as a separate column in the table. However, it is mentioned in some rows as part of other columns like \"Statistics\" or as a single number.\n\n#### Step 2: Filter data for 2011 to find total match win.\nWe need to extract the data from row 24 where the year is 2011 to determine if it was indeed the year with the most total match wins. We look at the cell at row_index = 24, column_name = \"Tour level win - loss\".\n\n#### Step 3: Find grand slam match wins for 2009.\nWe need to extract data from rows that mention years or are specifically associated with grand slam matches in 2009 to determine if it was indeed the year with the most grand slam match wins. We look at rows related to \"Statistics\", \"Tour level win - loss\", and any row mentioning \"Grand Slam\" for 2009.\n\n#### Step 4: Compare data from steps 2 and 3.\nWe compare the total match wins in 2011 with the grand slam match wins in 2009. If one is greater, we have our answer based on the claim.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if poloma had more total match wins in 2011 than in any other year.\nCompare the data for 2011 against all other years to ensure it was indeed the highest total match win year.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if poloma had most grand slam matches won in 2009.\nGiven that the specific column for just grand slam wins is not explicitly provided, we must infer this from any relevant \"Statistics\" or \"Tour level win - loss\" data that might indicate a record for that year. We look specifically at rows related to these columns and years.\n\n#### Step 7: Compile findings into JSON format.\nBased on the steps above, compile the findings into a JSON object according to the specified format.\n\nHere is my attempt at following the instructions:\n\n```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"text\": \"Identify relevant table columns for the claim.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"text\": \"Filter data for 2011 to find total match win.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"text\": \"Find grand slam match wins for 2009.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"text\": \"Compare data from steps 2 and 3.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"text\": \"Determine if poloma had more total match wins in 2011 than in any other year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"text\": \"Determine if poloma had most grand slam matches won in 2009.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 24,\n      \"column_name\": \"Tour level win - loss\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 28,\n      \"column_name\": \"Statistics\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 26,\n      \"column_name\": \"Overall win - loss\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n{ \"chain_of_thought\": [...], \"answer\": \"FALSE\", \"relevant_cells\": [...] }",

Identify the relevant rows and columns:\n\t* We need to find Poloma's first grand slam tournament match win and her second premier mandatory match win.\n\t* The relevant row for grand slam wins is Row 2 (tournament: grand slam tournaments) and Row 16 (tournament: win - loss).\n\t* The relevant row for premier mandatory wins is Row 16 (tournament: win - loss) and Row 26 (tournament: premier 5).\n\t* We also need to find the year of Poloma's first and second match wins.\n\t* This can be done by looking at the \"year\" column in Row 28 (tournament: year end ranking).\n2. Find Poloma's first grand slam tournament match win:\n\t* In Row 16 (tournament: win - loss), we see that there is a win-loss record for each tournament type, including \"grand slam tournaments\".\n\t* The value in the row for \"2006\" and \"2007\" suggests that Poloma had at least one match win, but it doesn't specify if it was her first grand slam win.\n3.
