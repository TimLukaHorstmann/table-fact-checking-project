However, this does not match the claim. We need to look for the cell that lists Rob Emerson's actual record.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if there are multiple records for Rob Emerson\nUpon reviewing the table again, we notice that there are multiple rows with opponents named after states or cities (e.g., California, Florida), which may imply different fights involving Rob Emerson in different locations.

We must conclude that there is no indication of Rob Emerson having a record of \"13 - 10\" in MMA career.\n\n#### Step 5: Compare with given information to determine the claim's validity\nSince we did not find any row explicitly stating Rob Emerson's record as \"13 - 10\", and only found one instance where he has a win-loss record of \"1 - 4\", the claim that \"Rob Emerson have the highest win record of 13 - 10 in his MMA career\" is false.\n\n#### Step 6: Output the result\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 0,\n      \"column_name\": \"no relevant information\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 20,\n      \"column_name\": \"record\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. The claim states there is only 1 KO (punches) method for a win by Rob Emerson.\n2. To evaluate the claim, we need to find out how many times Rob Emerson has won a fight using the KO (punches) method and compare it with the number of times he has used this method in any of his fights that ended in a win.\n3. Looking at Row 10: res: win, record: 8 - 6 (1), opponent: manny gamburyan, method: ko (punches), event: ufc 87, round: 1, location: minneapolis , minnesota , united states. We see that Rob Emerson used the KO (punches) method to win against Manny Gamburyan.\n4. Next, let's look at Row 15: res: win, record: 10 - 9 (1), opponent: jamie schmidt, method: tko, event: tc 13 - anarchy, round: 2, location: del mar , california , united states. Although this is a Tko victory, the claim specifies KO(punches) so we can disregard it as a possible answer.\n5. Let's verify that there are no other victories of Rob Emerson with KO (punches).\n6. Reviewing all 24 rows in the table, I found two wins by knockout using punches: Row 10: res: win, record: 8 - 6 (1), opponent: manny gamburyan, method: ko (punches), event: ufc 87, round: 1, location: minneapolis , minnesota , united states. and Row 16: res: win, record: 3 - 6, opponent: julian samaniego, method: tko, event: kotc - flash point, round: 1, location: san jacinto , california , united states.\n7. Since there are more than one KO (punches) victory for Rob Emerson and only one of the victories in question was with this method, the claim can be evaluated as False.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []",
