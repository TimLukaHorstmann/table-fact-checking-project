Check Row 58: Since it says he can play both left and right wing, but doesn't specify three positions, this row does not directly support the claim.\n4. Look for additional players who could potentially play more than two positions:\n   - Row 17: pick=59, Jim Mathieson is listed as playing defence and another position is missing (it's defence too), which indicates that he plays only one defence position mentioned but there is no info about a third position.\n   - Other rows may have players with more information on their positional play, such as Row 12: pick=54, John Tanner is listed as \"goaltender\" and Row 16 doesn't show him playing any position, so he is not one of them.\n\n5.
