To verify this, we need to check all rows in the table that have a position of \"left wing\" and see if Triston Grant is the only one listed.\n3. Looking at row 10: round: 9, player: triston grant, position: left wing, nationality: canada, college / junior / club team (league): vancouver giants ( whl ).\n   - In this row, we can confirm that Triston Grant is indeed listed as a left wing.\n4. Next, let's check other rows for players listed as left wings:\n   - Row 1 does not list a player in the \"left wing\" position.\n   - Row 2 also does not have any information about left wing positions.\n   - Similarly, row 3 and row 5 do not mention left wing.\n   - Rows 6 and 7 contain players that are centers or centers who play both center and another position. Therefore they cannot be considered as the only player in the \"left\" category\n   - Row 11 lists a different player for the center position than Triston Grant so he can't be the left wing \n5. Given our findings, we have verified that Triston Grant is indeed the only listed player with left wing position.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"left wing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"left wing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"left wing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"left wing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"left wing\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"center\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"center\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"center\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"left wing\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This involves examining rows 10 through 11, as those are the only rows corresponding to round 9 in the table.\n\n- Row 10: player - triston grant (left wing), row 11: player - john carter (center)\n\n#### Step 4: Check if there's at least one other player from round 9 with the same position\nSince we found that Triston Grant is a left winger and John Carter is a center, both playing different positions. However, to fulfill our initial reasoning step accurately, let's check for any other player in round 9 who might be on defense or right wing, which could potentially match one of these players' positions.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the rest of the players from round 9\n- Row 10 is Triston Grant.\n- Row 11 is John Carter.\n\nUpon reviewing these steps and the table again for completeness and accuracy:\n\nIn step 4 and 5, we concluded that there wasn't another player in round 9 with the same position as Triston Grant or John Carter.
