To determine if the claim about the highest attended game in New Jersey Devils' 07 - 08 season being against Philadelphia is true, we need to first find out which games were played at home and where.\n\n2. We then compare the attendance of each of these games with that of the game against Philadelphia to check which one has the higher attendance.\n \n3. Finally, if a game has a higher attendance than the Philadelphia game, we conclude that it is not the highest attended game in New Jersey Devils' 07 - 08 season.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n]\n\n#### Chain of Thought:\nWe need to check if there is a game with higher attendance than the Philadelphia game in Row 4.\n\n- From the table, we can see that on November 17th, home: philadelphia, attendance: 19621.\n- This value is greater than the one on November 8th, visitor: philadelphia, attendance: 14948.\n- Therefore, the highest attended game in New Jersey Devils' 07 - 08 season was not against Philadelphia.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"From Row 4 (visitor: philadelphia, attendance: 14948) and Row 9 (home: philadelphia, attendance: 19621), we can see that home game in row 9 has a higher attendance.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the Claim**: Understand what the claim is stating about a shutout game.\n\n   - A shutout game refers to a game where one team does not score any points.\n   - The New Jersey Devils lose 3 games this way, which implies they lost 3 shutout games in their recent matches.\n   \n2. **Find Shutout Games for the New Jersey Devils**: \n   - To verify if the claim is true, we need to find out how many of these \"shutout games\" the New Jersey Devils have played and won in the given table.\n   \n3. **Look at Record for Relevant Matches**:\n   - Go through each relevant match of the New Jersey Devils as shown in the table and check if it ended with a score of 0 (a shutout) since that is when they \"did not score at all during a game\".\n   - Take note of games where record = 13-10-2 for this step.\n\n4. **Verify Claim**:\n   - From the matches listed, verify whether each match had an attendance greater than zero and that none of their scores were 0 (shutouts) since we are assuming the question intended \"did not score at all\" means a team's score was NOT 0.\n   - Since all shutout scores in the table aren't relevant to our claim, we only check the total number of shutouts.\n\n5. **Finalize Answer**:\n   - Count how many times there is an attendance greater than zero and no score of 0 from the given matches.\n   - Verify if this amount aligns with what's expected based on \"a team do not score at all during a game the new jersey devil lose 3 game this way , score no point\".\n\n6. **Answer in JSON Format**:\n   - List relevant cells as objects with row_index and column_name, and output answer TRUE or FALSE for claim.\n\n### Code\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the Claim\",\n      \"text\": \"A shutout game is when a team does not score at all during a game. The New Jersey Devils lose 3 games this way, which implies they lost 3 shutout games in their recent matches.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find Shutout Games for the New Jersey Devils\",\n      \"text\": \"Verify if the claim is true by finding how many of these 'shutout games' the New Jersey Devils have played and won\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Look at Record for Relevant Matches\",\n      \"text\": \"Go through each relevant match of the New Jersey Devils as shown in the table and check if it ended with a score of 0 (a shutout)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify Claim\",\n      \"text\": \"From the matches listed, verify whether each match had an attendance greater than zero\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Finalize Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Count how many times there is an attendance greater than zero and no score of 0 from the given matches.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nAfter running through the steps above, we conclude that there are no games where score = 0 (shutouts) in all matches relevant to our claim. Therefore, since a shutout is when one team does not score any points, and there were three shutouts for New Jersey Devils, but none of these had scores of zero, the statement \"a shutout game be when a team do not score at all during a game the new jersey devil lose 3 game this way , score no point\" is FALSE.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis response provides all relevant information following the specified format for the final answer.",
