We need to verify if it indeed held this title for so long.\n\n2. **Verifying its current status**: Next, we compare its current year as the tallest (21 years) with the present. This is necessary to confirm whether Notre Dame Basilica has lost its position as the tallest building.\n\n3. **Checking the accuracy of 'most years as tallest' record**: To ensure the claim's validity, we need to verify if Notre Dame Basilica holds the longest tenure as the tallest. If it does, then our answer would be `TRUE`; otherwise, it would be `FALSE`.\n\nBased on the provided data in the table:\n\n- The Notre Dame Basilica held its position for 99 years from 1829 - 1928.\n- Its current year as the tallest is only 21 years (as of the present time).\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, we conclude that the claim is `FALSE`.",

The relevant columns are:\n\t* `name`\n\t* `years as tallest` (which includes both start and end years)\n\t* `of years as tallest` (to determine the length of time a building was the tallest)\n2. **Determine the relevance of each column**: We need to compare the number of years a building was the tallest with its height.\n3. **Find the relevant buildings for the claim**: The claim states that two buildings are in question, but only one is currently being considered (based on its status as \"current\"). Therefore, we should focus on `Tour Cibc` and `Place Ville Marie`.\n4. **Evaluate `Tour Cibc`**:\n\t* `years as tallest`: 1962\n\t* `of years as tallest`: <1 year\n\t* Since it was only the tallest for less than a year, this is not a strong candidate.\n5. **Evaluate `Place Ville Marie`**:\n\t* `years as tallest`: 1962 - 1964 = 2 years\n\t* `of years as tallest`: 2 years\n\t* Although it was taller for a total of 2 years, the claim states that if there is another building with \"the least amount of year\", we need to follow by this one. Therefore, the only candidate in question is indeed `Place Ville Marie`.\n6. **Verify that `Place Ville Marie` meets the conditions**: \n\t* It was taller for a total of 2 years\n\t* This is less than the time that Tour Cibc held the title (less than 1 year)\n7. **Conclusion**: The claim \"the tour cibc be the tallest building for the least amount of year, follow by place ville marie\" can be confirmed to be true, since there are only two relevant buildings and Place Ville Marie meets both conditions (it was taller for the least amount of years).\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identify relevant columns for claim, determine column relevance, find relevant buildings, evaluate Tour Cibc and Place Ville Marie.
