This is one instance.\n    - No other row directly matches, but we need to check if there's another game where the home team scored exactly 5 goals. That would be a different game where Vancouver is at home and scores exactly 5.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Continued\n\n5. **Check for Game with Vancouver as Home Team Scoring Exactly 5 Goals**:\n    - Looking through the rows, we find Row 8: Date (April 15), Visitor (Vancouver), Score (8 - 6). Here, Vancouver scored exactly 5 goals in a game where they were at home.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process Continued\n\n6. **Conclusion**: There are two games with Vancouver scoring exactly 5 goals in them\u2014a home and away instance.

First, let's determine the number of goals against Los Angeles on April 13: This can be found by looking at the score on Row 7 (4 - 7) where the visitor was Los Angeles.\n\n2. Now we need to find out how many goals against Los Angeles Vancouver scored on April 15: We will look at the row for April 15, which is row 8, and verify that the team was indeed visiting Los Angeles.\n\n3. After identifying both numbers of goals against Los Angeles from step 1 and 2 respectively, we can compare them to see if vancouver scored fewer goals against los angeles on april 15 than they do on april 13. \n\n4. We know from row 7 that Vancouver scored 7 goals against Los Angeles on April 13.\n\n5. Now, let's look at the value in Row 8, column score (score: 8 - 6), which corresponds to the number of goals for vancouver, not against los angeles. So we have to go back and find the correct values to compare against each other. \n\n6. Since row 8 does correspond to a game between Vancouver visiting Los Angeles and it's actually score column that gives us the info on goal Vancouver scored. So we are looking at row 8, score column (score: 8 - 6).\n\n7. Lastly let's go back and look at row 7 of the table and find out how many goals against los angeles vancouver scored on april 13.\n\n#### JSON Response:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the number of goals against Los Angeles on April 13\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Verify that Vancouver is visiting Los Angeles on April 15 to ensure we're using the correct row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Compare the number of goals against Los Angeles scored by Vancouver on April 13 and April 15\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Based on the table header, these are Row 1, Row 3, Row 4, Row 5, Row 6, Row 7, and Row 8.\n\n#### Step 2: Extract attendance for each identified row\nNext, extract the attendance values from these identified rows:\n- Attendance at Row 1's game: 10425\n- Attendance at Row 3's game: 10575\n- Attendance at Row 4's game: 15858\n- Attendance at Row 5's game: 20214\n- Attendance at Row 6's game: 16150\n- Attendance at Row 7's game: 16150\n- Attendance at Row 8's game: 16005\n\n#### Step 3: Check if any attendance is below 15000\nWe need to verify whether any of these attendances are below 15000.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine relevance and answer based on check results\nAfter identifying which rows have attendances above or equal to 15000, determine the claim's truth value. If at least one of the games has attendance below 15000, then the claim is true; otherwise, it is false.\n\n#### Relevance Check Results:\nUpon examining the extracted values (10425, 10575, 15858, 20214, 16150, 16150, and 16005), we can see that all of them are greater than or equal to 15000. Therefore, none of Vancouver's games have attendance below 15000.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nGiven the absence of any attendance below 15000 for Vancouver's games, the claim \"there be fewer than 15000 crowd attendance for 6 of vancouver 's game\" is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified relevant rows (Row 1 to Row 8), extracted attendances from identified rows (10425, 10575, 15858, 20214, 16150, 16150, 16005).

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the claim: \"during the season , the second most goal Vancouver score in a single game be 8\".\n   The claim is about finding the second-highest score of Vancouver in a single game.\n\n2. To verify this claim, we must find all the scores scored by Vancouver and identify which one is not the highest and which one is the second highest.\n\n3. Looking at the table provided, row 4 indicates that Edmonton won with a score of 5-4 against Vancouver.\n   Row 8 indicates that Vancouver won with a score of 8-6 against Los Angeles.\n   Row 1 indicates that Vancouver scored 5 goals but lost to Tampa Bay with a final score of 3-5 (score: 3).\n   Row 2 indicates that Vancouver scored 1 goal but lost to Detroit with a final score of 5-1 (score: 1).\n   Row 6 indicates that Calgary won with a score of 6-3 against Vancouver.\n   Row 7 indicates that Vancouver won with a score of 7 goals but lost to Los Angeles with a final score of 4-7 (score: 7).\n   \n   Among the given data, it is clear that there are two different scores of Vancouver in single games. The first highest score is 8 which belongs to row 8.\n\n4. Now we need to find out what the second highest score is for a single game by vancouver. \n   Since row 1 indicates a loss with the score:3. And row 6 and row 7 both have higher scores than that. We can deduce that row 1 has the lowest score among all the data.\n\n5. After determining that row 1 is not our second-highest score, we see which one of the other data points are not the highest.\n   Row 4 indicates a loss with a score:4 and row 7 also shows a win with the same score 7.\n   But since Vancouver won both games they belong to the first place. Thus there is only one remaining cell left for our second-highest single game score, row 2 which has a total of 1 goal scored.\n\n6. After determining that we have our first and second highest scores:8 and 1 respectively we can now make our answer.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"First analyze the claim to find what is being asked.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"List all possible game results with Vancouver's name to identify which one could be a score of 8 and which one is not the highest.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify row 4 as having a higher score than row 1.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify row 7 as having a higher score than row 1 and thus not our second-highest game's score with that value of 8. \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify row 2 is the remaining data point with only one goal being scored in a single game by Vancouver, making it the lowest score.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine what the second highest score for vancouver would be and match that value to row 2's entry\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"score\"}\n  ]\n}",
