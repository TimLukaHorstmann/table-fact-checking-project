Additionally, we need to check if there are any other teams with lower rankings among the West German teams.\n\n#### Step 3: Compare Gabriele Beck and Jochen Stahl's ranking\nSince Row 12 states that Gabriele Beck and Jochen Stahl have a rank of 12, we need to verify that no other team has a lower ranking.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the West German teams' rankings\nLooking at Rows 1-8, none of them are from West Germany. Therefore, Row 13 (Rank 13) is the first instance of a West German team. The next row for West Germany is Row 14 (Rank 14). \n\n#### Step 5: Conclusion\nSince there are no other West German teams with lower rankings than Gabriele Beck and Jochen Stahl, who have a rank of 12, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 1,\n            \"description\": \"Identify the claim's components\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 2,\n            \"description\": \"Find the relevant row(s) in the table\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 3,\n            \"description\": \"Compare Gabriele Beck and Jochen Stahl's ranking\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 4,\n            \"description\": \"Analyze the West German teams' rankings\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"step_number\": 5,\n            \"description\": \"Conclusion\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 12,\n            \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 13,\n            \"column_name\": \"nation\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"row_index\": 14,\n            \"column_name\": \"nation\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```",

Since we only have one team's points and it's not clear how to compare with another, let's first check their scores against the 3rd rank team.\n   ```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 1,\n  \"column_name\": \"points\"\n}\n```\n   According to this cell, rank 1 is tied with a score of 144.54.\n\n4. **Calculate the difference between Sabine Bae\u00e3\u00ff/Tassilo Thierbach's scores and the score of the team ranked second:**\n   The relevant cells for calculating points would be:\n   ```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"points\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"points\"\n}\n```\n   According to these cells, their scores are 142.22 and 138.72.\n\n5. **Calculate the difference:**\n   Points of Sabine Bae\u00e3\u00ff/Tassilo Thierbach - Points of team rank second = 137.74 - 138.72\n\n6. **Determine if this difference equals 2.32:**\n   We must calculate: 137.74 - 138.72 to see if it's indeed 2.32\n\n7. **Final comparison:**\n   Subtract the points of the second team from Sabine Bae\u00e3\u00ff/Tassilo Thierbach's points.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 3,\n  \"column_name\": \"points\"\n},\n{\n  \"row_index\": 2,\n  \"column_name\": \"points\"\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation\n\n```python\nresult = (137.74 - 138.72)\nprint(result) # output : -0.98\n```\nSince the result is not equal to 2.32, the claim about Sabine Bae\u00e3\u00ff/Tassilo Thierbach scoring 2.32 point higher than the team rank second is false.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"rank\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
