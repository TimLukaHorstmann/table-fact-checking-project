    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the range of total academic staff in each school\nTo verify the claim, we need to calculate the total number of academic staff for each row in the table.\n\n#### Step 2: Calculate total academic staff for each row\nWe will extract the relevant data from the table:\n- Row 1: lecturers = 5, associate professors = 35, assistant professors = 27, professors = 40. Total = 120.\n- Row 2: lecturers = 9, associate professors = 10, assistant professors = 8, professors = 58. Total = 96.\n- Row 3: lecturers = 12, associate professors = 16, assistant professors = 17, professors = 23. Total = 81.\n- Row 4: lecturers = 5, associate professors = 12, assistant professors = 8, professors = 20. Total = 55.\n- Row 5: lecturers = 18, associate professors = 20, assistant professors = 9, professors = 34. Total = 119.\n- Row 6: lecturers = 6, associate professors = 13, assistant professors = 10, professors = 48. Total = 78.\n- Row 7: lecturers = 7, associate professors = 14, assistant professors = 5, professors = 15. Total = 49.\n- Row 8: lecturers = 4, associate professors = 10, assistant professors = 9, professors = 14. Total = 51.\n- Row 9: lecturers = 2, associate professors = 4, assistant professors = 8, professors = 14. Total = 28.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if the total number of academic staff in each school range from 24 - 120\nThe claim states that the total number of academic staff in each school should be between 24 and 120. We will verify this by checking the calculated totals for each row.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if any calculated totals are outside the specified range\nComparing the calculated totals with the specified range:\n- Row 1: 120 (outside)\n- Row 2: 96 (outside)\n- Row 3: 81 (outside)\n- Row 4: 55 (outside)\n- Row 5: 119 (outside)\n- Row 6: 78 (outside)\n- Row 7: 49 (outside)\n- Row 8: 51 (within)\n- Row 9: 28 (within)\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze the results\nThe calculated totals for Rows 1 to 5 are outside the specified range, while Rows 8 and 9 fall within it. Since only one row has a total that is not within the claimed range, we can make an educated conclusion.\n\n#### Step 6: Draw a final conclusion based on the analysis.\nBased on the analysis, the claim \"the total number of academic staff in each school range from 24 - 120\" is FALSE because some of the totals calculated fall outside this specific range.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer JSON\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Determine the range of total academic staff in each school\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Calculate total academic staff for each row\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 1,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 2,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 4,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 5,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 7,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 8,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 9,\n          \"column_name\": \"Total\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Check if the total number of academic staff in each school range from 24 -
