    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. First, we need to analyze the table's data structure. The row index represents the team's position (Row 1 corresponds to the first team in the table), and the column name corresponds to the type of data being displayed.\n2. Next, we examine the claim that there have been only two occasions when a team drew and it had a goal difference of 34-25 and 36-29. This requires us to find teams where the number of drawn matches is 1, which means they drew exactly once.\n3. To fulfill this requirement, we must verify if any of the given rows have these specific values: games=7, drawn=1, goal difference in the format (34 - 25 or 36 - 29), and points=7.\n\n#### Relevant Cells:\n[\n  {\n    \"row_index\":4,\n    \"column_name\":\"goal difference\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"row_index\":5,\n    \"column_name\":\"goal difference\"\n  }\n]\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nWe need to verify that there are exactly two teams who have both drawn exactly once and achieved the desired goal differences. In order to do this we will analyze each of these conditions separately.\n\n*   The team with 34-25 as a goal difference has played 7 matches, drew only once and won 3 times. It does not fulfill our requirements.\n*   The team with 36-29 as a goal difference has also played 7 matches, drawn only once and lost three times. Also it doesn't meet the requirements.\n\nSince neither row fulfills both conditions of having exactly one draw and achieving the desired points differential, we need to determine whether either of these rows meets individual conditions in order to reach a final conclusion about the claim.\n\n*   The team with 34-25 as goal difference has drawn only once. This matches our first requirement.\n*   The team with 36-29 as goal difference also drew exactly once (according to column \"drawn\" in row 5). This meets the second condition of the statement.\n\nBoth conditions are fulfilled, therefore we can answer the claim as TRUE.\n\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"The table has two teams that have drawn only once.

There actually isn't a row with points less than 2 based on the information given.\n\n### Step 6: Compile observations into chain_of_thought\nChain of thought:\n- Points never exceed 12.\n- Upon further review, there's no instance where points fall below 2 either, because after checking again against the table provided in the prompt for accuracy I realize now that my step about finding an instance of point being less than 2 might have been a misinterpretation based on the data itself.\n\n### Step 7: Compile observations into answer and relevant_cells\nGiven that no row has points greater than 12 and there's actually another realization:\n- There's indeed one occurrence when points are exactly equal to or just below 2 because Row 7 has points = 0.\nTherefore, the chain of thought includes both facts. However, it seems like a mistake was made in interpreting those \"less than\" conditions given the prompt since, indeed, row 8 shows that point does indeed drop below 2.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the claim is saying. It claims that when the points are 12, the goal difference is both 51 - 10 and 40 - 13.\n\n2. To evaluate this claim, let's examine Row 1 of the table where points = 12, goal difference = 51 - 10.\n   - games: 7\n   - drawn: 0\n   - lost: 1\n   - goal difference: 51 - 10\n   - points: 12\n\n3. Since the claim specifies that the points are 12 and the goal difference is 51 - 10, let's check if this condition holds true for Row 1.\n   - The points in Row 1 match the condition (points = 12).\n   - However, we need to compare the specified value of the goal difference with the actual goal difference in Row 1. \n     - Actual goal difference: 41 (calculated as 51 - 10)\n   - Since the actual goal difference does not equal 51 - 10, this condition is false for Row 1.\n\n4. Now let's examine Row 2 of the table where points = 12 and goal difference = 40 - 13.\n   - games: 7\n   - drawn: 0\n   - lost: 1\n   - goal difference: 40 - 13\n   - points: 12\n\n5. Since the claim specifies that the points are 12, let's check if this condition holds true for Row 2.\n   - The points in Row 2 match the condition (points = 12).\n   - However, we need to compare the specified value of the goal difference with the actual goal difference in Row 2. \n     - Actual goal difference: 27 (calculated as 40 - 13)\n   - Since the actual goal difference does not equal 40 - 13, this condition is false for Row 2.\n\n6. To evaluate if the claim can be true for any other rows with points = 12 and the specified goal differences, let's examine Row 3.\n   - games: 7\n   - drawn: 0\n   - lost: 2\n   - goal difference: 41 - 19\n   - points: 10\n\n7. Since the claim specifies that the points are 12, let's check if this condition holds true for Row 3.\n   - The points in Row 3 do not match the condition (points = 10).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that no other rows exist where both conditions specified by the claim hold true.\n\n8. Since only one of the conditions must be met according to the claim and neither of the conditions meet for any row examined above, we have established that the chain_of_thought is:\n    \"The given condition specified in the claim cannot be met at Row 1 or Row 2.\"\n\n9.

Analyze the claim and compare it to the relevant values in rows 1-2:\n\t* The claim states that when \"the point be 13\", the goal difference is either \"51 - 10\" or \"40 - 13\".\n\t* From Row 1, we know that when points = 12, games = 7 and drawn = 0, but it does not have a value for 13.\n    In row 2: The claim \"when the point be 13\", is matched by goal difference=40-13.\n4. Based on step 3, analyze if the condition in step 3 matches the information:\n   - Yes\n5. Conclude that since there are two rows matching points=13 and both match the first part of the claim, the claim must be TRUE.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\":1,\n      \"column_name\":\"goal difference\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\":2,\n      \"column_name\":\"goal difference\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"goal difference\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step 1: Understand the table structure\nThe table has 8 rows, each representing a team's performance with games played, draws, losses, goal difference, and points scored. The columns are:\n- `games`: number of games played\n- `drawn`: number of draws (ties)\n- `lost`: number of losses\n- `goal_difference`: the difference between goals scored and conceded\n- `points`: the total points scored\n\n### Step 2: Identify relevant rows for the claim\nTo determine if there are three times when the point is 7 and the number of loss is 3, we need to identify such rows in the table.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Row 4\nRow 4 has `games` = 7, `drawn` = 1, `lost` = 3, `goal_difference` = 34 - 25, and `points` = 7. Here, `games` = 7, `drawn` = 1, `lost` = 3, and `points` = 7.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Row 5\nRow 5 also has `games` = 7, `drawn` = 1, `lost` = 3, but `goal_difference` = 36 - 29 = 7, and `points` is not equal to 7 (it's 7 as well).\n\n### Step 5: Draw conclusion\nSince Row 4 and Row 5 have the same conditions (`games`, `drawn`, `lost`) and both have `points` of 7, these are two instances that meet the claim. However, no other row matches this exact scenario.\n\n### Step 6: Output final answer in JSON format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Understand the table structure\",\n    \"Step 2: Identify relevant rows for the claim\",\n    \"Step 3: Analyze Row 4\",\n    \"Step 4: Analyze Row 5\",\n    \"Step 5: Draw conclusion\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"goal_difference\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",
