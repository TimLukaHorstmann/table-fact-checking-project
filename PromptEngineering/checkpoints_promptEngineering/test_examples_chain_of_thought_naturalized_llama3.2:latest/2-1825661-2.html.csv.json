To evaluate the claim, we first need to find the column that contains the number of units produced (or 'number built').\n\nIn this case, the relevant column is labeled \"number built\" or simply \"Number Built\".\n\n### Step 2: Identify the rows for each chassis code\nThe claim refers to the specific chassis code w109.015 and states that it has the lowest number built among all other chassis codes in the table.\nWe need to identify which rows correspond to this chassis code.\n\nAccording to the table, Row 1 corresponds to the chassis code w109.015.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate if w109.015 has the lowest number built\nWe now compare the 'number built' value for the row corresponding to w109.015 (Row 1) with the values in other rows.\nIn Row 1, the 'number built' is 2.369.\nNow we will find all other chassis codes and their respective 'number built' values:\n\n- In Row 3: w109.018, the 'number built' is 6.526.\n- In Row 4: w109.056, the 'number built' is 9.483.\n- In Row 5: w109.057, the 'number built' is 2.533.\n\n### Step 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\nBy comparing the number of units produced for each chassis code:\nRow 1 (w109.015) has a lower number built compared to other rows.\nTherefore, the statement in the claim is TRUE.\n\nHere's the final JSON answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the column for 'number built'\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Identify the rows for each chassis code\",\n      \"text\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Evaluate if w109.015 has the lowest number built\",\n      \"text\": \"Comparing numbers of units produced for each row.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 4: Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE\",\n      \"text\": \"The 'number built' value in Row 1 (w109.015) is lower than other values.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"number built\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

So, there are two different engine types for the same model.\n4. We check if any other models have a single unique engine type. \n5. In Row 3, the model has an engine type that is not mentioned in row 1 or 2 which is m100 v8 (6.3l). This means there are more than two different engines for this model.\n6. For Row 4 and Row 5: The models \"300sel 3.5\" and \"300sel 4.5\" also have multiple unique engine types, namely m116 v8 and m117 v8 respectively.\n7.

Check if there is any other row with a model of '300sel' and engine of '4.5l m117 v8':\n   Looking at the table, we can see that Row 5 has an engine of '4.5l m117 v8', but its model is actually '300sel 4.5'. The only other row with a model of '300sel' and engine of '4.5l m117 v8' would be another row with the same information, which does not exist in the table.\n\n3. Determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE:\n   Since there is only one row with the model '300sel 4.5' and engine '4.5l m117 v8', it means that '300sel 4.5' indeed has a unique engine of '4.5l m117 v8'.
