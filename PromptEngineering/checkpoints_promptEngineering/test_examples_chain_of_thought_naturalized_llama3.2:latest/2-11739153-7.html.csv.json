Next, we need to find the score on february 24 from the table:\n   - The relevant row for february 24 is Row 11 with column 'score' value 2 and 'column_name' value 2.\n   - Therefore, the value of 'score' on february 24 is: 2\n\n3.

    "resp": "Here are the step-by-step reasoning steps:\n\n1. First, I need to identify the columns that contain relevant information for the claim: 'decision' column contains the names of the goalies ('harding' or 'backstrom'), and the 'date' column is irrelevant to the claim.\n\n2. Next, I will calculate the total number of games played by each goalie during the 2007 - 08 season:\n   - For Harding: row 5 (16477) + row 10 (17812) + row 11 (18568) + row 13 (17211) + row 14 (16927) = 74825\n   - For Backstrom: row 1 (18529) + row 2 (18568) + row 3 (18568) + row 4 (18568) + row 7 (18630) + row 8 (18568) + row 9 (18568) + row 12 (17391) + row 13 (17211) = 121321\n\n3. Now, I will compare the number of games played by each goalie during the 2007 - 08 season:\n   - Harding played more games than Backstrom.\n\n4. Based on this comparison, I can now determine whether the claim is true or false.\n   \n5. Since Harding indeed played more games than Backstrom, the final answer will be \"TRUE\".\n\nHere's a JSON object summarizing my reasoning:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"decision\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14, \"column_name\": \"decision\"}\n  ]\n}",
