    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim about the class p type 4 - 4 - 0 locomotive being withdrawn for the longest duration of time is true, we need to find out which row(s) it was withdrawn from.\n\n2. We then compare the withdrawal dates from all relevant rows of the \"p\" class to identify the longest duration.\n\n3. To do this comparison, let's first list down the relevant withdrawal date ranges for the class \"p\":\n   - Row 5: 1956 - 1960\n   - Row 10: 1958 - 1963\n   - Row 11: 1958 - 1963\n   - Row 13: 1964 - 1965\n\n4. From the above data, we can observe that row 5 has the earliest withdrawal start date and the longest duration of time (from year 1956 to year 1960).\n\n5. Now let's see if any other rows have a longer total duration:\n   - Row 13 has an earlier end date than row 5.\n\n6. Since we are comparing durations, we should calculate how many years each class was withdrawn for in order to make the final conclusion.\n   - Class p: From year 1956 to year 1960 is 4 years long.\n   - Class s: From year 1964 to year 1965 is only 1 year long.\n\n7. Comparing these, we can conclude that indeed class \"p\" was withdrawn for the longest duration of time.\n\n8. Let's list down all relevant data points again and specify their locations:\n   ```\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date withdrawn\", \"text\": \"1956 - 1960\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date withdrawn\", \"text\": \"1964 - 1965\"}\n  ]\n```\n\n9. Now we can formulate our response.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"To determine if the claim about the class p type 4 - 4 - 0 locomotive being withdrawn for the longest duration of time is true, we need to find out which row(s) it was withdrawn from.\",\n    \"We then compare the withdrawal dates from all relevant rows of the \\u201cp\\u2013 class to identify the longest duration.\",\n    \"To do this comparison, let's first list down the relevant withdrawal date ranges for the class \\u201cp:\\n   - Row 5: 1956 - 1960\\n   - Row 10: 1958 - 1963\\n   - Row 11: 1958 - 1963\\n   - Row 13: 1964 - 1965\",\n    \"From the above data, we can observe that row 5 has the earliest withdrawal start date and the longest duration of time (from year 1956 to year 1960).\",\n    \"Now let's see if any other rows have a longer total duration:\\n   - Row 13 has an earlier end date than row 5.\",\n    \"Since we are comparing durations, we should calculate how many years each class was withdrawn for in order to make the final conclusion.\\n   - Class p: From year 1956 to year 1960 is 4 years long.\\n   - Class s: From year 1964 to year 1965 is only 1 year long.\",\n    \"Comparing these, we can conclude that indeed class \\u201cp was withdrawn for the longest duration of time.\",\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date withdrawn\", \"text\": \"1956 - 1960\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date withdrawn\", \"text\": \"1964 - 1965\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"date withdrawn\", \"text\": \"1956 - 1960\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"date withdrawn\", \"text\": \"1964 - 1965\"}\n  ]\n}",
