Next, let's look for Lauryn Williams' participation in the table:\n   - We can see Lauryn Williams is mentioned in rows 4 and 6 of the table.\n   \n3. Now, we need to determine if Lauryn Williams participated in the World Athletics Final at two different times:\n   - For this, we'll compare the times she ran in the World Athletics Final (row 4) and World Athletics Final (row 6).\n     - The time at row 4 is 11.21 secs.\n     - The time at row 6 is 11.04 secs.\n\n4. We can see that Lauryn Williams did participate in two World Athletics Finals but we need to check if the times are different or not.\n   - Since 11.21 secs and 11.04 secs are not exactly equal, these represent two distinct times for the same event (World Athletics Final).\n   \n5.
