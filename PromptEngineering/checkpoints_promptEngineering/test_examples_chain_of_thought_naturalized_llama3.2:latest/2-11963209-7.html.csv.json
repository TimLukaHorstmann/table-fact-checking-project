    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim about Mavericks being the visitor in over 7 games out of the list, we need to analyze each row of the table.\n\n2. We'll start from Row 1: Maverick is the visitor with a score of 67 - 90 against Pistons. Let's mark this one as visited.\n\n3. Moving on to Row 4: Mavericks are also visitors with a score of 81 - 92 against Grizzlies, and they won. This will be marked as well.\n\n4. Next, we check Row 5. Again, Mavericks are the visitor with a loss of 82 - 101 against Nets. Marked as visited.\n\n5. Then, we proceed to Row 6: Another visit from Mavericks but this time, they lost against Sixers. Marked.\n\n6. We continue in Row 7, where Mavericks win as visitors against Trail Blazers. This is also marked.\n\n7. In Row 10: Maverick wins again as a visitor, beating Grizzlies with 98 - 83. This visit will be noted.\n\n8. As for the next game (Row 11), Mavericks beat Timberwolves while visiting and winning, adding another mark to our list.\n\n9. Now we analyze further visits by Mavericks in Row 12: losing at home as the host but marking another one of their visits against Bulls.\n\n10. Next up is Row 14: Mavericks win again when hosting Kings with a final score. Another visit from Mavericks noted here.\n\n11. We review each game to confirm if there are more than 7 games where Mavericks were visitors and also found that they visited in Rows 9, 13, and all others that were directly identified as such.\n\n12. At this point, it's apparent we only have a list of their visits but need confirmation if indeed \"over seven\" of these games.\n\n#### Finalizing Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis provided above, let us confirm our final findings through relevant rows in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 1,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 14,\"column_name\": \"visitor\"}\n  ]\n}",

Next, determine which of these dates are after February 21, 2008:\n   - February has 29 days in a leap year and 28 days in non-leap years; since the given dates are prior to March 1st ,  we will assume it's not a leap year.\n   - Since february 29th does not occur, any date after february 28 would be before march 1st. Therefore, february 28 is our cut off\n   - So only row 14 has a date later than this\n\n3. Now let's find the row index of row 14:\n   Row 14: date = 29 february 2008, row_index = 14\n\n4.

Thus verifying that Josh was indeed the scorer.\n\n### Step 5: Find out how many more games are needed for our claim to be verified.\nSince we found at least one instance where he is a leader and two were claimed, finding any other would make it True; otherwise, False\n\n### Step 6: Check if there's another game with Josh Howard as leading scorer \nLooking further down the table we find Row 11 does indeed list Josh Howard (29) as a leader.
