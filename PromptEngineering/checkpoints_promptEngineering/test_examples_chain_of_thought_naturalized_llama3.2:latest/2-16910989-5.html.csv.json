    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Check the claim: The claim states that Kristofer Martin was nominated for 3 awards in 2012 and won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\n2. Identify relevant information:\n\t* To check if Kristofer Martin was nominated for an award, we need to look at Row 4 of the table (2012) and Row 5 (2012) because they mention nominations. We also need to verify that he was indeed nominated for exactly three awards as claimed.\n\t* For the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award, since it is mentioned in different rows, we will check each year individually.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Detailed Checks:\n\na. **Nominations in 2012**: \n    - Check Row 4: The Young Critics Circle Awards (Category: Best Performance, Nominated for: Oros)\n    - Check Row 5: PMPc Star Awards For Movies (Category: New Movie Actor of the Year, Nominated for: Tween Academy : Class of 2012)\n\nb. **Winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012**:\n   - Since this award is not categorized by a specific role (Stand Out Season Performer, Best Performance), it's necessary to check each year individually.\n   - In Row 6 and Row 7, there are mentions of winning this award for different years. However, the table indicates 2012, so we verify if Kristofer Martin won it in 2012.\n\n3. **Winning the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012**: Given that the awards in Row 6 and Row 7 were actually for a different year (not explicitly mentioned), and given that only one award is relevant to our search, we need to look at the other row:\n    - Verify if Kristofer Martin indeed won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award specifically.\n\n4. **Counting nominations**:\n   Since there are two categories of awards he was nominated for in 2012 (Row 4 and Row 5), we must confirm that this aligns with the claim that he was nominated for exactly three awards.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Conclusion:\n\nGiven the information above, Kristofer Martin was indeed nominated for more than one award as stated in the claim. Specifically:\n- He was nominated for Best Performance at The Young Critics Circle Awards.\n- He was nominated for New Movie Actor of the Year at PMPc Star Awards For Movies.\n\nTo verify if he won exactly three awards as claimed and to confirm the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award win, we found out that the award was indeed won but not explicitly mentioned in how many different awards. Therefore:\n- Kristofer Martin was nominated for more than one award.\n- He did win the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award.\n\nThe claim can be considered partially true since it mentions winning an award but does not accurately state he was only nominated for three, nor the exact nature of his nominations.\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if Kristofer Martin was nominated for more than one award.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"From the given data, Row 4 and Row 5 of the table indicate nominations.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify that he won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award in 2012.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"Row 6 and Row 7 mention wins for this award but do not specify the year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Count the total number of awards nominated by Kristofer Martin.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"He is nominated twice, according to rows provided.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Compare the nominations with the claim.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"This shows that he was indeed nominated for more than one award but does not exactly match the 'exactly three' part of the claim.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"Nominated for\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Nominated for\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine if the claim about Kristofer Martin is true:\n\n1. Look up the total number of nominations between 2012 and 2013 for Kristofer Martin by checking the relevant cells.\n   - The table shows that Kristofer Martin was nominated for: \n     * oros ( Row 4 ) in 2012\n     * orphan ( Row 2 ) in 2013\n     * orphan ( Row 5 ) in 2012\n     * orphan ( Row 6 ) in 2012\n     * orphan ( Row 7 ) in 2012\n   Total nominations = 4\n\n2. Check how many of these awards Kristofer Martin won between 2012 and 2013.\n   - The table shows that Kristofer Martin won:\n     * honorable mention for best supporting actor at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo ( Row 2 )\n     * German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at the Famas Awards ( Row 6 )\n     * Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching at the 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards ( Row 7 )\n   Total wins = 3\n\n3. Since Kristofer Martin has 4 nominations but only won 3, we must look for other awards to see if he was also nominated in the year 2013 as mentioned in claim.\n   - The table shows that Kristofer Martin was nominated for orphan ( Row 2 ) in 2013\n   Total nominations = 5\n\n4. Now check again how many of these awards Kristofer Martin won between 2012 and 2013.\n   - The table still shows that Kristofer Martin won:\n     * honorable mention for best supporting actor at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo ( Row 2 )\n     * German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at the Famas Awards ( Row 6 )\n     * Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching at the 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards ( Row 7 )\n\n5.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, I will parse the table to extract relevant information about Kristofer Martin's awards in 2013.\n2. From Row 6 of the table, I find that Kristofer Martin won the German Moreno Youth Achievement Award at the Famas Awards in 2012, but this is not directly related to the claim. So, I will ignore it for now and focus on the relevant rows.\n3. Next, from Row 1 of the table, I see that Kristofer Martin was nominated for the \"Stand Out Season Performer\" award at the 1st Sunday All Stars Awards in 2013, but this is not related to the claim.\n4. Moving on to Row 2 of the table, I find that Kristofer Martin won the \"Honorable Mention for Best Supporting Actor\" award at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo in 2013.\n5. Now, from Row 7 of the table, I see that Kristofer Martin won the \"Most Liked Loveteam with Joyce Ching\" award at the 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards in 2012, which is also not related to the claim.\n6. From Row 3 of the table, I find that Kristofer Martin won the \"Best Actor in a Supporting Role\" award for Oros at the 10th Golden Screen Awards in 2013.\n7. Now, let's re-examine Row 2 and Row 3 of the table. It seems that there is some inconsistency between the two awards. According to Row 2, Kristofer Martin won an \"Honorable Mention\" award for Best Supporting Actor, but according to Row 3, he won a full \"Best Actor in a Supporting Role\" award.\n8. Based on this inconsistency, I will need to verify whether Kristofer Martin indeed received two \"Honorable Mention for Best Support Actor\" awards at the 16th Long Island International Film Expo in 2013.\n\n#### Verifying the Inconsistency:\n\nAfter re-examining Row 2 of the table, I see that it states: \"year: 2013, award giving body: 16th long island international film expo, category: honorable mention for best supporting actor, nominated for: oros, result: won.\"\n\nThis means that Kristofer Martin won one \"Honorable Mention\" award, not two.

List all award-winning years for Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013: According to rows 4, 6, and 7 of the table, these awards were won in 2012 and 2013.\n2. Identify which award-giving bodies are responsible for awarding these wins: Rows 6 and 7 indicate that Famas Awards and 1st Party Pilipinas Most Liked Awards, respectively, awarded Kristofer Martin between 2012 and 2013.\n3. Check if any of these awards were based on a nomination for a specific show: According to row 4, the Young Critics Circle Award was not based on a nomination for a specific show (the category is \"best performance\").

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Review the claim: The claim states that all of Kristofer Martin's award nominations were for his performance in Oros.\n\n2. Analyze Row 1: In the first row, it's mentioned that Kristofer Martin was nominated for \"none\" (i.e., no specific performance), but this is not directly related to the claim as the award giving body and category are relevant here though.\n\n3. Check Rows 4-7: For the years 2012, we see that he received nominations in different categories - including Best Performance, New Movie Actor of the Year (not specifically about Oros) and German Moreno Youth Achievement Award - where it is stated 'n/a' as the nominee for the latter award, but Kristofer Martin was still nominated.\n\n4. Review Row 5: In this row, he received a nomination in the category \"new movie actor of the year\", which again doesn't specify Oros.\n\n5. Check Rows 2 and 3: Here we see that Kristofer Martin won for his performance as an actor in both 'The 16th Long Island International Film Expo' and 'The 10th Golden Screen Awards', which is not directly related to the claim but highlights multiple awards he won.\n\n6. Review Row 6 and 7: For these years, it's noted that Kristofer Martin received a German Moreno Youth Achievement Award and 'most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching' award, again not detailing anything about Oros in either of those categories.\n\n7. Compare claim to data: Now that all nominations from the relevant cells are viewed, there is no evidence within the given table which directly supports or refutes the claim completely because some details and exact performance for Kristofer Martin was indeed only related to 'Oros' but also other awards as well.\n\n8. Finalize answer: Given this information about both award nominations (some of them not being specifically related to Oros) combined with multiple wins, the statement is actually FALSE.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"Best performance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"New Movie Actor of the Year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"German Moreno Youth Achievement Award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"Best performance\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"New Movie Actor of the Year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"German Moreno Youth Achievement Award\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"Most liked loveteam with Joyce Ching\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
