    "resp": "### Step 1: Understanding the Claim\nThe claim is about Ayrton Senna starting 13 grand prix races in pole position. We need to verify if this claim is true based on the information provided in the table.\n\n### Step 2: Reviewing Table Content\nWe will go through each row of the table and extract relevant data, focusing on the column for \"pole position\" since it directly relates to whether a driver started in pole position or not.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Pole Position Data\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 2: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 3: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 4: Alain Prost starts in pole position, not Ayrton Senna.\n- Row 5: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 6: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 7: Alain Prost starts in pole position, not Ayrton Senna.\n- Row 8: Gerhard Berger starts in pole position, not Ayrton Senna.\n- Row 9: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 10: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 11: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 12: Ayrton Senna does not start in pole position (Michele Alboreto does, and the winner is Gerhard Berger).\n- Row 13: Alain Prost starts in pole position, not Ayrton Senna.\n- Row 14: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 15: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n- Row 16: Ayrton Senna starts in pole position.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nFrom the table analysis, it's clear that Ayrton Senna indeed started a significant number of races in pole position. However, we need to calculate the exact number and verify if he met the claim of starting \"13 grand prix races in pole position\".\n\n### Step 5: Counting Pole Positions for Ayrton Senna\nCounting from Row 1 to Row 16:\n\n- Rows 1 through 10 have Ayrton Senna starting in pole position, totaling 10.\n- Rows 14 through 16 add more starts, bringing the total to at least 13.\n\n### Step 6: Determination of Answer\nBased on our count and analysis, we conclude that Ayrton Senna did indeed start \"at least\" 13 grand prix races in pole position. This means the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Final JSON Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Started with Row 1 to ensure correct data for Ayrton Senna's pole starts, checked each row against the relevant data, counted total number of pole positions from Row 1 through Row 16.

We can do this by looking at the 'winning driver' column for each row where Gerhard Berger's name is listed as the winning driver (see rows 8, 12).\n3. Count the number of such instances to get the total number of Grand Prix won by Gerhard Berger.\n4. Next, we need to determine the number of Grand Prix won by Alain Prost.\n5. We can do this by looking at the 'winning driver' column for each row where Alain Prost's name is listed as the winning driver (see rows 4, 14).\n6. Count the number of such instances to get the total number of Grand Prix won by Alain Prost.\n7.
