This will help us determine if Wozniak has won every time she competed in Canada.\n\n- Row 1: lachine, canada (hard), winner\n- Row 2: hamilton, canada (clay), winner\n- Row 6: toronto, canada (hard (i)), winner\n- Row 7: hamilton, canada (clay), winner\n\n#### Step 3: Count the total number of wins in Canada\nWe found 4 rows where Wozniak won in Canada. Since we need to check if she has competed 5 times and won every time, this information alone is insufficient.\n\n#### Step 4: Check each relevant row for Canada\nTo complete our analysis, we also need to count the total number of times Wozniak competed in Canada.\n\n- Row 1: lachine, canada (hard)\n- Row 2: hamilton, canada (clay)\n- Row 6: toronto, canada (hard (i))\n- Row 7: hamilton, canada (clay)\n\n#### Step 5: Count the total number of times Wozniak competed in Canada\nWe found 4 rows where Wozniak competed in Canada.

Determine the relevance of each found piece of information to our claim about Wozniak competing only in the Bahamas twice but losing:\n   - If we find a match where Wozniak is a winner outside of the Bahamas, it contradicts our statement.\n   - Any losses outside of the Bahamas contradict our claim that Wozniak loses only when competing in the Bahamas.\n6.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim\nThe claim states that Wozniak has lost 9 times between the year 2002 and 2012.\n\n#### Step 2: List all losses of Wozniak\nWe need to find out how many times Wozniak lost between 2002 and 2012. Let's analyze each row in the table:\n\n- Row 3: outcome is \"runner-up\", so Wozniak loses.\n- Row 5: outcome is \"runner-up\" and score ends with \"ret.\" (retired), which implies a loss, but it does not specify whether she wins or loses. \nWe can't be sure of this loss yet.\n\n- Row 10: outcome is \"runner-up\", so Wozniak loses.\n- Since we found 3 losses, let's continue to find more:\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze further rows for additional losses\n- Row 11: outcome is \"winner\", so no loss here.\n- Row 12: outcome is \"winner\" as well, which means there are no other losses.\n\n- For the ambiguity in Row 5, if Wozniak lost, we should have at least one more loss besides row 3 and row 10. Therefore, let's re-analyze row 5 for a potential loss of Wozniak.\n\n\n#### Step 4: Re-examine row 5\nRow 5 has score \"4 - 6 , 0 - 4 ret\". This indicates that the opponent won.\n\n- For Row 5 to be considered as a loss, we need another row where Wozniak lost. Since Row 3 and Row 10 have been identified as losses, let's continue searching for more.\n\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze remaining rows\n- Row 7: outcome is \"winner\", which means no loss.\n- Row 8: outcome is \"winner\" too.\n\nSince we have a total of three confirmed losses (Row 3, Row 10, and row 5), let's verify the existence of more losses by checking if Wozniak lost any other times in between those dates. This can be done by analyzing remaining rows which are from year 2006 onwards.\n\n\n#### Step 6: Verify potential additional loss for Wozniak\n- Row 4: outcome is \"winner\", so no loss.\n- Row 9: outcome is \"winner\" due to a retirement and has won before, but it's not specified if there was another opponent lost. The only score mentioned is the first set won with an unmentioned score.\n\n\n\nSince we are trying to find out how many times Wozniak lost between the years of 2002 and 2012, let's analyze more information from Row 9.\n\n- Row 9: outcome is \"winner\" because the opponent retired. However, there was no loss mentioned in this row.\n\n\n#### Step 7: Conclude based on the available data\nSince we have identified at least 3 confirmed losses (Row 3, Row 10, and Row 5) and verified that Row 9 did not provide any additional loss, we can conclude our analysis.\n\n\n\nThe final answer is:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"analysis\": \"Identify the claim: Wozniak has lost 9 times between the year 2002 and 2012\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"analysis\": \"List all losses of Wozniak.
