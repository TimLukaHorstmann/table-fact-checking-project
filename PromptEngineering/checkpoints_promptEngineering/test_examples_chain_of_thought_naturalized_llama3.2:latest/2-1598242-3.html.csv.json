To determine which tournaments are associated with Mark McCumber, we will look at his corresponding data:\nRow 1: tournament - masters tournament\nRow 2: tournament - us open\nRow 3: tournament - the open championship\nRow 4: tournament - pga championship\nRow 5: tournament - totals\n\nHowever, there is no data for \"mark mccumber\" in these rows. We will assume that we need to find the row with the most cuts made where a top -25 ranking and an events count greater than 7 are present.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine relevant columns\nSince we know that the row we're looking for must have a 'cuts made' value higher than the other rows, our goal is to find the first cell in Row 1,2, or 3 where cuts made > the open championship.\n\nWe look at top - 25 column for each of those tournaments. For The Open Championship, it has \"top- 25\" ranking equal to 2 and an events count of 7.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze and conclude\nSince we found that the relevant cell corresponds to the open championship (Row 3) with cuts made = 5 and there are no other rows having a cut made greater than this, our goal is to determine if it's indeed higher than \"the open championship\" column in row 1 or 2.\n\n\n\nRow 1: cuts made = 10\nRow 2: cuts made = 9\n\nBased on the information we have, we can conclude that Row 3 has the most cut made with the open championship.\n\n#### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Identify the row in question\",\n      \"relevant_data\": {\n        \"tournament\": \"the open championship\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find the relevant cells for the column 'cuts made'\",\n      \"relevant_data\": {\n        \"top - 25\": 2\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine relevant columns\",\n      \"relevant_data\": {\n        \"events\": 7\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Analyze and conclude\",\n      \"relevant_data\": {\n        \"cuts made\": 5\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"cuts made\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
