Identify the cell containing the claim: The claim states \"data digester be 1 of 4 software program with various cost\". This implies that we need to find a row in the table where the column name is \"software\" and the value matches this description.\n2. Look up the row index corresponding to the claimed software program: In order to make a valid comparison, we must know which cell contains the data digester, so let's first look up the row that contains it:\n- We see from our table of contents that `35` is the row number for `software`, and in this row the column name \"cost\" has value `$free`. Therefore, the cell containing 'data digester' is actually located at cell (`35`, \"cost\").\n3. Look up the row index corresponding to software with cost \"$free\": Let's look up the values of the cell at each row for column \"cost\", as we need to see if it matches '$free'.\n- For example, let's look at `32` and find that the value in this row is also `$free`. We also notice that this value corresponds to software with the name \"md5summer\".\n4. Count how many software programs match the claim: Since we know now that two software programs have cost \"$free\" (\"data digester\" and \"md5summer\"), let's check if there are three such values.\n- Looking up rows `25` and `30`, we find that both jdigest and md5deep (and hashdeep) also match the criteria of having a cost of '$free'.\n- So now, we have three software programs with variable cost.
