Let's start by finding the relevant cells for Australian players: t1, t5, t9, and t10.\n   - For each of these rows, we will check if the value in column \"country\" is indeed \"Australia\".\n   - If all four players have their country as Australia, then we can say that there are at least 3 Australian players on the leaderboard. We still need to verify this conclusion.\n3. Next, let's look for any other rows with a place of t6 or higher and examine if they also share a country other than \"Australia\".\n   - The row in t4 has a place of t3 but was still counted among t6 players as well.\n   - t7, t8, t11, and t12 are all part of the same leaderboard with a total of 6 places shared.\n   - All of these places have Australia listed in their respective country columns.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nSince we found 4 Australian players but there was one other place that had two additional Australians along with t3, it can be said there were at least 4 Aussies among the leaderboard. However, based on the claim \"there be total of 3 player from australia on the leaderboard\", we need to consider if this could possibly still be true.\n\n4. Looking closer at row 4 again, let's verify that t10 is indeed an Australian:\n   - country: united states\n   - This means there are actually only 3 players from Australia on the leaderboard.\n5.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the column for \"to par\":** The claim mentions a tie at 1 under par, so we need to examine the \"to par\" column.\n\n2. **Locate rows with \"to par: e\" or \"to par: +1\":** According to the claim, there are two players tied at 1 under par. Looking at the table, we can see that rows t3, t6 have scores and corresponding \"to par\" values that indicate a tie.\n\n    Relevant cells:\n    - Row Index: 3\n    - Column Name: to par\n    - Value: e\n\n    - Row Index: 6\n    - Column Name: to par\n    - Value: +1\n\n3. **Examine the \"to par\" values for each row:** By comparing these rows, we can see that t3 and all of t6 share the same score but different country information (Zimbabwe vs West Germany, England, Australia, Spain, etc.) indicating they're not tied on a per-country basis.\n\n    However, the problem statement's phrasing suggests it wants us to look for ties in overall par value (e.g., \"1 under par\"), so we'll continue examining rows t3 and those of t6.\n\n4. **Look for other relevant information:** The problem does ask about players tied at 1 under par overall, but no additional player's score should be lower than that if the result is only to check the specific number stated in the question (i.e., \"2\" player). It is implied we look solely at t3 and all of t6.\n\n    Relevant cells:\n    - Row Index: 3\n    - Column Name: place\n    - Value: t3\n\n    - Rows Index: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12\n    - Column Name: place\n    - Values: t6 (multiple instances)\n\n5. **Verify if there are two players tied at the same score:** Now we need to find out if exactly two of these rows had a \"place\" that is unique or only one.\n\n    Rows 3 and all of rows 6,7,8,9,10,11,12 have place values from t3 and t6 respectively. Upon inspection: Row 3 has \"t3\", so does each of the six other row's \"place\" value beginning with \"t6\".

Thus, Ian Woosnam does not qualify as an Australian player.\n\n5. **Check Peter Senior's country**: Looking at Row 11: The value in the \"country\" column is indeed \"australia\".\n\n6. **Check David Graham's country**: Referring to Row 1: The value in the \"country\" column is \"australia\".\n\n7. **Count Australian players on the leaderboard**:\n   - We have Wayne Riley (Row 9) and Peter Senior (Row 11) as Australian players.\n   - However, we also need to verify if there are exactly four such players.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since two out of the mentioned four players are indeed from Australia but we only found two names that match \"australia\" as their country, we must now check for any other Australians who might be on the leaderboard by another name or row number.\n\n9. **Additional Check for More Australian Players**:\n   - Looking at Row 1 again: David Graham's score is 139 with \"australia\" in his country column.\n   - Checking Row 4: Christy O'Connors Jnr from Ireland should not be included as we're interested only in Australians.\n   - Therefore, there are indeed two Australian players mentioned by name in the relevant rows (David Graham and Peter Senior), but to fulfill the condition of \"four\" Australian players as per the claim, it seems we have missed other Australians in different rows or names.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's examine the table to identify players from the United States.\n   We need to look at columns for \"country\", as the country of origin may indicate if a player is from the US.\n\n2. Now we will check each row to see if it includes the information needed to verify our claim:\n   - Row 1: This row does not contain any relevant data for US players.\n   - Row 2: This row does not contain any relevant data for US players.\n   - Row 3: The player \"tony johnstone\" is from Zimbabwe, so this row is irrelevant for checking US players.\n   - Row 4: This row contains information about a US player (\"d a weibring\").\n   - We have found our first US player. We need to continue the search.\n\n3. Now that we know there's at least one US player in the table, let's find the next relevant data:\n   - Row 5: Contains another relevant piece of information about a \"d a weibring\" being from the United States.\n   - Row 6 and onwards contains irrelevant pieces for our purposes since their information indicates that the country isn't the USA.\n\n4. Now that we have two relevant players (\"d a weibring\" and \"david graham\"), let's confirm if there are indeed three US players:\n   Since only one row, out of ten rows, had data relevant to the claim about the United States, it cannot be confirmed yet. We need at least 3 more.\n\n5. Now that we know there was a second player (\"sand y lyle\") from the USA who also appeared in Row 2, let's confirm if the third US player exists:\n   The presence of \"d a weibring\" (Row 4) and \"sandy lyle\" (Row 2), both being from the United States, verifies our claim.\n\n6. Conclusion: Since we have found two players from the USA in row 4 (\"d a weibring\") and row 2 (\"sand y lyle\"), they confirm that indeed there are at least 3 US players on the leaderboard (as Row 10 contains \"emilio rodr\u00edguez\" also being a player from the United States).\n\n7. Final verification: \n   We have identified three relevant rows in the table:\n   - row_index = 4, column_name = country\n     Value: 'United States'\n   - row_index = 2, column_name = country\n     Value: 'Scotland' ( Irrelevant for our purposes)\n   - row_index = 10, column_name = country\n     Value: 'Spain' (Irrelevant for our purposes)\n\n#### Final Answer in JSON Format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"the relevant columns are country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"looking at each row to see if any contain a player from the United States \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"Row 4 contains information about d a weibring, a US player.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"Row 5 also contains relevant information about another US player, d a weibring.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"Two of the players from the USA are in Row 2 and Row 4\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"We have to keep searching for one more player, to make sure that indeed there be at least three US players on leaderboard\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_text\": \"Row 10 also contains information about a third player from the United States, emilio rodr\u00edguez.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"country\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze the table to find any rows where a player is tied for the lead.\n\n2. Looking at row 3 of the table: tony johnstone with a score of 140 and to par e (even).\n\n3. In row 4 of the table: christy o'connor jnr with a score of 140 and to par e (even), so these two players are tied for the lead.\n\n4. Next, looking at rows 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the table: each row has a player with a score of 141 and to par +1 (one over par), but none of these players are tied with any other player.\n\n5. Now let's check if there is another score that equals or goes 2 under par for any other player:\n\n6. Rows 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9 have a score of 139 (to be one over). \n    - Score: 139 can go down by 2 to 137 which cannot be \"2 under par\".\n    - The scores of players on rows 1-6 will never meet the \"2 under\" requirement since it is an impossible task, especially when comparing with the other score of 141.\n\n7. Based on our findings from steps 3 and 4, we know that there are two players tied for first place, christy o'connor jnr and tony johnstone with a score that is one under par (e).\n\n8. Since we also verified in step 6 that the other rows do not have players tied at or below 2 under par, we can confirm that our initial conclusion was correct.\n\n9.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the row number for 2nd place\nTo verify if the claim about the 3-player tie at 2nd place being even to par, we first need to determine the row number that corresponds to the 2nd place position. Since Row 1 is already tied for 1st place with another player, we can move on to the next lowest place value, which is \"t3\".\n\n#### Step 2: Find the scores and par values of the players in the t3 tie\nWe need to examine the scores and par values of the players who are tied at \"t3\". This includes Tony Johnstone, Christy O'Connors Jr., and D A Weibring. Their scores and corresponding par values are as follows:\n- Tony Johnstone: 68 + 72 = 140, to par: e\n- Christy O'Connors Jr.: 64 + 76 = 140, to par: e\n- D A Weibring: 69 + 71 = 140, to par: e\n\n#### Step 3: Determine if the scores and par values are even\nSince all three players have the same score of 140 and both have a corresponding par value of \"e\" (even), we can conclude that their scores and par values are indeed even.\n\n#### Step 4: Evaluate the claim about the 2nd place tie being even to par\nGiven that the scores and par values for all three players in the \"t3\" position are equal, we can confidently state that the claim about the 3-player tie at 2nd place being even to par is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 5: List relevant cells as objects with row_index and column_name\nHere are the relevant cells:\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]\n\n[\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]\n\n\n#### Final JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Identified the row number for 2nd place as 't3'\",\n    \"Found the scores and par values of the players in the t3 tie\",\n    \"Determined if the scores and par values were even\",\n    \"Evaluated the claim about the 2nd place tie being even to par\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n  ],\n  [\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"score\"],\n  [\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"to par\"]\n],\n[\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"score\"],\n[\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"to par\"]\n],\n[\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n[\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n],\n[\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n[\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n],\n[\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"score\"},\n[\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"to par\"}\n]",
