    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. First, we need to check if Liselotte Neumann had any wins that were the result of a playoff.\n2. We will examine each row in the table to find any instances where \"margin of victory\" is equal to 0 or \"runner (s) - up\" indicates a tie for first place, which would likely require a playoff to break the tie.\n3. If we find at least two wins that meet this condition, we can conclude that the claim is TRUE.\n\n### Relevant Cells\n\nTo determine the relevant cells, we will focus on rows where the margin of victory is 0 or there's an indication of a tie for first place:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"margin_of_victory\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"margin_of_victory\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Chain of Thought\n\n- **Step 1**: Check if any row has a margin of victory equal to 0.\n- **Step 2**: For the row with margin of victory = 0 (if found), verify that it is indeed due to a playoff by examining other columns, particularly \"runner (s) - up\".\n- **Step 3**: If more than one such instance is found in different rows (June 1996 and March 1998 specifically mentioned in the claim), we can confirm the claim as TRUE.\n- **Step 4**: Review all relevant details again to ensure no similar scenario was overlooked.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter examining the table, we find that for the row with date: \"14 jan 1996\" and winning score: \"- 13 (67 + 66 + 72 + 70 = 275)\", Liselotte Neumann won by 11 strokes, not a playoff, so it does not match our criteria.\n\nHowever, for the row with date: \"26 apr 1998\", the winning score is: \"- 14 (67 + 65 + 70 = 202)\" and the margin of victory is 2 strokes. The \"runner (s) - up\" indicates a tie among Lori Kane, Dottie Pepper, so this indeed was a playoff.\n\nFinally, for row with date: \"22 mar 1998\", Liselotte Neumann won by a playoff as indicated by \"margin_of_victory\" being equal to \"playoff\".\n\nTherefore, the claim is TRUE because we found at least two instances in different rows where the margin of victory was indeed due to a playoff.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"After examining the table, we find that for row with date: 26 apr 1998 and row with date: 22 mar 1998, Liselotte Neumann won by playoff in different rows.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"column_name\": \"margin_of_victory\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"runner (s) - up\"}\n  ]\n}\n```",

We will list out all the relevant rows from the table where Liselotte Neumann is the winner:\n\t* Row 7: date = 17 mar 1996 (not in the range, but we'll keep it for context)\n\t* Row 10: date = 9 nov 1997\n\t* Row 12: date = 26 apr 1998\n\t* Row 13: date = 10 oct 2004\n3. Now, let's find Liselotte Neumann's final winning scores in the specified range:\n\t+ Row 10: winning score = -11 (68 + 70 + 67 = 205)\n\t+ Row 12: winning score = -14 (67 + 65 + 70 = 202)\n\t+ Row 13: winning score = -15 (68 + 68 + 69 + 68 = 273)\n4. We need to check if any of these scores are under 206:\n\t* -11 is under 206\n\t* -14 is under 206\n\t* -15 is not under 206 (it's equal to, but we'll consider it FALSE in this case)\n5. Since there are 3 winning scores that are under 206 (out of the specified range), we need to verify if all of them are within the correct format (i.e., \"-xx\" where xx are digits).\n\n6.

For the 1994 tournament: Weetabix Women's British Open, the winner is Dottie Pepper and Annika S\u00f6renstam with a total score of 280, but there is no record of Lise Meissner winning this tournament (as she was not in the table).\n3. For the 1996 tournament: Edina Realty LPGA Classic, we need to verify if Lise Meissner won with a margin of victory that would be significant enough to claim three wins.\n4. For the 1998 tournament: Chick-fil-A Charity Championship, we should confirm whether Lise Meissner won this event and check her scores against the other winners to see if it supports the claim.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Verification:\n1.2. Check for Lise Meissner in the specified tournaments.\n1.3. For 1994: The winner of Weetabix Women's British Open is Dottie Pepper with a total score of 280 and Annika S\u00f6renstam, so it was not won by Lise Meissner.\n\n2.6 Verify that Lise Meissner indeed won the 1996 Edina Realty LPGA Classic.\n1.3 Check scores for 1996 Edina Realty LPGA Classic\n2.7 Check if Lise Meissner won the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship in 1998 and verify her score against other competitors.\n1.4 Review scores for 1998 Chick-fil-A Charity Championship.\n\n#### Final Answer JSON\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check the winning tournament of Lise Meissner\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check the 1994 Weetabix Women's British Open tournament results for a Liselotte Neumann win\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": null,\n        \"column_name\": null\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Verify Lise Meissner won in 1996 Edina Realty LPGA Classic\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check scores for the 1994 Weetabix Women's British Open tournament\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": null,\n        \"column_name\": null\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Review the total score of 280 won by Dottie Pepper in the 1994 Weetabix Women's British Open tournament\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Check if Lise Meissner indeed won the 1996 Edina Realty LPGA Classic\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": []\n}",
