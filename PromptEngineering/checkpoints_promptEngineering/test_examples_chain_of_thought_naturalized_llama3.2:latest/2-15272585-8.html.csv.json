    "resp": "### Claim Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Identify relevant information\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to find Galina Voskoboeva's average score against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa.\n\n#### Step 2: Extract data from table\n- Row 1: Matea Mezak (not Galina Voskoboeva) - not relevant.\n- Row 2: Oleksandra Kravets vs. Galina Voskoboeva:\n\t+ Winner: Oleksandra Kravets\n\t+ Score: 6 - 4, 6 - 2\n- Row 5: Alice Canepa (not mentioned in the table as having lost to Galina Voskoboeva) - not relevant.\n- Since we are looking for losses against both players, there's no data available.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate claim based on data\nSince there is no loss score given for Galina Voskoboeva against Alice Canepa in the table, and only one game against Oleksandra Kravets where she lost with a total of 4 points, we can't accurately calculate an average. The claim seems to be false because it suggests a different scenario (average loss of only 4 points) than what is actually available.\n\n#### Step 4: Conclude\nGiven the information in the table, we cannot assess the claim about Galina Voskoboeva's performance against both Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa accurately because key data for these opponents are missing or not applicable to the situation described by the claim.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    \"Step 1: Identify relevant information\",\n    \"Step 2: Extract data from table, finding that there is no loss against Alice Canepa mentioned in the table.\",\n    \"Step 3: Evaluate claim based on data, conclusion is drawn due to lack of data for one opponent.\",\n    \"Step 4: Conclude, claim cannot be accurately evaluated with given information\"\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"Score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to extract the information about Galina Voskoboeva's performance on hard courts and clay courts from the table.\n\n2. From row 4 of the table, we can see that Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 2 games (6-7, 4-6) on a hard court in Pittsburgh.\n\n3. Now, to check if this matches the claim, let's look at the information about her performance on clay courts. From row 5 of the table, we can see that Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 2 games (6-1, 6-2) on a clay court in Cuneo.\n\n4. Since both statements from step 2 and step 3 do not match the claim \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court , and 1 on clay\", we must analyze other rows to see if any match these claims.\n\n5. From row 1 of the table, we can see that Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 4 games (6-4, 4-6, 4-6) on a hard court in Tipton.\n\n6. Since none of the individual game counts match either the claim about the total number of games on a hard court or the claim about the number of games on a clay court, we will now try to find any row which has at least one of these values.\n\n7. From row 1 and row 5, neither contain the correct values in order for us to say that they make up part of \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court , and 1 on clay\" or either \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court ,and 1 on clay\"\n\n8. From row 2 and row 3, neither contain the correct values in order for us to say that they make up part of \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court ,and 1 on clay\" or either \"galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court ,and 1 on clay\"\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"From row 4, we know that Galina Voskoboeva played 2 games on a hard court.
