    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the Claim\nThe claim states that \"the game at junction oval be 1 of 2 game that have a crowd of 12000\". This implies we need to check if there's another game with the same crowd at a different venue.\n\n#### Step 2: Locate Relevant Data in Table\nWe need to find the row(s) related to games at Junction Oval and verify if any other game has the same crowd size. Looking at the table, Row 6 is specifically about a game at Junction Oval.\n\n#### Step 3: Check for Another Game with Same Crowd Size\nIn Row 5 of the table, we see that another game also had a crowd of 12000. This means there's more than one instance where the crowd size matches the claim's condition.\n\n#### Step 4: Reasoning Conclusion\nSince we've identified at least two games (at Junction Oval and another unspecified venue) with the same crowd size of 12000, the claim is accurate in stating it as \"1 of 2\".\n\n#### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the Claim, located relevant data in table about Junction Oval game and found another game with same crowd size, concluded based on this evidence.\",\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"venue\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\"}\n  ]\n}",
