To determine if the claim \"Mark Farraway be pick 7 pick after Chad Folk\" is TRUE or FALSE, we need to understand what it means for a player to be picked before another player.\n2. According to the table, Mark Farraway was picked in Row 8 with Pick #8, and Chad Folk was picked in Row 1 with Pick #1.\n3.
