We start by identifying which places have shared scores in order to find out how many distinct scores are available.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relevant rows\nSince our goal is to see if there's exactly six players tied for first place, we need to look at all rows but focus on those that indicate a tie (ending with \"t\"). Specifically, we're interested in rows where the score equals or has an equal number of competitors who are also tied.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze row 1\nThe player \"lee janzen\" is in first place with a total score and to par difference of -7. This doesn't directly tell us how many players are tied, but it does establish the leader's information.\n\n### Step 4: Continue analyzing rows\nMoving through each relevant row (where applicable), we need to count how many times there's at least one person sharing the same score that corresponds with a \"t\". If such an instance occurs six times, then our answer would be affirmative.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion based on analysis\nWe examine all rows for ties and check if there are indeed six players tied in any position.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine if the claim \"Nick Price be rank higher than Payne Stewart\" is true, we first need to understand what ranking means in this context. The ranking appears to be determined by the score, with lower scores being better.\n\n2. Next, let's look at the relevant rows from the table:\n   - Row 1: player = nick price\n   - Row 2: player = payne stewart\n\n3. Now we need to compare their scores. The claim states that Nick Price should be ranked higher than Payne Stewart.\n\n4. Let's find out who has a lower score between them:\n   - Row 1 (Nick Price): score = 207\n   - Row 2 (Payne Stewart): score = 204\n\n5. Since 204 is less than 207, it means that Payne Stewart has a better score than Nick Price.\n\n6. Given that ranking is based on the score and Payne Stewart has a lower score than Nick Price, we can conclude that the statement in question is false because Nick Price cannot be ranked higher than Payne Stewart.\n\n7.
