To verify this, we need to check how many teams qualified for the tournament.\n\n2. We can find the number of teams that qualified by looking at the \"copa libertadores 1995\" column in each row and counting the number of cells with values other than \"did not qualify\".\n\n3. Looking at the table, the following rows have a value other than \"did not qualify\": Row 1 (no), Row 2 (no), Row 3 (yes), Row 4 (yes), Row 5 (no), Row 6 (no), Row 7 (yes), Row 8 (yes), Row 9 (yes), and Row 10 (yes). This means that 7 teams qualified for the tournament.\n\n4. Since there are 10 teams in total, if every team but 3 did not qualify, then we would expect 7 teams to have not qualified (i.e., 10 - 3 = 7).\n\n5. However, the truth value of the claim depends on whether this expectation is met. We need to compare the actual number of teams that qualified with the expected number.\n\n6.
