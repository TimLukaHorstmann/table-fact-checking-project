We need to verify if any of these three peaks are indeed located in Italy, given the initial claim.\n\n3. Reviewing each peak:\n   - Wildspitze is clearly not in Italy but in Austria.\n   - Gro\u00dfer Priel is also found in Austria and not in Italy.\n   - M\u00f6lltaler Polinik's location was mentioned as Austria (Cell 37).\n\n4. Given the information, none of the three peaks are located in Italy.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"birkkarspitze\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 40,\n      \"column_name\": \"grimming\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 37,\n      \"column_name\": \"grand t\u00eate de l'obiou\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 35,\n      \"column_name\": \"birkkarspitze\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 40,\n      \"column_name\": \"grimming\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 37,\n      \"column_name\": \"grand t\u00eate de l'obiou\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
