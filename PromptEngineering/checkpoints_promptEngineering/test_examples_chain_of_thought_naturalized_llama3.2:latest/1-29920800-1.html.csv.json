    "resp": "Here are the steps to determine whether the claim is true or false:\n\n1. Identify the relevant data: The table contains information about the US viewers (million) for each episode of a TV series called \"Hot in Cleveland\". We need to find the first episode and compare its viewership with the rest.\n\n2. Find the first episode: Since there are no rows explicitly labeled as \"series premiere\" or \"first episode\", we can assume that the first row represents the pilot episode, which is typically considered the first episode of a series. In this case, it's Row 1.\n\n3. Check if the first episode has the highest viewership: We need to compare the viewership of the first episode (Row 1) with the rest of the episodes. \n\n4. Compare viewership of all other rows:\n\n- For Row 2, the viewership is 3.37 million, which is higher than Row 1.\n\n- For Row 3, the viewership is 3.07 million, which is lower than Row 1.\n\n- For Row 4, the viewership is 2.93 million, which is also lower than Row 1.\n\n- For Row 5, the viewership is 2.99 million, which is equal to Row 1.\n\n- For Row 6, the viewership is 2.44 million, which is lower than Row 1 and 5.\n\n- For Row 7, the viewership is 2.97 million, which is also equal to Row 5.\n\n- For Row 8, the viewership is 2.57 million, which is lower than both Rows 1, 5, and 7.\n\n- For Row 9, the viewership is 2.72 million, which is higher than Row 8 but still lower than Rows 1 and 5.\n\n5. Conclusion: Since none of the rows have a viewership higher than Row 1 (4.75 million), we cannot conclude that the first episode has the highest viewership in the US.\n\nHere's the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"US Viewers (Million)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\"\n}",
