    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to identify all the entries where 'entrant' equals 'camel team lotus honda' for any year.\n   - Relevant cells: \n     * Row 1: row_index = 1, column_name = 'year'\n     * Row 1: row_index = 1, column_name = 'points'\n     * Row 2: row_index = 2, column_name = 'year'\n     * Row 2: row_index = 2, column_name = 'points'\n     * Row 3: row_index = 3, column_name = 'year'\n     * Row 6: row_index = 6, column_name = 'year'\n\n2. Next, we need to find the entry where 'year' equals 1987 for 'entrant' equals 'camel team lotus honda'.\n   - Relevant cell:\n     * Row 1: row_index = 1, column_name = 'year'\n     * Value of 'points' in this cell is 7.\n     \n3. Then we need to find the highest points that 'camel team lotus honda' has earned in any year for which 'entrant' equals 'camel team lotus honda'.\n   - Relevant cell:\n     * Row 1: row_index = 1, column_name = 'points'\n     * Value of 'points' in this cell is 7.\n   - Relevant cell:\n     * Row 2: row_index = 2, column_name = 'points'\n     * Value of 'points' in this cell is 1.\n\n4. Now that we have found that the points for 'camel team lotus honda' are 7 in the year 1987 and 1 in another year, we can conclude whether or not the claim is true.\n   - Since 7 is greater than 1, it seems that the claim might be true.\n\n5. Finally, to confirm our reasoning, let's look at one more relevant entry for 'entrant' equals 'camel team lotus honda' and any year (other than year 1987) \n   - Relevant cell:\n     * Row 6: row_index = 6, column_name = 'points'\n     * Value of 'points' in this cell is 2.\n\nSince 2 is not greater than the points obtained by 'camel team lotus honda' in the year 1987 (which was 7), we can confirm that our reasoning for step 4 is correct.\n\n\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Identify all entries where 'entrant' equals 'camel team lotus honda' for any year.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find the entry where 'year' equals 1987 for 'entrant' equals 'camel team lotus honda'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Determine if the points earned by camel team lotus honda in any year are the highest among all entrants.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Compare the points obtained by 'camel team lotus honda' with other relevant points to confirm reasoning for step 3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"year\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, the problem is asking for a comparison based on the number of times each engine was used with its respective points per engine. This suggests that we may need to look at the points distribution over time rather than across all years.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total points earned by Honda V6\n- In 1987, Lotus 99T scored 7 points.\n- In 1988, Lotus 100T scored 1 point. Assuming this is part of an aggregate that combines data from multiple sources or considering it as a separate unit for comparison:\n    - If we consider the 'point' column across different rows for Honda V6 engines used in the same year (or any relevant aggregation method), this single instance does not contribute significantly enough to be considered separately without knowing total points distribution. However, the problem statement doesn't provide such data.\n- In 1991, Tyrrell 020 scored 2 points.\n\nWithout clear totals or further context on how these points are aggregated across different seasons or races for each engine, direct comparison isn't feasible based solely on provided table values.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total points earned by Cosworth V8\n- In 1990, Tyrrell 018 and 019 both scored 3 points. This is a clear instance of aggregation since it's the same year and chassis for two entries with the same engine.\n\n### Step 5: Compare the aggregate points earned by Honda V6 and Cosworth V8\nSince we are to determine if the Honda V6 engine earns \"3 more points\" than the Cosworth V8 when compared in an aggregate that isn't explicitly defined, let's clarify:\n\n- The question seems to ask for a comparison at this point but doesn't specify how to combine these across different years and chassis types. Given data is sparse enough as it stands.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the lack of clear aggregation or total points distribution by engine type across all seasons or races mentioned in the table, we cannot accurately determine if Honda V6 earns \"3 more points\" than Cosworth V8 based solely on the provided information without making several assumptions that aren't supported directly by the data given.\n\nHowever, since there's a specific format to be followed and no clear basis for comparison can be made as per current data availability and problem statement clarity:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Given the sparse information and unclear aggregation method, direct comparison between Honda V6 and Cosworth V8 isn't feasible.

So, by default, it's safe to say camel team lotus honda earned the lowest amount of points in 1987 compared to any entrant and year.\n\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify if the claim should be checked for lowest points value in 1987\",\n      \"description\": \"Check if there are other rows with a specific year (1987) and entrant (camel team lotus honda)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify the point values for each entrant in 1987\",\n      \"description\": \"Extract the 'points' column from this row: `year: 1987, entrant: camel team lotus honda, chassis: lotus 99t, engine: honda v6, points: 7`\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if there are any lower point values for the same year and entrant\",\n      \"description\": \"Verify that the 'points' column has no lower value than what is shown here (7)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion - Camel team lotus honda earned lowest amount of points in 1987 out of any entrant and year.\",\n      \"description\": \"Based on the previous steps, camel team lotus honda earn lowest amount of point in 1987 out of any entrant and year.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": null,\n      \"column_name\": \"year,entrant,chassis(engine)\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
