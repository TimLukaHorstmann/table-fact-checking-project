This means we need to check if any player was selected as a pick during the 2nd round.\n\n#### Step 2: Check rows 1-12 for relevant information\nWe will review each row in the table and identify if any player's column values match the claim.\n\n#### Step 3: Locate rows with \"round\": 2\nLooking at the table, we see that the following players were selected during the 2nd round:\n- Ray Donaldson (row 3)\n- Tim Foley (row 4)\n- Chris Foote (row 6)\n- Wes Roberts (row 7)\n\n#### Step 4: Verify if these players were picked\nAccording to the table, all of these players were indeed selected as picks during their respective rounds.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine the truth value of the claim\nSince at least one player was selected as a pick during the 2nd round, the claim is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 6: Identify relevant cells\nWe can identify the following relevant cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"pick\"},\n  {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\"}\n]\n```\n\n#### Step 7: Compile the chain of thought and answer\nOur reasoning process has been explained.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the position of Wes Roberts\nTo verify the claim, we first need to determine if Wes Roberts was picked by the Indianapolis Colts before Ed Whitley was chosen. According to the table, Row 7 states \"round: 7, pick: 5, overall: 170, name: wes roberts, position: defensive end, college: tcu\". The relevant cell for this is:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 7,\n  \"column_name\": \"position\"\n}\n```\nThe value of this column in Row 7 is \"defensive end\".\n\n#### Step 2: Identify the team that selected Wes Roberts\nNext, we need to identify which team selected Wes Roberts. The table does not explicitly state the team, but we can infer it from the college information. According to the table, Row 7 states \"college: tcu\". TCU is a university located in Fort Worth, Texas. Since the Indianapolis Colts are based in Indianapolis, Indiana (which is relatively close to TCU), we can reasonably assume that Wes Roberts was selected by the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n#### Step 3: Identify Ed Whitley's position and team\nTo verify the claim, we also need to determine Ed Whitley's position and team. According to the table, Row 11 states \"round: 11, pick: 3, overall: 280, name: ed whitley, position: tight end, college: kansas state\". The relevant cell for this is:\n```json\n{\n  \"row_index\": 11,\n  \"column_name\": \"position\"\n}\n```\nThe value of this column in Row 11 is indeed \"tight end\".\n\n#### Step 4: Determine Ed Whitley's team\nTo verify the claim, we need to determine which team selected Ed Whitley. The table does not explicitly state the team, but we can infer it from the college information. According to the table, Row 11 states \"college: kansas state\". Kansas State is a university located in Manhattan, Kansas. Since the Indianapolis Colts are based in Indianapolis, Indiana (which is relatively far from Kansas), we cannot assume that Ed Whitley was selected by the Colts.\n\n#### Step 5: Compare Wes Roberts and Ed Whitley's picks\nNow that we know Wes Roberts was picked by the Indianapolis Colts and Ed Whitley was not (since his team is unknown), we can conclude that the claim \"wes robert be pick by the indianapolis colt before ed whitley be choose\" is TRUE.\n\n#### Step 6: Final Answer\nHere is our final answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"college\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

To verify this, we need to check if there are any players who have a position of \"running back\" and were picked after the 10th round.\n3.

I need to find out if there is a player who was picked in round 2, so I start by looking at the relevant columns in the table: 'round', 'pick', 'overall'.\n\n2. Since the claim says \"5 player be pick\", it must mean that exactly five players were picked in the second round of the draft.\n\n3. To verify this, I need to look for rows with a value in the 'round' column equal to 2 and count how many players meet this criteria.\n\n4. In row 3, 'round' is 2 and 'pick' is 4. Row 7 has a round of 7 but that's not what we're looking at here. Row 8 is also in the 8th round but again we need to look for the second round which is row 3, row 10, and row 11.\n\n5. Now that I have the relevant rows identified, I can list them out: [ { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\" } ]\n\n6. Since we have the relevant cells identified I can count them to see if there are exactly five players picked in the second round of the draft.\n\n7. There are indeed three rows with a 'round' value of 2 that contain values in the 'pick' column, so this is not what I need to do for my final answer.\n\n8. However I am now going to look at the total picks to verify that exactly five were picked in round two.\n\n9. Now I will list out all relevant rows: [ { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"pick\" }, { \"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"pick\"} ]\n\n10.
