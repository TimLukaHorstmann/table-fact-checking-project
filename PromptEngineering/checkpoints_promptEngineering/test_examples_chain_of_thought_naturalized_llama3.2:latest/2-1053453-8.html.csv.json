From the table, we can see that Nat Borchers indeed has 9 goals.\n\n3. Now, we need to compare the number of goals for both players.

    "resp": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. The claim states that Kyle Beckerman, Chris Wingert, and Javier Morales have the same year of 2007 - present.\n2. To verify this, we need to check the years listed for each player in the table.\n\n**Step 2: Check Kyle Beckerman's year**\nRow 3 has \"rank: 3\", \"player: kyle beckerman\", \"nation: usa\", \"caps: 177\", \"goals: 21\", and \"years: 2007 - present\". Since the years match \"2007 - present\", this player indeed belongs to this time period.\n\n**Step 3: Check Chris Wingert's year**\nRow 4 has \"rank: 4\", \"player: chris wingert\", \"nation: usa\", \"caps: 174\", \"goals: 1\", and \"years: 2007 - present\". Again, the years match \"2007 - present\".\n\n**Step 4: Check Javier Morales' year**\nRow 6 has \"rank: 6\", \"player: javier morales\", \"nation: arg\", \"caps: 155\", \"goals: 28\", and \"years: 2007 - present\". The years match as well.\n\n5. However, for the claim to be true, all three players must have the same year of \"2007 - present\".\n6. Upon reviewing Row 3 again, it states that Kyle Beckerman's years are from \"2007 - present\", which includes the current year.\n7. Unfortunately, this is not explicitly stated for Chris Wingert (Row 4) and Javier Morales' (Row 6).\n8. To verify if Javier Morales still belongs to the time period as of today, we can look up his actual retirement date in real-time or see a more recent source which would confirm that he indeed retired after the original cutoff date.\n\n9. We now have conflicting information about whether Chris Wingert and Javier Morales are still in their stated year range.\n10. Since only two players have verified \"2007 - present\" years, the claim cannot be entirely true.\n\n11. However, if we're considering only those who definitely still belong to the specified timeframe as of today (which is uncertain without real-time data or a more recent source for Javier Morales), it seems like the statement could potentially be considered false because of uncertainty surrounding Javier's current status.\n\n12.

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, I need to check the number of goals for player Ned Grabavoy from the USA.\n   - Look at row 8: rank: 8, player: ned grabavoy, nation: usa, caps: 126, goals: 8, years: 2009 - present.\n   - Since the number of goals is exactly 8, not less than 8, Ned Grabavoy does not meet the condition.\n\n2. Next, I need to check the number of goals for player Tony Beltran from the USA.\n   - Look at row 7: rank: 7, player: tony beltran, nation: usa, caps: 135, goals: 0, years: 2008 - present.\n   - The number of goals is 0, not 5, so Tony Beltran does not meet the condition.\n\n3. Since neither Ned Grabavoy nor Tony Beltran meets the condition (less than 8 goals for Grabavoy and exactly 5 goals for Beltran), we need to check if there are any other players that meet this criteria.\n   - Upon reviewing the table again, it seems like there is no player with less than 8 goals and 5 goals simultaneously.\n\n4. As neither condition is met by either player, the claim cannot be considered TRUE or FALSE based on the given information.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"goals\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"goals\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"goals\"}\n  ]\n}",

Check if any of these players have the same year range in the table:\n   - Kyle Beckerman's year range is 2007 - present.\n   - Chris Wingert's year range is 2007 - present.\n   - Javier Morales' year range is 2007 - present.\n3.
