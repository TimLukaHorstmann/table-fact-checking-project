The attendance figure column is what we will focus on to determine if the lowest attendance figure in a game is indeed 6500.\n\n### Step 2: Find all instances of the attendance value \"6500\" across the table to confirm that this value does not represent the smallest attendance figure found in a match.\n\nReviewing each row:\n- Row 11 has an attendance of 6500, which we'll verify against other values.\n- Other rows contain higher or lower attendance figures than 6500; we are looking for evidence it is indeed the lowest attendance value across all matches.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the attendance figure of \"6500\" with every other attendance value to establish if it holds the position of being the lowest attendance in any match.\n\nComparing with Row 11's specific entry:\n- The game attended by 6500 had a loss, but let's examine if this is indeed the lowest recorded.\n\nUpon comparing all other attendance values (17000, 20175, 66266, 15000, 25000, 27000, 16000, 38689, 18025, 18000), it appears that Row 11 has the smallest recorded attendance figure among these values.\n\n### Step 4: Summarize findings and provide an answer to the claim based on evidence from the table.\n\nGiven that no lower attendance value exists in the games listed than 6500 (which is present in Row 11), we can infer this value holds the position of being the lowest recorded attendance figure among all matches played, as per the data provided in the table.\n\n### Step 5: Organize findings into a JSON format for output as requested.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Reviewing table structure and identifying relevant column.\",\n      \"text\": \"Identified that the attendance figure column is what to focus on.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verifying if 6500 indeed represents the smallest attendance figure found across all matches.\",\n      \"text\": \"Found in Row 11 with a loss, we'll check against other values for confirmation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing 6500 with every other attendance value to confirm its position as the lowest recorded attendance.\",\n      \"text\": \"Other attendance figures (17000, 20175, 66266, 15000, 25000, 27000, 16000, 38689, 18025, 18000) all contain higher values.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on evidence from the table.\",\n      \"text\": \"Row 11's attendance figure of 6500 holds the position of being the lowest recorded among these matches.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Reviewing table structure and identifying relevant column.\",\n      \"text\": \"Identified that the attendance figure column is what to focus on.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verifying if 6500 indeed represents the smallest attendance figure found across all matches.\",\n      \"text\": \"Found in Row 11 with a loss, we'll check against other values for confirmation.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Comparing 6500 with every other attendance value to confirm its position as the lowest recorded attendance.\",\n      \"text\": \"Other attendance figures (17000, 20175, 66266, 15000, 25000, 27000, 16000, 38689, 18025, 18000) all contain higher values.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Conclusion based on evidence from the table.\",\n      \"text\": \"Row 11's attendance figure of 6500 holds the position of being the lowest recorded among these matches.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"attendance\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process:\n\n1. Identify the claim: The claim states that the Demon Deacon wins 2 games and loses 9.\n2. Look for relevant information in the table:\n   - To verify the number of wins, we need to find rows where the result is 'w' (win) and the opponent's name matches \"demon deacon\".\n   - Similarly, to verify the number of losses, we need to find rows where the result is 'l' (loss) and the opponent's name does not match \"demon deacon\".\n3. Filter table rows based on these conditions:\n   - For wins: Row 1 has a win against \"Davidson\" which matches partially with \"Demon Deacon\", but no exact match, so consider it.\n   - For losses: Rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 have losses against non-\"demon deacon\" opponents, while Row 10 has a loss but the opponent is also not \"demon deacon\".\n4. Count wins and losses:\n   - Wins: Only Row 1 gives an exact match for the win.\n   - Losses: Rows 2 through 9 give one loss each against non-\"Demon Deacon\" opponents. \n5. Compare with the claim:\n   - The table shows 1 win (Row 1) instead of 2 wins required by the claim. It also lists 9 losses rather than the claimed 9 losses, as all listed losses are against different teams.\n6. Determine if the claim is true or false based on the findings.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nFinal Answer: \n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Extract relevant information from the table:\n   - To verify the claim, we need to check if North Carolina State and North Carolina were ever shut out (scored zero points) and the margin of loss was less than or equal to 10 points.\n   - We will list the column names for this verification: \n     * row_index\n     * opponent\n     * result\n\n3. Verify that North Carolina State was indeed shutout:\n   - The game against North Carolina State on Row 5 with attendance 25000 and loss of 13-42 has a margin greater than 10 points, so we can disregard this one.\n   - Next up is the game against North Carolina State on Row 11, which had an attendance of 6500 and loss of 9-44. The margin here is 35 points, which is greater than 10 points.\n\n4. Verify that North Carolina was indeed shutout:\n   - There are no games where the margin of loss was less than or equal to 10 points for this particular opponent.\n\n5. Combine all information and draw a conclusion about the claim.\n   - Given the results from steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that the claim is false, as North Carolina State was shutout more than once, but with margins greater than 10 points in both instances.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\",\n      },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n      }\n   ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n      },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"result\"\n      }\n  ]\n}",
