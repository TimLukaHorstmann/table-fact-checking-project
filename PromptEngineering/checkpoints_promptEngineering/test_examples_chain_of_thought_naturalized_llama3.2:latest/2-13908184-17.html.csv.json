According to row 3, he was drafted in round: 4. \n\n#### Step 3: Determine if being drafted in round 4 is true\nBeing drafted in round 4 does not necessarily mean that Andreachuk was drafted before other players drafted earlier. However, there are no indications of later rounds, so it could imply a first draft pick for center.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the position of Randy Andreachuk\nRandy Andreachuk is indeed listed as a center in row 3 of the table.\n\n#### Step 5: Find other centers drafted before round 4\nLooking at rows 11 and 13, we see that Scott Jessee was drafted in round: 12, while Brad Morrow was drafted in round: 13. Since Randy Andreachuk was drafted before them, it means he must have been drafted first among the centers.\n\n#### Step 6: Compile relevant data for JSON\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": [\n        {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Determine the relevance of each row to the claim\"},\n        {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"Identify the draft order for center Randy Andreachuk\"},\n        {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"Determine if being drafted in round 4 is true\"},\n        {\"step\": 4, \"description\": \"Verify the position of Randy Andreachuk\"},\n        {\"step\": 5, \"description\": \"Find other centers drafted before round 4\"},\n        {\"step\": 6, \"description\": \"Compile relevant data for JSON\"}\n    ],\n    \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 11, \"column_name\": \"round\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"round\"}\n    ]\n}",

Next, we will look at the row where Scott Jessee's position is recorded as \"right wing\" and take note of his corresponding row index (row 10).\n3. Then, we can proceed by finding the last player selected in each round of the draft and verifying if they are indeed 'right wingers' like Scott Jessee.\n4. Lastly, to identify whether Scott Jessee was drafted last, we'll need to check the number assigned to him which corresponds to his position in the draft order.\n\n#### Code-based Implementation:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Define relevant cells based on table data\ntable_data = [\n    {\"row_index\": 1, \"position\": \"defense\", \"player\": \"don mclean\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"position\": \"right wing\", \"player\": \"bob sirois\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"position\": \"center\", \"player\": \"randy andreachuk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"position\": \"center\", \"player\": \"dennis sobchuk\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 5, \"position\": \"left wing\", \"player\": \"willie friesen\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"position\": \"left wing\", \"player\": \"steve short\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"position\": \"defense\", \"player\": \"peter mckenzie\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"position\": \"center\", \"player\": \"marcel labrosse\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"position\": \"right wing\", \"player\": \"scott jessee\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"position\": \"right wing\", \"player\": \"brad morrow\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 11, \"position\": \"goaltender\", \"player\": \"richard guay\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 12, \"position\": \"defense\", \"player\": \"craig arvidson\"}\n]\n\n# Find right wingers and their corresponding row indices\nright_wingers = [cell for cell in table_data if cell[\"position\"] == 'right wing']\n\n# Get Scott Jessee's row index\nscott_jessee_row_index = 9\n\n# Determine if Scott Jessee was drafted last\nlast_player_position = right_wingers[-1][\"position\"]\nif last_player_position == \"right wing\" and scott_jessee_row_index < len(right_wingers):\n    answer = False\nelse:\n    answer = True\n\n\nrelevant_cells = [\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": 'position'},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": 'position'}\n]\n\nfinal_answer = {\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"The process starts with identifying all the right wingers in the table to determine Scott Jessee's place among them.\",\n    \"answer\": str(answer),\n    \"relevant_cells\": relevant_cells\n}\n\nprint(json.dumps(final_answer, indent=4))\n```\n\nThis Python script will help you verify whether Scott Jessee was drafted last.",
