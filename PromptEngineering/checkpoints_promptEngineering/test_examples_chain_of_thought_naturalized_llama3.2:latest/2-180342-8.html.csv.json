    "resp": "#### Claim Analysis\n\n1. Determine the current height of Southwark Cathedral:\n   - The table states that Southwark Cathedral's location is Southwark, with a height of 02.0 metres / 50 ft.\n\n2. Find when did Southwark was previously tallest:\n   - According to the table, before 2010-, Southwark cathedral was tallest from year 1666 - 1677.\n\n3. Calculate if it has been just under three centuries since that point:\n   - Subtracting the years from 2010- and adding one results in being \"over\" 3 centuries. Since the starting point is after 3, we calculate: \n     2010 - 1666 = 344\n     So subtract 1 to get \"just under\" three centuries:\n      344 - 1 = 343\n\n4. Determine if it's just under 3 centuries since Southwark was tallest:\n   - Since 343 is less than 100, Southwark has been tallest for \"just under three century\"s.\n\n\n#### JSON Response\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"height metres / ft\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"years as tallest\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"name\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"name\"}\n  ]\n}",
