However, the event in Row 5 against Hamill does have him knocked out.\n\n3. Next, we need to verify that Forrest Griffin was indeed knocked out in round 4.\n4. We can find Forrest Griffin's record for his fight against Matt Hamill in Row 5 of the table (event: KO - time: 0:38). This tells us he got knocked out by Hamill in Round 1, not Round 4.\n\n5. Since there is no other information about Forrest Griffin getting a knockout in round 4, we cannot definitively confirm that it occurred.\n6.
