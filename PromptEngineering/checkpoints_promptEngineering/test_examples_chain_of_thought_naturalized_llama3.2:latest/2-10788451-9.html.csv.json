To determine if the claim about Collingwood and St Kilda having an average away team score of 15.14 is true, we need to first calculate their individual away team scores.\n2. From the table, we can find the away team scores for both Collingwood and St Kilda:\n   - Collingwood's away team score: 12.14 (86)\n   - St Kilda's away team score: 18.14 (122)\n3. Now that we have their individual away team scores, we need to calculate the average of these two scores.\n4. The formula for calculating an average is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. In this case, the sum of Collingwood and St Kilda's away team scores is 12.14 + 18.14 = 30.28\n5. Since there are only two teams, we divide the sum (30.28) by 2 to find the average: 30.28 / 2 = 15.14\n6.
