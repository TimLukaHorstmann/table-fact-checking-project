    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n1. To determine if the claim is TRUE or FALSE, we need to find out if the highest number of points scored by any team is indeed 32.\n\n2. Looking at the table, we can see that there are multiple teams with different points totals. We need to compare these values to determine which team has scored the most points.\n\n3. Starting from Row 1, we see that San Francisco FC has a total of 37 points.\n4. Moving on to Row 2, Arabe Unidos has a total of 32 points.\n5. Continuing with Row 3, Tauro FC has a total of 31 points.\n6. Next is Row 4, where Municipal Chorrillo has 27 points.\n7. In Row 5, Atl\u00e9tico Chiriqu\u00ed has 26 points.\n8. Moving further down the table, we find that Alianza FC has 24 points in Row 6 and Chepo FC has 23 points in Row 7.\n9. Finally, we have Rows 8 to 10 with teams Sporting San Miguelito, Plaza Amador, and Atl\u00e9tico Verag\u00fcense having fewer points than Arabe Unidos.\n\n10. From the comparison above, it's clear that Arabe Unidos holds the highest number of points scored by any team with a total of 32 points.\n\n11. Therefore, we can confirm whether or not the claim is true based on this analysis.\n\n\n#### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Identify teams with the most points\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Compare each team's point total to determine the highest score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"description\": \"Confirm if Arabe Unidos indeed holds the highest number of points scored by any team\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"pts\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
