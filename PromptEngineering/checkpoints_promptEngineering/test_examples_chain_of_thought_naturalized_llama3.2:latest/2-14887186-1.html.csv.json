Since both players have the same school (\"south carolina\"), we need to determine if their positions match.\n\n5. However, upon closer inspection of the table, it appears there was a mistake in my previous assertion that both had 'back' as their position; Joe Gomes actually has \"back\" as his position and so does Kirk Phares, confirming they have matching positions.\n\n6.

However, since there is no explicit column for the team name, we will assume that teams are represented by their school names.\n\n#### Step 4: Examine the table for players from schools that could be Green Bay\nLooking at the table, there is no row with a school name that explicitly matches \"Green Bay\". However, we can look for rows with positions that might indicate they played for the Packers. Notably, there is no row with a position like \"defensive back\" or \"tackle\" for the school \"Wisconsin\", but another row has a player from Wisconsin.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if Wisconsin players could be included\nAlthough Wisconsin is not explicitly mentioned as being the team Green Bay, we have to consider that it might match. In this case, we need to examine the relevant columns of Row 3 and determine if any of those are \"defensive back\", \"tackle\", or \"back\" and see how many there actually are.\n\n#### Step 6: Count the number of defensive players from Wisconsin\nRow 3 states that round: 5, pick: 51, player: dale hackbart, position: defensive back, school: wisconsin. Thus, we have found one player who could be considered part of the team Green Bay.\n\n#### Step 7: Continue searching for other potential defensive players from schools with matching teams\nWe need to continue examining rows to see if any other positions match those of a Green Bay Packers player.\n\n#### Step 8: Evaluate additional possible \"defensive\" players based on team schools and their corresponding positions in the table\nAfter evaluating row 3, we still need to look at row 12 for another player's school to see whether there is indeed only one defensive player from that potential Green Bay school. In Row 12, we find garney henley who played for \"huron\". However, we can't conclude if he was part of the team or not since no connection exists between huron and a Packers match.\n\n#### Step 9: Conclude on whether there are only two defensive players in the Green Bay team\nWe found that Row 3 has one player (defensive back) from Wisconsin. However, without further connections between specific schools with a team name like \"green bay\", we can't conclude how many other potential players exist. Thus, if we consider another position and match it to the \"Green Bay\" school, then there might be two defensive players but not just one.\n\n#### Step 10: Final evaluation of defensive players\nAfter looking through the table again for connections to Green Bay Packers (assuming that they have a player from Wisconsin), we find Row 15 with \"round: 19, pick: 221, player: rich brooks, position: end, school: purdue.\" Then in row 16 we see Gilmer Lewis who played for Oklahoma which is not the team Green Bay either. Still no definitive match.\n\n#### Step 11: Final Answer Determination\nSince there are indeed at least two defensive players (one from Wisconsin), but no other potential matches were found, we can now conclude that there is more than one, and therefore the claim \"there be only 2 defensive in the team green bay\" is FALSE.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\",\n      \"description\": \"The claim to be evaluated is 'there be only 2 defensive in the team green bay'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 2: Determine the meaning of defensive in the context of the table\",\n      \"description\": \"In the context of the table, a defensive player refers to any player whose position is listed as either \\\"defensive back\\\", \\\"tackle\\\", or \\\"back\\\".\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Step 3: Count the number of defensive players in the team Green Bay\",\n      \"description\": \"To count the number of defensive players, we need to examine each row and determine if the player's position falls under one of the categories mentioned.

In the table, these are columns 5 and 2, respectively.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine how to identify tackle players\nTo determine if there are six tackle players in Green Bay in 1960, we need to find rows where the \"school\" is Green Bay (since it's not specified that they were drafted by Green Bay, but for simplicity let's assume this column refers to their collegiate team) and the \"position\" is \"tackle\". We will then count these rows.\n\n#### Step 3: Look for rows corresponding to Green Bay\nTo find if any of the players were from Green Bay, we need to look at the school names. However, since all schools are named in the table but not explicitly stating if they're from Green Bay, let's focus on tackle players as per step 2.\n\n#### Step 4: Check for players who play tackle\nLooking through the relevant columns, we see that there are indeed tackle players mentioned. For example, Row 4 mentions \"tackle\", Row 7 mentions \"tackle\", and so on.\n\n#### Step 5: Determine if any of these tackles played in Green Bay in 1960\nSince no specific information is given about where these players were drafted from or when they joined the team, we will have to assume this claim based on the availability of tackle players in the table. There are several tackle players in Row 4 through Row 8.\n\n#### Step 6: Determine if there are six tackle players\nFrom our observations in step 5, it appears that not all players listed as tackles were drafted by Green Bay or played for them specifically. However, based on how many we found in relevant positions and the lack of more information to exclude any others, we have at least a few.\n\n#### Step 7: Determine if Green Bay indeed has six tackle players\nGiven our steps above, while there are several tackles listed, it's unclear from just this list whether all or exactly six were drafted by Green Bay. We can't confirm the total number of tackle players solely based on the provided data without more context.\n\n#### Step 8: Determine if we have enough information to evaluate the claim\nBased on our analysis and steps above, we realize that with a lack of specificity regarding where each player was drafted from or how many were actually part of Green Bay's 1960 team, we cannot definitively say there are exactly six tackle players in Green Bay.\n\n#### Step 9: Conclusion based on available information\nGiven the information provided, it appears we can't confirm if there are indeed six tackle players specifically from Green Bay.

Next, we need to determine if any of these schools are Green Bay: Looking at the table, there is no player from a team called \"Green Bay\". However, we do see players from other teams that might have played in or around Green Bay.\n\n3. Now, let's focus on finding out who were picked in the third round and whether they were running backs for a possible Green Bay team: Looking at row 10, pick 149, player paul winslow was drafted by North Carolina Central but he wasn't picked as a \"back\". \n\n4. Continuing from step 3 to find out more information about players who might have been selected in the third round and were running backs for a Green Bay team: In row 12, pick 173, we see player Garney Henley was drafted by Huron and his position is listed as \"back\" but that isn't sufficient since he went at 173rd overall.\n\n5. Further looking through the table to find any players who were picked in round three from a school with a name or team associated with Green Bay: Row 11 states pick 161 was used by East Texas State player Jon Gilliam whose position is listed as center; while row 8 shows Oklahoma State's Don Hitt, selected at 89th overall but his position is centered. Also looking through the table we see that South Dakota was not a possible team.\n\n6. To continue verifying our previous steps let's make sure we did find a running back in round three from Green Bay: After reviewing all of these teams again it seems there isn't enough information to verify if any running backs were selected by Green Bay in round 3.\n\n\n1. Finally, we can conclude whether the claim is TRUE or FALSE.\n\nHere is our final answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check school of each player\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Determine if any of these schools are Green Bay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Find players picked in third round and were running backs for a possible Green Bay team\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Verify information to make sure we did find a running back in round three from Green Bay\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Check if there is any additional information needed\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"position\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
