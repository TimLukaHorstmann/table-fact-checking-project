However, looking closer at the data provided for the Australian Open specifically, there seems to be a misunderstanding.\n\n#### Step 6: Correct Understanding\nSince there are different outcomes across the years and no information about other tournaments besides the Australian Open is relevant to evaluating the claim directly, we must rely on what the table actually tells us.\n\n#### Step 7: Final Analysis\nThe data does not support the specific claim of being \"6-10 in win loss during this open\" as it pertains more to a singular tournament rather than an aggregate score.
