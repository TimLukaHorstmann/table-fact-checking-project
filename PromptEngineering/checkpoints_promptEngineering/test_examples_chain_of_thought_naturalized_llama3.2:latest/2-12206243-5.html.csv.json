Check the status of each row related to a postpoment due to snow:\n   - Rows 9 and 10 have \"postponed (snow)\" which means they were postponed because of snow.\n   - The rest of rows do not indicate any postponement due to weather conditions.\n\n3. Count how many rows show that the game was postponed due to snow:\n   There are two such rows, specifically row 9 and row 10.\n\n4. Evaluate if more than one out of six games against brewers were postponed due to snow:\n   - Out of the identified rows (3 regular games, and 2 postponed games), only 2 games were postponed due to snow.\n\n5. Compare with the claim that 2 of the 6 game against the Brewers be postpone due to snow:\n   The number of actual postponed games matches the claim.\n\n#### Final Answer JSON:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"opponent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. To determine whether the highest scoring game will be played agains the Mariners on April 25, we need to identify the highest scoring game from the table.\n\n2. We can start by examining row 22: date: april 25, opponent: mariners, score: 13 - 8, loss: plesac (0 - 2), attendance: 31215, record: 9 - 10. The score of 13-8 is the highest recorded score in the table so far.\n\n3. We need to check if this game will be played agains the Mariners on April 25. The claim states \"be play agains the mariner\", which seems to be a typo and should read \"will be played against the Mariners\".\n\n4. Looking at row 22 again, we can see that it indeed mentions playing the Mariners on April 25.\n\n5. Next, we need to check if this is the highest scoring game of all, not just for the Mariners. We will have to go back and compare scores across different opponents.\n\n6. Examining rows 20-21: date: april 23, opponent: angels, score: 7 - 6, loss: james (1 - 2), attendance: 13353, record: 9 - 8, and row 22 does not have the highest recorded score of 13-8, but examining row 21: we see that this is actually the second-highest scored game.\n\n7. Now going through rows 24-26; date: april 27, opponent: mariners, score: 2 - 1, loss: person (0 - 1), attendance: 32160, record: 10 - 11; row 25: date: april 29, opponent: royals, score: 6 - 5 (10), loss: quantrill (3 - 2), attendance: 12533, record: 10 - 12; and row 26: date: april 30, opponent: royals, score: 1 - 0, loss: appier (3 - 1), attendance: 13004, record: 11 - 12. We see that both of these games have a higher score than the Mariners game.\n\n8. Now we need to check row 26; and row 25 is actually tied with row 24's for third-highest score. Also examining row 18: date: april 20, opponent: rangers, score: 10 - 5, loss: guzm\u00e1n (2 - 2), attendance: 34333, record: 11 - 12 we can see that the Rangers game also has a higher score than the Mariners. We cannot confirm if this is the highest scoring game.\n\n9. Now let's go back to row 18 and examine row 21; date: april 23, opponent: angels, score: 5 - 4 (10), loss: spoljaric (0 - 2), attendance: 13117, record: 9 - 9, we see that this is actually tied with the mariners April 25th game for second highest.\n\nHowever, examining row 22; date: april 25, opponent: mariners, score: 13 - 8, loss: plesac (0 - 2), attendance: 31215, record: 9 - 10 we see that the mariners April 25th game is actually second highest, with a tie for the third-highest game.\n\nExamining row 18; date: april 20, opponent: rangers, score: 10 - 5, loss: guzm\u00e1n (2 - 2), attendance: 34333, record: 11 - 12 we see that this is actually tied with row 26; and row 25 for the highest recorded game. The Rangers vs Mariners game was played on April 20th.\n\nTherefore, we can confirm that the highest scoring game will be played against the Mariners on April 25 but since it's not actually the highest game, our answer must be false.\n\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 21,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 25,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the highest scoring game played against the Mariners on April 26.\n2. To do this, let's look at the score column for the Mariners vs. Brewers game on April 25 (Row 22): it shows a score of 13 - 8. This is the highest score in the table so far.\n3. However, we need to verify if there are any other games with higher scores played against the Mariners on April 26. Let's check Row 23: it also has a score for the Mariners vs. Brewers game played on April 26. The score shows 4 - 3.\n4. Since both Row 22 and Row 23 have scores, we need to find out which one is higher. The score in Row 22 is 13 - 8, while the score in Row 23 is 4 - 3. Clearly, the score in Row 22 is higher than Row 23.\n5. Therefore, we can conclude that the highest scoring game played against the Mariners was on April 26 with a score of 13 - 8.\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 22,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 23,\n      \"column_name\": \"score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, identify the relevant column to check for attendance: `attendance`.\n2. Next, filter out rows where attendance was not provided or was postponed (for games rescheduled due to weather): Rows 6, 9, 10, and 11.\n3. After filtering out the aforementioned rows, find all unique values in the `attendance` column:\n    - The smallest value is 746.\n4. Now compare this value with 500:\n    - Since 746 is greater than 500, we can conclude that the claim about less than 500 crowd attending the game against the White Sox cannot be true.\n5. Additionally, we need to verify if it's indeed the least attended game among those where attendance was provided:\n    - However, since there are other games with smaller attendance (e.g., Row 24: 32160), this detail is not necessary for our current claim.\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"step\": 1, \"description\": \"Identify the relevant column to check for attendance\"},\n    {\"step\": 2, \"description\": \"Filter out rows where attendance was not provided or was postponed (for games rescheduled due to weather)\"},\n    {\"step\": 3, \"description\": \"Find all unique values in the attendance column\"},\n    {\"step\": 4, \"description\": \"Compare this value with 500\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 24, \"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ]\n}",
