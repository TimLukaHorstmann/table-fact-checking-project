    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the table to understand who was a member of the Socialist Party of Albania. We will look at the column \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\" and check if any of them were members of the Socialist Party.\n\n2. From Row 3, Ylli Bufi is listed as being a member of the Socialist Party ( political party: socialist party of albania).\n\n3. From Row 6, Bashkim Fino is also listed as a member of the Socialist Party ( political party: socialist party of albania).\n\n4. From Row 7, Fatos Nano is listed as a member of the Socialist Party for the third time ( political party: socialist party of albania).\n\n5. From Row 8, Pandeli Majko was first listed as a member of the Socialist Party ( political party: socialist party of albania), and then from Row 10, he was listed again as a member.\n\n6. Finally, from Row 13, Edi Rama is listed as being a member of the Socialist Party ( political party: socialist party of albania) and has been in office since 2013, indicating they are still currently a member.\n\n7. Since we have found that at least five people were members of the Socialist Party (Ylli Bufi, Bashkim Fino, Fatos Nano, Pandeli Majko, Edi Rama), we need to check if only one person was a member and that it's not true, so we can say that claim is false.\n\n8. We should also look for any inconsistencies or missing information in the table but in this case, everything seems to be correct.\n\n\n#### JSON Output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"born - died\", \"text\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"born - died\", \"text\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"born - died\", \"text\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"born - died\", \"text\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"born - died\", \"text\": \"\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"born - died\", \"text\": \"\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10, \"column_name\": \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 13, \"column_name\": \"political party: prime ministers 1991 onwards\"}\n  ]\n}",
