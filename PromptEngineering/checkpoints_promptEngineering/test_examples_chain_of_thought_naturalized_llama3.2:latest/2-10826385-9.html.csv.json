Next, we need to find the attendance for Carlton on May 27, 1972.\n   The relevant cell can be found by looking at Row 5 of the table: \"crowd: 15664, date: 27 may 1972.\"\n   This means that Carlton had an attendance of 15664.\n\n3. Now we need to compare these two attendances in order to determine if St Kilda has a lower attendance than Carlton on May 27.\n   We can do this by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and determining which is smaller: 23507 - 15664 = 7843, or 15664 - 23507 = -7843\n   Since 7843 > 0 we know that St Kilda's attendance is higher than Carlton's.\n\n4.

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the team**: The claim mentions Geelong, so we need to check their score and find out how many other teams scored more points on May 27.\n\n2. **Look up Geelong's score**: In Row 4 of the table, the away team is Geelong and they scored 16.13 (109) points.\n\n3. **Check if Geelong lost the game**: Looking at Row 4 again, we see that the home team Collingwood scored 28.16 (184) points. Since Collingwood's score is higher than Geelong's, we can conclude that Geelong did not lose this game.\n\n4. **Identify other teams that scored more points on May 27**: We need to check the scores of all teams in Rows 1-6 and find out which ones scored more points than Geelong (16.13).\n\n5. **Compare scores with Geelong's score**: Looking at each row:\n    - Row 1: South Melbourne scored 9.10 (64), so less than Geelong.\n    - Row 2: Richmond scored 16.9 (105) and also more than Geelong.\n    - Row 3: Hawthorn scored 14.21 (105), but only tied with Richmond, not more.\n    - Row 4: Collingwood's score is higher than Geelong's, so yes, but we are looking for scores MORE THAN Geelong's to fulfill the condition of being \"all but 2 other teams\".\n    - Row 5: Carlton scored 16.13 (109) which is more than Geelong.\n    - Row 6: Melbourne scored 5.6 (36), so less than Geelong.\n\n### Relevant Cells:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"row_index\":4,\"column_name\":\"away_team\"},\n  {\"row_index\":2,\"column_name\":\"score\"}\n]\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Geelong did not lose their game (since the home team Collingwood scored more points).
