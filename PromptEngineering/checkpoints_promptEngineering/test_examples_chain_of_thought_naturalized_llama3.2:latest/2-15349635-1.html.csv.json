    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n1. First, I will examine the claim to understand what it's saying. The claim states that there is no team tie on points, but most teams are separate by more than 1 goal difference.\n2. To verify this, I need to check each row of the table for any ties in points and then calculate the difference between the points and the goal difference for each team.\n3. If a tie in points exists, I will look at how many teams have differences greater than 1 from this tied point value.\n4. The claim suggests that there should be no such team with a difference of 1 or less.\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation\n```json\n{\n    \"chain_of_thought\": \"Start by checking for any ties in points across different rows.\\n\\nChecking each row individually:\\nRow 1: Flamengo has 13 points, and Fluminense also has 13 points.\\nThis is a tie.\\nCalculating the difference between point and goal difference for both teams in Row 1:\\nFlamengo's difference: 8 (points) - 5 (goal difference) = 3\\nFluminense's difference: 10 (points) - 5 (goal difference) = 5\\nBoth differences are greater than 1.\\n\\nChecking the rest of the rows for ties in points and calculating the goal difference:\\nRow 2: Corinthians has 9 points, Palestra It\u00e1lia also has 8 points. But Palestra It\u00e1lia's team has 19 points against, while Corinthians has only 15. There isn't a tie in point value but they both are not separated by more than 1.\\nRow 3 to Row 5: No ties in points and all teams have differences greater than 1 from their points.\\nRow 6: Botafogo is tied with 6 points, Vasco da Gama also has 6 points. They don't meet the criteria of being separated by more than 1 goal difference in this case since they are tied on both.\\nRow 7 to Row 9: No ties in points and all teams have differences greater than 1 from their points.\",\n    \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n    \"relevant_cells\": [\n        {\"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 6, \"column_name\": \"team\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 7, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 8, \"column_name\": \"points\"},\n        {\"row_index\": 9, \"column_name\": \"points\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is in JSON format.",
