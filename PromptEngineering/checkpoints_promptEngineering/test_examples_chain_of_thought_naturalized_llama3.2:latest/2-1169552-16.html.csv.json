    "resp": "#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. First, we need to extract the information about i1 and c3 from the table.\n   - For class: i1, wheels: 4 - 4 - 2t, date: 1906 - 7\n     - No built: 20 (this is not relevant for our comparison)\n     - Loco nos: 1 - 10595 - 604\n   - For class: c3, wheels: 0 - 6 - 0, date: 1906\n     - No built: 10 (this is not relevant for our comparison)\n\n2. Next, we need to compare the number of i1 builds with c3 builds.\n   - There are 20 i1 builds and 10 c3 builds.\n\n3. Now, let's calculate if there are indeed 10 fewer i1 builds than c3 builds.\n   - Yes, because 20 (number of i1 builds) is greater than 10 (number of c3 builds), but we need to find out if it's exactly 10 less or more.\n\n4. Let's do the math:\n   - Number of i1 builds: 20\n   - Number of c3 builds: 10\n   - Difference between the two classes' number of builds: 20 - 10 = 10\n\n5. The difference is indeed 10, so our claim about there being exactly 10 fewer i1 builds than c3 is true.\n\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Extracted relevant information from table\\nCompare the number of i1 and c3 builds\\nDetermined that there are indeed 10 more i1 builds rather than a lesser amount of c3 builds\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"no built\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"no built\"}\n  ]\n}",
