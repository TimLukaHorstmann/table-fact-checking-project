Now let\u2019s compare all of these scores with each other to find out who has the highest away team score.\n   - Collingwood and St Kilda have similar home and away team scores, making them high contenders for having the highest away team score in the season.\n   - Hawthorn only has a lower score compared to Collingwood.\n\n8. Check if Hawthorn\u2019s higher score is the greatest among all away team scores.\n    - Hawthorn's 10.14 (74) isn't the highest away team score in the season; Collingwood has a similar home and away team score.\n\n9. Determine whether hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\n   - Given that Hawthorn is not at the top, we can infer that Hawthorn does indeed have the highest away team score but it isn\u2019t the greatest among all away team scores.\n\nHere is the output:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"reasoning\": \"First, find all away team scores in row 1-6\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Compare these away team scores with each other and with home team scores in the same row\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Find highest among away team scores from previous comparison\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Compare highest away team score with home team's total for each match day\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Determine if hawthorn have the highest away team score in the season\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Check if Hawthorn\u2019s higher score is the greatest among all away team scores\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Determine whether hawthorn have the highest score of the away team in the season\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"away_team_score\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the row for St Kilda's match: The claim mentions St Kilda, so we need to look at Row 5 of the table.\n\n2. Extract the home team score for St Kilda from Row 5: According to the table, St Kilda scored 6.16 (52).\n\n3. Compare this score with other home teams' scores in the season:\n   - Essendon scored 10.11 (71) in their match.\n   - Richmond scored 17.18 (120) in their match.\n   - South Melbourne scored 13.11 (89) in their match.\n   - North Melbourne scored 17.16 (118) in their match.\n   - Carlton scored 17.14 (116) in their match.\n\n4. Determine if St Kilda has the highest score among these home teams: Comparing the scores, we see that Richmond's score of 17.18 is higher than St Kilda's score of 6.16.\n\n5. Conclude whether the claim about St Kilda having the highest score of the home team in the season is TRUE or FALSE based on our comparison.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Identify the row for St Kilda's match\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Extract the home team score for St Kilda from Row 5\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Compare this score with other home teams' scores in the season\",\n      \"relevant_cells\": [\n        { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n        { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n        { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"\" },\n        { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Determine if St Kilda has the highest score among these home teams\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"reasoning_step\": \"Conclude whether the claim about St Kilda having the highest score of the home team in the season is TRUE or FALSE\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"\" }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"home team score\" }\n  ]\n}",
