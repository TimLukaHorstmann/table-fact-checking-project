    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n1. To determine whether the claim about Arden Street Oval having 3000 more crowd participants than Lake Oval, we first need to find the number of attendees at each venue.\n\n2. The relevant information can be found in rows 1 and 3 of the table.\n   - For Arden Street Oval, the attendee count is listed as 21000 (in row 1).\n   - For Lake Oval, the attendee count is listed as 18000 (in row 3).\n\n3. Subtracting the attendee count at Lake Oval from that of Arden Street Oval gives us the difference: 21000 - 18000 = 3000.\n\n4. Now we can evaluate if this difference matches the claim made in the prompt.\n   - The claim states that there are 3000 more attendees at Arden Street Oval than at Lake Oval.\n   - Our calculation in step 3 shows an exact match to this claim.\n\n5. To support our answer, it's worth noting which specific values from the table we used:\n   - Relevant cells: [ { \"row_index\": 1, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }, { \"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" } ]\n\n### Final Answer in JSON Format\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Subtracted attendee counts from the relevant rows of the table to find the difference: 21000 (Arden Street Oval) - 18000 (Lake Oval) = 3000.

    "resp": "Here are the steps to reason about the claim:\n\n1. Identify the column containing crowd information, which is the second column.\n2. For each row, extract the value in the second column (crowd).\n3. Compare the values in the second column for each row to determine if any of them represent the highest crowd participation.\n4. Check if Windy Hill venue has the highest crowd participation by verifying if its crowd value is greater than or equal to all other crowd values.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the table:\n\n- Row 1: home team: north melbourne, home team score: 17.15 (117), away team: richmond, away team score: 10.13 (73), venue: arden street oval, crowd: 21000, date: 6 july 1957\n- Row 2: home team: footscray, home team score: 9.11 (65), away team: geelong, away team score: 9.10 (64), venue: western oval, crowd: 23578, date: 6 july 1957\n- Row 3: home team: south melbourne, home team score: 11.15 (81), away team: st kilda, away team score: 9.17 (71), venue: lake oval, crowd: 18000, date: 6 july 1957\n- Row 4: home team: melbourne, home team score: 24.14 (158), away team: fitzroy, away team score: 10.14 (74), venue: mcg, crowd: 21370, date: 6 july 1957\n- Row 5: home team: essendon, home team score: 12.16 (88), away team: collingwood, away team score: 10.13 (73), venue: windy hill, crowd: 26500, date: 6 july 1957\n- Row 6: home team: hawthorn, home team score: 7.10 (52), away team: carlton, away team score: 8.13 (61), venue: glenferrie oval, crowd: 26000, date: 6 july 1957\n\nApplying the steps to the table:\n\n- Row 1: 21000 is less than other values\n- Row 2: 23578 is greater than all other values\n- Row 3: 18000 is less than other values\n- Row 4: 21370 is less than Row 5's value\n- Row 5: 26500 is the highest value\n\nTherefore, Windy Hill venue has the highest crowd participation.\n\nHere is the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"crowd\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"TRUE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    { \"row_index\": 5, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" },\n    { \"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"crowd\" }\n  ]\n}",
