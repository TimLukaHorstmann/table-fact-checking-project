First, let's identify the game on November 19, 1978.\n   - From the table, we can see that row 12 corresponds to week 12, which has a date of \"November 19, 1978\".\n   - Looking at this row, we find that the attendance is 45022.\n\n2. Next, let's determine if November 19 is indeed the highest attendance.\n   - We need to compare the attendance from November 19 with all other attendances in the table.\n   - From rows 1-11 and 15, there are no higher attendances than row 16.\n   - In row 10, we have an attendance of 55468.\n   - Row 10 has a date later than November 19.\n\n3. Now let's determine if the game on October 8, 1978 is higher in attendance than November 19.\n   - From row 6, we see that the attendance for this game is 59337.\n\n4. Next, let's check if any of the other games have an attendance greater than both row 10 and row 6.\n   - There are no such attendances in rows 1-11.\n\n5. Given these facts, we now know what we need to do:\n   - Row 10 has a higher attendance than row 16.\n   - Therefore, row 10 cannot be the highest attended game.\n\n6. Now that we have ruled out row 10, and since we also have an attendance in row 15 which is lower than row 6, there are no attendances left to check against row 6 for higher attendance.\n\n7. Since all other games have a lower attendance than both rows 10 and 6, then the only possibility for this game being the highest attended remains: \n   - Row 16.\n   - This corresponds to week 16 of the season which has an attendance greater than that of row 15.\n\n8. After ruling out all attendances with higher values, we have shown by process of elimination:\n   - Row 10 cannot be the highest\n   - There is no other row between rows 6 and 15.\n   - Only one possibility remains for this game being the highest attended: \n     - Row 16.\n\n9. Since we've confirmed that only row 16 has a higher attendance than both rows 6 and 10, then by elimination we can conclude that:\n   - The claim \"the game on November 19 , 1978 , be the game with the highest attendance\" is FALSE\n\n10. Lastly, let's identify the relevant cells:\n   - Row_index: 16\n   - column_name: attendance\n   - Therefore our final answer in JSON format will include:\n     {\n       \"chain_of_thought\": [\n         {\"row_index\": 12,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n         {\"row_index\": 10,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n       ],\n       \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n       \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":16,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n     }\n\n    ```\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 12,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 10,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"}\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [{\"row_index\":16,\"column_name\": \"attendance\"}]\n}",
