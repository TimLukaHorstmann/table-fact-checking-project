    "resp": "Here are the steps for evaluating the claim:\n\n1. First, we need to check if \"Three Times a Lady\" by Commodores has the same week on top as \"Baker Street\" by Gerry Rafferty. To do that, we should find the week when both songs were at number one.\n\n2. According to the table, \"Three Times a Lady\" by Commodores is in issue 29:26-25 and reached its peak on September 16th. \"Baker Street\" by Gerry Rafferty is in issue 29:16-19 and reached its peak on July 15th.\n\n3. Comparing these weeks, we can see that both songs were not at the same week on top, because \"Three Times a Lady\" had four weeks on top (September 23 - October 7), while \"Baker Street\" had four weeks on top as well (July 22-August 5).\n\n4. However, given that both had four weeks, we should look for an exact match in the weeks' dates to confirm if indeed they share the same week at number one.\n\n5. Checking again for \"Three Times a Lady\" by Commodores and \"Baker Street\" by Gerry Rafferty, we find that both had their peaks at week 16 and 15 respectively but then both had four more weeks of being on top with different dates. There's no overlap in their peak weeks.\n\n6. Now let's consider the claim: \"three time a lady have the same week on top as baker street\". As determined, there is an instance where both songs reached number one at the same week but it was just for one week and they shared that exact week of being at number one.\n\n\n\nHere is the JSON output:\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 15,\n      \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"weeks on top\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The closest match is \"(you don't bring me flowers)\", which seems to be a part of another song but shares a similar phrase.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Rows\n- In Row 22, under \"weeks on top\", it states 3 for the song \"(you don't bring me flowers)\".\nThis is the closest we get to our target.
