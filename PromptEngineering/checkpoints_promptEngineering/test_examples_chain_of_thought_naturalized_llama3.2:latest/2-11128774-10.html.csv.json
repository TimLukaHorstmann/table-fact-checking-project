Therefore, it appears that the decision was always Mclean in the 1992-93 Vancouver Canuck season.\n\n### Step 2: Check if only few dates take place in May\nTo verify this claim, let's count the number of games played in May. We see that there are at least three games played on May 2, May 5, and May 13 (Row 1, Row 2, and Row 6 respectively). Since we can find more than a few dates that take place in May, this claim seems to be FALSE.\n\n### Step 3: Compile the reasoning steps\nHere is our step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n* The decision was always Mclean in the 1992-93 Vancouver Canuck season (Step 1).\n* Only a few games took place in May (Step 2).\n\n### JSON Output\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"decision\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

The other score given in the claim is 4-3, which can be found in Row 5. However, there's another row with a different score that must be checked.\n\nStep 2: Find all unique scores and their corresponding dates to verify if any occur on May 9 and May 13.\n\nAfter examining the table, we find that 7-2 is one of the highest scores. The highest score mentioned between Vancouver and Los Angeles in the claim is indeed found at Row 4, where a home team (Los Angeles) won against a visiting team (Vancouver). Another high score is in Row 5 for the same teams.\n\nNow we must check if these match with May 9 and May 13 as stated in the claim along with their attendance of 16005 and 16150.\n\nStep 3: Verify that May 9 and May 13 are correct, and both have attendance of 16005 and 16150 respectively. \n\nBoth dates (May 9 and May 13) and attendances (16005 and 16150) in the claim are also found at Row 4 and Row 6 which is one of the rows with a score matching the highest score.\n\nStep 4: Now we will confirm that these specific conditions for attendance match the information at row 6. \n\nWe see that, yes indeed, both attendances do indeed occur on those dates.
