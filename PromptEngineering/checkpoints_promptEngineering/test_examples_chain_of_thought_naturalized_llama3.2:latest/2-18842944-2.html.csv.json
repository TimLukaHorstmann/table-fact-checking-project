The months of the year in order are January (1), February (2), March (3), April (4), May (5), June (6), July (7), August (8), September (9), October (10), November (11), and December (12). Since December falls between October and November, we need to look at the dates in rows 13 and 14 of the table.\n\n4. For row 13: week: 13, date: december 5 , 1976, opponent: miami dolphins, result: l 45 - 27, attendance: 43475. December 5th falls within December.\n\n5.

Since there's more than one occurrence of a team playing the Patriots with different attendance values, we need to find which game indeed had the \"smallest\" attendance:\n   Comparing rows 9 and 13, since row 9 has an attendance value larger than row 13 (61157 > 43475), the correct smallest attendance for this specific claim is 43475.\n\n5.

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Determine the number of wins and losses\nTo evaluate the claim, we need to calculate the total number of games won and lost by the Buffalo Bills.\n\n- Wins can be determined by looking at rows with a 'w' result.\n- Losses can be determined by looking at rows with an 'l' result.\n\n#### Step 2: Count wins in the table\nLooking at row 3, 4, 10 we see that there are 3 wins (result = w).\nIn row 13 and 14 we add a 0 win for the lost games against Baltimore colts.\nThus, the total number of wins is 3.\n\n#### Step 3: Count losses in the table\nLooking at rows with an 'l' result we see that there are 10 losses (result = l).\nIn row 5 and 8 we add a 0 loss for the win game against New York Jets.\nThus, the total number of losses is 10.\n\n#### Step 4: Determine if Buffalo Bills lose 3 more games than they win\n- To do this, subtract the number of wins from the number of losses. \n- If the result is -3 (losses - wins), then the claim is true; otherwise it's false.\n\n- Losses minus wins = 10 - 3 = 7\n\nSince losses are greater than wins by 4 instead of 3, this means that Buffalo Bills lose 4 more games than they win. The answer is FALSE.\n\n\n#### Answer JSON:\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 1,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 2,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 3,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 4,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 5,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 6,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 7,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 8,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 9,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 11,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 12,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 13,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 14,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 10,\n      \"column_name\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",
