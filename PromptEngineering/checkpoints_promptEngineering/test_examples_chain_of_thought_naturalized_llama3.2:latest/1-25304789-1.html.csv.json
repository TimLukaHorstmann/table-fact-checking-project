Since both episodes have the same US air date (august 10 , 2010), the claim seems to be true at first glance.\n\n4. However, I also notice that Row 1 has an episode with \"a modest proposal\" and August 3, 2010 as its US air date, which might raise questions about the consistency of dates in the table.\n\n5. After closer inspection, I realize that the issue is not with the dates themselves but rather the possibility of there being a different air date for each episode, given the information provided.\n\n6. Given that both \"it's my party\" and \"detour\" have the same US air date (august 10 , 2010) and considering no additional information to contradict this claim, I can conclude that the claim is indeed true.\n\n7.
