    "resp": "### Chain of Thought\n1. **Identify the claim**: The claim states that 3 drivers had to retire due to a gearbox issue.\n2. **Locate relevant cells**: To verify this claim, we need to find rows where \"time / retired\" indicates a gearbox issue (i.e., 'gearbox', 'wheel', or any other clearly related issue not explicitly stated as 'gearbox' but implying it) and check if the number of such instances meets or exceeds 3.\n3. **Analyze row 18**: In Row 18, driver Bertrand Gachot's time is noted as \"36\" with a note of \"retired: gearbox\". This implies that his retirement was due to a gearbox issue.\n4. **Analyze row 19**: In Row 19, driver Domenico Schiattarella's time is noted as \"35\" with a note of \"retired: suspension\". While not explicitly stated, the context suggests this could be related to a gearbox issue given its proximity and commonality in problems.\n5. **Analyze row 18 and 19 closely**: Both these rows do indeed indicate issues leading to retirement that could be broadly categorized under mechanical failure or maintenance (suspension or gearbox), reinforcing the interpretation of a 'gearbox' issue indirectly.\n6. **Count relevant instances**: Currently, we have at least two instances directly related to gearbox issues due to either 'gearbox' or closely related reasons.\n7. **Check for more instances**: Beyond these two clear cases, we need to see if there are any other indications of gearbox issues that might suggest a third case meeting the claim's criteria.\n8. **Inspect rows 3, 6, and others**: Rows like Jean Alesi's '+ 18.510' (indicating overtake) and Gerhard Berger's '+ 43.116', while indicating significant laps lost, do not explicitly mention a gearbox issue.\n9. **Conclusion on count**: Given the direct evidence of gearbox issues in only two instances and the lack of further indications that would strongly suggest another case meeting the claim within the provided data, it appears the claim might be false or underrepresented.\n10. **Review for potential oversight**: Reviewing all rows again to ensure no instance was overlooked that directly relates to a 'gearbox issue'.\n\n### Final Answer\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": [\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 1,\n      \"description\": \"Identify the claim\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 2,\n      \"description\": \"Locate relevant cells\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 3,\n      \"description\": \"Analyze row 18\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 18,\n        \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 4,\n      \"description\": \"Analyze row 19\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": {\n        \"row_index\": 19,\n        \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 5,\n      \"description\": \"Analyze rows 18 and 19 closely for gearbox implications\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 18,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 19,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 6,\n      \"description\": \"Count relevant instances of gearbox issues\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 18,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 19,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 7,\n      \"description\": \"Inspect rows for more instances of gearbox issues\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 3,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 6,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"step_number\": 8,\n      \"description\": \"Conclusion on count and potential oversight\",\n      \"relevant_cell\": [\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 18,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"row_index\": 19,\n          \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 18,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row_index\": 19,\n      \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Identify the rows with 63 laps**: We need to look for rows where the number of laps completed by a driver is exactly 63.\n2. **Check the constructor of these drivers**: Once we have identified the row(s) with 63 laps, we will check the constructor (team name) of each driver in those rows.\n3. **Verify if all Ferrari drivers completed 63 laps**: We need to confirm that all drivers from the Ferrari team who completed 63 laps are indeed listed among these rows.\n\n### Relevant Rows and Columns\n\n- Row Index: The row number of the table where a condition is met (e.g., completing 63 laps).\n- Column Name: The column name relevant to our analysis, which includes:\n  - `time / retired`: The time taken by the driver or the reason for retirement.\n  - `grid`: The starting position on the grid.\n\n### Reasoning Steps\n\n1. Identify rows where `laps = 63` and check if all drivers in these rows are from Ferrari:\n\n   From the table, we can see that only Row 2 has a driver who completed 63 laps (Jean Alesi) with no mention of him driving for Ferrari. All other rows have drivers completing 63 laps who do not drive for Ferrari.\n\n2. Determine that none of the drivers in these conditions are from Ferrari:\n\n   - Since Jean Alesi does not drive for Ferrari but completes 63 laps, and all other rows listed also do not have Ferrari drivers under the given condition (63 laps), it indicates that no driver completing exactly 63 laps is a Ferrari driver.\n\n3. Conclusion: The claim that \"all drivers who complete 63 laps so in a Ferrari\" is false because there are Ferrari drivers completing 63 laps, but they are not all listed in this table.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\n  \"chain_of_thought\": \"Identified the rows with 63 laps and checked their constructors. Found Jean Alesi from Ferrari in Row 2 who completed 63 laps. However, for the claim to be true, it should apply to all drivers completing 63 laps being Ferrari. Since there's at least one Ferrari driver (Jean Alesi) completing 63 laps not listed under this claim, the statement is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n  \"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 2, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 3, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 4, \"column_name\": \"constructor\"}\n  ]\n}",

    "resp": "#### Step 1: Identify the claim to be evaluated\nThe claim to be evaluated is: \"more than 3 drivers have to retire because of a gearbox issue\".\n\n#### Step 2: List all the rows where a driver retired due to a gearbox issue\nTo verify the claim, we need to find out how many drivers had to retire due to a gearbox issue. Looking at the table, we see that there are two instances where this happened:\n- Row 18: driver: bertrand gachot, constructor: pacific - ford, laps: 36, time / retired: gearbox, grid: 22.\n- Row 23: driver: andrea montermini, constructor: pacific - ford, laps: 15, time / retired: gearbox, grid: 24.\n\n#### Step 3: Check if more than 3 drivers have to retire because of a gearbox issue\nFrom the previous step, we can see that only two drivers had to retire due to a gearbox issue. Therefore, we cannot say that more than three drivers have to retire because of this reason.\n\n#### Step 4: Write down the chain of thought and final answer in JSON format\nHere's the chain of thought:\n\n{\n\"chain_of_thought\": \"Listed all the rows where a driver retired due to a gearbox issue (Step 2), checked if more than 3 drivers have to retire because of this reason (Step 3), verified that two drivers had to retire (Step 4).\",\n\"answer\": \"FALSE\",\n\"relevant_cells\": [\n    {\"row_index\": 18, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"},\n    {\"row_index\": 23, \"column_name\": \"time / retired\"}\n]\n}",
